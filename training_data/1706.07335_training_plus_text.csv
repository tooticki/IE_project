"
14,4.5,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," the central idea among the majority of denitions of shadowing for ows is the

14,5.07142857143,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," following: even if small errors occur at each iteration, one can track the resulting

12,5.33333333333,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," Recently, in [10] the denition of shadowing for homeomorphisms in a compact
