1,12.0,0.0,0.0,False,1.0,True,text," Introduction
"
16,5.1875,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," For anyone who comes into contact with dieology [6] (meant initially as an extension of dierential
"
19,4.47368421053,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," geometry, although as of now, other opinions exist) it does not take long to notice that a great number
"
17,5.17647058824,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," of typical objects do not admit obvious counterparts; there is obviously a dieological space as the base
"
18,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," object, and there are also various types of it endowed with an extra, algebraic, structure, starting with a
"
16,5.5,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," natural concept of a dieological vector space and proceeding towards the notion of a dieological group,
"
17,4.94117647059,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," dieological algebra, and so on. But when we try to endow these objects with further structures, even
"
13,3.92307692308,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," very simple ones, we discover that it is not possible to do so.
"
20,3.7,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," The specic instance that we have in mind at the moment is that of a scalar product on a nite-
"
14,6.78571428571,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," dimensional dieological vector space. Surprising in its simplicity, it excellently illustrates what has been
"
20,4.15,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," said in the previous paragraph. Specically, it has been known for some time (see [6], Ex. 70 on p. 74)
"
15,5.86666666667,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," that a nite-dimensional dieological vector space admits a smooth (with respect to its dieology) scalar
"
21,3.95238095238,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," product if and only if it is a standard space, which means that, as a vector space, it is isomorphic to
"
20,4.1,0.0,0.075,False,0.0,True,text," Rn for some n, and its dieology consists of all usual smooth maps. But for a single vector space this
"
19,4.63157894737,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," issue is easily resolved: one looks (as was done, for instance, in [8]) for a kind of minimally degenerate
"
19,4.63157894737,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," smooth symmetric bilinear form on it; there is always one, of rank equal to the dimension of the so-called
"
8,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," dieological dual [15] of the space in question.
"
17,4.88235294118,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," The next natural step, then, is to pose the same question for a possible dieological counterpart of
"
16,5.4375,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," the notion of a Riemannian metric. The corresponding issues become two-fold then: for one thing, there
"
18,4.66666666667,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," is not yet a standard theory of tangent spaces in dieology (but some constructions do exist, see, for
"
20,4.45,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," instance, [2], as well as the previous [4], and other references therein), so we are left with looking for a
"
14,6.07142857143,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," dieological version of a dieological metric on an abstract (dieological version of) vector bundle.
"
16,5.1875,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," This version appeared originally in [5] (by the authors own admission, the same material is better
"
20,4.4,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," explained in Chapter 8 of [6]; but the former is the original source). It was later utilized in [14], under
"
20,4.25,0.347402597403,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," the name of a regular vector bundle, and then in [2], where it is called a dieological vector space over
"
18,4.44444444444,0.167748917749,0.0833333333333,False,0.0,True,text," X, X being the notation for the base space. We call it a dieological vector pseudo-bundle, as was
"
1,1.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," 1
"
20,4.1,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," already done in [9]. This concept is an obvious (it is asked that all the operations be smooth in the
"
16,5.4375,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," dieological sense) extension to the dieological context of the usual notion of a vector bundle, except
"
19,4.78947368421,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," that there is no requirement of local triviality. This allows to treat objects that not only carry an unusual
"
19,4.52631578947,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," smooth structure (that is, a dieology) but also ones that, from a topological point of view, have a more
"
9,5.66666666667,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," complicated local structure than that of a Euclidean space.
"
16,5.1875,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," For objects such as these, there are well-dened notions of the tensor product pseudo-bundle and of
"
18,4.61111111111,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," the dual pseudo-bundle, see [14]. So a dieological metric can of course be dened as a smooth section
"
19,4.36842105263,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," of the tensor product of two duals, symmetric at each point. However, due to what has been said about
"
20,4.4,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," single vector spaces, the value at a given point cannot, in general, be a scalar product, unless the bre at
"
18,4.94444444444,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," this specic point is standard (generally not the case). In this paper we discuss what happens if pointwise

17,5.23529411765,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," we try to take the minimally degenerate value of the prospective section (the approach initiated in [9]).
