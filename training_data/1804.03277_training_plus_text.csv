10,6.8,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," graphex process convergence (GP-convergence), which was introduced in [25]. A

3,6.33333333333,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," random graph process.
"
14,4.71428571429,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," In this paper, we introduce a concrete notion of distance for graphexes that is
"
13,5.30769230769,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," equivalent to GP-convergence, which can be thought of as corresponding to the cut

"
13,5.30769230769,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," the weak kernel distance. We show that convergence in this distance is equivalent

2,8.5,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," to GP-convergence.
"
17,4.05882352941,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," In general, the set of all graphexes is not compact. Indeed, it is not dicult to show

1,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," tight.
"
12,5.41666666667,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," Finally, we prove an identiability theorem, showing to what extent a graphex

"
11,4.45454545455,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," this proves a conjecture of Janson; see Remark 5.4 in [17].
"
13,4.69230769231,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," We note that in this paper we treat graphexes slightly dierently from the
"
17,4.05882352941,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," denition in [26, 17, 25, 18, 4]. Namely, as in [3], we follow the convention from the

13,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," theory of dense graph limits, and dene the graphex process corresponding to a
"
15,4.6,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," graphex as a process of graphs without loops. Indeed, we believe that a theory with
"
13,5.23076923077,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," loops is most naturally embedded into a more general theory of graphex processes
"
12,4.75,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," with multi-edges and loops, which is beyond the scope of this paper.
"
13,5.07692307692,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," Nonetheless, it is worth pointing out that the reader interested in the theory
"
14,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," with loops (but not multi-edges) can derive many results for this theory from those
"
14,4.35714285714,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," developed here, even though some of the theorems will need to be modied to
"
8,8.875,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," accommodate additional technical complications. For the identiability theorem,
"
6,3.66666666667,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," this is done in Appendix B.
"
15,4.46666666667,0.0,0.133333333333,False,0.0,True,text," Finally, we note that while signed graphexes (i.e., graphexes for which W , S and
