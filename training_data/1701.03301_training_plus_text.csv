"
17,4.11764705882,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," phy [12]). As reported in [11], it all started in 1971 when F. Galvin realized that by
"
12,5.75,0.0,0.0833333333333,False,0.0,False,text," assuming the existence of ultralters on N that are almost translation invariant,
"
15,4.33333333333,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," one could produce a short proof of a conjecture of R. Graham and B. Rothschild,
"
14,4.5,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," that was to become a cornerstone of Ramsey theory of numbers: For every nite

"
15,4.2,0.0,0.0666666666667,False,0.0,False,text," sums of distinct elements of X have the same color. However, at that time the
"
13,4.92307692308,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," problem was left open as whether such special ultralters could exist at all.
"
1,2.0,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," In
"
12,5.41666666667,0.166666666667,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," 1972, N. Hindman [9] showed that the continuum hypothesis suces to construct

11,6.36363636364,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," those ultralters, but their existence in ZFC remained unresolved. Eventually, in
"
11,6.09090909091,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," 1974, N. Hindman [10] proved Graham-Rothschild conjecture (now known as Hind-

13,5.15384615385,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," the use of ultralters. Shortly afterwards, in 1975, S. Glazer observed that al-
"
11,6.54545454545,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," most translation invariant ultralters are precisely the idempotent elements of the
"
