"
15,4.4,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," This paper is mainly a survey on (left or right) Leibniz algebras from the point

12,6.25,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," of view of the theory of non-associative (i.e., not necessarily associative) algebras,
"
13,5.15384615385,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," but there are also several new results. Leibniz algebras were rst introduced by
"
16,4.125,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,True,text," Bloh in the mid sixties of the last century (see [11, 12, 13]) and then forgotten
"
14,4.71428571429,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," for nearly thirty years. In the early 1990s they were rediscovered by Loday who
"
13,5.53846153846,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," together with his students and collaborators developed much of the theory of Leibniz
"
11,6.27272727273,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," algebras, Leibniz bimodules, and Leibniz cohomology (see, for example, [33, 34,
"
14,4.92857142857,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," 20]). A left (resp. right) Leibniz algebra is a vector space with a multiplication
"
13,5.46153846154,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," for which every left (resp. right) multiplication operator is a derivation (i.e., a
"
12,6.08333333333,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," linear operator satisfying the usual Leibniz product rule). As such Leibniz algebras
"
10,7.2,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," are non-anticommutative versions of Lie algebras. In particular, Leibniz algebras
"
7,6.57142857143,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," are examples of non-associative algebras (see [42]).

"
15,4.8,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," modules (see also [2] and [21]). Similarly to the Leibniz kernel of a Leibniz algebra,
"
12,5.83333333333,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," we introduce the anti-symmetric kernel of a Leibniz bimodule. Using this concept,

15,4.46666666667,0.0,0.0,False,0.0,False,text," we give a very short Schurs lemma type proof of the fact that irreducible Leibniz
