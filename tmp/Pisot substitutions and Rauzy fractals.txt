Abstract
We prove that the dynamical system generated by a primitive unimodular
substitution of the Pisot type on d letters satisfying a combinatorial condition
which is easy to check, is measurably isomorphic to a domain exchange in
Rd−1 , and is a finite extension of a translation on the torus Td−1 . In the
course of the proof, we introduce some potentially useful notions: the linear
maps associated to a substitution and their dual maps, and the σ-structure
for a dynamical system with respect to a pair of partitions.

Figure 1: The Rauzy fractal

Introduction
In the paper [Rau82], we find a curious compact domain, called the Rauzy fractal.
The domain is constructed in the following manner:
Let σ be the substitution
σ : 1 → 12
2 → 13
3→1
Let w = (w1 , · · · , wn , · · · ) be the fixed point of this substitution, E0(σ) be the
linear map associated to σ by abelianization, P the contractive invariant plane for
the transformation E0 (σ), and π : R3 → P be the projection along the eigenvector
t
(1, α, α2 ) with respect to the maximum eigenvalue λ of E0 (σ), where α = 1/λ is
the unique real root of α + α2 + α3 = 1.
P
We define X as the closure of the set {π nk=1 ewk | n = 1, 2, · · · } where e1, e2, e3
is the canonical basis of R3 .
The domain X has a fractal boundary, and admits a natural decomposition into
P
three sets X (i) , i = 1, 2, 3 defined as the closure of {π nk=1 ewk |wn = i, n ∈ N}. This
domain is not only interesting from the viewpoint of fractal geometry [IK91], but also
in the sense of ergodic theory and number theory. In fact, two dynamical systems,
Markov endomorphism with the structure matrix E0 (σ) and quasi-periodic motion,
act on the n
domain X (See [Rau82],
[IK91], [IO93], [Mes96]). And the projection of
o
Pl n
n
the points
k=1 ewk | n ∈ N , where ln is the length of the word σ (1), gives the
best approximations of the point (α, α2 ), in other word, the fractal domain is strongly
related to the simultaneous approximation of the pair of the cubic number (α, α2 )
(See [IH94]). This domain is also related to developments of complex numbers in a
base conjugate to α (See [Mes96]).
In this paper, we would like to discuss a generalization of the Rauzy fractal. We
will describe several constructions related to substitutions. The aim is, for a certain

Pisot Substitutions and Rauzy fractals

183

class of substitutions, to obtain the same result as for the Rauzy substitution; along
the way, we will obtain weaker results for larger classes of substitutions.
Call f the natural map from the free monoid on d letters to Zd obtained by
abelianization. Consider a substitution σ on d letters, defined by σ(i) = W (i), i =
(i)
(i)
(i)
(i) (i)
1, . . . , d where W (i) = W1 . . . Wli . We will use the notation W (i) = Pk Wk Sk ,
(i)
(i)
where Pk (resp. Sk ) is the prefix (resp. suffix) of the word W (i) with respect to
the k-th letter of W (i) .
We say that the substitution σ has a positive strong coincidence of order 1 for
(i)
(j)
(i)
(j)
i, j if there is an integer k such that Wk = Wk and f(Pk ) = f(Pk ).
We say that the substitution σ has positive strong coincidences for all letters if,
for any pair i, j, there is an integer n such that σ n has a positive strong coincidence
of order 1 for i, j.
The main result of this paper is the following:
Theorem 1. Let σ be a primitive unimodular substitution of the Pisot type on d
letters that has positive strong coincidences for all letters. The uniquely ergodic
symbolic dynamical system generated by σ is measurably conjugate to an exchange
of pieces by translation on the plane Rd−1 . It is also measurably semi-conjugate, by
a continuous onto map, to a translation on the torus Td−1 .
We can also define negative strong coincidences, using suffixes instead of prefixes,
and obtain the same result.
One interest of our method is that it gives an explicit construction of the domain
exchange, with a constructive approximation to the domain.
Remark 1. In all known examples, the substitution system is in fact isomorphic
to a toral translation; we do not know whether this is the general case. We can
however prove that it is true if the sequence of approximations we build for the
domain exchange contains a fixed open set, and this is possible to check explicitly for
a given substitution.
In that case, it is easy to show that the pieces of the domain exchange are the
bases of cylinders of a Markov partition for the toral automorphism associated to the
substitution.
The substitution has strong coincidences for all letters if, for example, the images
of all letters by σ start or end with the same letter; so the theorem applies for the
Rauzy substitution, for which all images start with 1, and also for more general
systems, giving the following corollary, since in that case we can check that the
sequence of approximations contains a fixed open set:
Corollary 1. We take d = 3, and define the substitution σi , i = 1, 2, 3, by σi (i) = i
and σi (j) = ji if j 6= i. Let σ be a product of the substitutions σ1 , σ2 , σ3 , where all
these substitutions occur at least once. The system generated by σ is measurably
isomorphic to a translation on the torus T2 .
Such substitutions have been considered, for example, in [AR91], where it was
proved that all systems generated by sequences of complexity 2n+ 1 with one trispecial factor of all lengths could be realized as interval exchanges. It was natural to
believe, in the light of the above theorem, that such systems could also be realized

184

as toral translations. However, a recent paper ([CFZ00]) shows that some of these
sequences are not balanced, hence they cannot be coding of translation. In that
case, we can, using the techniques given here, build a sequence of partitions, but it
fails to converge.
The content of the paper is the following. In the first section, we build the 1dimensional linear realization of a substitution; this is valid for any substitution.
In the second section, we define the dual map associated to a substitution. This
definition is only interesting in the case of an unimodular substitution, that is,
a substitution whose associated abelianized map has determinant +1 or −1. In
the third section, we consider primitive unimodular substitutions (a substitution is
primitive if there is an n such that, for any i and j, i occurs in σ n (j); it is equivalent
to say that the matrix of the associated linear map has a strictly positive power)
and study some geometric and combinatorial properties of the dual map under this
condition. In section 4, we prove that, in that case, we can build a sequence of
domains Dn , which tile a hyperplane of Rd , and a sequence of dynamical systems
Tn on Dn , that have σ-structure, in the sense defined in that section.
In section 5, we consider Pisot substitutions, that is, substitutions such that the
associated matrix has all eigenvalues, except one, of modulus strictly smaller than 1.
In that case, we can prove that the sequence of sets Dn , when properly renormalized,
converges to a compact set X in the Hausdorff topology. In section 6, we show that,
if the substitution has strong coincidences for all letters, the dynamical systems Tn
can be used to define a dynamical system on X, which is measurably conjugate to the
substitution dynamical system defined by σ. In section 7, we give some examples,
and prove the corollary above.
There are different methods to construct the Rauzy fractal: one can use convergent series associated to the substitution, as is done in the original paper, or
approximate it by a sequence of domains obtained by ”exduction”, as was already
known to Rauzy. We try here to formalize this second approach; however, both
methods have common points, and section 5 and 6 of this paper rely heavily on a
(unfortunately unpublished) paper by Bernard Host [Hos92], summarizing the results of a seminar at Villetaneuse (Université Paris 13) on the first approach. This
paper contains a deeper result in the 2 letters case: a unimodular substitution σ
on two letters is measurably conjugate to a rotation if and only if it has a strong
coincidence for the two letters.
We signal that it is unknown whether there exists a unimodular Pisot substitution, on 2 or more letters, that does not have strong coincidences for all letters, and
in this regard our work is incomplete.
Another problem is given by the case of unimodular non-Pisot substitutions; we
give some elements to study this problem in [AIS00], generalizing the construction
of linear extensions of substitutions and their dual maps.

Let A be an alphabet of d letters {1, 2, . . . , d}. We denote by A∗ = ∞
n=0 A the free
monoid on A, that is, the set of finite words on the alphabet A, endowed with the
concatenation product. A substitution σ on A∗ is a map from A to A∗ , such that,

for any letter i, σ(i) is a non-empty word. The substitution σ extends in a natural
way to an endomorphism of the monoid A∗ , by the rule σ(UV ) = σ(U)σ(V ).
(i)

(i)

Notations 1. We denote by W (i) the word σ(i); W (i) = W1 . . . Wli is a finite
(i)
word of length li . We call Pk the prefix of length k − 1 of W (i)(for k = 1, this is
(i)
(i)
(i) (i)
the empty word), and Sk the suffix of length li − k, so that W (i) = Pk Wk Sk .
There is a natural homorphism f : A∗ → Zd , obtained by abelianization of
the free monoid, and one can obtain a linear transformation E0 (σ) satisfying the
following commutation relation:
lclA∗ −→ A∗

−→ Z d .

We will now build another linear map, on an infinite dimensional space, that
contains more information on σ. The idea is the following: consider the space
Rd , with canonical basis (e1 , . . . , ed). To a finite word U = U1 . . . Uk , one can
associate a path in Rd , consisting in k segments joining respectively f(U1 . . . Uj−1 )
and f(U1 . . . Uj ) (this is just a graphic representation of the abelianization). Each
segment is a translate, by an element of Zd , of one of the basic segments {λei |0 ≤
λ ≤ 1} (see Fig. 2, in the case d = 2). Formally, we can consider the path as a
sum of elements (x, ei), where x ∈ Zd . It is then quite natural to consider that the
substitution σ operates on the set of paths, replacing each segment parallel to ei by a
broken line corresponding to the word σ(i). We want the image of a connected path
to be a connected path; this implies, if we suppose that the point 0 is fixed, that
the image of a path joining 0 to x is a path joining 0 to E0(σ)(x). This completely
defines the image of every segment (x, ei), see Fig. 2.
For a formal definition, it is more convenient to consider linear combinations of
paths with coefficients in R, so as to get a vector space.
Definition 1. Let F be the vector space of maps from Zd × A to R that take value
zero except for a finite set. For x ∈ Zd and i ∈ A, denote by (x, ei ) the element of
F which takes value 1 at (x, i), and 0 elsewhere; the set {(x, ei) |x ∈ Zd , i ∈ A} is a
basis of F , and we define the 1-dimensional geometric realization E1 (σ) of σ by

Definition 2. The support of an element of F is the set of (x, i) on which it is not
zero. We say that an element of F is geometric if it takes only value 0 and 1. To a
geometric element, one can associate a finite union of segments, as explained above.
If a and b are two geometric elements, we will say for simplicity that a contains b
if the support of a contains that of b.
If we apply the map E1(σ) to (0, ei ), we get the previous intuitive definition. A
geometric application is the following: suppose that σ(i) starts with i; then, there
is an infinite word u, starting with i, which is fixed by σ. This infinite word begins
with σ n (i), for all n ∈ N. It is possible to prove that E1 (σ)n (0, ei ) is a geometric
element of F , to which one associates a broken line in Rd which approximates (if
the substitution is primitive) the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the
largest eigenvalue; it is the path associated with σ n (i) we discussed above, and the
union of all this paths is an infinite path associated with the fixed point. If the
substitution is of the Pisot type, this broken line stays within bounded distance of
the line through zero in this direction.
One can check directly that, if we take two distinct segments in this broken line,
their images by E1 (σ) have disjoint supports; the reason is that, if we take 2 elements
(x, ei) and (y, ej ) on the line, with y “after” x, the vector y − x has all coordinates
positive, and the i-th coordinate strictly positive. Hence we have E0 (σ)(y − x) ≥
(i)
(j)
E0 (σ)(ei) = f(W (i) ), and we can never have E0 (σ)(x)+f(Pk ) = E0 (σ)(y)+f(Pl );
this is why all the E1 (σ)n (0, ei ) are geometric. However, it is false in general: the
image of a geometric element is not always geometric. In the next section, we will
compute exactly the set of segments that contain a given (x, ei) in their image, and
show that it is usually not reduced to one element.
It is possible to generalize this definition to multidimensional extensions of substitutions; this is studied in [AIS00].

2 The dual map associated to a unimodular substitution
In this section, we will only be interested in so-called “unimodular” substitutions.
Definition 3. A substitution σ is called unimodular if the associated linear map
E0 (σ) has determinant +1 or −1; in other words, its matrix in the canonical basis
belongs to the linear group GL(d, Z).
It is equivalent to say that the square of the matrix belongs to the unimodular
linear group SL(d, Z), hence the term unimodular substitution.
We can associate to E1 (σ) the dual map E1∗(σ). We will show how to compute
explicitly this map. We denote by F ∗ the space of linear forms on F with finite
support (that is, linear forms for which there exists a finite set K ∈ Zd × A, such
that the form is 0 on any element of F whose support does not intersect K) ; this
space admits as basis the set {(x, e∗i )|x ∈ Zd , i ∈ A}. It is easy to check that E1∗ (σ)
preserves F ∗.

The product is not zero if and only if Wk = i and E0 (σ)(y) + f(Pk ) =
x. Since E0 (σ), as a map from Zd to Zd , is invertible, this amounts to y =
(j)
E0 (σ)−1 x − f(Pk ) ; hence we get the formula given above.

Remark that we can also consider F ∗ as the set of maps from Zd × A to R with
value zero except of a finite set. Hence definition 2 makes sense also here, and we
can define the geometric elements of F ∗ as those who take only value 0 and 1.
We recover in this way, up to a change of coordinates, the formulas already
given, with a dynamical motivation, in [IO93]. The signification of this map is not
immediately clear; but we can give a geometric model, in the following way:
To (x, e∗i ), we associate the upper hyperface orthogonal to ei of the unit cube with
P
lower vertex at x. Analytically, this face can be expressed as {x + ei + j6=i λj ej |λj ∈
[0, 1]} (see Fig. 3). The dual map associates, to a given hyperface, a finite collection
of hyperfaces (see Fig. 4 for the dual map associated to the Rauzy substitution).
To a geometric element of F ∗, we can associate a finite union of faces; it is
however more difficult to represent non-geometric elements. In the general case, the
image by E1∗ (σ) of a geometric element is no longer geometric, since different faces
can have images by E1∗ (σ) whose support intersect. We will see in the next section
that there are sets of geometric elements invariant by the map; these can be used to
approximate, by iteration, the plane defined by the dual eigenvector for the maximal
eigenvalue.

3 The case of primitive unimodular substitutions: elementary
properties
From now on, we will suppose that the substitution is primitive, that is, there is
an n such that, for any pair of letters (i, j), i occurs in σ n (j). It is equivalent to
say that the matrix of E0 (σ) is primitive, and so, by Perron-Frobenius theorem,
E0 (σ) has an eigenvalue λ that is positive, simple and strictly bigger in modulus
than the other eigenvalues. We denote by vλ a positive eigenvector associated to λ
for the transpose of E0 (σ), and by P the plane orthogonal to vλ. It is clear that
P is invariant by E0 (σ). We will denote by P < the set {x ∈ Rd |x.vλ < 0}, (where
x.vλ is the scalar product between vectors of Rd ) that is, the open lower half-space
associated to P. We can define in the same way P ≤ , P > , P ≥ .
Remark 2. To avoid cumbersome terminology, we will always use the 3-dimensional
vocabulary instead of d-dimensional, and speak of planes, surface, cube,. . ., instead
of hyperplane, hypersurface, hypercube, . . ., since no confusion will ensue, and all
our examples will be on 2 or 3 letters.
Definition 4. We say that (x, e∗i ), where x ∈ Zd , is a unit tip of the stepped surface
of P if x ∈ P < and x + ei ∈ P ≥ . We denote by G the set of finite sums of distinct
unit tips.
The unit tips can be easily visualised, using the geometric model of the preceding
section. The element (x, e∗i ) is a unit tip if the interior of the unit cube with lower
corner at x intersects the plane P, and its upper face orthogonal to ei does not
intersect P, except maybe on the boundary. The union of all unit tips constitute a
stepped surface that is the best approximation of P by faces contained in the closed
upper half-space P ≥ . The elements of G can be represented as finite parts of this
stepped surface. They are all geometric elements of F ∗ , so that E1∗(σ) acts on G.
The main result of this section is the following:
Proposition 1. The set G is invariant by E1∗ (σ)

Pisot Substitutions and Rauzy fractals

189

Proof. it is enough to prove that the image of any unit tip is contained in G, and
that two different unit tips have disjoint images; this is accomplished in the following
two lemmas.

Lemma 2. If (x, e∗i ) is a unit tip, its image E1∗ (σ)(x, e∗i ) belongs to G.
Proof. From the definition of E1∗(σ), we must prove that, if Wk = i, (E0 (σ)−1(x −
(j)
f(Pk )), e∗j ) is a unit tip.
(j)
But f(Pk ) is a positive vector, so its opposite is in the negative cone, included
in P ≤ ; x is in P < by definition, so the sum is in P < . This set is invariant by E0(σ)−1 ,
(j)
so that E0 (σ)−1 (x − f(Pk )) is in P < .
On the other hand, remark that, from the definition of E0 (σ) and f, we have
(j)
(j)
E0 (σ)−1(f(σ(j))) = ej . Hence, E0(σ)−1 (x − f(Pk )) + ej = E0 (σ)−1(x − f(Pk ) +
(j)
(j)
f(σ(j))) = E0 (σ)−1 (x + ei + f(Sk )); since f(Sk ) is in the positive cone, and x + ei
is in P ≥ , their sum is in P ≥ , which is invariant by E0(σ)−1 , so that E0 (σ)−1 (x −
(j)
f(Pk )) + ej ∈ P ≥ . This is exactly what we need.
It is easy to check that all the unit tips in the sum that defines E1∗(σ)(x, e∗i ) are
(j)
distinct. Indeed, take two such unit tips (E0 (σ)−1(x − f(Pk )), e∗j ) and (E0 (σ)−1 (x −
0
(j )
f(Pk0 ), e∗j0 ). Suppose they are equal; we must then have j = j0 . If k 6= k 0 , we can
(j)
(j)
suppose that k < k 0, so that Pk is a strict prefix of Pk0 . Then, their images by f
are distinct, and since E0 (σ)−1 is one-to-one, this implies that the base vertices of
the two unit tips are distinct.

(j)

Lemma 3. Two distinct unit tips have disjoint images
Proof. Suppose that (y, e∗i ) is in the intersection of E1∗ (σ)(x, e∗j ) and E1∗ (σ)(x0, e∗j0 ).
(i)
Then, by definition, we can find k and k 0 such that y = E0 (σ)−1(x − f(Pk )) =
(i)
(i)
(i)
E0 (σ)−1(x0 − f(Pk0 )), hence x − f(Pk ) = x0 − f(Pk0 ) since E0(σ) is not degenerate.
If x = x0, we must have k = k 0 , and the unit tips are not distinct. If x 6= x0, we
(i)
(i)
must have k 6= k 0; if for example k < k 0 , we have x + f(Wk . . . Wk0 −1 ) = x0; since
(i)
f(Wk ) = ej , this implies that x0 is not in P < , and this contradicts the definition of
the unit tip (x0, e∗j0 ).

Remark that the contradiction comes from the fact that unit tips must be close
to the plane P; there is no reason for an arbitrary pair of elements to have disjoint
images.
One checks immediately that the elements (−ei , e∗i ) are unit tips; the sum of all
the elements represent the lower faces of the unit cube at the origin, which touches
the plane P at the origin.
The upper faces of this unit cube are given by the sum of the elements (0, e∗i ).
Remark that if, in the definition of the unit tips, we exchange strict and large
inequalities, replacing P < by P ≤ and P ≥ by P > , then (0, e∗i ) becomes a unit tip; the
lemmas 1 and 2 and the proposition stay true, mutatis mutandis, in that case, by
the same proof, exchanging all large and strict inequalities. It will prove very useful
in the sequel to use these upper and lower faces of the unit cube at the origin. We
will use the following notation:

Figure 5: The images E1∗ (σ)(U) and E1∗(σ)(U 0 ) for Rauzy substitution

Definition 5. We denote by U the union
P
∗
i∈A (0, ei )

P

∗
i∈A (−ei , ei ),

and by U 0 the union

Proposition 2. E1∗ (σ)(U) is an element of G which contains U; E1∗(σ)(U 0 ) contains
U 0; E1∗ (σ)(U 0) is not in G, but we have E1∗(σ)(U 0 ) − E1∗ (σ)(U) = U 0 − U.

(j)

Proof. Because P1 is, by definition, the empty word, its image by f is zero; suppose
(j)
that W1 = i, this implies that (0, e∗j ) is contained in E1∗ (σ)(0, e∗i ) (we only need to
(j)
check that, because W1 = i, (0, e∗j ) appears in the sum that defines the image). By
taking the sum on all letters, we obtain that E1∗ (σ)(U 0) contains U 0 .
In the same way, suppose that the last letter of W j is i; from the very definition
(j)
of E1∗ (σ), we check that E1∗ (σ)(−ei, e∗i ) contains (E0 (σ)−1 (−ei − f(Plj )), e∗j ). But
we have E0 (σ)−1(−ei − f(Plj )) = E0 (σ)−1 (−f(σ(j))) = −ej , so that E1∗ (σ)(−ei, e∗i )
contains (−ej , e∗j ). This shows that E1∗ (σ)(U) contains U.
(j)

Remark that, since U is obviously in G, its image is, by the proposition, in G,
hence it is geometric; a similar proof, exchanging large and strict inequalities, shows
that E1∗ (σ)(U 0), while not in G, is geometric.
(j)

It remains to compute the difference between the images. Remark that, if Wk =
(j)
(j)
i and k is less than the length lj of σ(j), we have ei + f(Pk ) = f(Pk+1 ); if k = lj ,
(j)
then, as above, E0 (σ)−1(−ei − f(Pk )) = −ej . Hence, we easily compute:

The group Zd acts in an obvious way on F by translation; the following lemma
will be useful:
Lemma 4. The translation of E1∗ (σ)(−ei, e∗i ) by E0 (σ)−1 (ei ) is E1∗ (σ)(0, e∗i )
Proof. From the definition of E1∗ (σ), the difference between E1∗ (σ)(0, e∗i ) and E1∗ (σ)(x, e∗i )
is just a translation of E0 (σ)−1 (x).

Proposition 2 tells us that E1∗ (σ)(U) and E1∗ (σ)(U 0) differ only by the unit cube
at the origin; in particular, they have the same projection on the plane P. Lemma
4 gives us another way to recover E1∗(σ)(U 0 ) from E1∗ (σ)(U), by translating the
different constituent pieces.

4 Tilings and dynamical systems associated to unit tips
From now on, we will identify unit tips and the corresponding subsets of Rd ; a
geometric element of F will be considered as a subset of Rd . The results of the
preceding section can be applied to σ n for all n, so we can iterate and obtain a
sequence of larger and larger pieces of the stepped surface.
We denote by π the projection on the plane P along the positive eigendirection
n
of the map E0 (σ). We want to project by π the sets E1∗ (σ) (U 0), and establish their
properties.
It is clear that the projection of the stepped surface generates a (non periodic)
tiling of the plane P by d tiles, projections of (−ei, e∗i ); the union π(U) of these
tiles also generates a periodic tiling, obtained by projecting the stepped surface

192

P

associated with the diagonal plane xi = 0. The main result of this section can be
expressed in this way: we can group the tiles so that the non periodic tiling of P
is also generated by the projections of E1∗ (σ)n (−ei, e∗i ), and the union of these new
tiles π(E1∗(σ)n (U)) generates a periodic tiling, obtained from the projection of the
stepped surface of the rational plane E0 (σ)n(P). These bigger tiles have an almost
self-similar structure, which allow a simple generation of large parts of the tiling by
translation of the basic tiles, giving rise to a family of larger and larger dynamical
systems induced from each other.
Definition 6. We denote by Dn the domain π(E1∗(σ) (U)). We denote by Dn(i)
0
n
n
(resp. Dn(i) ) the domain π(E1∗(σ) (−ei , e∗i )) (resp. π(E1∗(σ) (0, e∗i )) ).
n

Proposition 3. The set Dn is the closure of a fundamental domain for the action
on P of the lattice Γn generated by the vectors π(E0(σ)−n (ei −ej )), for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ d.
Proof. We start by D0 . It is clear that, if we translate U by the lattice generated by
the vectors (ei − ej ), we obtain a periodic stepped surface over the plane P0 defined
P
by the equation di=1 xi = 0 (this stepped surface consists of lower faces of unit
cubes having their lowest vertex on P0 ). The projection of this periodic stepped
surface gives the required result.
It suffices now to apply E1∗ (σ)n to this periodic stepped surface to obtain a
new periodic stepped surface over the plane E0 (σ)−n P0 , with lattice generated by
E0 (σ)−n (ei − ej ), whose projection by π gives the required result.

Lemma 5. The image of Dn(i) by the translation of −π(E0(σ)−n (ei )) is Dn(i)
Proof. this follows immediately from lemma 4 of the preceding section, replacing σ
by σ n and projecting to the plane P.

It is easy to check that Dn is the disjoint union, up to a set of measure zero,
0
of the sets Dn(i) (and also of the sets Dn(i) ). This allows us to define a dynamical
system:
Definition 7. We denote by Tn the map from Dn to itself defined (up to a set of
0
measure 0) by Tn (x) = x − π(E0(σ)−n (ei )) if x ∈ Dn(i) .
Remark 3. It could seem more natural to consider the inverse map of Tn , that is,
the map defined on Dn(i) by x 7→ x + π(E0(σ)−n (ei )); the reason for our choice is that
it turns out that the substitution associated to this map is not σ, but its retrograde
f = W . . . W W , and the
(the retrograde of a word W = W1 W2 . . . Wl is the word W
l
2 1
g
retrograde of a substitution σ is the substitution σ̃ defined by σ̃(i) = σ(i).
The map Tn is not well defined if the point x belongs to two different domains
(i)
Dn , Dn(j) . However, there is a canonical projection from Dn onto the torus P/Γn ,
which conjugates Tn with the translation by the class modulo Γn of any of the vectors
π(E0(σ)−n (ei )) (all these classes are equal, by definition of Γn ); after the projection,
the map is everywhere well-defined. This proves that the domain exchange we have
defined is in fact conjugate to a rotation on a torus.
These maps Tn , together with the partitions {Dn(i) }, have remarkable properties,
for which we need a definition:

we say that the measuredn dynamicalosystem

to the pair of partitions X |i ∈ A and A(i)|i ∈ A .
The simplest example of system with σ-structure is the following: consider a
primitive substitution σ which admits a nonperiodic fixed point, let (Ω, S, µ) be the
uniquely ergodic system generated by σ (closure of the orbit by the shift map S
of the fixed point of the substitution), with µ the unique invariant measure. If we
consider the canonical partition of Ω by the elementary cylinders, and take for A the
set σ(Ω), also with its canonical partition, one can check that (Ω, S) has σ-structure
with respect to these two partitions.

clear from the definition that, since x ∈ A, we have almost everywhere u = σ(v).
Call φ the map from X to AN , that takes each point to the corresponding sequence;
we see that, if we denote by [i] the set of sequences in AN that begins in i, we have
φ(X) ⊂ ∪i∈A ∪0≤k<li S k σ[i].
It is natural to iterate this definition:
Definition 9. Let (X, T, µ) be a measured dynamical system, σ a substitution on
the alphabet A such that σ(i) = W (i) , and consider an decreasingo sequence of subsets
(i)
A0 = X, A1, . . . , An , of X with associated partitions Ak |i ∈ A for k = 0, 1, . . . , n.
We say that the transformation T has σ-structure of order n with respect to this
sequence of partitions if the first return map T|Ak of Tn on each Aok ,nk = 0, . . . , no− 1
(i)
(i)
has σ-structure with respect to the pair of partitions Ak |i ∈ A , Ak+1 |i ∈ A .
The system (X, T, µ) has σ-structure of all orders if we can find such an
infinite sequence of subsets and partitions.
It is easy to check that (X, T, µ) has σ-structure of order n with respect to a
sequence of partitions if and only if it has σ n -structure with respect to the first and
last of these partitions. For a primitive substitution σ, there is essentially only one
system with σ-structure of all orders:

or the sequence of partitions T k A(i)
n |i ∈ A, 0 ≤ k < |σ (i)| is generating, the system (X, T, µ) is measurably conjugate to the dynamical system (Ω, S) associated to
the substitution σ.

Proof. First consider AN with the product topology. We define, on the set of compact subsets of AN , a map Σ by:
Σ (K) =

[

[

S k σ(K ∩ [i])

i∈A 0≤k<li

By primitivity of σ, S k σ is strictly contracting on each cylinder [ij], and so Σ or
one of its powers is strictly contracting for the Hausdorff distance; hence it has a
unique fixed point, which is the domain Ω of the dynamical system (Ω, S) associated
to σ.
The remark above shows that, if (X, T ) has σ-structure, the set φ(X) of symbolic
sequences is included in Σ(AN ). Hence, if it has σ-structure of all orders, it is
included in ∩n∈N Σn (AN) = Ω.
On the other hand, the partition being measurable, the set φ(X) is a measurable
invariant subset of Ω. But it is well known that (Ω, S), for a primitive substitution,
is uniquely ergodic;nhence φ(X)
o is equal to Ω, up to a set of measure 0.
(i)
If the partition A0 |i ∈ A is generating with respect to T , φ is one-to-one, so
it is a measurable isomorphism.
Suppose that the sequence of partitions is generating. To each point of X, we
can associate a sequence of sets T kn Ainn in which it is contained. Except for a set of
measure 0, two distinct points cannot be contained in the same sequence. But then,
the symbolic dynamic sequence of x is contained in S kn σ n ([in ]), and these sets are

Pisot Substitutions and Rauzy fractals

195

disjoint, up to measure 0; hence distinct points have distinct associated symbolic
sequences, except for a set of measure 0.
In both cases, φ is a measurable isomorphism that conjugates (X, T, µ) and
(Ω, S, ν), where ν is the unique shift invariant measure on Ω.

0

Proof. We will check it for Dn and D0 ; it suffices in fact to check it for D1 and D0 ,
(i) 0
and then to replace σ by σ n . But the very construction of D1 implies that the
(j) 0
iterates of D0 are, before their first return to D0 , contained in an element of the
partition of Dn , whose index is given by the substitution; this proves the proposition.


To summarize our results, we have now proved that, for any primitive unimodular substitution σ, and any integer k, we can find a domain exchange (and even
a translation on the torus Td−1 ) that has σ k -structure with respect to a pair of
explicit partitions. Our aim in the next section will be to obtain, by a suitable
renormalisation, a limit partition, to get, if possible, a system with σ-structure of
all orders.

5 Unimodular substitutions of the Pisot type
We can renormalize the domains Dn(i) , using E0 (σ)n . One checks that the renormalized domains are, up to a set of measure 0, fundamental domains for the lattice Γ0 ,
and the associated dynamical systems are all conjugate to the translation by π(ei )
on P/Γ0 . It is natural to ask whether there is a limit dynamical system; we can give
an answer in a special case.
Definition 10. We will say that a substitution is of the Pisot type if the characteristic polynomial of the associated linear map is irreducible over Q and has all roots,
except one, of modulus strictly smaller than 1.
In that case, the maximal eigenvalue is a Pisot number (hence the name) and the
plane P is the contracting plane associated to E0 (σ). From now on, we will suppose
that σ is a unimodular substitution of the Pisot type, and that the modulus of the
second largest eigenvalue is |λ0 | < L < 1.
Recall ([Bar88]) that the space H(P) of all compact subsets on P, equipped
with the Hausdorff metric dH , is a complete metric space. We know that, for a good
choice of the norm on P,
dH (E0(σ)A, E0(σ)B) ≤ L dH (A, B)
and we will use the following easy lemma, whose proof we leave to the reader:
Lemma 7. For any compact sets A, B, C, D, we have:
dH (A ∪ B, C ∪ D) ≤ max(dH (A, C), dH (B, D))

Proof. Let us define
c0 := max dH (π(0, e∗i ), E0 (σ) (π(E1∗(σ)(0, e∗i ))))
i∈A

From the preceding lemma, we see
dH (πE1∗(σ)n U, E0 (σ)πE1∗(σ)n+1 U) ≤ c0
Therefore

dH (E0 (σ)n πE1∗(σ)n U, E0 (σ)n+1 πE1∗(σ)n+1 U) ≤ c0Ln

This means the sequence (E0 (σ)n πE1∗(σ)n U)n∈N is a Cauchy sequence in H(P).
Therefore the limit set X in the sense of Hausdorff metric exists. A similar proof
0
shows that X (i) and X (i) are well defined.

Lemma 8. The set X (i) is the image of X (i) by a translation of π(ei )
0

Proof. This is a consequence of lemma 5: the equality E0 (σ)n (Dn(i) ) + π(ei ) =
E0 (σ)(Dn(i) ) extends to the limit.

We would like to define a domain exchange on the limit set. However, even if
the limit set exists, it is in not at all clear that it supports a dynamical system. The
reason is that the sets X (i) could have an intersection of non zero measure. In the
next section we will prove that, if the substitution has strong coincidences for all
letters, this cannot happen; in this section, we will only prove, in the general case,
that the set X contains a fundamental domain for Γ0 , the vector of measures (|X (i) |)
is an eigenvector for E0 (σ), and some translates of the X (i) are pairwise disjoint;
this last fact will be of critical importance in the next section.
From now on, we will denote by |K| the measure of a compact set K. The
measure does not behave very well with respect to Hausdorff metric, as can be seen
from the fact that any compact set is the limit of a sequence of finite sets, of measure
0. It is however easy to prove that, by passing to the limit, the measure can only
increase:
Lemma 9. if K is the limit of a sequence (Kn )n∈N for the Hausdorff metric, we
have |K| ≥ lim supn→∞ |Kn |.
Proof. Define K +  = {x|d(x, K) ≤ }. This is a compact that contains K. By the
definition of Hausdorff metric, for all n large enough, Kn is contained in K +, which
implies that |K + | ≥ lim supn→∞ |Kn |. Take a sequence (n ), decreasing, with limit
0. The sets K + n are a decreasing sequence of compact, whose intersection is K.
This implies that |K| = limn→∞ |K + n |, and we get the result by taking the limit

in the first inequality.

Pisot Substitutions and Rauzy fractals

197

This result applies in particular to the sets X and X (i) . We can even prove a
little more:
Lemma 10. The set X contains a fundamental domain for Γ0 .
Proof. It is enough to prove that any element of P is contained in X + γ, for some
γ ∈ Γ0 . But for any n, it is contained in E0 (σ)n Dn + γn , because the E0 (σ)n Dn
contain a fundamental domain for Γ0 . These domains are uniformly bounded, hence
the sequence γn , even if it is not constant, can take only a finite number of values.
Hence we can find a subsequence nk such that γnk is constant, equal to γ, which
implies that the point is contained in X + γ.

We can also be more precise on the ratio of the pieces. Remark that the vector
whose coordinates are |π(0, e∗i )| is a positive eigenvector for the maximal eigenvalue
λ. Indeed, let v be a positive eigenvector of norm 1. The area of π(0, e∗i ) is also
the volume of the parallelepiped with basis π(0, e∗i ) and height v; but, since π is the
projection along v, this is also the volume of the parallelepiped with basis (0, e∗i )
and height v, that is vi , hence the result. Since one builds the successive sets
Dn(i) by applying the substitution, we see that at each step, the vector of measures
t
(|Dn(i) |) ∈ Rd stays proportional to a positive eigenvector, and after renormalisation,
it is constant. Unfortunately, it is not possible to obtain directly the same result
for the limit, since we have only an inequality. We will use a property of primitive
matrices which is a corollary of Perron-Frobenius theorem.
Lemma 11. Let M be a primitive positive matrix, with maximal eigenvalue λ.
Suppose that v is a positive vector such that Mv ≥ λv. Then the inequality is an
equality, and v is an eigenvector with respect to λ.
Proof. (see [Que87], P. 91) We can suppose, by replacing M and λ by a suitable
power, that M is strictly positive. Define, for all positive non zero vector v:
P
j

r(v) = inf
i

mi,j vj
vi

The function r is homogeneous of degree 0, so we can consider it as defined on
P
the simplex vi = 1, vi ≥ 0. By continuity, it is bounded; let θ be its upper bound.
There is some v such that r(v) = θ, hence Mv ≥ θv. Let w denote the vector
Mv − θv; if w is not zero, since it is positive, Mw is strictly positive; but then, we
have M(Mv) > θMv, and Mv contradicts the definition of θ. We conclude that v is
a positive eigenvector for θ, hence θ is the Perron eigenvalue λ, and we just proved
that the inequality Mv ≥ λv implies the equality.

measures.

6 Substitutions with strong coincidences
As we just saw, the difficult question is whether the sets X (i) are disjoint of each
other, up to a set of measure zero, and form a partition of X. This is unknown
in the general case; however, the last corollary gives us a sufficient combinatorial
condition.
Definition 11. We say that the substitution σ has a positive strong coincidence
(i)
(j)
of order 1 for i, j ∈ A, if there exists an integer k such that Wk = Wk , and
(i)
(j)
f(Pk ) = f(Pk ).

Pisot Substitutions and Rauzy fractals

199

The substitution has positive strong coincidence of order n for i, j if σ n has a
positive strong coincidence of order 1 for i, j. It has positive strong coincidence for
i, j if, for some integer n, it has a positive strong coincidence of order n for i, j.
The substitution has positive strong coincidences for all letters if, for all pairs
i, j of letters, it has a positive strong coincidence for i, j.
Remark 4. A weaker notion of coincidence was defined by Dekking, see [Dek78]:
a substitution σ has a coincidence of order 1 for i and j if there exists k such that
(j)
(i)
Wk = Wk = a. The coincidence of order n is defined similarly.
In the case of a substitution of constant length n, this notion of coincidence is
(i)
(j)
preserved by the substitution, since the images of the prefixes Pk and Pk have same
length n(k − 1), and they are both followed by σ(a); this is the main purpose of the
definition. To obtain the same result for a substitution of non constant length, it is
not enough to have a coincidence. We need to add a condition on the prefixes, to
(i)
(j)
ensure that σ(Pk ) and σ(Pk ) have the same length.
It is worth remarking that a unimodular primitive substitution can never be of
constant length: if this were the case, the length n would be the maximal eigenvalue,
and n would divide the determinant.
Remark that, if σ has a positive strong coincidence of order n for i, j, it has
positive strong coincidence of order n0 for i, j for all n0 > n; indeed, it is clear that,
if f(V ) = f(W ), then σ(V ) and σ(W ) have same length, and same image by f, so
there is a positive strong coincidence at the next order. So, if the substitution σ has
positive strong coincidences for all letters, there is a power of σ that has positive
strong coincidences of order 1 for all letters.
The easiest example of a substitution that has positive strong coincidences for
all letters is a substitution such that all the images of the letters begin with the
same letter.
Theorem 2. Suppose that the unimodular primitive substitution σ of the Pisot type
0
has positive strong coincidences for all letters. Then the sets X (i) (resp. X (i) ) are
disjoint, up to a set of measure 0, and X contains a measurable fundamental domain
for the action on P of the lattice Γ0 . The dynamical system T : X → X, such that
T (x) = x − π(ei)

if x ∈ X (i)

0
0

is well-defined, and has σ-structure of all orders with respect to the partition X (i)
and its images by E0 (σ)k , k ∈ N.
The system (X, T ) is conjugate, by the symbolic dynamics with respect to parti0
tion X (i) , to the symbolic system (Ω, S), and it is a finite extension of the translation
by −π(ei ) on P/Γ0 . The semi-conjugacy map from Ω to P/Γ0 is continuous.
Proof. As we remarked above, we can suppose that some power σ n of σ has positive
strong coincidences of order 1 for all letters; replacing σ by σ n does not change
the eigenvector, and amounts to replacing the sequence (Dn ) and the corresponding
partitions by a subsequence: this does not change the limit X, so from now on we
will suppose that σ has positive strong coincidences of order 1 for all letters.
The corollary 2 shows that, if σ has a positive strong coincidence of order 1 for
0
0
i, j, X (i) ∩ X (j) is of measure 0.

Since X is the disjoint (up to a set of measure 0) union of the X (i) , and is the
union of the X (i) , it follows that the X (i) are also disjoint up to a set of measure 0.
In that case, we can define the dynamical system T ; this system preserves Lebesgue measure. It has, by construction, σ-structure of all orders with respect to the
partition X (i) and its images by E0 (σ)k , k ∈ N. This implies, as we saw in section
4, that it is measurably conjugate (using the symbolic dynamics with respect to
partition X (i)n) to theosystem generated by the substitution σ, because the sequence
k
of partitions T k A(i)
n , being translates of images by E0 (σ) of the initial one, has
a diameter going to 0, hence it is generating.
The set X projects onto the torus P/Γ0 , since, by lemma 10, it contains a
fundamental domain; after projection, the vectors π(ei) become identified, since
by definition they differ by an element of Γ0 , hence the transformation T is semiconjugate to a toral translation.
The continuity of the map from Ω to the torus comes from the fact that a
primitive substitution is bilaterally recognizable (cf. [Mos92]); from the initial part
of a word u, it is possible to determine nk such that u is contained in S nk σ k (Ω),
hence the corresponding point must be contained in π(T −nk E0 (σ)k (X)); since the
diameter of E0 (σ)k (X) goes to 0, and the translation is an isometry, we get the
result (the analogous result for (X, T ) could be false, because T is not continuous,
hence the diameter of T −n E0 (σ)k X has no reason to tend to 0).

Remark 5. In all the examples we know, the projection from X to the torus P/Γ0 is
almost everywhere one-to-one. Since X is compact, we can prove that this projection
is always finite-to-one. Furthermore, the number of preimages of a point of the torus
is almost everywhere invariant by the translation (it is constant on all orbits whose
0
preimages do not belong to the intersection of two sets X (i) , and this is a set of full
measure), hence, by ergodicity of the translation, it is almost everywhere constant.
One should like to prove that it is almost everywhere one. We do not know
a general proof of this fact; however, one can show that, if the projection is not
one-to-one, all points of X also belong to some X + γ, for some non-zero γ ∈ Γ0 .
If there exists a set K, with non-empty interior, such that K ⊂ E0(σ)n (Dn )
for all large enough n, this is impossible, since interior points of K cannot belong
to translates of E0 (σ)n (Dn ) by the lattice; in that case, we can conclude that the
substitution system is in fact measurably conjugate to a toral translation.
Remark 6. This is not the only system we can define on X: there is also E0 (σ),
but this is not interesting since it is strictly contracting, and its ”inverse” A defined
by:
A(x) = E0(σ)−1 (x + f(Pk ))
(j)

0

0

if x ∈ X (i) and E0 (σ)−1 x ∈ X (j) + f(Pk ).
(j)

This is a Markov endomorphism, with matrix structure E0 (σ).
It is also possible to consider the action of E0 (σ) on Rd /Zd ; we obtain a toral
automorphism, and, in the case where the set X is a fundamental
domain for the
n
o
(i)
lattice Γ0 , it is not difficult to show that the partition X
is the basis for a
Markov partition associated to this automorphism. The map A we just considered is
the restriction, to the subset X of the stable leaf of 0, of the inverse of this Markov
automorphism.

This gives us a way to build explicit Markov partitions associated to a Pisot toral
automorphism, taking an associated substitution that has strong coincidences for all
letters (up to a power, it is always possible to find such a substitution). It remains to
understand which substitutions will give good topological properties to the partition
(see [FI98]).
Remark 7. We can of course define negative strong coincidences, using suffixes
instead of prefixes; all the proofs work in the same way for negative strong coincid0
ences (we prove first in that case that the X (i) , instead of the X (i) , are disjoint, and
everything follows)

7 Examples
In this section, we provide 6 examples; other examples can be found in [FI98], [IO93].
Example 1. (sturmian substitutions) Let σ1 be the substitution 1 → 1, 2 → 21,
and σ2 be the substitution 1 → 12, 2 → 2. Let σ be any product of σ1 and σ2 ,
where both substitutions occur at least once. It is easy to prove that σ is primitive
and unimodular, hence it is Pisot since it cannot have an eigenvalue of modulus 1,
and it has negative strong coincidence of order 1 because the images of both letters
ends with the same letter. We can apply in that case the results of the paper. (See
Fig. 7)
A combinatorial study shows that all the domain Dn(i) are interval, and in fact
one can prove directly that the renormalized domains E0 (σ)Dn(i) do not depend on
n; at each step, they consist in two intervals whose length vector is the eigenvector
of E0 (σ).
It is well known that in that case the fixed point of the substitution is a sturmian
sequence, corresponding to the coding of a rotation by the 2 intervals X (1) , X (2) .
The result extends to all primitive substitutions in the Sturm monoid, corresponding
to substitutions that can be extended to automorphisms of the free group on two
generators. All matrices in SL(2, N) can be obtained in this way.
Example 2. Let σ be the substitution 1 → 112, 2 → 21. It is easily checked that
σ is unimodular, and it has positive strong coincidence of order 2. (See Fig. 8)

Here again, we can apply the theorem, but the situation is more complicated.
This substitution is not sturmian; we can however prove that the renormalized
domains contain a fixed interval, and it corresponds to the coding of a rotation by
a set that is not connected.
Example 3. (Rauzy substitution) Let σ be the Rauzy substitution defined in the
introduction, 1 7→ 12, 2 7→ 13, 3 7→ 1. We check easily that σ is a unimodular
substitution of the Pisot type that has positive strong coincidences of order 1 for all
letters. (See Fig. 9)
In that case, we can prove stronger results than those given by the theorem: the
domains X (i) are simply connected, and one can compute the Hausdorff dimension
of their boundary (cf. [Rau82], [IK91]).
Example 4. (modified Rauzy substitution) Let σ be the substitution 1 7→ 21, 2 7→
13, 3 7→ 1. The substitution σ is unimodular, of the Pisot type. It has negative
strong coincidences of order 2 for all letters. (See Fig. 10)
We check easily that σ is a unimodular substitution of the Pisot type, since its
matrix is the same as for Rauzy substitution. The substitution does not have all
strong coincidences of order 1, but its square σ 2 : 1 7→ 1321, 2 7→ 211, 3 7→ 21
does, since the images of all the letters end by 1. Hence the system is conjugate to
an exchange of pieces; the sets X (i) have a complicated structure, and in particular,
they seem not to be simply connected, as appears in Fig. 10.
Example 5. (generalized Rauzy substitution) Define the substitution σi , i = 1, 2, 3,
by σi (i) = i and σi (j) = ji if j 6= i. Let σ be a product of the substitutions σ1 , σ2 , σ3 ,
where all these substitutions occur at least once. The system generated by σ is
measurably isomorphic to a translation on the torus T2 . (See Fig. 11)
It is clear that σ is unimodular, as a product of unimodular substitutions, and
it has all negative strong coincidences of order 1, since all the images end with the
same letter. A case study shows that the renormalized sets E0 (σ)nDn contain a

fixed open set (the basic idea is to prove that, for n large enough, Dn contain a disk
of large diameter).
The only thing we have to check is that the substitution is of the Pisot type.
The characteristic polynomial of the matrix M associated to σ is of the type
P (X) = X 3 − TrMX 2 + b(M)X − 1. The trace TrM increases when we multiply on the right by one of the matrices associate to the substitutions σi , and
its minimum value is 3. Lemma 13 below proves that, for all matrices associated to a non degenerate product of σ1 , σ2 , σ3 , we have |b(M)| < TrM. This implies that P (−1) = −2 − TrM − b(M) < 0, P 0 (−1) = 3 + 2TrM + b(M) > 0,
P (1) = b(M) − TrM < 0, and P 0 (1) = 3 − 2TrM + b(M) < 0. Hence P has one
real root bigger than 1, and either the other roots are complex conjugate, hence of
modulus less than one since the product of all the roots is 1, or the other roots are
real and contained in ] − 1, 1[; in each case, the substitution is of the Pisot type. It
is associated to a translation on the torus by a vector with coordinates in a cubic
field.
Lemma 13. Let Mi denote the matrix associated to σi . Let M be a product of the
matrices Mi , where all these matrices occur at least once. We have |b(M)| < TrM.
Proof. We denote by Pi the orthogonal projection to the plane xi = 0, and by kuk
the L1 norm of the vector u in R3 (sum of the absolute values of coordinates).
We will show that the function TrM − |b(M)| is increasing. We use the following
lemma:
Lemma 14. Let fni , n ∈ N, i = 1, 2, 3 be three sequences of vectors in R2 such that
i
f01 = (0, 0),f02 = (1, 0),f03 = (0, 1), and for each n there exists i such that fn+1
= fni ,
j
fn+1
= fni + fnj if j 6= i. Then, for each n, and i, j, k distinct, we have:
| det(fni , fnj − fnk )| ≤ kfni k

Proof. The property is true by inspection for n = 0. If we suppose fn+1
= fni , we
have:

| det(fn+1

≤ | det(fnj , fni − fnk )| + | det(fni , fnj − fnk )|
≤ kfni k + kfnj k
j
k
= kfn+1

(Remark that the vectors are all positive, hence we can add the norms).

End of proof of lemma 13. We compute TrMMi = TrM + kPi Mei k. On the other
P
P
end, we can compute explicitly b(M) = i<j Mi,i Mj,j − i<j Mi,j Mj,i . We obtain the
relation:
|b(MMi ) − b(M)| = det(Pi Mei , Pi Mej − Pi Mek )
We can apply lemma 14 to the vectors Pi Mei , Pi Mej , Pi Mek , which clearly satisfy
the hypothesis, and we obtain: |b(MMi ) − b(M)| ≤ TrMMi − TrM; hence the
function TrM − |b(M)| does not decrease if we multiply on the right by Mi . This
function is 0 for the identity; hence it is nonnegative for all products of the Mi .
If one of the substitutions σi does not occur in the product, we can suppose that,
up to permutation, it is σ1 , and the first line of matrix M is (1, 0, 0), hence 1 is an
eigenvalue, and TrM = b(M). In that case, one checks that the matrix M has the
form:


1
0 0


M = a + b − 1 a b 
c+d−1 c d
where ad − bc = 1 and, if both substitutions σ2 and σ3 occur, a, b, c, d are strictly
positive integers.
We have TrM.M1 = TrM + (a + b + c + d − 2), and, by a direct computation,
b(M.M1 ) = b(M) + a + b − c − d − 2. This implies that, for the first nondegenerate
matrix in a product, |b(M)| < TrM; the result follows, since TrM − |b(M)| does not
decrease by right multiplication by Mj .

We remark that, in this case, it is possible to find examples where the characteristic polynomial has 3 real roots, as well as examples with one real and two complex
conjugate roots.
Example 6. Let σ be the substitution 1 7→ 23, 2 →
7 123, 3 7→ 1122233. it is
unimodular of the Pisot type, and it has all negative strong coincidences of order 1,
since all images end by 3 (See Fig. 12).
This is an exemple of a non-invertible substitution, that is, this substitution
extends to an homomorphism of the free group that is not an automorphism.
