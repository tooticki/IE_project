<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In the paper <ref type="bibr">[Rau82]</ref>, we find a curious compact domain, called the Rauzy fractal. The domain is constructed in the following manner:</p><p>Let σ be the substitution σ : 1 → 12 2 → 13 3 → 1</p><p>Let w = (w 1 , · · · , w n , · · · ) be the fixed point of this substitution, E 0 (σ) be the linear map associated to σ by abelianization, P the contractive invariant plane for the transformation E 0 (σ), and π : R 3 → P be the projection along the eigenvector t (1, α, α 2 ) with respect to the maximum eigenvalue λ of E 0 (σ), where α = 1/λ is the unique real root of α + α 2 + α 3 = 1.</p><p>We define X as the closure of the set {π n k=1 e w k | n = 1, 2, · · · } where e 1 , e 2 , e 3 is the canonical basis of R 3 .</p><p>The domain X has a fractal boundary, and admits a natural decomposition into three sets X (i) , i = 1, 2, 3 defined as the closure of {π n k=1 e w k |w n = i, n ∈ N}. This domain is not only interesting from the viewpoint of fractal geometry <ref type="bibr">[IK91]</ref>, but also in the sense of ergodic theory and number theory. In fact, two dynamical systems, Markov endomorphism with the structure matrix E 0 (σ) and quasi-periodic motion, act on the domain X (See <ref type="bibr">[Rau82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[IK91]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[IO93]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[Mes96]</ref>). And the projection of the points ln k=1 e w k | n ∈ N , where l n is the length of the word σ n (1), gives the best approximations of the point (α, α 2 ), in other word, the fractal domain is strongly related to the simultaneous approximation of the pair of the cubic number (α, α 2 ) (See <ref type="bibr">[IH94]</ref>). This domain is also related to developments of complex numbers in a base conjugate to α (See <ref type="bibr">[Mes96]</ref>).</p><p>In this paper, we would like to discuss a generalization of the Rauzy fractal. We will describe several constructions related to substitutions. The aim is, for a certain class of substitutions, to obtain the same result as for the Rauzy substitution; along the way, we will obtain weaker results for larger classes of substitutions.</p><p>Call f the natural map from the free monoid on d letters to Z d obtained by abelianization. Consider a substitution σ on d letters, defined by σ(i) = W (i) , i = 1, . . . , d where W (i) = W k ) is the prefix (resp. suffix) of the word W (i) with respect to the k-th letter of W (i) .</p><p>We say that the substitution σ has a positive strong coincidence of order 1 for i, j if there is an integer k such that W k ). We say that the substitution σ has positive strong coincidences for all letters if, for any pair i, j, there is an integer n such that σ n has a positive strong coincidence of order 1 for i, j.</p><p>The main result of this paper is the following: We can also define negative strong coincidences, using suffixes instead of prefixes, and obtain the same result.</p><p>One interest of our method is that it gives an explicit construction of the domain exchange, with a constructive approximation to the domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 1.</head><p>In all known examples, the substitution system is in fact isomorphic to a toral translation; we do not know whether this is the general case. We can however prove that it is true if the sequence of approximations we build for the domain exchange contains a fixed open set, and this is possible to check explicitly for a given substitution.</p><p>In that case, it is easy to show that the pieces of the domain exchange are the bases of cylinders of a Markov partition for the toral automorphism associated to the substitution.</p><p>The substitution has strong coincidences for all letters if, for example, the images of all letters by σ start or end with the same letter; so the theorem applies for the Rauzy substitution, for which all images start with 1, and also for more general systems, giving the following corollary, since in that case we can check that the sequence of approximations contains a fixed open set: Corollary 1. We take d = 3, and define the substitution σ i , i = 1, 2, 3, by σ i (i) = i and σ i (j) = ji if j = i. Let σ be a product of the substitutions σ 1 , σ 2 , σ 3 , where all these substitutions occur at least once. The system generated by σ is measurably isomorphic to a translation on the torus T 2 .</p><p>Such substitutions have been considered, for example, in <ref type="bibr">[AR91]</ref>, where it was proved that all systems generated by sequences of complexity 2n+ 1 with one trispe- cial factor of all lengths could be realized as interval exchanges. It was natural to believe, in the light of the above theorem, that such systems could also be realized as toral translations. However, a recent paper ( <ref type="bibr">[CFZ00]</ref>) shows that some of these sequences are not balanced, hence they cannot be coding of translation. In that case, we can, using the techniques given here, build a sequence of partitions, but it fails to converge.</p><p>The content of the paper is the following. In the first section, we build the 1- dimensional linear realization of a substitution; this is valid for any substitution. In the second section, we define the dual map associated to a substitution. This definition is only interesting in the case of an unimodular substitution, that is, a substitution whose associated abelianized map has determinant +1 or −1. In the third section, we consider primitive unimodular substitutions (a substitution is primitive if there is an n such that, for any i and j, i occurs in σ n (j); it is equivalent to say that the matrix of the associated linear map has a strictly positive power) and study some geometric and combinatorial properties of the dual map under this condition. In section 4, we prove that, in that case, we can build a sequence of domains D n , which tile a hyperplane of R d , and a sequence of dynamical systems T n on D n , that have σ-structure, in the sense defined in that section.</p><p>In section 5, we consider Pisot substitutions, that is, substitutions such that the associated matrix has all eigenvalues, except one, of modulus strictly smaller than 1. In that case, we can prove that the sequence of sets D n , when properly renormalized, converges to a compact set X in the Hausdorff topology. In section 6, we show that, if the substitution has strong coincidences for all letters, the dynamical systems T n can be used to define a dynamical system on X, which is measurably conjugate to the substitution dynamical system defined by σ. In section 7, we give some examples, and prove the corollary above.</p><p>There are different methods to construct the Rauzy fractal: one can use con- vergent series associated to the substitution, as is done in the original paper, or approximate it by a sequence of domains obtained by "exduction", as was already known to Rauzy. We try here to formalize this second approach; however, both methods have common points, and section 5 and 6 of this paper rely heavily on a (unfortunately unpublished) paper by Bernard Host <ref type="bibr">[Hos92]</ref>, summarizing the res- ults of a seminar at Villetaneuse (Université Paris 13) on the first approach. This paper contains a deeper result in the 2 letters case: a unimodular substitution σ on two letters is measurably conjugate to a rotation if and only if it has a strong coincidence for the two letters.</p><p>We signal that it is unknown whether there exists a unimodular Pisot substitu- tion, on 2 or more letters, that does not have strong coincidences for all letters, and in this regard our work is incomplete.</p><p>Another problem is given by the case of unimodular non-Pisot substitutions; we give some elements to study this problem in <ref type="bibr">[AIS00]</ref>, generalizing the construction of linear extensions of substitutions and their dual maps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">The linear maps associated to a substitution</head><p>Let A be an alphabet of d letters {1, 2, . . . , d}. We denote by A * = ∞ n=0 A n the free monoid on A, that is, the set of finite words on the alphabet A, endowed with the concatenation product. A substitution σ on A * is a map from A to A * , such that, for any letter i, σ(i) is a non-empty word. The substitution σ extends in a natural way to an endomorphism of the monoid A * , by the rule σ(UV ) = σ(U)σ(V ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notations 1. We denote by</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">W (i) the word σ(i); W (i) = W (i) 1 . . . W (i) l i</formula><p>is a finite word of length l i . We call P </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">l i − k, so that W (i) = P (i) k W (i) k S (i) k .</formula><p>There is a natural homorphism f : A * → Z d , obtained by abelianization of the free monoid, and one can obtain a linear transformation E 0 (σ) satisfying the following commutation relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">lclA * σ −→ A * f ↓ ↓f Z d E 0 (σ) −→ Z d .</formula><p>We will now build another linear map, on an infinite dimensional space, that contains more information on σ. The idea is the following: consider the space R d , with canonical basis (e 1 , . . . , e d ). To a finite word U = U 1 . . . U k , one can associate a path in R d , consisting in k segments joining respectively f(U 1 . . . U j−1 ) and f(U 1 . . . U j ) (this is just a graphic representation of the abelianization). Each segment is a translate, by an element of Z d , of one of the basic segments {λe i |0 ≤ λ ≤ 1} (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>, in the case d = 2). Formally, we can consider the path as a sum of elements (x, e i ), where x ∈ Z d . It is then quite natural to consider that the substitution σ operates on the set of paths, replacing each segment parallel to e i by a broken line corresponding to the word σ(i). We want the image of a connected path to be a connected path; this implies, if we suppose that the point 0 is fixed, that the image of a path joining 0 to x is a path joining 0 to E 0 (σ)(x). This completely defines the image of every segment (x, e i ), see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>.</p><p>For a formal definition, it is more convenient to consider linear combinations of paths with coefficients in R, so as to get a vector space. Definition 1. Let F be the vector space of maps from Z d × A to R that take value zero except for a finite set. For x ∈ Z d and i ∈ A, denote by (x, e i ) the element of F which takes value 1 at (x, i), and 0 elsewhere; the set {(x, e i ) |x ∈ Z d , i ∈ A} is a basis of F , and we define the 1-dimensional geometric realization E 1 (σ) of σ by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E 1 (σ) (x, e i ) = l i k=1 E 0 (σ)(x) + f(P (i) k ), e W (i) k .</formula><p>Definition 2. The support of an element of F is the set of (x, i) on which it is not zero. We say that an element of F is geometric if it takes only value 0 and 1. To a geometric element, one can associate a finite union of segments, as explained above. If a and b are two geometric elements, we will say for simplicity that a contains b if the support of a contains that of b.</p><p>If we apply the map E 1 (σ) to (0, e i ), we get the previous intuitive definition. A geometric application is the following: suppose that σ(i) starts with i; then, there is an infinite word u, starting with i, which is fixed by σ. This infinite word begins with σ n (i), for all n ∈ N. It is possible to prove that E 1 (σ) n (0, e i ) is a geometric element of F , to which one associates a broken line in R d which approximates (if the substitution is primitive) the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue; it is the path associated with σ n (i) we discussed above, and the union of all this paths is an infinite path associated with the fixed point. If the substitution is of the Pisot type, this broken line stays within bounded distance of the line through zero in this direction.</p><p>One can check directly that, if we take two distinct segments in this broken line, their images by E 1 (σ) have disjoint supports; the reason is that, if we take 2 elements (x, e i ) and (y, e j ) on the line, with y "after" x, the vector y − x has all coordinates positive, and the i-th coordinate strictly positive. Hence we have E 0 (σ)(y − x) ≥ E 0 (σ)(e i ) = f(W (i) ), and we can never have E 0 (σ)(x)+f(P</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(i) k ) = E 0 (σ)(y)+f(P (j) l );</formula><p>this is why all the E 1 (σ) n (0, e i ) are geometric. However, it is false in general: the image of a geometric element is not always geometric. In the next section, we will compute exactly the set of segments that contain a given (x, e i ) in their image, and show that it is usually not reduced to one element.</p><p>It is possible to generalize this definition to multidimensional extensions of sub- stitutions; this is studied in [AIS00].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The dual map associated to a unimodular substitution</head><p>In this section, we will only be interested in so-called "unimodular" substitutions. It is equivalent to say that the square of the matrix belongs to the unimodular linear group SL(d, Z), hence the term unimodular substitution.</p><p>We can associate to E 1 (σ) the dual map E * 1 (σ). We will show how to compute explicitly this map. We denote by F * the space of linear forms on F with finite support (that is, linear forms for which there exists a finite set K ∈ Z d × A, such that the form is 0 on any element of F whose support does not intersect K) ; this space admits as basis the set</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">{(x, e * i )|x ∈ Z d , i ∈ A}. It is easy to check that E * 1 (σ) preserves F * . O X Y Z (x, e * 1 ) ( x, e * 2 ) ( x, e * 3 )</formula><p>Figure 3: Exemples of geometric models of (x, e * i ) in dimension 3</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Lemma 1. The map E * 1 (σ) is defined on F * by: E * 1 (σ)(x, e * i ) = j∈A W (j) k =i E 0 (σ) −1 x − f(P (j) k ) , e * j Proof. We want to compute E * 1 (σ)(x, e * i ).</formula><p>Using the natural bilinear product on F * × F, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">E * 1 (σ)(x, e * i )| (y, e j ) = (x, e * i )|E 1 (σ) (y, e j ) = (x, e * i ) l j k=1 (E 0 (σ)(y) + f(P (j) k ), e W (j) k )</formula><p>The product is not zero if and only if W</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(j) k = i and E 0 (σ)(y) + f(P (j) k ) = x. Since E 0 (σ), as a map from Z d to Z d , is invertible, this amounts to y = E 0 (σ) −1 x − f(P (j) k )</formula><p>; hence we get the formula given above.</p><p>Remark that we can also consider F * as the set of maps from Z d × A to R with value zero except of a finite set. Hence definition 2 makes sense also here, and we can define the geometric elements of F * as those who take only value 0 and 1.</p><p>We recover in this way, up to a change of coordinates, the formulas already given, with a dynamical motivation, in <ref type="bibr">[IO93]</ref>. The signification of this map is not immediately clear; but we can give a geometric model, in the following way:</p><p>To (x, e * i ), we associate the upper hyperface orthogonal to e i of the unit cube with lower vertex at x. Analytically, this face can be expressed as {x + e i + j =i λ j e j |λ j ∈ [0, 1]} (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>). The dual map associates, to a given hyperface, a finite collection of hyperfaces (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref> for the dual map associated to the Rauzy substitution).</p><p>To a geometric element of F * , we can associate a finite union of faces; it is however more difficult to represent non-geometric elements. In the general case, the image by E * 1 (σ) of a geometric element is no longer geometric, since different faces can have images by E * 1 (σ) whose support intersect. We will see in the next section that there are sets of geometric elements invariant by the map; these can be used to approximate, by iteration, the plane defined by the dual eigenvector for the maximal eigenvalue. From now on, we will suppose that the substitution is primitive, that is, there is an n such that, for any pair of letters (i, j), i occurs in σ n (j). It is equivalent to say that the matrix of E 0 (σ) is primitive, and so, by Perron-Frobenius theorem, E 0 (σ) has an eigenvalue λ that is positive, simple and strictly bigger in modulus than the other eigenvalues. We denote by v λ a positive eigenvector associated to λ for the transpose of E 0 (σ), and by P the plane orthogonal to v λ . It is clear that P is invariant by E 0 (σ). We will denote by P &lt; the set {x ∈ R d |x.v λ &lt; 0}, (where x.v λ is the scalar product between vectors of R d ) that is, the open lower half-space associated to P. We can define in the same way P ≤ , P &gt; , P ≥ .</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">E * 1 (σ) −→ E * 1 (σ) −→ E * 1 (σ) −→</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 2.</head><p>To avoid cumbersome terminology, we will always use the 3-dimensional vocabulary instead of d-dimensional, and speak of planes, surface, cube,. . ., instead of hyperplane, hypersurface, hypercube, . . ., since no confusion will ensue, and all our examples will be on 2 or 3 letters.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Definition 4. We say that (x, e * i )</formula><p>, where x ∈ Z d , is a unit tip of the stepped surface of P if x ∈ P &lt; and x + e i ∈ P ≥ . We denote by G the set of finite sums of distinct unit tips.</p><p>The unit tips can be easily visualised, using the geometric model of the preceding section. The element (x, e * i ) is a unit tip if the interior of the unit cube with lower corner at x intersects the plane P, and its upper face orthogonal to e i does not intersect P, except maybe on the boundary. The union of all unit tips constitute a stepped surface that is the best approximation of P by faces contained in the closed upper half-space P ≥ . The elements of G can be represented as finite parts of this stepped surface. They are all geometric elements of F * , so that E * 1 (σ) acts on G. The main result of this section is the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Proposition 1. The set G is invariant by E * 1 (σ)</formula><p>Proof. it is enough to prove that the image of any unit tip is contained in G, and that two different unit tips have disjoint images; this is accomplished in the following two lemmas.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Lemma 2. If (x, e * i ) is a unit tip, its image E * 1 (σ)(x, e * i ) belongs to G.</formula><p>Proof. From the definition of</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">E * 1 (σ), we must prove that, if W (j) k = i, (E 0 (σ) −1 (x − f(P (j) k )), e * j ) is a unit tip. But f(P (j)</formula><p>k ) is a positive vector, so its opposite is in the negative cone, included in P ≤ ; x is in P &lt; by definition, so the sum is in P &lt; . This set is invariant by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">E 0 (σ) −1 , so that E 0 (σ) −1 (x − f(P (j) k )) is in P &lt; .</formula><p>On the other hand, remark that, from the definition of E 0 (σ) and f, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">E 0 (σ) −1 (f(σ(j))) = e j . Hence, E 0 (σ) −1 (x − f(P (j) k )) + e j = E 0 (σ) −1 (x − f(P (j) k ) + f(σ(j))) = E 0 (σ) −1 (x + e i + f(S (j) k )); since f(S (j)</formula><p>k ) is in the positive cone, and x + e i is in P ≥ , their sum is in P ≥ , which is invariant by</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">E 0 (σ) −1 , so that E 0 (σ) −1 (x − f(P (j) k )) + e j ∈ P ≥ .</formula><p>This is exactly what we need. It is easy to check that all the unit tips in the sum that defines</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">E * 1 (σ)(x, e * i ) are distinct. Indeed, take two such unit tips (E 0 (σ) −1 (x − f(P (j) k )), e * j ) and (E 0 (σ) −1 (x − f(P (j ) k ), e * j )</formula><p>. Suppose they are equal; we must then have j = j . If k = k , we can suppose that k &lt; k , so that P</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">(j) k is a strict prefix of P (j)</formula><p>k . Then, their images by f are distinct, and since E 0 (σ) −1 is one-to-one, this implies that the base vertices of the two unit tips are distinct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 3. Two distinct unit tips have disjoint images</head><p>Proof. Suppose that (y, e * i ) is in the intersection of</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">E * 1 (σ)(x, e * j ) and E * 1 (σ)(x , e * j )</formula><p>. Then, by definition, we can find k and k such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">y = E 0 (σ) −1 (x − f(P (i) k )) = E 0 (σ) −1 (x − f(P (i) k )), hence x − f(P (i) k ) = x − f(P (i) k ) since E 0 (σ) is not degenerate.</formula><p>If x = x , we must have k = k , and the unit tips are not distinct. If x = x , we must have k = k ; if for example k &lt; k , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">x + f(W (i) k . . . W (i) k −1 ) = x ; since f(W (i)</formula><p>k ) = e j , this implies that x is not in P &lt; , and this contradicts the definition of the unit tip (x , e * j ).</p><p>Remark that the contradiction comes from the fact that unit tips must be close to the plane P; there is no reason for an arbitrary pair of elements to have disjoint images.</p><p>One checks immediately that the elements (−e i , e * i ) are unit tips; the sum of all the elements represent the lower faces of the unit cube at the origin, which touches the plane P at the origin.</p><p>The upper faces of this unit cube are given by the sum of the elements (0, e * i ). Remark that if, in the definition of the unit tips, we exchange strict and large inequalities, replacing P &lt; by P ≤ and P ≥ by P &gt; , then (0, e * i ) becomes a unit tip; the lemmas 1 and 2 and the proposition stay true, mutatis mutandis, in that case, by the same proof, exchanging all large and strict inequalities. It will prove very useful in the sequel to use these upper and lower faces of the unit cube at the origin. We will use the following notation: </p><formula xml:id="formula_22">X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z E * 1 (σ) ↓ E * 1 (σ) ↓ E * 1 (σ) ↓ E * 1 (σ) ↓</formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">i∈A (0, e * i ) Proposition 2. E * 1 (σ)(U) is an element of G which contains U; E * 1 (σ)(U ) contains U ; E * 1 (σ)(U ) is not in G, but we have E * 1 (σ)(U ) − E * 1 (σ)(U) = U − U. Proof. Because P (j)</formula><p>1 is, by definition, the empty word, its image by f is zero; suppose that W (j)</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">1 = i, this implies that (0, e * j ) is contained in E * 1 (σ)(0, e * i ) (we only need to check that, because W (j) 1 = i, (0, e * j )</formula><p>appears in the sum that defines the image). By taking the sum on all letters, we obtain that E * 1 (σ)(U ) contains U .

The main result of this section can be expressed in this way: we can group the tiles so that the non periodic tiling of P is also generated by the projections of E * 1 (σ) n (−e i , e * i ), and the union of these new tiles π(E * 1 (σ) n (U)) generates a periodic tiling, obtained from the projection of the stepped surface of the rational plane E 0 (σ) n (P). These bigger tiles have an almost self-similar structure, which allow a simple generation of large parts of the tiling by translation of the basic tiles, giving rise to a family of larger and larger dynamical systems induced from each other.

However, even if the limit set exists, it is in not at all clear that it supports a dynamical system. The reason is that the sets X (i) could have an intersection of non zero measure. In the next section we will prove that, if the substitution has strong coincidences for all letters, this cannot happen; in this section, we will only prove, in the general case, that the set X contains a fundamental domain for Γ 0 , the vector of measures (|X (i) |) is an eigenvector for E 0 (σ), and some translates of the X (i) are pairwise disjoint; this last fact will be of critical importance in the next section.</p><p>From now on, we will denote by |K| the measure of a compact set K. The measure does not behave very well with respect to Hausdorff metric, as can be seen from the fact that any compact set is the limit of a sequence of finite sets, of measure 0. It is however easy to prove that, by passing to the limit, the measure can only increase: Lemma 9. if K is the limit of a sequence (K n ) n∈N for the Hausdorff metric, we have |K| ≥ lim sup n→∞ |K n |.</p><p>Proof. Define K + = {x|d(x, K) ≤ }. This is a compact that contains K. By the definition of Hausdorff metric, for all n large enough, K n is contained in K +, which implies that |K + | ≥ lim sup n→∞ |K n |. Take a sequence ( n ), decreasing, with limit 0. The sets K + n are a decreasing sequence of compact, whose intersection is K. This implies that |K| = lim n→∞ |K + n |, and we get the result by taking the limit in the first inequality. This result applies in particular to the sets X and X (i) . We can even prove a little more:</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">Lemma 10. The set X contains a fundamental domain for Γ 0 .</formula><p>Proof. It is enough to prove that any element of P is contained in X + γ, for some γ ∈ Γ 0 . But for any n, it is contained in E 0 (σ) n D n + γ n , because the E 0 (σ) n D n contain a fundamental domain for Γ 0 . These domains are uniformly bounded, hence the sequence γ n , even if it is not constant, can take only a finite number of values. Hence we can find a subsequence n k such that γ n k is constant, equal to γ, which implies that the point is contained in X + γ.</p><p>We can also be more precise on the ratio of the pieces. Remark that the vector whose coordinates are |π(0, e * i )| is a positive eigenvector for the maximal eigenvalue λ. Indeed, let v be a positive eigenvector of norm 1. The area of π(0, e * i ) is also the volume of the parallelepiped with basis π(0, e * i ) and height v; but, since π is the projection along v, this is also the volume of the parallelepiped with basis (0, e * i ) and height v, that is v i , hence the result. Since one builds the successive sets</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">D (i)</formula><p>n by applying the substitution, we see that at each step, the vector of measures t (|D (i) n |) ∈ R d stays proportional to a positive eigenvector, and after renormalisation, it is constant. Unfortunately, it is not possible to obtain directly the same result for the limit, since we have only an inequality. We will use a property of primitive matrices which is a corollary of Perron-Frobenius theorem.</p><p>Lemma 11. Let M be a primitive positive matrix, with maximal eigenvalue λ.

We need to add a condition on the prefixes, to ensure that σ(P (i) k ) and σ(P (j) k ) have the same length.

This implies, as we saw in section 4, that it is measurably conjugate (using the symbolic dynamics with respect to partition X (i) ) to the system generated by the substitution σ, because the sequence of partitions T k A (i) n , being translates of images by E 0 (σ) k of the initial one, has a diameter going to 0, hence it is generating.</p><p>The set X projects onto the torus P/Γ 0 , since, by lemma 10, it contains a fundamental domain; after projection, the vectors π(e i ) become identified, since by definition they differ by an element of Γ 0 , hence the transformation T is semi- conjugate to a toral translation.</p><p>The continuity of the map from Ω to the torus comes from the fact that a primitive substitution is bilaterally recognizable (cf. <ref type="bibr">[Mos92]</ref>); from the initial part of a word u, it is possible to determine n k such that u is contained in S n k σ k (Ω), hence the corresponding point must be contained in π(T −n k E 0 (σ) k (X)); since the diameter of E 0 (σ) k (X) goes to 0, and the translation is an isometry, we get the result (the analogous result for (X, T ) could be false, because T is not continuous, hence the diameter of T −n E 0 (σ) k X has no reason to tend to 0).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 5.</head><p>In all the examples we know, the projection from X to the torus P/Γ 0 is almost everywhere one-to-one. Since X is compact, we can prove that this projection is always finite-to-one. Furthermore, the number of preimages of a point of the torus is almost everywhere invariant by the translation (it is constant on all orbits whose preimages do not belong to the intersection of two sets X (i) , and this is a set of full measure), hence, by ergodicity of the translation, it is almost everywhere constant.</p><p>One should like to prove that it is almost everywhere one. We do not know a general proof of this fact; however, one can show that, if the projection is not one-to-one, all points of X also belong to some X + γ, for some non-zero γ ∈ Γ 0 .</p><p>If there exists a set K, with non-empty interior, such that K ⊂ E 0 (σ) n (D n ) for all large enough n, this is impossible, since interior points of K cannot belong to translates of E 0 (σ) n (D n ) by the lattice; in that case, we can conclude that the substitution system is in fact measurably conjugate to a toral translation.</p><p>Remark 6. This is not the only system we can define on X: there is also E 0 (σ), but this is not interesting since it is strictly contracting, and its "inverse" A defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_72">A(x) = E 0 (σ) −1 (x + f(P (j) k )) if x ∈ X (i) and E 0 (σ) −1 x ∈ X (j) + f(P (j) k ).</formula><p>This is a Markov endomorphism, with matrix structure E 0 (σ).</p><p>It is also possible to consider the action of E 0 (σ) on R d /Z d ; we obtain a toral automorphism, and, in the case where the set X is a fundamental domain for the lattice Γ 0 , it is not difficult to show that the partition</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">X (i)</formula><p>is the basis for a Markov partition associated to this automorphism. The map A we just considered is the restriction, to the subset X of the stable leaf of 0, of the inverse of this Markov automorphism. </p><formula xml:id="formula_74">E * 1 (σ) n (0, e * i ) for σ = σ 1 σ 2 , i = 1, 2, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4</formula><p>This gives us a way to build explicit Markov partitions associated to a Pisot toral automorphism, taking an associated substitution that has strong coincidences for all letters (up to a power, it is always possible to find such a substitution). It remains to understand which substitutions will give good topological properties to the partition (see <ref type="bibr">[FI98]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remark 7.</head><p>We can of course define negative strong coincidences, using suffixes instead of prefixes; all the proofs work in the same way for negative strong coincid- ences (we prove first in that case that the X (i) , instead of the X (i) , are disjoint, and everything follows)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Examples</head><p>In this section, we provide 6 examples; other examples can be found in <ref type="bibr">[FI98]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[IO93]</ref>. Example 1. (sturmian substitutions) Let σ 1 be the substitution 1 → 1, 2 → 21, and σ 2 be the substitution 1 → 12, 2 → 2. Let σ be any product of σ 1 and σ 2 , where both substitutions occur at least once. It is easy to prove that σ is primitive and unimodular, hence it is Pisot since it cannot have an eigenvalue of modulus 1, and it has negative strong coincidence of order 1 because the images of both letters ends with the same letter. We can apply in that case the results of the paper. (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Fig. 7)</ref> A combinatorial study shows that all the domain D (i) n are interval, and in fact one can prove directly that the renormalized domains E 0 (σ)D (i) n do not depend on n; at each step, they consist in two intervals whose length vector is the eigenvector of E 0 (σ).</p><p>It is well known that in that case the fixed point of the substitution is a sturmian sequence, corresponding to the coding of a rotation by the 2 intervals X (1) , X <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> . The result extends to all primitive substitutions in the Sturm monoid, corresponding to substitutions that can be extended to automorphisms of the free group on two generators. All matrices in SL(2, N) can be obtained in this way. Here again, we can apply the theorem, but the situation is more complicated. This substitution is not sturmian; we can however prove that the renormalized domains contain a fixed interval, and it corresponds to the coding of a rotation by a set that is not connected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 3. (Rauzy substitution) Let</head><p>σ be the Rauzy substitution defined in the introduction, 1 → 12, 2 → 13, 3 → 1. We check easily that σ is a unimodular substitution of the Pisot type that has positive strong coincidences of order 1 for all letters. (See <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>)</p><p>In that case, we can prove stronger results than those given by the theorem: the domains X (i) are simply connected, and one can compute the Hausdorff dimension of their boundary (cf. <ref type="bibr">[Rau82]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[IK91]</ref>). We check easily that σ is a unimodular substitution of the Pisot type, since its matrix is the same as for Rauzy substitution. The substitution does not have all strong coincidences of order 1, but its square σ 2 : 1 → 1321, 2 → 211, 3 → 21 does, since the images of all the letters end by 1. Hence the system is conjugate to an exchange of pieces; the sets X (i) have a complicated structure, and in particular, they seem not to be simply connected, as appears in <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>.</p><p>Example 5. (generalized Rauzy substitution) Define the substitution σ i , i = 1, 2, 3, by σ i (i) = i and σ i (j) = ji if j = i. Let σ be a product of the substitutions σ 1 , σ 2 , σ 3 , where all these substitutions occur at least once. The system generated by σ is measurably isomorphic to a translation on the torus T 2 . (See <ref type="figure">Fig. 11)</ref> It is clear that σ is unimodular, as a product of unimodular substitutions, and it has all negative strong coincidences of order 1, since all the images end with the same letter. A case study shows that the renormalized sets E 0 (σ) n D n contain a fixed open set (the basic idea is to prove that, for n large enough, D n contain a disk of large diameter). The only thing we have to check is that the substitution is of the Pisot type. The characteristic polynomial of the matrix M associated to σ is of the type P (X) = X 3 − TrMX 2 + b(M)X − 1. The trace TrM increases when we mul- tiply on the right by one of the matrices associate to the substitutions σ i , and its minimum value is 3. Lemma 13 below proves that, for all matrices associ- ated to a non degenerate product of σ 1 , σ 2 , σ 3 , we have |b(M)| &lt; TrM. This im- plies that P (−1) = −2 − TrM − b(M) &lt; 0, P (−1) = 3 + 2TrM + b(M) &gt; 0, P (1) = b(M) − TrM &lt; 0, and P (1) = 3 − 2TrM + b(M) &lt; 0. Hence P has one real root bigger than 1, and either the other roots are complex conjugate, hence of modulus less than one since the product of all the roots is 1, or the other roots are real and contained in ] − 1, 1[; in each case, the substitution is of the Pisot type. It is associated to a translation on the torus by a vector with coordinates in a cubic field. Lemma 13. Let M i denote the matrix associated to σ i . Let M be a product of the matrices M i , where all these matrices occur at least once. We have |b(M)| &lt; TrM.</p><p>Proof. We denote by P i the orthogonal projection to the plane x i = 0, and by u the L 1 norm of the vector u in R 3 (sum of the absolute values of coordinates).</p><p>We will show that the function TrM − |b(M)| is increasing. We use the following lemma: Lemma 14. Let f i n , n ∈ N, i = 1, 2, 3 be three sequences of vectors in R 2 such that f 1 0 = (0, 0),f 2 0 = (1, 0),f 3 0 = (0, 1), and for each n there exists i such that f i n+1 = f i n , f j n+1 = f i n + f j n if j = i. Then, for each n, and i, j, k distinct, we have: </p><formula xml:id="formula_75">| det(f i n , f j n − f k n )| ≤ f i n</formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: The linear map associated to 1 → 121, 2 → 21</figDesc></figure>
