BEGIN Proof 
 The `only if' part follows immediately from definitions. Let us show the `if' part. Suppose that $\tau \circ f$ is strongly affine for each $\tau \in F^*$. Given any $\mu \in \M ^1(X)$, $A\subset X$ $\mu $-measurable and $\tau \in F^*$, we have $$\int _A \tau \circ f\di \mu = \begin {cases} 0, & \mu (A)=0,\\ \mu (A) \tau \left (f\left (r\left (\frac {\mu |_A}{\mu (A)}\right )\right )\right ), &\mu (A)>0.\end {cases}$$ Hence $f$ is $\mu $-integrable and $\int _X f\di \mu =f(r(\mu ))$.

END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 The assertion (a) follows from \cite [Theorem 1]{frolik-bulams}. Indeed, the space $X$, being a Baire subset of a compact space, is $K$-analytic by \cite [Proposition $\beta $ on p.1113]{frolik-bulams} (spaces which are now called $K$-analytic are called \emph {analytic} in the quoted paper). Thus $X$ satisfies the assumption on the domain space in \cite [Theorem 1]{frolik-bulams}. Further, $f$ is Baire measurable. It should be noted, that in \cite {frolik-bulams} this notion has a different meaning -- it means that the preimage of any Baire set is a Baire set. Since $F$ is assumed to be metrizable, this notion coincides with our notion of Baire measurability. The conclusion is that $f(X)$ is $K$-analytic, hence Lindel\"of (by \cite [Proposition $\alpha $ on p.1113]{frolik-bulams}) and therefore separable (by metrizability). \par (b) By (a) we can suppose without loss of generality that $F$ is separable. Hence the assertion follows from Lemma~\ref {L:baire-n}(b). \par (c) By (a) we can suppose without loss of generality that $F$ is separable.

END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Fix a closed absolutely convex bounded set $L\subset F$ containing the ranges of all the functions $f_{n,m}$, $n,m\in \en $. Since closed convex sets are weakly closed, it contains also ranges of $f_n$, $n\in \en $, and that of $f$. Hence by Corollary~\ref {C:baire} we have $f\in \C _1(X,L)$ (note that $L$ can be chosen to be separable). Fix a sequence $(h_k)$ in $\C (X,L)$ pointwise converging to $f$. \par Since $F$ is a \fr space, its topology is generated by a sequence of seminorms $(p_k)$. Without loss of generality we can suppose that $p_1\le p_2\le \dots $. For each $k\in \en $ denote by $K_k$ the polar of the set $\{y\in F\setsep p_k(y)<1\}$. By the Alaoglu theorem $K_k$ is weak$^*$ compact. \par Given any function $u\colon X\to F$ denote by $\widehat {u}$ the scalar function on $X\times F^*$ defined by $$ \widehat {u}(x,x^*)=x^*(u(x)), \qquad (x,x^*)\in X\times F^*.$$ It is easy to observe that \begin {itemize} \item $\widehat {u_n}\to \widehat {u}$ pointwise whenever $u_n(x)\to u(x)$ weakly in $F$ for each $x\in X$. \item If $u$ is continuous, then $\widehat {u}$ is continuous on $X\times K_k$ for each $k\in \en $. ($K_k$ is equipped with the weak$^*$ topology.) \end {itemize} Indeed, the first assertion is obvious. Let us show the second one. Suppose $u$ is continuous and $k\in \en $. Fix any $(x,x^*)\in X\times K_k$ and $\varepsilon >0$. For $(y,y^*)\in X\times K_k$ we have $$\begin {aligned}\abs {\widehat {u}(y,y^*)-\widehat {u}(x,x^*)}&=\abs {y^*(u(y))-x^*(u(x))} \\& \le \abs {y^*(u(y)-u(x))}+\abs {y^*(u(x))-x^*(u(x))} \\& \le p_k(u(y)-u(x))+\abs {y^*(u(x))-x^*(u(x))}<\varepsilon \end {aligned}$$ whenever $$p_k(u(y)-u(x))<\frac \varepsilon 2\mbox {\quad and \quad }\abs {y^*(u(x))-x^*(u(x))}<\frac \varepsilon 2,$$ which defines a neighborhood of $(x,x^*)$ in $X\times K_k$. \par Fix $k\in \en $. Then $\widehat {h_n}\to \widehat {f}$ pointwise and hence $\widehat {f}\,\r _{X\times K_k}\in \C _1(X\times K_k,\ef )$. Moreover, $\widehat {f_n}\to \widehat {f}$ and $\widehat {f_{n,m}}\overset {m}{\longrightarrow } \widehat {f_n}$ pointwise on $X\times K_k$ for each $n\in \en $. Since $(\widehat {f_{n,m}}\r _{X\times K_k})$ is a uniformly bounded family of continuous functions, \cite [Lemma 2.5]{MeSta} yields a sequence $(u^k_n)_n$ in the convex hull of the family $(f_{n,m})$ such that $\widehat {u^k_n}\overset {n}{\longrightarrow }\widehat {f}$ pointwise on $X\times K_k$. Then $\widehat {u^k_n}-\widehat {h_n}\overset {n}{\longrightarrow }0$ pointwise on $X\times K_k$. Since this sequence is uniformly bounded in $\C (X\times K_k,\ef )$, it converges weakly to zero in $\C (X\times K_k,\ef )$. By the Mazur theorem there is $v_k\in \co \{u^k_n-h_n\setsep n\ge k\}$ such that $\norm {\widehat {v_k}\r _{X\times K_k}}<\frac 1k$. The function $v_k$ can be expressed as $v_k=g_k-w_k$, where $g_k\in \co \{f_{n,m}\setsep n,m\in \en \}$ and $w_k\in \co \{h_n\setsep n\ge k\}$. \par We claim that $g_n(x)\to f(x)$ for each $x\in X$. So, fix $x\in X$ and $k\in \en $. We will show that $p_k(f(x)-g_n(x))\overset {n}{\longrightarrow } 0$. Let $\varepsilon >0$ be arbitrary. Fix $n_0\in \en $ such that $n_0\ge k$, $\frac {1}{n_0}<\frac \varepsilon 2$ and $p_k(f(x)-h_n(x))<\frac \varepsilon 2$ for $n\ge n_0$. Fix $n\ge n_0$. Then $p_k(f(x)-w_n(x))<\frac \varepsilon 2$ (as $w_n(x)\in \co \{h_j(x)\setsep j\ge n_0\}$). Hence $$\begin {aligned}p_k(f(x)-g_n(x))&\le p_k(f(x)-w_n(x))+p_k(w_n(x)-g_n(x)) \le \frac \varepsilon 2 + p_n(v_n(x)) \\&=\frac \varepsilon 2+\sup \{\abs {x^*(v_n(x))}\setsep x^*\in K_k\} =\frac \varepsilon 2+\norm {\widehat {v_n}\r _{X\times K_k}} \\&\le \frac \varepsilon 2+\norm {\widehat {v_n}\r _{X\times K_n}} <\frac \varepsilon 2+\frac 1n<\varepsilon .\end {aligned}$$ This completes the proof.

 Let $U$ be an open subset of $F$. For each $x\in U$ there is a convex open neighborhood $V_x$ of zero such that $x+\overline {V_x}\subset U$.

BEGIN Proof 
 Suppose that $f$ is weakly measurable, i.e., $\tau \circ f$ is $\mu $-measurable for any $\tau \in F^*$. It follows that $f^{-1}(U)$ is $\mu $-measurable for any set $U$ from the canonical basis of the weak topology on $F$. Since $F$ is separable and metrizable, the weak topology is hereditarily Lindel\"of, thus $f^{-1}(U)$ is $\mu $-measurable for any weakly open set $U$. By Lemma~\ref {L:meas-0} we conclude that $f^{-1}(U)$ is $\mu $-measurable for any set $U$ open in the original topology of $F$. This completes the proof.

 We can without loss of generality suppose that $F$ is separable. \par The assertion (a) for nonnegative measures then follows immediately from \cite [Corollary~3.1]{thomas}. The general case is an easy consequence. \par (b) Assuming $\mu (f)\notin L$, we can by the Hahn-Banach separation argument find an element $\tau \in F^*$ and $c\in \er $ such that $\Re \tau (\mu (f))>c>\sup \{\Re \tau (l)\setsep l\in L\}$. Then \[ c<\Re \tau (\mu (f))=\int _X \Re \tau (f(x))\di \mu (x)< \int _X c\di \mu (x)=c. \] Hence the assertion follows. \par (c) We proceed in the same way as in the proof of (b). If $L$ is absolutely convex, we get $$\sup \{\Re \tau (l)\setsep l\in L\}=\sup \{\abs {\tau (l)}\setsep l\in L\}$$ and \[ c<\Re \tau (\mu (f))=\Re \int _X \tau (f(x))\di \mu (x)\le \int _X \abs {\tau (f(x))}\di \abs {\mu }(x) \le c. \] \par To show (d), let $\rho $ be any continuous seminorm on $F$. Since $f$ is $\mu $-measurable by Lemma~\ref {L:meas-ws}, it is clear that $\rho \circ f$ is $\mu $-measurable and bounded, hence it is $\mu $-integrable. Set $V=\{x\in F\setsep \rho (x)\le 1\}$ and let \[ V^0=\{\tau \in F^*\setsep \abs {\tau (x)}\le 1\mbox { for }x\in V\} \] denote the absolute polar of $V$. Then the Bipolar Theorem implies that \[ \rho (x)=\sup \{\abs {\tau (x)}\setsep \tau \in V^0\},\quad x\in F. \] Hence \[ \begin {aligned} \rho \left (\int _X f\di \mu \right )&=\sup \left \{\abs {\tau \left (\int _X f\di \mu \right )}\setsep \tau \in V^0\right \} =\sup \left \{\abs {\int _X \tau \circ f\di \mu }\setsep \tau \in V^0\right \}\\ &\le \sup \left \{\int _X \abs {\tau \circ f}\di \abs {\mu }\setsep \tau \in V^0\right \} \le \int _X \rho \circ f\di \abs {\mu }. \end {aligned} \] This concludes the proof. \par

Moreover, all the involved functions are $\mu $-integrable and $\int _X f_n\di \mu \to \int _X f\di \mu $ in $F$.
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Set $L=\ov {\{f_n(x)\setsep n\in \en , x\in X\}}$. Then $L$ is a separable closed bounded set and clearly $f(X)\subset L$. Thus $f$ is bounded and has separable range. Moreover, it is weakly $\mu $-measurable as measurability is preserved by pointwise limits of sequences. By Lemma~\ref {L:meas-ws}, all the involved mappings are even $\mu $-measurable. Their $\mu $-integrability now follows from Lemma~\ref {L:norma}(a). It remains to prove the convergence of integrals. \par To do that, let $\rho $ be any continuous seminorm on $F$. By Lemma~\ref {L:norma}(c) we get $$\rho \left (\int _X f_n\di \mu -\int _X f\di \mu \right )=\rho \left (\int _X (f_n-f)\di \mu \right )\le \int _X\rho \circ (f_n-f)\di \abs {\mu }$$ for each $n\in \en $. Since $f_n\to f$ pointwise, $\rho \circ (f_n- f)\to 0$ pointwise. Clearly $\rho (f_n(x)-f(x))\le 2\sup \{\rho (v)\setsep v\in L\}$ for each $x\in K$, thus the classical Dominated Convergence Theorem gives \[ \lim _{n\to \infty }\int _X \rho \circ (f_n-f)\di \abs {\mu }=0. \] Since $\rho $ is an arbitrary continuous seminorm, the convergence of the integrals follows.

BEGIN Proof 
 (a) Let $x\in A$ be arbitrary. Fix any continuous seminorm $\rho $ on $F$ and any $\ep >0$. We will find a neighborhood $U$ of zero in $E$ such that for any $y\in (x+U)\cap A$ one has $\rho (\hom f(y)-\hom f(x))\le \ep $. \par To do that first observe that the mapping $h:A\times \er \to B$ defined by $h(y,t)=e^{-it}f(e^{it}y)$ is continuous. Therefore for any $t\in \er $ there is $V_t$, an absolutely convex neighborhood of zero in $E$, and $\delta _t>0$ such that whenever $s\in (t-\delta _t,t+\delta _t)$ and $y\in (x+V_t)\cap A$, then $\rho (h(y,s)-h(x,t))<\frac \ep 2$. Fix a finite set $J\subset [0,2\pi ]$ such that the intervals $(t-\delta _t,t+\delta _t)$, $t\in J$, cover $[0,2\pi ]$. Let $U=\bigcap _{t\in J}V_t$. Given $s\in [0,2\pi ]$, choose $t\in J$ with $s\in (t-\delta _t,t+\delta _t)$. Then for each $y\in (x+U)\cap A$ we have $$\rho (h(y,s)-h(x,s))\le \rho (h(y,s)-h(x,t))+\rho (h(x,t)-h(x,s))<\ep .$$ Hence, for each $y\in (x+U)\cap A$ we have $$\begin {aligned} \rho (\hom f(y)-\hom f(x))&=\rho \left (\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2 \pi } (h(y,s)-h(x,s))\di s\right ) \\&\le \frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2 \pi } \rho (h(y,s)-h(x,s))\di s\le \ep , \end {aligned}$$ which concludes the proof. \par The assertion (b) follows immediately from Theorem~\ref {T:dct}. The assertion (c) follows from (a) using (b) and transfinite induction.

BEGIN Proof 
 (a) Set $h=f-f(0)$. Then $h$ is odd, hence $h(\alpha x+\beta y)=\alpha h(x)+\beta h(y)$ whenever $\alpha ,\beta \in \er $ and $x,y,\alpha x+\beta y\in A$. Indeed, this is clear in case $\beta =0$. If $\beta \ne 0$, we have $$\begin {aligned}h(\alpha x+\beta y)&=2(\abs {\alpha }+\abs {\beta })h\left (\frac {\alpha x+\beta y}{2(\abs {\alpha }+\abs {\beta })}\right )\\& =(\abs {\alpha }+\abs {\beta })\left (h\left (\frac {\alpha }{\abs {\alpha }+\abs {\beta }}x\right )+h\left (\frac {\beta }{\abs {\alpha }+\abs {\beta }}y\right )\right )=\alpha h(x)+\beta h(y).\end {aligned}$$ Therefore we have $$\begin {aligned} \hom f(x)&=\hom h(x)=\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi }e^{-it}h(e^{it}x)\di t \\&=\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi } e^{-it}h(x\cos t+ix\sin t)\di t \\&=\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi } (\cos ^2t-i\cos t\sin t)(h(x)) \di t \\&\qquad \qquad +\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi } (\cos t\sin t-i\sin ^2t)h(ix)\di t \\&=\frac 12( h(x) - ih(ix)) =\frac 12(f(x)-if(ix))-\frac {1-i}2f(0). \end {aligned}$$ Set $u=\hom f$ and $v(x)=\ov {f(x)-f(0)-u(x)}$ for $x\in A$. Then $u$ is a homogeneous affine function. Moreover, by the above formula we get $$v(x)=\frac 12\ov {(f(x)-f(0))+i(f(ix)-f(0))}, \quad x\in A.$$ Hence $v(ix)=iv(x)$ for $x\in A$, so $v$ is homogeneous. The uniqueness is clear. \par The assertion (b) follows from (a) by transfinite induction. The assertion (c) follows immediately from (b).

 (a) Define a measure $\nu $ by $\nu (A)=\frac 12(\mu (A)-\mu (-A))$ for $A\subset X$ Borel. It is a well-defined measure. Moreover, for any $f\in \C (X,\er )$ we have $\nu (f)=\mu (\odd f)$. Indeed, set $\sigma (x^*)=-x^*$ for $x^*\in X$. Then, given $f\in \C (X,\er )$, we have $$\nu (f)=\frac 12\left (\int _X f\di \mu -\int _X f\di \sigma (\mu )\right )=\frac 12\left (\int _X f\di \mu -\int _X f\circ \sigma ^{-1}\di \mu \right )=\mu (\odd f).$$ It follows that $\nu =\odd \mu $. \par The assertions (b) and (c) follow immediately from (a).

END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 (a) Let us fix two disjoint Borel sets $A^+$ and $A^-$ such that $\mu ^+$ is supported by $A^+$ and $\mu ^-$ is supported by $A^-$. It is enough to take $A=A^+\setminus (-A^+)$. \par To show (b) it is enough to observe that $x\mapsto \int y^*(x)\di \mu (y^*)$ defines a linear functional on $E$ of norm not greater than $\|\mu \|$. \par (c) If $\mu =0$, take $\nu =\frac 12(\ep _{y^*}+\ep _{-y^*})$ where $y^*$ is an extreme point of $X$. If $\mu \ne 0$, one can take $\nu =2\mu ^+ +\frac {1-2\norm {\mu ^+}}{\norm {\mu }}\abs {\mu }$. Indeed, let $A$ be the set provided by (a). Then $\norm {\mu ^+}=\mu ^+(A)=\mu (A)=-\mu (-A)=\mu ^-(-A)=\norm {\mu ^-}$, thus $\norm {\mu ^+}\le \frac 12$. It follows that $\nu $ is a probability measure. Moreover, given $B\subset X$ Borel, we have $$\begin {aligned} \odd \nu (B)&=\frac 12(\nu (B)-\nu (-B)) =\mu ^+(B)-\mu ^+(-B)+\tfrac {1-2\norm {\mu ^+}}{2\norm {\mu }} (\abs {\mu }(B)-\abs {\mu }(-B)) \\&=\mu (B\cap A)-\mu ((-B)\cap A)\\&\quad + \tfrac {1-2\norm {\mu ^+}}{2\norm {\mu }} (\mu (B\cap A)-\mu (B\cap (-A))-\mu ((-B)\cap A)+\mu ((-B)\cap (-A))) \\&=\mu (B\cap A)+\mu (B\cap (-A)) + 0 = \mu (B),\end {aligned}$$ thus $\odd \nu =\mu $. \par Let $f:X\to \er $ be a continuous affine function. Then $f-f(0)$ is odd, thus there is $x\in E$ such that $f(x^*)-f(0)=x^*(x)$ for each $x^*\in X$. Hence $$\nu (f)=\nu (f(0))+\nu (f-f(0))=f(0)+\mu (f-f(0))=f(0)+x^*(x)=f(x^*),$$ therefore $\nu $ represents $x^*$. \par Finally, if $\mu $ is boundary, then both $|\mu |$ and $\mu ^+$ are boundary, hence $\nu $ is maximal.

END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 (a) Let $\lambda $ denote the normalized Lebesgue measure on $[0,2\pi ]$ and $\lambda \times \mu $ the product measure on $[0,2\pi ]\times X$. Set $h(t,x)=e^{-it}$. Then $h$ is a bounded continuous function on $[0,2\pi ]\times X$, hence we can set $\nu _1=h\cdot (\lambda \times \mu )$ to be the measure on $[0,2\pi ]\times X$ with the density $h$ with respect to $\lambda \times \mu $. Further, consider the mapping $\varphi :[0,2\pi ]\times X\to X$ defined by $\varphi (t,x)=e^{it}x$. This mapping is clearly continuous, thus the image of the product measure $\nu _2=\varphi (\nu _1)$ is a well-defined Radon measure on $X$. Then for any $A\subset X$ Borel we have $$\begin {aligned} \nu _2(A)&=\nu _1(\varphi ^{-1}(A))=\nu _1(\{(t,x)\setsep e^{it}x\in A\})= \nu _1(\{(t,e^{-it}x)\setsep t\in [0,2\pi ],x\in A\}) \\&=\int _{\{(t,e^{-it}x)\setsep t\in [0,2\pi ],x\in A\}} e^{-it}\di (\lambda \times \mu ) =\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi }e^{-it}\mu (e^{-it}A)\di t. \end {aligned}$$ This shows that the formula in the statement of (a) defines the measure $\nu _2$. To show $\nu _2=\hom \mu $ it is enough to prove that $\nu _2(f)=\mu (\hom f)$ for any $f\in \C (X,\ce )$. So, fix $f\in \C (X,\ce )$. Then $$\begin {aligned} \mu (\hom f) &=\int _X\left (\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi }e^{-it}f(e^{it} x)\di t\right )\di \mu =\int _{[0,2\pi ]\times X} e^{-it}f(e^{it} x) \di (\lambda \times \mu )(t,x) \\&=\int _{[0,2\pi ]\times X}f(e^{it} x) \di \nu _1(t,x) =\int _{[0,2\pi ]\times X}f(\varphi (t,x)) \di \nu _1(t,x) =\int _X f\di \nu _2, \end {aligned}$$ which completes the proof. \par The assertions (b) and (c) follow immediately from the formula in (a). The assertion (d) follows from the formula in (a) since the computation of $\mu (\hom f)$ can be repeated for any bounded Borel function $f$. \par (e) For the proof see \cite [Lemma 4.2]{effros} or \cite [\S \,23, Lemma 10]{lacey}.

END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 The assertions (a) and (b) are obvious. To show (c) it is enough to observe that $x\mapsto \int y^*(x)\di \mu (y^*)$ defines a linear functional on $E$ of norm at most equal to $\|\mu \|$. \par (d) If $\mu =0$ take $\nu =\frac 12(\ep _{y^*}+\ep _{-y^*})$ where $y^*$ is an extreme point of $X$. \par Let $\mu \ne 0$. Then the absolute variation $\abs {\mu }$ is invariant with respect to rotations, i.e., $\abs {\mu }(\alpha A)=\abs {\mu }(A)$ for any $A\subset X$ Borel and $\alpha \in \ce $ with $\abs {\alpha }=1$. Let $h_0$ be a Borel function on $X$ such that $\mu =h_0\abs {\mu }$ (i.e., $h_0$ is the density of $\mu $ with respect to $\abs {\mu }$). Then $\abs {h_0}=1$ $\abs {\mu }$-almost everywhere. Observe that without loss of generality we may suppose that $h_0$ is Baire measurable. Indeed, by the Luzin theorem there is a sequence $(f_n)$ of continuous functions converging $\abs {\mu }$-almost everywhere to $h_0$. Then the function $h_1$ defined by $$h_1(y^*)=\begin {cases}\lim f_n(y^*) &\mbox {if the limit exists},\\ 0 &\mbox {otherwise},\end {cases}$$ is a Baire measurable function which equals $h_0$ $\abs {\mu }$-almost everywhere. Further, define the function $h$ by the formula $$ h(y^*)=\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi }e^{-it}h_1(e^{-it}y^*)\di t,\quad y^*\in X. $$ Then $h$ is also Baire measurable (by Lemma~\ref {L:baire} and Lemma~\ref {l:hom}(c)). Moreover, $h(\alpha y^*)=\ov {\alpha }h(y^*)$ for any $y^*\in X$ and any complex unit $\alpha $. Finally, $h=h_1$ $\abs {\mu }$-almost everywhere since $h$ is also a density of $\mu $ with respect to $\abs {\mu }$. Indeed, for any Borel set $A\subset X$ we have $$\begin {aligned} \mu (A)&=\hom \mu (A)=\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi }e^{-it}\mu (e^{-it}A) \di t \\&=\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi }e^{-it}\int _{e^{-it}A} h_1(y^*)\di \abs {\mu }(y^*) \di t \\&=\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi }e^{-it}\int _{A} h_1(e^{-it}y^*)\di \abs {\mu }(y^*) \di t \\&=\int _{A}\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi }e^{-it}h_1(e^{-it}y^*) \di t\di \abs {\mu }(y^*) =\int _A h(y^*)\di \abs {\mu }(y^*). \end {aligned}$$ Set $X_1=\{y^*\in X\setsep \abs {h(y^*)}=1\}$ and $X_0=X\setminus X_1$. Then $X_0$ and $X_1$ are Baire subsets of $X$, $0\in X_0$ (since $h(0)=0$) and $X_0$ has $\abs {\mu }$-measure zero. Further, set $P=\{y^*\in X\setsep h(y^*)=1\}$. Then $P$ is a Baire subset of $X$ and the mapping $\Phi :[0,2\pi )\times P\to X_1$ defined by $\Phi (t,y^*)=e^{it}y^*$ is a continuous bijection. Since the product space $Z=[0,2\pi )\times P$ is a Baire subset of the compact space $[0,2\pi ]\times X$, $\Phi $ maps Baire sets in $Z$ to Baire sets of $X_1$. (Indeed, let $A\subset Z$ be a Baire set. Then both $A$ and $Z\setminus A$ are $K$-analytic, hence $\Phi (A)$ and $\Phi (Z\setminus A)$ are two disjoint $K$-analytic subsets of $X_1$ covering $X_1$, hence they are Baire sets, see \cite [Theorems 4.10 and 5.8]{frolikcmj}.) \par Therefore we can define measure $\nu _1$ as $\nu _1=\Phi ^{-1}(\abs {\mu })$. Then $\nu _1$ is a positive measure defined on the Baire $\sigma $-algebra of $Z$. Further, define $\nu _2=\pi _2(\nu _1)$, where $\pi _2$ is the projection of $Z=[0,2\pi )\times P$ onto the second coordinate. Then $\nu _2$ is a positive measure defined on the Baire $\sigma $-algebra of $P$. Since $P$ is a Baire subset of $X$, we can consider $\nu _2$ to be defined on the Baire $\sigma $-algebra of $X$ (and supported by $P$). Therefore $\nu _2$ generates a positive functional on $\C (X,\ce )$. Since $$\norm {\nu _2}=\nu _2(1)=\nu _2(P)=\nu _1(Z)=\abs {\mu }(X_1)=\norm {\mu },$$ we have $\norm {\nu _2}\le 1$. Moreover, if $f\in \C (X,\ce )$ is homogeneous, then $$\begin {aligned} \int _X f(y^*)\di \nu _2(y^*)&=\int _P f(y^*)\di \nu _2(y^*) =\int _Z f(y^*)\di \nu _1(t,y^*) =\int _Z e^{-it}f(e^{it}y^*)\di \nu _1(t,y^*) \\&=\int _Z h(e^{it}y^*) f(e^{it}y^*)\di \nu _1(t,y^*) =\int _{X_1} h(z^*)f(z^*)\di \abs {\mu }(z^*) \\&=\int _{X} h(z^*)f(z^*)\di \abs {\mu }(z^*) =\int _{X}f(z^*)\di {\mu }(z^*). \end {aligned}$$ The first equality holds because $\nu _2$ is supported by $P$, the second one follows from the fact that $\nu _2=\pi _2(\nu _1)$. The third is valid since $f$ is homogeneous. In the fourth one we used the properties of $h$: $h(e^{it}y^*)=e^{-it}h(y^*)=e^{-it}$ for $y^*\in P$. The fifth inequality follows from the fact that $\nu _1=\Phi ^{-1}(\abs {\mu })$, in the sixth one we used that $\abs {\mu }$ is supported by $X_1$ and, finally, the last one follows from the choice of $h$. Hence, for any $f\in \C (X,\ce )$ we have $$\hom \nu _2(f)=\nu _2(\hom f)=\mu (\hom f)=\mu (f),$$ hence $\hom \nu _2=\mu $. \par Set $\nu =\nu _2+ \frac {1-\norm {\nu _2}}{\norm {\mu }}\abs {\mu }$. Then $\nu $ is a probability measure and $\hom \nu =\mu $ (since $\hom \abs {\mu }=0$). We continue by showing that $\nu $ represents $x^*$. Let $f$ be an affine continuous function on $X$. By Lemma~\ref {l:homaff}, there are $u,v$ homogeneous affine continuous functions from $X$ to $\ce $ such that $f=f(0)+u+\ov {v}$. Since $u$ and $v$ are given by evaluation at some points of $E$, we get $$\nu (f)=\nu (f(0)+u+\ov {v})=f(0)+\nu (u)+\ov {\nu (v)}=f(0)+u(x^*)+\ov {v(x^*)}=f(x^*).$$ \par It remains to show that $\nu $ is maximal whenever $\mu $ is boundary. Since $\nu $ is a probability and $\abs {\mu }$ is a boundary measure, it is enough to check that $\nu _2$ is boundary. We will do that by the test using convex continuous functions. For a real-valued continuous convex function $f$ on $X$ set $$\hat {f}(y^*)=\sup \{\sigma (f)\setsep \sigma \in \M ^1(X), r(\sigma )=y^*\}, \quad y^*\in X,$$ and $$B(f)=\{y^*\in X\setsep f(y^*)=\hat {f}(y^*)\}.$$ Then boundary measures are exactly the measures supported by each $B(f)$ (see \cite [p. 34--35]{alfsen}). So, let $f$ be any real-valued continuous convex function on $X$. Set $$g(y^*)=\frac 1{2\pi }\int _0^{2\pi } f(e^{it}y^*)\di t, \quad y^*\in X.$$ Then $g$ is again a continuous convex function and, moreover, $B(g)\subset B(f)$ by \cite [Lemma 4.1]{effros}. Hence $\abs {\mu }(X\setminus B(g))=0$. Since $X\setminus B(g)$ is homogeneous, by the definition of $\nu _2$ we get $\nu _2(X\setminus B(g))=\abs {\mu }(X\setminus B(g))=0$. Hence $\nu _2$ is supported by $B(g)$ and, a fortiori, by $B(f)$. This completes the proof.

END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Example~\ref {E:cap}] Since $E$ is reflexive, the unit ball $B_E$ is weakly compact. By the Namioka theorem (see e.g. \cite [Corollary 14.4]{hhz}), the function $f$ (which is the identity from $X=(B_E,w)$ to $E$ equipped with the norm) has a dense (in fact residual) set of continuity points. The same is true for the restriction of $f$ to any closed subset of $X$. Since $E$ is separable, $X$ is moreover metrizable, thus $f$ is $F_\sigma $-measurable by \cite [\S 31, X, Theorem 2]{kuratowski}. This implies that $f\in \C _1(X,B_E)$ by Lemma~\ref {L:baire}(c). \par Suppose that $f\in \bigcup _{\alpha <\omega _1}\fra _\alpha (X,E)$. Since $f$ is odd (homogeneous), we get $f\in \bigcup _{\alpha <\omega _1}\fra _{\odd ,\alpha }(X,E)$ by Lemma~\ref {l:odd} ($f\in \bigcup _{\alpha <\omega _1}\fra _{\hom ,\alpha }(X,E)$ by Lemma~\ref {l:hom}). Let $I$ denote the identity operator on $E$. Using Lemma~\ref {l:operator} we then get $I\in \bigcup _{\alpha <\omega _1}(K(E))_\alpha $, where the notation $(K(E))_\alpha $ follows the pattern from the Section~\ref {ssec:baire}. (Indeed, a linear operator $L:E\to E$ is weak-to-norm continuous on $B_E$ if and only if it is compact.) To finish the argument it is enough to check that all the operators from $\bigcup _{\alpha <\omega _1}(K(E))_\alpha $ are bounded and are contained in the closure of $K(E)$ in the topology of uniform convergence on norm compact subsets of $E$. This will be done by transfinite induction. For $\alpha =0$ it is clear. Let $\alpha >0$ and suppose that the assertion is valid for each operator in $\bigcup _{\beta <\alpha }(K(E))_\beta $. Fix $L\in (K(E))_\alpha $. Then there is a sequence $(L_n)$ in $\bigcup _{\beta <\alpha }(K(E))_\beta $ pointwise converging to $L$. By the induction hypothesis the operators $L_n$ are bounded, hence the uniform boundedness principle shows that the sequence $(L_n)$ is uniformly bounded. Thus $L$ is bounded and, moreover, $L_n\to L$ uniformly on compact sets.

 (i) Let $\boldsymbol x^{**}\in (E^{**})^n$.

BEGIN Lemma 4.3  
 \label {L:mok-fin} Let $X$ be a compact convex set, $F$ be a finite-dimensional Banach space and $f:X\to F$ be an affine function which belongs to $\C _1(X,F)$ and satisfies $\norm {f(x)}_F\le 1$ for each $x\in X$. Then $f\in \fra _1(X,B_F)$.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Without loss of generality we may suppose that $F$ is a real space. Since $F$ has finite dimension, it easily follows from the Mokobodzki theorem that $f\in \fra _1(X,F)$. Let $E=\fra (X)$. For any $x\in X$ let $\ep _x\in E^*$ be the respective evaluation functional. By \cite [Lemma 2.2]{affperf} there is a unique linear operator $L_f:E^*\to F$ such that $L_f(\ep _x)=f(x)$ for each $x\in X$. If follows from \cite [Lemma 2.3]{affperf} that $\norm {L_f}\le 1$ and $L_f\r _{B_{E^*}}\in \fra _1((B_{E^*},w^*),F)$. The Banach-Dieudonn\'e theorem easily yields that $L_f\in \fra _1((E^*,w^*),F)$. \par Let $H$ denote the subspace of $L(E^*,F)$ formed by the weak$^*$ continuous operators. By Lemma~\ref {L:locref}(iv) the bidual $H^{**}$ can be canonically identified with $L(E^*,F)$. Hence, in this identification we have $L_f\in H^{**}$ and, moreover, $L_f$ is the weak$^*$-limit of a sequence from $H$. Since $\|L_f\|\le 1$, it follows from \cite [Remark on p. 379]{odro} that $L_f$ is the weak$^*$-limit of a sequence from $B_H$. But this means that $L_f\in \fra _1((E^*,w^*),B_F)$, hence $f\in \fra _1(X,B_F)$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem~\ref {T:bap}] It is enough to prove the `moreover' part since any affine mapping $f\in \C _1(X,E)$ is bounded by Theorem~\ref {T:c1sa} and Lemma~\ref {4.3}. \par Suppose that $E$ has the $\lambda $-bounded approximation property for some $\lambda \ge 1$. Let $f:X\to E$ be an affine mapping of the first Baire class such that $f(X)\subset B_E$. Observe that $f(X)$ is separable and fix a countable dense subset $C\subset f(X)$. The $\lambda $-bounded approximation property yields a sequence $(L_n)$ of finite-rank operators pointwise converging to the identity on $C$ such that $\norm {L_n}\le \lambda $ for each $n$. It follows that $L_n$ converge to the identity also pointwise on $f(X)$. Then $L_n\circ f$ is also affine and of the first Baire class. Moreover, since the range has finite dimension and $(L_n\circ f)(X)\subset \lambda B_E$, Lemma~\ref {L:mok-fin} yields $L_n\circ f\in \fra _1(X,\lambda B_E)$. Finally, $L_n\circ f\to f$ pointwise, we get $f\in \fra _2(X,\lambda B_E)$. Finally, Corollary~\ref {C:c21} yields $f\in \fra _1(X,\lambda B_E)$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 4.4  
 Similar problems are investigated in \cite {MeSta}. In particular, Theorem 2.12 in the quoted paper is a weaker variant of our Theorem~\ref {T:bap}. However, the proof given in \cite {MeSta} contains a gap. The authors confuse a projection on a one-dimensional space with a coordinate functional. Therefore, it is not clear why the family of operators $(T_{n,m})$ defined on p.\ 25 should be uniformly bounded. The correct estimate is $\norm {T_{n,m}}\le 2Kn\norm {T}$ which is not a uniform bound. The same type of a gap is in Remark 2.18.1 and in the proof of Theorem 2.19. These results can be repaired and improved using our Lemma~\ref {L:mok-fin}.

BEGIN Lemma 5.1  
 \label {l:te-sa} \^^M\begin {itemize} \item [(S)] Let $X$ be a simplex. Then the mapping $T:x\mapsto \delta _x$ is strongly affine. \item [(R,C)] Let $X=(B_{E^*},w^*)$ for an $L^1$-predual $E$. Then $T$ is strongly affine. \end {itemize}
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 (S) It is clear that the mapping is affine. (Indeed, if $x,y\in X$ and $t\in [0,1]$, then $t\delta _x+(1-t)\delta _y$ is a probability measure with barycenter $tx+(1-t)y$. Since maximal probabilities form a convex set (by \cite [Theorem 3.70]{lmns}), necessarily $t\delta _x+(1-t)\delta _y=\delta _{tx+(1-t)y}$.) To prove that it is strongly affine, by Fact~\ref {fact1} it is enough to prove that $x\mapsto \delta _x(f)$ is strongly affine for each $f:X\to \er $ continuous. Since differences of convex continuous functions are norm-dense in $\C (X,\er )$ by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, it is enough to prove it for convex continuous functions. But if $f$ is convex and continuous, then the mapping $x\mapsto \delta _x(f)$ is upper semicontinuous by \cite [Theorem II.3.7]{alfsen}, hence it is strongly affine by \cite [Proposition A.122 and Theorem 4.21]{lmns}. \par (R) The proof in this case is completely analogous to the case (S), we only need to use \cite [Chapter 7, \S 21, Theorem 7]{lacey} to show that $Tf$ is a difference of two upper semicontinuous functions whenever $f$ is continuous and convex. \par (C) The assertion for complex $L^1$-preduals is proved in \cite [Lemma~4.12]{petracek-spurny}.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma 5.2  
 \label {l:bauer} If $\ext X$ is closed, then $T$ is continuous.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 (S) The mapping $r:\M ^1(X)\to X$ which assigns to each $\mu \in \M ^1(X)$ its barycenter $r(\mu )$ is clearly continuous (see, e.g., \cite [Proposition 3.40]{lmns}). Since $\ext X$ is compact, $\M ^1(\ext X)$ is a compact subset of $\M ^1(X)$. Moreover, maximal probabilities are exactly those supported by $\ext X$ (see, e.g., \cite [p. 35]{alfsen} or \cite [Proposition 3.80]{lmns}). By the simpliciality the operator $r$ restricted to $\M ^1(\ext X)$ is one-to-one, hence it is a homeomorphism. The operator $T$ is its inverse. \par (R) The proof is similar. Let $Y$ denote the set of all odd measures from $B_{\M (X,\er )}$ and $Y_b$ the set of all boundary measures from $Y$. For any $\mu \in Y$ let $u(\mu )$ denotes the point of $X$ provided by Lemma~\ref {l:odd-miry2}(b). It is clear that the operator $u$ is continuous and, by Fact~\ref {fact:L1}, the restriction of $u$ to $Y_b$ is one-to-one. The operator $T$ is the inverse of $u\r _{Y_b}$. To prove that $T$ is continuous it is enough to check that $Y_b$ is compact. But $Y_b$ is the image of the set of all maximal probabilities on $X$ under the continuous operator $\odd $ (by Lemma~\ref {l:odd-miry2}(c)) and maximal probabilities on $X$ are exactly the probabilities from the compact set $\M ^1(\ext X)$ (by \cite [Proposition 3.80]{lmns}). \par (C) The complex case is completely analogous to the real one. We just consider anti-homogeneous measures instead of odd ones and use Lemma~\ref {l:hom-miry2} instead of Lemma~\ref {l:odd-miry2}.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Theorem 5.3  
 \label {T:selekcelsc} Let $X$ be a compact convex set, $F$ a \fr space and $\Phi \colon X\to F$ a lower semicontinuous set-valued mapping with nonempty closed values. \begin {itemize} \item [(S)] If $X$ is a simplex and the graph of $\Phi $ is convex, $\Phi $ admits a continuous affine selection. \item [(R)] If $X=(B_{E^*},w^*)$, where $E$ is a real $L_1$-predual and the graph of $\Phi $ is convex and symmetric, $\Phi $ admits an odd continuous affine selection. \item [(C)] If $X=(B_{E^*},w^*)$, where $E$ is a complex $L_1$-predual, $F$ is complex and the graph of $\Phi $ is absolutely convex, $\Phi $ admits a homogeneous continuous affine selection. \end {itemize}
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem~\ref {T:dilation}] (S) This case is essentially due to \cite [Theorem 6.6]{lmnss03} (or \cite [Theorem 11.26]{lmns}). However, the formulation of these results is weaker and hence we give a complete proof here. Since $X$ is metrizable, $\fra (X,\er )$ is separable, hence we can choose a countable set $\{e_n\setsep n\in \en \}$ dense in $\fra (X,\er )$. \par Let $n\in \en $ be fixed. We define a multivalued mapping $\Gamma _n\colon X\to \M ^1(X)$ by the formula \[ \Gamma _n(x)=\{\mu \in \M ^1(X) \setsep \abs {\mu (e_i)-e_i(x)}<\frac 1n, i=1,\dots , n\},\quad x\in X. \] We claim that $\Gamma _n$ is a nonempty valued lower semicontinuous mapping with convex graph. First, $\Gamma _n(x)\ne \emptyset $ as $\ep _x\in \Gamma _n(x)$. Further, the graph of $\Gamma _n$ is equal to $$\{(x,\mu )\in X\times \M ^1(X)\setsep \abs {\mu (e_i)-e_i(x)}<\frac 1n, i=1,\dots , n\},$$ hence it is convex. \par We continue by showing that $\Gamma _n$ is lower semicontinuous. Let $V\subset \M ^1(X)$ be a nonempty open set and let $\Gamma _n(x)\cap V\neq \emptyset $ for some $x\in X$. We select $\mu \in V$ satisfying $\abs {\mu (e_i)-e_i(x)}<\frac 1n$ for each $i=1,\dots , n$. By the continuity of the functions $e_i$, $i=1,\dots ,n$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ satisfying \[ \abs {\mu (e_i)-e_i(y)}<\frac 1n,\quad y\in U, i=1,\dots ,n. \] Hence $\mu \in \Gamma _n(y)\cap V$ for $y\in U$, and thus the set \[ \{x\in X\setsep \Gamma _n(x)\cap V\neq \emptyset \} \] is open. This implies that $\Gamma _n$ is lower semicontinuous. \par Next we modify the mapping $\Gamma _n$ to have closed values. To this end we define a mapping $\ov {\Gamma }_n\colon X\to \M ^1(X)$ as \[ \ov {\Gamma }_n(x)=\ov {\Gamma _n(x)},\quad x\in X. \] Since, for an open set $V\subset \M ^1(X)$ and $x\in X$, $\ov {\Gamma }_n(x)$ intersects $V$ if and only if $\Gamma _n(x)$ intersects $V$, $\ov {\Gamma }_n$ is also lower semicontinuous. Moreover, it is clear that the graph of $\ov {\Gamma }_n$ convex. \par Now we want to use the selection result contained in Theorem~\ref {T:selekcelsc}. This is possible since $\M ^1(X)$, being a compact convex metrizable set, is affinely homeomorphic to a subset of $\ell _2$. Hence there exists a continuous affine selection $T_n$ from $\ov {\Gamma }_n$. \par We continue by showing that $T_n\to T$ on $\ext X$. Fix $x\in \ext X$. Let $\mu $ be any cluster point of the sequence $(T_n(x))$ in $\M ^1(X)$. By the very definition of $\Gamma _n$ and $\ov {\Gamma }_n$, $\mu (e_i)=e_i(x)$ for $i\in \en $. By the density of the sequence $(e_i)$ in $\fra (X,\er )$ we get that $\mu (e)=e(x)$ for all $e\in \fra (X,\er )$, i.e., $r(\mu )=x$. Since $x$ is an extreme point of $X$, necessarily $\mu =\ep _{x}=\delta _x$. It follows that $T_n(x)\to \delta _x$. \par \par Finally, we will prove that $T_n\to T$ on $X$. Fix any $x\in X$ and $f\in C(X,\er )$. Then $$\delta _x(f)=\int _X \delta _y(f)\di \delta _x(y)=\lim _{n\to \infty } \int _X T_n(y)(f)\di \delta _x(y)=\lim _{n\to \infty } T_n(x)(f).$$ The first equality follows by the strong affinity of $T$ (see Lemma~\ref {l:te-sa}). To verify the second one we use that $\delta _x$ is maximal, hence supported by $\ext X$ , the already proved fact that $T_n\to T$ on $\ext X$ and Theorem~\ref {T:dct}. The last one uses the fact that $T_n$ is affine and continuous. \par (R) The construction of the sequence $(T_n)$ is analogous, we indicate the differences. First, $\{e_n\setsep n\in \en \}$ will be a dense subset of $E$. Further, $\M ^1(X)$ will be everywhere replaced by the set $Y=\{\mu \in \M (X)\setsep \mu \mbox { is odd and }\norm {\mu }\le 1\}$. Then $Y$ is a compact convex symmetric set. The mappings $\Gamma _n$ and $\ov {\Gamma }_n$ will be defined in the same way. They are lower semicontinuous for the same reason and, moreover, their graphs are convex and symmetric. Using Theorem~\ref {T:selekcelsc} we obtain a continuous odd affine selection $T_n$ from $\ov {\Gamma }_n$. \par We continue by showing that $T_n\to T$ on $\ext X$. Fix $x\in \ext X$. Let $\mu $ be any cluster point of the sequence $(T_n(x))$ in $Y$. By the very definition of $\Gamma _n$ and $\ov {\Gamma }_n$, $\mu (e_i)=x(e_i)$ for $i\in \en $. By density of the sequence $(e_i)$ in $E$ we get that $\mu (e)=x(e)$ for all $e\in E$. It follows from Lemma~\ref {l:odd-miry2} that there is a probability measure $\nu $ representing $x$ such that $\odd \nu =\mu $. Since $x$ is an extreme point of $X$, necessarily $\nu =\ep _{x}$ and it is maximal, thus $\mu =T(x)$. It follows that $T_n(x)\to T(x)$. \par Finally, we will prove that $T_n\to T$ on $X$. Fix any $x\in X$ and $f\in C(X,\er )$. Let $\sigma $ be a maximal probability representing $x$. Then $$T(x)(f)=\int _X T(y)(f)\di \sigma (y)=\lim _{n\to \infty } \int _X T_n(y)(f)\di \sigma (y)=\lim _{n\to \infty } T_n(x)(f).$$ The first equality follows by the strong affinity of $T$ (see Lemma~\ref {l:te-sa}). To verify the second one we use that $\sigma $ is maximal, hence supported by $\ext X$, the already proved fact that $T_n\to T$ on $\ext X$ and Theorem~\ref {T:dct}. The last one uses the fact that $T_n$ is affine and continuous. \par \par (C) The proof in the complex case is completely analogous to the real case. Instead of the set of odd measures we consider the set of anti-homogeneous measures. If we define $\Gamma _n$ and $\ov {\Gamma }_n$ by the same formula, their graphs are clearly absolutely convex and we can find a homogeneous affine continuous selection $T_n$ of $\ov {\Gamma }_n$. The proof that $T_n\to T$ is analogous to the real case, we just use Lemma~\ref {l:hom-miry2}.

END Example
 
BEGIN Proof 
 We will use the well-known construction of `porcupine simplices' which was used for example in \cite {kalenda-bpms}. Let $A\subset [0,1]$ be an uncountable set. Let $$K=([0,1]\times \{0\})\cup (A\times \{-1,1\})$$ equipped with the following topology. The points from $A\times \{-1,1\}$ are isolated and a basis of neighborhoods of a point $(x,0)\in [0,1]\times \{0\}$ is formed by the sets of the form $$(U\times \{-1,0,1\})\cap K \setminus \{(x,1),(x,-1)\},$$ where $U$ is a standard neighborhood of $x$ in $[0,1]$. Then $K$ is a compact space. Let $$\A =\{f\in \C (K,\er )\setsep f(x,0)=\frac 12(f(x,-1)+f(x,1))\mbox { for each }x\in A\}$$ and let $X=\{\xi \in \A ^*\setsep \|\xi \|=1\ \&\ \xi (1)=1\}$ be equipped with the weak$^*$ topology. Then $X$ is a simplex. Moreover, $K$ canonically homeomorphically embeds into $X$ (as evaluation mappings), in this way $\ext X$ is identified with $((K\setminus A)\times \{0\})\cup (A\times \{-1,1\})$ . \par The assertion (b) is valid for any such $X$ by \cite [Theorem 1]{kalenda-bpms}. If we take $A=[0,1]$, then $\ext X$ is uncountable discrete (see \cite [Theorem 4]{kalenda-bpms}); and there is an uncountable $A$ such that $\ext X$ is Lindel\"of (by \cite [Theorem 2]{kalenda-bpms} it is enough if $A$ contains no uncountable compact subset, cf. \cite [p. 69]{kalenda-bpms}). \par Finally, we will prove that (c) is valid for any $X$ of the described form. We consider $K$ canonically embedded in $X$. For any $a\in A$ set $f_a=\chi _{\{(a,1)\}}-\chi _{\{(a,-1)\}}$. Then $f_a\in \A $. Let us define two sets in $X$ by the formula: $$\begin {aligned} U&=\{\xi \in X\setsep \exists a\in A: \xi (f_a)>\frac 12\},\\ H&=\{\xi \in X\setsep \forall a\in A: \xi (f_a)\ge -\frac 12\}. \end {aligned}$$ Then $U$ is open and $H$ is closed. Moreover, clearly $A\times \{1\}\subset U$ and $H\cap ( A\times \{-1\})=\emptyset $. Further, $U\subset H$. Indeed, pick any $\xi \in U$ and fix $a\in A$ such that $\xi (f_a)>\frac 12$. Fix any $b\in A$. We will show that $\xi (f_b)\ge -\frac 12$. If $b=a$ the inequality is obvious. So, suppose $b\ne a$. Since the function $f_a-f_b$ belongs to $\A $ and has norm one, we have $$1\ge \xi (f_a-f_b)=\xi (f_a)-\xi (f_b)>\frac 12-\xi (f_b)$$ and the inequality follows. \par Now consider the following system of mappings $$\F =\{S\colon X\to \M ^1(X)\setsep \{a\in A\setsep S(a,-1)(H)<S(a,0)(U)\}\mbox { is countable}\}.$$ \par First observe that $\F $ contains all continuous mappings. Indeed, suppose that $S$ is continuous. Fix any $q\in \qe $ and set $$M_q= \{a\in A\setsep S(a,-1)(H)<q<S(a,0)(U)\}.$$ Given $a\in M_q$, we have $S(a,0)(U)>q$. Since $U$ is open, the mapping $\mu \mapsto \mu (U)$ is lower semicontinuous on $\M ^1(X)$, hence the set $\{\mu \in \M ^1(X)\setsep \mu (U)>q\}$ is open. Therefore there is a neighborhood $W$ of $a$ in $[0,1]$ such that for any $x\in (W\times \{-1,0,1\})\cap K\setminus \{(a,-1),(a,1)\}$ we have $S(x)(U)>q$. In particular, $W\cap M_q=\{a\}$ (recall that $H\supset U$ and so $S(b,-1)(H)>q$ for $b\in W\setminus \{a\}$). It follows that each point of $M_q$ is isolated, hence $M_q$ is countable. Therefore $\bigcup _{q\in \qe }M_q$ is countable as well, hence $S\in \F $. \par Further observe that $\F $ is closed with respect to pointwise limits of sequences. Let $(S_n)$ be a sequence in $\F $ pointwise converging to a mapping $S$. By the definition of the system $\F $ there is a countable set $C\subset A$ such that $S_n(a,-1)(H)\ge S_n(a,0)(U)$ for each $n\in \en $ and each $a\in A\setminus C$. We will show that $S(a,-1)(H)\ge S(a,0)(U)$ for $a\in A\setminus C$ as well. So, fix $a\in A\setminus C$ and suppose that $S(a,-1)(H) < S(a,0)(U)$. Fix a number $q$ such that $S(a,-1)(H) < q < S(a,0)(U)$. Since $S_n(a,0)\to S(a,0)$ and $U$ is open, we can find $n_0\in \en $ such that for each $n\ge n_0$ we have $S_n(a,0)(U)>q$. Since $a\in A\setminus C$, we get (for $n\ge n_0$) $S_n(a,-1)(H)\ge S_n(a,0)>q$. Since $H$ is closed and $S_n(a,-1)\to S(a,-1)$, we get $S(a,-1)(H)\ge q$, a contradiction. \par We conclude that $\bigcup _{\alpha <\omega _1}\C _\alpha (X,\M ^1(X))\subset \F $. Finally, the mapping $T$ does not belong to $\F $, since for any $a\in A$ we have $$\begin {aligned} T(a,0)(U)&=\delta _{(a,0)}(U)=\frac 12(\ep _{(a,1)}(U)+\ep _{(a,-1)}(U))=\frac 12,\\ T(a,-1)(H)&=\delta _{(a,-1)}(H)=\ep _{(a,-1)}(H)=0. \end {aligned}$$

BEGIN Lemma 6.1  
 \label {L:fra-0} Using the above notation, the following assertions hold. \begin {itemize} \item [(i)] If $U$ and $f$ are continuous, then $Uf$ is continuous as well. \item [(ii)] If $U$ is strongly affine, then $Uf$ is strongly affine as well. \item [(iii)] If $U\in \fra _\alpha (X,B_{\M (X,\ef )})$ and $f\in \C _\beta (X,F)$ is a bounded mapping, then $Uf\in \fra _{\alpha +\beta }(X,\ov {\aco } f(X))$. \end {itemize}
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 (i) Since $f$ is continuous, $f(X)$ is a compact subset of $F$. Thus $L=\ov {\aco } f(X)$ is an absolutely convex compact subset of $F$ (see, e.g., \cite [Proposition 6.7.2]{jarchow}). By Lemma~\ref {L:norma}(c), $Uf(X)\subset L$. We need to show that $Uf$ is continuous. To this end, let $\tau \in F^*$ be given. Then \[ \tau (Uf(x))=\tau \left (\int _{X} f\di U(x)\right )=\int _{X} \tau \circ f\di U(x)=U(x)(\tau \circ f), \quad x\in X. \] Since $U$ is continuous and $\tau \circ f\in \C (X,\ef )$, the mapping $x\mapsto U(x)(\tau \circ f)$ is a continuous function on $X$. Thus $Uf\colon X\to (L,\text {weak})$ is continuous. Since $L$ is compact, the original topology of $F$ coincides on $L$ with the weak topology. Hence $Uf\in \C (X,L)$. \par (ii) Let us first suppose that $f$ is continuous. Let $\mu $ be any Radon probability on $X$. Then for any $\tau \in F^*$ we have $$ \begin {aligned} \int _X \tau (Uf(x))\di \mu (x)&= \int _X \tau (\int _X f \di U(x))\di \mu (x) =\int _X \int _X \tau \circ f \di U(x) \di \mu (x) \\&=\int _X U(x)(\tau \circ f)\di \mu (x) = U(r(\mu ))(\tau \circ f) =\int _X \tau \circ f\di U(r(\mu )) \\&=\tau (Uf(r(\mu ))).\end {aligned}$$ Thus $\tau \circ Uf$ is strongly affine for each $\tau \in F^*$, so $Uf$ is strongly affine by Fact~\ref {fact1}. \par The general case follows by transfinite induction on the class using Corollary~\ref {C:baire} and the following observation: If $(f_n)$ is a bounded sequence of Baire mappings pointwise converging to a mapping $f$, then for each $x\in X$ and each $\tau \in F^*$ we have $$\tau (Uf_n(x))=\int _X \tau \circ f_n\di U(x)\to \int _X \tau \circ f\di U(x)=\tau (Uf(x)).$$ \par (iii) Set $L=\ov {\aco } f(X)$. By Lemma~\ref {L:norma}(c) we have $Uf(X)\subset L$. \par Let us give the proof first for $\beta =0$, i.e., in case $f$ is continuous. The case $\alpha =0$ follows from (i) and (ii). We continue by transfinite induction. To proceed it is enough to observe that $U_n\to U$ pointwise on $X$ implies $U_nf\to Uf$ pointwise on $X$. So, suppose that $U_n\to U$ pointwise on $X$. Fix any $x\in X$. Then $U_n(x)\to U(x)$. For any $\tau \in F^*$ we have $$\tau (U_n f(x))=U_n(x)(\tau \circ f)\to U(x)(\tau \circ f)=\tau (Uf(x)).$$ Thus $U_nf(x)\to Uf(x)$ weakly in $F$. But since the sequence is contained in the compact set $L$, we deduce that $U_nf(x)\to Uf(x)$ in $F$.

BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem~\ref {T:aff-baire} in case $X$ is metrizable.] \par (S) Let $f$ be strongly affine and $f\in \C _\alpha (X,F)$. Then $f(x)=\delta _x(f)$ for each $x\in X$. Since the mapping $x\mapsto \delta _x$ belongs to $\fra _1(X,\M _1(X))$ by Theorem~\ref {T:dilation}, by Lemma~\ref {L:fra-0}(iii) we conclude that $f\in \fra _{1+\alpha }(X,F)$. \par (R) If $f$ is odd and strongly affine, then $f=Tf$. Since $T\in \fra _1(X,B_{\M _{\odd }(X,\er )})$ by Theorem~\ref {T:dilation}, we conclude by Lemma~\ref {L:fra-0}(iii) and Lemma~\ref {l:odd}(c). If $f$ is not odd, then $f=f(0)+(f-f(0))$. Since $f-f(0)$ is odd, we get $f-f(0)\in \fra _{\odd ,1+\alpha }(X,F)$, thus $f\in \fra _{1+\alpha }(X,F)$. \par (C) If $F$ is complex and $f$ is homogeneous and strongly affine, then $f=Tf$. Since $T\in \fra _1(X,B_{\M _{\ahom }(X,\ce )})$ by Theorem~\ref {T:dilation}, we conclude by Lemma~\ref {L:fra-0}(iii) and Lemma~\ref {l:homaff}(b). If $F$ is complex and $f$ is not homogeneous, then we can write $$f(x)=f(0)+u(x)+\ov {v(x)},\quad x\in X,$$ where $u$ and $v$ are homogeneous and strongly affine and, moreover, $u=\hom f$ (see Lemma~\ref {l:homaff}(a)). Then $u,v\in \C _\alpha (X,F)$ by Lemma~\ref {l:hom}(c), hence $u,v\in \fra _{\hom ,1+\alpha }(X,F)$. It follows that $f\in \fra _{1+\alpha }(X,F)$. Finally, if $F$ is a real \fr space, denote by $F_{\ce }$ its complexification. Then $F$ is a real-linear subspace of $F_{\ce }$, thus $f\in \C _\alpha (X,F_{\ce })$, so $f\in \fra _{1+\alpha }(X,F_{\ce })$. Since the canonical projection of $F_{\ce }$ onto $F$ is continuous and real-linear (hence affine), it is clear that $f\in \fra _{1+\alpha }(X,F)$. \par \smallskip \par Finally, consider the case $\alpha =1$. In all the cases we get as above by the use of Lemma~\ref {L:fra-0}(iii) that $f\in \fra _2(X,\ov {\aco f(X)})$. Hence, Corollary~\ref {C:c21} yields $f\in \fra _1(X,\ov {\aco f(X)})$.

 \label {selekce5} Let $E$ be a Banach space, $X\subset B_{E^*}$ a weak$^*$ compact convex set and $L$ be a convex subset of a \fr space $F$. Let $f\colon X\to L$ be a mapping of type $\C _\alpha (X,L)$ for some $\alpha \in [0,\omega _1)$. Then there exist a closed separable subspace $E_1\subset E$ and $g\colon \pi (X)\to L$ such that $g\in \C _\alpha (\pi (X),L)$ and $f=g\circ \pi $. (Here $\pi \colon E^*\to {E_1^*}$ denotes the restriction mapping.)
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Assume first that $\alpha =0$, i.e., that $f$ is continuous. Then $f(X)$ is a compact subset of $F$, hence it is a compact metrizable space. It follows that there is a homeomorphic injection $p\colon f(X)\to \er ^\en $. Further, since $X$ is equipped with the weak$^*$-topology, it can be canonically embedded into the cartesian product $\ef ^E$. The continuous mapping $p\circ f\colon X\to \er ^\en $ can be extended to a continuous mapping $g\colon \ef ^E\to \er ^\en $ (by \cite [Theorem 3.1.7]{engelking}). Further, by \cite [Theorem 4]{Ross-Stone} (see also \cite [Problem 2.7.12(d)]{engelking}) there is a countable set $C\subset E$ such that $$u,v\in \ef ^E, u\r _{C}=v\r _{C} \Rightarrow g(u)=g(v).$$ Hence we can take $E_1$ to be the closed linear span of $C$. Then $E_1$ is a closed separable subspace of $E$ and, moreover, $\pi (x_1^*)=\pi (x_2^*)$ for some $x_1^*,x_2^*\in X$ implies $(p\circ f)(x_1^*)=(p\circ f)(x_2^*)$, and so $f(x_1^*)=f(x_2^*)$. Thus there is a mapping $g:\pi (X)\to L$ with $f=g\circ \pi $. Since $f$ is continuous and $\pi $ is a closed continuous mapping, $g$ is continuous. \par Assume now that $\alpha \in (0,\omega _1)$ and $f\colon X\to L$ of type $\C _\alpha (X,L)$ is given. We select a countable family $\F =\{f_n\setsep n\in \en \}$ in $\C (X,L)$ such that $f\in \F _\alpha $. For each $n\in \en $ we find using the previous step a countable set $C_n\subset E$ such that for any $x_1^*,x_2^*\in X$ we have $$x_1^*\r _{C_n}=x_2^*\r _{C_n}\Rightarrow f_n(x_1^*)=f_n(x_2^*).$$ Let $E_1$ be the closed linear span of $\bigcup _n C_n$. Then there are mappings $g:\pi (X)\to L$ and $g_n:\pi (X)\to L$ for $n\in \en $ such that $f=g\circ \pi $ and $f_n=g_n\circ \pi $. Similarly as above $g_n$ are continuous and, moreover, it is easy to check by transfinite induction that $g\in \left (\{g_n:n\in \en \}\right )_\alpha $, thus $g\in \C _\alpha (\pi (X),L)$.

Then there exists a separable $L_1$-predual $E_2$ satisfying $E_1\subset E_2\subset E$. \end {itemize}
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 (S) In this proof we will denote by $\fra (X)$ the space $\fra (X,\er )$ and similarly for other compact convex sets. Let $f^*\colon \fra (X_1)\to \fra (X)$ denote the canonical isometric embedding defined by $f^*(u)=u\circ f$ for $u\in \fra (X_1)$. Let $E$ be a (for a while arbitrary) closed subspace of $\fra (X)$ containing $f^*(\fra (X_1))$. Denote by $\pi _2:\fra (X)^*\to E^*$ the canonical restriction map. Define $\pi _1:E^*\to \fra (X_1)^*$ by $\pi _1(x^*)(u)=x^*(f^*(u))$, $x^*\in E^*$, $u\in \fra (X_1)$. Further, let $\kappa _X:X\to \fra (X)^*$ be the canonical evaluation mapping, i.e., $\kappa _X(x)(u)=u(x)$ for $x\in X$ and $u\in \fra (X)$. Similarly, $\kappa _{X_1}$ denotes the analogous mapping for $X_1$. Set $X_2=\pi _2(\kappa _{X}(X))$, $f_2=\pi _2\circ \kappa _X$ and $f_1=(\kappa _{X_1})^{-1}\circ \pi _1\r _{X_2}$. Then $X_2$ is a compact convex set, and $f_1:X_2\to X_1$ and $f_2:X\to X_2$ are affine continuous surjections satisfying $f=f_1\circ f_2$. So, to complete the proof it is enough to choose $E$ in such a way that $X_2$ is a metrizable simplex. \par Observe that $E$ is canonically isometric to $\fra (X_2)$. More precisely, if we consider the isometric embedding $f_2^*\colon \fra (X_2)\to \fra (X)$ defined by $f_2^*(u)=u\circ f_2$ for $u\in \fra (X_2)$, then $E=f_2^*(\fra (X_2))$. Indeed, if $v\in E$, we define $u\in \fra (X_2)$ by $u(x^*)=x^*(v)$ for $x^*\in X_2$. Then for each $x\in X$ we have $$f_2^*(u)(x)=u(f_2(x))=f_2(x)(v)=\pi _2(\kappa _X(x))(v)=\kappa _X(x)(v)=v(x),$$ thus $v\in f_2^*(\fra (X_2))$. Conversely, let $u\in \fra (X_2)$. Then $f_2^*(u)=u\circ f_2\in \fra (X)$. If $u\circ f_2\notin E$, by the Hahn-Banach separation theorem there is $x^*\in \fra (X)^*$ such that $x^*\r _{E}=0$ and $x^*(u\circ f_2)\ne 0$. By \cite [Proposition 4.31(a,b)]{lmns} we have $x^*=c_1\kappa _X(x_1)-c_2\kappa _X(x_2)$ for some $x_1,x_2\in X$ and $c_1,c_2$ nonnegative real numbers. Since the space $E$ contains the constant functions, we get $c_1=c_2$. Hence without loss of generality $c_1=c_2=1$. Then we get $v(x_1)=v(x_2)$ for each $v\in E$. It follows that $\pi _2\circ \kappa _X(x_1)=\pi _2\circ \kappa _X(x_2)$, thus $f_2(x_1)=f_2(x_2)$. So, $$x^*(u\circ f_2)=(u\circ f_2)(x_1)-(u\circ f_2)(x_2)=0,$$ a contradiction. \par Hence, $X_2$ is metrizable provided $E$ is separable, and $X_2$ is a simplex provided $E$ satisfies the weak Riesz interpolation property (see \cite [Corollary II.3.11]{alfsen}). Recall that $E$ has the weak Riesz interpolation property if, whenever $u_1,u_2,v_1,v_2 \in E$ are such that $\max \{u_1,u_2\}<\min \{v_1,v_2\}$, then there is $w\in E$ with $\max \{u_1,u_2\}<w<\min \{v_1,v_2\}$. The inequalities are considered in the pointwise meaning. Further, it is clear that it is enough to check this property for $u_1,u_2,v_1,v_2$ belonging to a norm-dense subset of $E$. Thus we can construct $E$ by a standard inductive procedure: We construct countable sets $A_0\subset B_1\subset A_1\subset B_2\subset \cdots \fra (X)$ as follows: \begin {itemize} \item $A_0$ is a countable dense subset of $f^*(\fra (X_1))$. \item Whenever $u_1,u_2,v_1,v_2 \in A_{n-1}$ are such that $\max \{u_1,u_2\}<\min \{v_1,v_2\}$, then there is $w\in B_n$ with $\max \{u_1,u_2\}<w<\min \{v_1,v_2\}$. \item $A_n$ is the $\qe $-linear span of $B_n$. \end {itemize} Then we can set $E=\ov {\bigcup _n A_n}$. \par \par (R,C) This is proved in \cite [\S 23, Lemma 1]{lacey}.

If we apply Lemma~\ref {selekce5} to $\kappa _X(X)$ in place of $X$ and $f\circ \kappa _X^{-1}$ in place of $f$, we get a separable space $E_1\subset E$ and $g\in \C _\alpha (\pi (\kappa _X(X)),F)$ with $f\circ \kappa _X^{-1}=g\circ \pi $ (where $\pi :E^*\to E_1^*$ is the restriction mapping). Set $X_1=\pi (\kappa _X(X))$ and $h=\pi \circ \kappa _X$. Then $X_1$ is a metrizable compact convex set and $h$ is an affine continuous surjection of $X$ onto $X_1$.

Then $g\circ \pi _1\in \C _{\alpha }(B_{E_2^*},F)$. Moreover, $g\circ \pi _1$ is strongly affine by Lemma~\ref {perfectaff}.

 We will prove the result by transfinite induction on $\alpha $. Suppose first that $\alpha =1$, i.e., that $f\in \C _1(\ext X,F)$.

Let $z$ be an arbitrary element of $L$. Then the function \[ h(x)=\begin {cases} \lim _{n\to \infty } h_n(x),& x\in C,\\ z,& x\in X\setminus C, \end {cases} \] is the required extension.

Since $(\tau \circ f)^{-1}(U)=f^{-1}(\tau ^{-1}(U))$ for any $U\subset \ef $ and $F$, being separable, is hereditarily Lindel\"of in the weak topology, we get that $f$ is $\Sigma _{\alpha +1}^b$-measurable as a mapping from $K$ to the weak topology of $F$. It follows from Lemma~\ref {L:meas-0} that it is $\Sigma _{\alpha +2}^b(K)$-measurable as a mapping from $K$ to the original topology of $F$.

BEGIN Proof 
 Let us show first the uniqueness. Suppose that $g_1,g_2$ are two strongly affine mappings which coincide with $h$ on $\ext X$. Fix any $\tau \in F^*$. Then, for each $i=1,2$ the function $\tau \circ g_i$ is strongly affine and $\tau \circ g_i\r _{\ext X}$ is a Baire mapping (as it coincides with $h\r _{\ext X}$), hence $\tau \circ g_i$ is a Baire mapping by \cite [Theorem 5.2]{lusp}. In particular, the set $\{x\in X\setsep \tau (g_1(x))=\tau (g_2(x))\}$ is a Baire set containing $\ext X$. Given any $x\in X$ let $\mu $ be a maximal probability representing $x$. Then $\mu $ is carried by any Baire set containing $\ext X$, hence $\tau (g_1(x))=\mu (\tau \circ g_1)=\mu (\tau \circ g_2)=\tau (g_2(x))$. Hence $\tau \circ g_1=\tau \circ g_2$. Since $\tau \in F^*$ is arbitrary, we conclude $g_1=g_2$. \par Further, observe that any strongly affine mapping coinciding with $h$ on $\ext X$ is a Baire mapping. Indeed, let $g$ be such a mapping and suppose that $h\in \C _\alpha (X,F)$. Using \cite [Theorem 5.2]{lusp} as in the previous paragraph we get $\tau \circ g\in \C _{1+\alpha }(X,\ef )$ for each $\tau \in F^*$, hence $g\in \C _{1+\alpha +1}(X,F)$ by Lemma~\ref {L:meas}. In particular, $g$ is a Baire mapping. \par Finally, $Th$ is strongly affine by Lemma~\ref {l:te-sa} and Lemma~\ref {L:fra-0}(ii). To finish the proof it is enough to show that $Th$ coincides with $h$ on $\ext X$ and that it enjoys the appropriate symmetry in cases (R) and (C). The fact that $Th$ is a Baire mapping then follows from the previous paragraph. Hence distinguish the three cases: \par (S) For $x\in \ext X$ we have $Th(x)=\delta _x(h)=h(x)$ since $\delta _x$ is the Dirac measure supported at $x$. \par (R) To show that $g$ is odd it is enough to observe that $T$ is odd (if $x^*\in X$, then $-T(x^*)$ satisfies the conditions (a)--(d) from Fact~\ref {fact:L1} for $-x^*$). Further, for any $x^*\in \ext X$ we have $T(x^*)=\odd \ep _{x^*}$, hence $$Th(x^*)=\int _X h\di \odd \ep _{x^*}=\int _X\odd h\di \ep _{x^*}=\odd h(x^*)=h(x^*).$$ \par (C) This case is completely analogous to the case (R).

By Lemma~\ref {L:limita} we know that $Sf_n\to Sf$ pointwise whenever $(f_n)$ is a bounded sequence converging to $f$ pointwise on $\ext X$. The already proved case $\alpha =1$ shows that $Sf\in \fra _2(X,F)$ whenever $f\in \C _1(\ext X,F)$.

Since boundary measures are supported by $\ext X$, we have $$g(x)=\int _{\ext X} f\di T(x),\quad x\in X.$$ Suppose first that $\alpha =0$, i.e., $f$ is continuous. Then we can prove that $g$ is continuous by a minor modification of the proof of Lemma~\ref {L:fra-0}(i) with the help of Lemma~\ref {l:bauer}.

Fix a countable family $\F =\{f_n\setsep n\in \en \}\subset \C (K,L)$ such that $f\in (\F )_\alpha $. \par We define $\varphi \colon K\to F^\en $ by \[ \varphi (x)=(f_n(x))_{n=1}^\infty ,\quad x\in K. \] Then $\varphi $ is a continuous mapping of $K$ into $F^\en $. Further we set \[ \Gamma (x)=\begin {cases} \{\varphi (x)\}, & x\in K,\\ \ov {\co }\, \varphi (K),& x\in X\setminus K. \end {cases} \] Then $\Gamma $ is a lower semicontinuous mapping with closed values. Moreover, the graph of $\Gamma $ is convex. By Theorem~\ref {T:selekcelsc} there exists a continuous affine selection $\gamma \colon X\to F^\en $ of $\Gamma $. \par Let $h_n=\pi _n\circ \gamma $, $n\in \en $, where $\pi _n\colon F^\en \to F$ is the $n$-th projection mapping. Then $h_n$ are continuous affine mappings of $X$ into $F$ such that \[ h_n(x)=\pi _n(\gamma (x))=\pi _n(\varphi (x))=f_n(x),\quad x\in K. \] Further, for each $x\in X$ we choose some $r(x)\in H$ such that $h_n(x)=h_n(r(x))$ for each $n\in \en $. If $x\in H$ we set $r(x)=x$. If $x\in X \setminus H$, then $\gamma (x)\in \ov {\co }\,\varphi (K)=\ov {\co }\,\gamma (K)=\gamma (H)$, thus there exists an element $r(x)\in H$ such that $\gamma (x)=\gamma (r(x))$. \par Finally, we can construct the required extension by \begin {equation} \label {eq:rozsireni} \hat {f}(x)=\begin {cases} \delta _x(f), & x\in H,\\ \hat {f}(r(x)), & x\in X\setminus H.\end {cases}\end {equation} \par First, if $x\in H$, then $\delta _x$ is supported by $K$, thus $\hat {f}$ is well defined on $H$. Subsequently, $\hat {f}$ is extended to $X$ using the mapping $r$ fixed above. It is clear that $\hat {f}$ is an extension of $f$. Moreover, \begin {equation} \label {eq:fhat} \hat {f}\in \left (\{h_n\setsep n\in \en \}\right )_\alpha \subset \fra _{\alpha }(X,L).\end {equation} Indeed, the formula \eqref {eq:rozsireni} enables us to assign to each Borel function $g\colon K\to L$ its extension $\hat {g}\colon X\to L$. Note that $$\hat {f_n}=h_n \mbox { for }n\in \en .$$ Further, it follows from Theorem~\ref {T:dct} that $$g_k\to g\mbox { pointwise on }K\Rightarrow \hat {g_k}\to \hat {g}\mbox { pointwise on }X.$$ Hence it is easy to prove by transfinite induction on $\beta $ that $$g\in \left (\{f_n\setsep n\in \en \}\right )_\beta \Rightarrow \hat {g}\in \left (\{h_n\setsep n\in \en \}\right )_\beta ,$$ so, in particular, \eqref {eq:fhat} holds. \par \par (R) We assume that $K$ is moreover symmetric and $f$ is odd. We proceed in the same way. The sets $H$ and $L$ are convex and symmetric. The family $\F $ may consist of odd functions by Lemma~\ref {l:odd}. Then $\varphi $ is moreover odd and the graph of $\Gamma $ is convex and symmetric. Thus the selection $\gamma $ may be chosen to be moreover odd and the functions $h_n$ are odd as well. The formula for the extension is similar: $$\hat {f}(x)=\begin {cases} T(x)(f), & x\in H,\\ \hat {f}(r(x)), & x\in X\setminus H.\end {cases}$$ The rest of the proof is the same, we use the fact that $T(x)$ is supported by $K$ whenever $x\in H$. \par (C) The proof is completely analogous to the real case.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem~\ref {T:dirichlet} in case $\ext X$ is $F_\sigma $.] (S) It is enough to prove that $x\mapsto \delta _x(f)$ is in $\fra _1(X,F)$ for any bounded $f\in \C _1(\ext X,F)$. Hence choose any bounded $f\in \C _1(\ext X,F)$. Fix a bounded sequence of continuous functions $f_n:\ext X\to F$ pointwise converging to $f$ (this can be done by Corollary~\ref {C:baire}). Let $\ext X=\bigcup _n K_n$, where $(K_n)$ is an increasing sequence of compact sets. By Theorem~\ref {T:weakDP} there are affine continuous maps $h_n$ extending $f_n\r _{K_n}$. Then $h_n$ converge to $f$ pointwise on $\ext X$, thus for each $x\in X$ we have $$\delta _x(f)=\lim _{n\to \infty }\delta _{x}(h_n)=\lim _{n\to \infty } h_n(x).$$ This completes the proof. \par (R) The proof is analogous. Assume that $f$ is moreover odd. We can choose $f_n$ to be odd (Lemma~\ref {l:odd}) and $K_n$ to be symmetric. In the final computation we use $T(x)$ instead of $\delta _x$. \par (C) If $f$ is homogeneous, we can choose $f_n$ to be homogeneous by Lemma~\ref {l:hom}. Moreover, $K_n$ can be chosen to be homogeneous as well. Indeed, if $K$ is compact, then $\bigcup \{\alpha K\setsep \alpha \in \ce ,|\alpha |=1\}$ is compact as a continuous image of the compact set $K\times \{\alpha \in \ce \setsep |\alpha |=1\}$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Theorem 8.1  
 \label {T:weak2} Let $K$ be a compact subset of a completely regular space $Z$, $F$ be a \fr space and $f\colon K\to F$ be a bounded mapping in $\C _\alpha (K,F)$. Then there exists a mapping $h\colon Z\to F$ in $\C _\alpha (Z,F)$ extending $f$ such that $h(Z)\subset \overline {\co } f(K)$.
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $L=\ov {\aco } f(K)$. Let $\beta Z$ be the \v {C}ech-Stone compactification of $Z$ and $X=\M ^1(\beta Z)$. Then $X$ is a simplex and $\ext X$ is canonically identified with $\beta Z$. Hence $K$ is a compact subset of $\ext X$. Therefore the result follows from Theorem~\ref {T:weakDP}.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma 9.1  
 \label {L:sel-convex} Let $X$ be a compact convex set, $F$ be a \fr space over $\ef $ and $\Gamma \colon X\to F$ be an upper or lower semicontinuous mapping with closed values and convex graph, such that $\Gamma (X)$ is bounded. Let $f\colon X\to F$ be a Baire measurable selection from $\Gamma $. If $\mu \in \M ^1(X)$, then \[ \mu (f)\in \Gamma (r(\mu )). \]
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Since $f$ is Baire measurable, $\mu (f)$ is well defined by Lemma~\ref {L:integr-for-baire}. Set $x=r(\mu )$. Assuming $\mu (f)\notin \Gamma (x)$, $\Gamma (x)$, as a convex closed set, can by separated from $\mu (f)$ by some element from $F^*$, i.e., there exists $\tau \in F^*$ and $c\in \er $ such that \[ (\Re \tau )(\mu (f))>c>\sup (\Re \tau )(\Gamma (x)). \] Let \[ \varphi (y)=\sup (\Re \tau )(\Gamma (y)),\quad y\in X. \] Since the graph of $\Gamma $ is convex, $\varphi $ is a concave function on $X$. Moreover, if $\Gamma $ is upper semicontinuous, then $\varphi $ is upper semicontinuous; and if $\Gamma $ is lower semicontinuous, then $\varphi $ is lower semicontinuous. In both case we get by \cite [Proposition 4.7]{lmns} \[ c<(\Re \tau )(\mu (f))=\int _X (\Re \tau )(f(y))\di \mu (y)\le \int _X \varphi (y)\di \mu (y)\le \varphi (x)<c. \] This contradiction finishes the proof.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem~\ref {T:selekceusc}.] (S) By \cite [Theorem]{jaro82c} (which is an improved version of \cite [Theorem 2]{jaro82}) and Lemma~\ref {L:baire}(c) there is a selection $f$ from $\Gamma $ which belongs to $\C _1(X,F)$. Set $g(x)=\delta _x(f)$ for $x\in X$. By Theorem~\ref {T:dilation} and Lemma~\ref {L:fra-0}(iii) we have $g\in \fra _2(X,F)$ and by Lemma~\ref {L:sel-convex}, $g$ is a selection of $\Gamma $. \par (R) We proceed in the same way. We find a selection $f$ in $\C _1(X,F)$ and set $f_1=\odd f$. Observe that $f_1$ is still a selection from $\Gamma $. Indeed, if $x\in X$, then $(x,f(x))$ and $(-x,f(-x))$ belong to the graph of $\Gamma $. Since the graph of $\Gamma $ is symmetric, $(x,-f(-x))$ belongs there, too. By convexity we conclude that $(x,f_1(x))=(x,\odd f(x))$ belongs there as well. Further, set $g=Tf_1$. By Theorem~\ref {T:dilation} and Lemma~\ref {L:fra-0}(iii) we have $g\in \fra _2(X,F)$. Moreover, let $x\in X$ be arbitrary. Fix a maximal representing measure $\mu $ of $x$. Then $$g(x)=T(x)(f_1)=\odd \mu (f_1)= \mu (f_1)\in \Gamma (x)$$ by Lemmata~\ref {L:sel-convex} and~\ref {l:odd-miry}(d), hence $g$ is a selection from $\Gamma $. It remains to observe that $g$ is odd since $T$ is odd. \par (C) This case is analogous to the case (R). We find a selection $f$ in $\C _1(X,F)$ and set $f_1=\hom f$. Observe that $f_1$ is still a selection of $\Gamma $. Indeed, if $x\in X$ and $t\in [0,2\pi ]$, then $(e^{it}x,f(e^{it}x))$ belongs to the graph of $\Gamma $. Since the graph is homogeneous, it contains also $(x,e^{-it}f(e^{it}x))$, hence $e^{-it}f(e^{it}x)\in \Gamma (x)$. Since $\Gamma (x)$ is closed and convex, we get $f_1(x)=\hom f(x)\in \Gamma (x)$. The rest of the proof is the same as in case (R).
END Proof
 
BEGIN Example 9.2  
 \label {ex:selekce} There are simplices $X_1$, $X_2$ and upper semicontinuous mappings $\Gamma _i\colon X_i\to \er $ with closed values, bounded range and convex graph for $i=1,2$ such that the following assertions hold: \begin {itemize} \item [(i)] $X_1$ is metrizable and $\Gamma _1$ admits no affine Baire-one selection. \item [(ii)] $X_2$ is non-metrizable and $\Gamma _2$ admits no affine Borel selection. \end {itemize}
END Example
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $A\subset [0,1]$ be any subset. Let $K$, $\A $ and $X$ be defined as in Example~\ref {ex:dikobraz}. We again consider $K$ canonically embedded into $X$. Fix an arbitrary set $B\subset A$ and define two real-valued functions on $K$ by $u_0=\chi _{B\times \{1\}}$ and $v_0=\chi _{(B\times \{1\})\cup ([0,1]\times \{0\})}$. Then $u_0\le v_0$. We further define two functions on $X$ by the formulas $$\begin {aligned} u(x)&=\sup \{ h(x)\setsep h\in \fra (X,\er ), h\le u_0\mbox { on }K\}, \\ v(x)&=\inf \{ h(x)\setsep h\in \fra (X,\er ), h\ge v_0\mbox { on }K\}. \end {aligned}$$ Then $u$ is a lower semicontinuous convex function on $X$ and $v$ is an upper semicontinuous concave function on $X$. Moreover, clearly $u\le v$ (if $h_1,h_2\in \fra (X,\er )$ with $h_1\le u_0$ and $h_2\ge v_0$ on $K$, then $h_1\le h_2$ on $\ext X$, hence $h_1\le h_2$ on $X$). Therefore the formula $\Gamma (x)=[u(x),v(x)]$, $x\in X$, defines a bounded upper semicontinuous mapping with nonempty closed values and convex graph. \par We claim that $u\r _K=u_0$ and $v\r _K=v_0$. This follows from abstract results \cite [Propositions 3.48 and 3.55]{lmns}, but it can be seen also directly: \par Since $0\le u_0$, it follows that $u(x)=0=u_0(x)$ for $x\in K\setminus (B\times \{1\})$. If $x=(b,1)$ for some $b\in B$, consider the function $f_b=\chi _{(b,1)}-\chi _{(b,-1)}$. Then $f_b\in \A $ and $f_b\le u_0$. Since $f_b$ defines a function in $\fra (X,\er )$, we conclude that $u(x)=1=u_0(x)$. \par Since $v_0\le 1$, we get $v(x)=1=v_0(x)$ for $x\in (B\times \{1\})\cup ([0,1]\times \{0\})$. If $x=(a,-1)$ for some $a\in A$, then $1+f_a\ge v_0$, thus $v(x)=0=v_0(x)$. If $x=(a,1)$ for some $a\in A\setminus B$, then $1-f_a\ge v_0$, thus $v(x)=0=v_0(x)$. \par In particular, $u=v$ on $A\times \{-1,1\}$. Let $g$ be any affine selection from $\Gamma $. Then $$f(a,0)=\begin {cases} \frac 12, & a\in B,\\ 0, & a\in A\setminus B.\end {cases}$$ \par Therefore, to construct $X_1$ it is enough to take $A$ to be a countable dense subset of $[0,1]$ and $B\subset A$ such that both $B$ and $A\setminus B$ are dense. To construct $X_2$ it is enough to take $A$ to be an uncountable Borel set and $B\subset A$ a non-Borel subset.
