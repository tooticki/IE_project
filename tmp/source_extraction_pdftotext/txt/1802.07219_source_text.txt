BEGIN Proof 
 (a) follows from the solvability of $\rad (\af )$, and (c) is an immediate consequence of Proposition \ref {subalghomimsolv}. \par (b): According to the correspondence theorem for ideals, there exists an ideal $\If $ of $\af $ such that $\rad (\af )\subseteq \If $ and $\rad (\af /\rad (\af ))=\If /\rad (\af )$. This implies that $\If /\rad (\af )$ is solvable, and therefore Proposition \ref {extsolv} yields that $\If $ is solvable. Hence $\If \subseteq \rad (\af )$, and so $\rad (\af /\rad (\af ))=0$.

 Suppose that $\If $ is an ideal of $\lf $ such that $\lf /\If $ is a Lie algebra. Then it follows from the anti-commutativity of $\lf /\If $ that $x^2\in \If $ for every element $x\in \lf $. Since $\If $ is a subspace of $\lf $, we conclude that $\leib (\lf )\subseteq \If $.

END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 By definition of a left Leibniz algebra, $L(\lf )\subseteq \der (\lf )$. Since the multiplication of $\lf $ is bilinear, $L(\lf )$ is a subspace of $\der (\lf )$. \par Let $x,y\in \lf $ and $D\in \der (\lf )$ be arbitrary elements. Then the computation $$[D,L_x](y)=(D \circ L_x-L_x\circ D)(y)=D(xy)-xD(y)=D(x)y=L_{D(x)}(y)$$ shows that $[D,L_x]=L_{D(x)}\in \der (\lf )$ for any element $x\in \lf $ and any derivation $D\in \der (\lf )$. This completes the proof that $L(\lf )$ is an ideal of $\der (\lf )$. \par Now consider the linear transformation $L:\lf \to \der (\lf )$ defined by $x\mapsto L_x$. By definition, $\Ker (L)=C_\ell (\lf )$ and $\im (L)=L(\lf )$. Finally, it follows from the identity $[D,L_y]=L_{D(y)}$ that $L_{xy}=L_{L_x(y)}=[L_x,L_y]$ for any elements $x,y\in \lf $, and thus $L$ is a homomorphism of Leibniz algebras. Then the fundamental homomorphism theorem shows that $L$ induces a Leibniz algebra isomorphism from $L/C_\ell (\lf )$ onto $L(\lf )$.

END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 The proof of Proposition \ref {rightmult} is very similar to the proof of Proposition~\ref {leftmult}. Nevertheless, we include the whole argument in this case as well, since it shows why left multiplication operators are preferable when one writes functions on the left of their arguments. \par By definition of a right Leibniz algebra, $R(\lf )\subseteq \der (\lf )$. Since the multiplication of $\lf $ is bilinear, $R(\lf )$ is a subspace of $\der (\lf )$. \par Let $x,y\in \lf $ and $D\in \der (\lf )$ be arbitrary elements. Then the computation $$[D,R_x](y)=(D \circ R_x-R_x\circ D)(y)=D(yx)-D(y)x=yD(x)=R_{D(x)}(y)$$ shows that $[D,R_x]=R_{D(x)}\in \der (\lf )$ for any element $x\in \lf $ and any derivation $D\in \der (\lf )$. This completes the proof that $R(\lf )$ is an ideal of $\der (\lf )$. \par Now consider the linear transformation $R:\lf \to \der (\lf )$ defined by $x\mapsto R_x$. By definition, $\Ker (R)=C_r(\lf )$ and $\im (R)=R(\lf )$. Finally, it follows from the identity $[D,R_x]=R_{D(x)}$ that $R_{xy}=R_{R_y(x)}=[R_y,R_x]$ for any elements $x,y\in \lf $ that $R$ is an anti-homomorphism of Leibniz algebras.

BEGIN Proof 
 Recall that the Lie multiplication algebra $\lie (\lf )$ of the symmetric Leibniz algebra $\lf $ is the smallest subalgebra of the general linear Lie algebra $\gl (\lf )$ that contains $L(\lf )\cup R(\lf )$. It follows from Proposition \ref {leftmult} and Proposition \ref {rightmult} that $L(\lf )$ and $R(\lf )$ are ideals of $\der (\lf )$. But as a sum of ideals $L(\lf )+R(\lf )$ is an ideal of $\der (\lf )$, and thus a subalgebra of $\der (\lf )$ which in turn is a subalgebra of $\gl (\lf )$. This shows that $\lie (\lf )=L(\lf )+R(\lf )$.

 \label {flexible} Every symmetric Leibniz algebra is flexible and power-associative. Moreover, $x^3=0$ for every element $x$.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $\lf $ be any symmetric Leibniz algebra. It follows from Lemma \ref {rightmultsq} that $yx^2=0$ for any elements $x$ and $y$ of a right Leibniz algebra. Hence the left Leibniz identity for $\lf $ yields $x(yx)=(xy)x+yx^2=(xy)x$ for any elements $x$ and $y$ of $\lf $, and thus $\lf $ is flexible. \par According to Lemma \ref {leftmultsq}, we have that $x^2y=0$ for any elements $x$ and $y$ of a left Leibniz algebra. This implies that $x^2x=0=xx^2$ for any element $x\in \lf $. In particular, third powers are well-defined and are equal to zero. Consequently, we obtain by induction that symmetric Leibniz algebras are power-associative.\footnote {The proof of Proposition \ref {flexible} shows that this result holds more generally for left central Leibniz algebras or right central Leibniz algebras. The latter notions were introduced by Mason and Yamskulna in \cite {MY}: A {\em left central Leibniz algebra\/} is a left Leibniz algebra $\lf $ such that $\leib (\lf )\subseteq C_r(\lf )$ and a {\em right central Leibniz algebra\/} is a right Leibniz algebra $\lf $ such that $\leib (\lf )\subseteq C_\ell (\lf )$.}

BEGIN Proof 
 We only prove the result for left Leibniz algebras as this yields the result for right Leibniz algebras by considering the opposite algebra. We first prove that $\lf ^{(n)}$ is a left ideal of $\lf $ for every non-negative integer $n$. We proceed by induction on $n$. The base step $n=0$ is clear as $\lf \lf ^{(0)}=\lf \lf \subseteq \lf =\lf ^{(0)}$. For the induction step let $n>0$ be an integer and assume that the statement is true for $n-1$. Then we obtain from the left Leibniz identity and the induction hypothesis that \begin {eqnarray*} \lf \lf ^{(n)} & = & \lf [\lf ^{(n-1)}\lf ^{(n-1)}]\subseteq [\lf \lf ^{(n-1)}]\lf ^{(n-1)}+\lf ^{(n-1)} [\lf \lf ^{(n-1)}]\\ & \subseteq & \lf ^{(n-1)}\lf ^{(n-1)}=\lf ^{(n)}\,. \end {eqnarray*} \par Next, we prove that $\lf ^{(n)}$ is a right ideal of $\lf $ for every non-negative integer $n$. We again proceed by induction on $n$. The base step $n=0$ is clear as $\lf ^{(0)}\lf =\lf \lf \subseteq \lf =\lf ^{(0)}$. For the induction step let $n>0$ be an integer and assume that the statement is true for $n-1$.

 Since $\leib (\lf )$ is a subspace of $\lf $, it is enough to show that $x^2\in \ann _\lf (M)$ for any element $x\in \lf $. We have that $\lambda _{x^2}=\lambda _x\circ \lambda _x-\lambda _x\circ \lambda _x=0$, and therefore it follows that $x^2\in \Ker (\lambda )=\ann _\lf (M)$.

END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 The inclusion $\leib (\lf )\subseteq \lf ^\lambda $ follows immediately from Lemma \ref {leftann}. \par Let $x,y\in \lf $ and $z\in \lf ^\lambda $ be arbitrary elements. Then we obtain from the invariance of $\kappa _\lambda $ that $\kappa _\lambda (zx,y)=\kappa _\lambda (z,xy)=0$, i.e., $zx\in \lf ^\lambda $. This shows that $\lf ^\lambda $ is a right ideal of $\lf $. \par Moreover, using the symmetry in conjunction with the invariance of $\kappa _\lambda $, we conclude that $\kappa _\lambda (xz,y)=\kappa _\lambda (y,xz)=\kappa _\lambda (yx,z)=\kappa _\lambda (z,yx) =0$, i.e., $xz\in \lf ^\lambda $.

BEGIN Proof 
 Since every $\lf $-bimodule is a left $\lf $-module, it follows from Lemma \ref {leftann} that $\leib (\lf ) \subseteq \Ker (\lambda )$. If $M$ is anti-symmetric, then $\rho =0$, and the assertion is clear. On the other hand, if $M$ is symmetric, then $\lambda _x=-\rho _x$ for every element $x\in \lf $. Hence $\Ker (\rho )=\Ker (\lambda )$, and therefore $\leib (\lf )\subseteq \Ker (\rho )$ follows from the already established inclusion $\leib (\lf )\subseteq \Ker (\lambda )$.

 Suppose that $N$ is a $\lf $-subbimodule of $M$ such that $M/N$ is a symmetric $\lf $-bimodule.

BEGIN Proof 
 (a): Since (LLM) holds for every left $\lf $-module, and each term in (LML) as well as in (MLL) contains at least one trivial right action, the assertion follows. \par (b): In order for $M$ to be a symmetric $\lf $-bimodule, the right action of $\lf $ on $M$ has to be defined by $m\cdot x:=-x\cdot m$ for every element $m\in M$ and every element $x\in \lf $. Since (LLM) is automatically satisfied, one only needs to verify (LML) and (MLL). Let $x,y\in \lf $ and $m\in M$ be arbitrary elements. Then it follows from (LLM) that \begin {eqnarray*} (x\cdot m)\cdot y & = & -y\cdot (x\cdot m)\\ & = & (xy)\cdot m-x\cdot (y\cdot m)\\ & = & x\cdot (m\cdot y)-m\cdot (xy) \end {eqnarray*} and \begin {eqnarray*} (m\cdot x)\cdot y & = & y\cdot (x\cdot m)\\ & = & x\cdot (y\cdot m)-(xy)\cdot m\\ & = & m\cdot (xy)-x\cdot (m\cdot y)\,. \end {eqnarray*} This completes the proof.

Since $f$ is a $2$-cocycle, we have that $$x_1\cdot f(x_2\otimes x_3)+f(x_1\otimes x_2x_3)= x_2\cdot f(x_1\otimes x_3)+f(x_1\otimes x_2)\cdot x_3+f(x_1x_2\otimes x_3)+f(x_2\otimes x_1x_3)\,.$$ \par We compute \begin {eqnarray*} (x_1,m_1)[(x_2,m_2)(x_3,m_3)] & = & (x_1,m_1)(x_2x_3,m_2\cdot x_3+x_2\cdot m_3+f(x_2\otimes x_3))\\ & = & (x_1(x_2x_3),m_1\cdot (x_2x_3)+x_1\cdot (m_2\cdot x_3)+x_1\cdot (x_2\cdot m_3)\\ & & +\,x_1\cdot f(x_2\otimes x_3)+f(x_1\otimes x_2x_3))\,, \end {eqnarray*} \begin {eqnarray*} [(x_1,m_1)(x_2,m_2)](x_3,m_3) & = & (x_1x_2,m_1\cdot x_2+x_1\cdot m_2+f(x_1\otimes x_2))(x_3,m_3)\\ & = & ((x_1x_2)x_3,(m_1\cdot x_2)\cdot x_3+(x_1\cdot m_2)\cdot x_3\\ & & +\,f(x_1\otimes x_2)\cdot x_3+(x_1x_2)\cdot m_3+f(x_1x_2\otimes x_3))\,, \end {eqnarray*} \begin {eqnarray*} (x_2,m_2)[(x_1,m_1)(x_3,m_3)] & = & (x_2,m_2)(x_1x_3,m_1\cdot x_3+x_1\cdot m_3+f(x_1\otimes x_3))\\ & = & (x_2(x_1x_3),m_2\cdot (x_1x_3)+x_2\cdot (m_1\cdot x_3)+x_2\cdot (x_1\cdot m_3)\\ & & +\,x_2\cdot f(x_1\otimes x_3)+f(x_2\otimes x_1x_3)) \end {eqnarray*} for any elements $x_1,x_2,x_3\in \lf $ and $m_1,m_2,m_3\in M$. \par It follows from the left Leibniz identity, (\ref {LLM}), (\ref {LML}), (\ref {MLL}), and the $2$-cocycle identity for $f$ that the right--hand side of the first identity equals the sum of the right-hand sides of the second and third identities. Hence the left-hand side of the first identity also equals the sum of the left-hand sides of the second and third identities, and thus $\lf \times M$ satisfies the left Leibniz identity.

 We only prove Proposition \ref {rightlowcenser} as this yields Proposition \ref {leftlowcenser} by considering the opposite algebra. Firstly, we show that the right descending central series is indeed descending, i.e., $\lf ^{n+1}\subseteq \lf ^n$ for every positive integer $n$. We proceed by induction on $n$. The base step $n=1$ is clear. For the induction step let $n>1$ be an integer and assume that the statement is true for $n-1$.

BEGIN Proof 
 Let $\lf $ be a right Leibniz algebra. We begin by proving that $\If ^n$ is a right ideal of $\lf $ for any right ideal $\If $ of $\lf $ and for any positive integer $n$. We will proceed by induction on $n$. The base step $\If ^1\lf =\If \lf \subseteq \If =\If ^1$ follows from the fact that $\If $ is a right ideal of $\lf $. For the induction step let $n>1$ be an integer and assume that the statement is true for $n-1$. Then we obtain from the right Leibniz identity and the induction hypothesis that $$\If ^n\lf =(\If ^{n-1}\If )\lf \subseteq (\If ^{n-1}\lf )\If +\If ^{n-1}(\If \lf )\subseteq \If ^{n-1}\If = \If ^n\,.$$ \par Now let $\jf $ and $\kf $ be two nilpotent ideals of $\lf $. We will prove that $$(\jf +\kf )^n\subseteq \sum _{r=1}^{n-1}(\jf ^r\cap \kf ^{n-r})$$ for every positive integer $n$. We will again proceed by induction on $n$. The base step $(\jf +\kf )^1=\jf +\kf =\jf ^1+\kf ^1$ is an immediate consequence of the definition of the right descending central series. For the induction step let $n\ge 1$ be an integer and assume that the statement is true for $n$. Then we obtain from the induction hypothesis and the fact that $\jf ^r$ and $\kf ^{n-r}$ are right ideals of $\lf $: \begin {eqnarray*} (\jf +\kf )^{n+1} & = & (\jf +\kf )^n(\jf +\kf )\subseteq \sum _{r=1}^{n-1}(\jf ^r\cap \kf ^{n-r})(\jf +\kf )\\ & \subseteq & \sum _{r=1}^{n-1}(\jf ^r\cap \kf ^{n-r})\jf +\sum _{r=1}^{n-1}(\jf ^r\cap \kf ^{n-r})\kf \\ & \subseteq & \sum _{r=1}^{n-1}(\jf ^{r+1}\cap \kf ^{n-r})+\sum _{r=1}^{n-1}(\jf ^r\cap \kf ^{n+1-r})\\ & = & \sum _{s=2}^n(\jf ^s\cap \kf ^{n+1-s})+\sum _{r=1}^{n-1}(\jf ^r\cap \kf ^{n+1-r})\\ & = & \jf ^n\cap \kf ^1+\sum _{r=2}^{n-1}(\jf ^r\cap \kf ^{n+1-r})+\jf ^1\cap \kf ^n\\ & = & \sum _{r=1}^n(\jf ^r\cap \kf ^{n+1-r})\,. \end {eqnarray*} Finally, as $\jf $ and $\kf $ are nilpotent, there exist positive integers $s$ and $t$ such that $\jf ^s =0$ and $\kf ^t=0$. Hence we obtain that $(\jf +\kf )^{s+t-1}=0$ which shows that $\jf +\kf $ is a nilpotent ideal of $\lf $.

 \label {ej} Let $\lf $ be a finite-dimensional left Leibniz algebra and let $(\lambda ,\rho )$ be a representation of $\lf $ on a non-zero finite-dimensional vector space $M$ such that $\lambda _x$ is nilpotent for every element $x\in \lf $. Then $\rho _x$ is nilpotent for every element $x\in \lf $, and there exists a non-zero vector $m\in M$ such that $\lambda _x(m)=0=\rho _x(m)$ for every element $x\in \lf $.
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 We first prove that for any element $x\in \lf $ the nilpotency of $\lambda _x$ implies the nilpotency of $\rho _x$ (see also \cite [Lemma 6]{P1}). Namely, we have that $\rho _x^n=(-1)^{n-1}\rho _x \circ \lambda _x^{n-1}$ for every element $x\in \lf $ and every positive integer $n$. This can be shown by induction on $n$. The base step $n=1$ is trivial. For the induction step let $n\ge 1$ and assume that the statement is true for $n$. Then it follows from the induction hypothesis and Lemma \ref {LRRR} that $$\rho _x^{n+1}=\rho _x\circ \rho _x^n=(-1)^{n-1}\rho _x\circ \rho _x\circ \lambda _x^{n-1}=-(-1)^{n-1}\rho _x\circ \lambda _x\circ \lambda _x^{n-1}=(-1)^n\rho _x\circ \lambda _x^n\,.$$ \par Since the $\lf $-bimodule $M$ is finite-dimensional, it has an irreducible $\lf $-subbi\-module $N$. We obtain from Theorem \ref {irrbimod} that $N$ is symmetric or anti-symmetric. In the former case we have that $\rho _x=-\lambda _x$, and in the latter case we have that $\rho _x=0$ for every $x\in \lf $. It follows from the linearity of $\lambda $ and (\ref {LLMrep}) that $\lambda (\lf )$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\gl (M)$. So the existence of a non-zero vector $m\in N$ such that $\lambda _x(m)=0$ for every $x\in \lf $ can be obtained from Engel's theorem for Lie algebras of linear transformations (see \cite [Theorem 3.3]{H}). Finally, this and the symmetry or anti-symmetry of $N$ yield $\rho _x(m)=0$ for every $x\in \lf $.

 Since the $\lf $-bimodule $M$ is finite-dimensional, it has an irreducible $\lf $-sub\-module $N$. We obtain from Theorem \ref {irrbimod} that $N$ is symmetric or anti-symmetric.

The latter isomorphism in conjunction with Proposition \ref {subalghomimsolv} yields that $\lambda (\lf )$ is solvable. So the existence of a common eigenvector $m\in N$ for $\lambda (\lf )$ can be obtained from Lie's theorem for solvable Lie algebras of linear transformations (see \cite [Theorem~4.1]{H}).

Then the proof of Proposition \ref {leftmult} shows that the corresponding matrix of $L_{yz}=[L_y,L_z]=L_y\circ L_z-L_z\circ L_y$ is a strictly upper triangular matrix for any $y,z\in \lf $. Hence $\kappa (x,yz)=\tr (L_x\circ L_{yz})=0$ for any $x,y,z\in \lf $. \par Suppose now that $\kappa (x,y)=0$ for every element $x\in \lf $ and every element $y\in \lf ^2$ and the ground field of $\lf $ again is algebraically closed. It follows from Proposition~\ref {leftmult} that $L(\lf )$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\gl (\lf )$. In particular, we obtain as before that $\tr (L_x\circ [L_y,L_z])=\tr (L_x\circ L_{yz})=\kappa (x,yz)=0$ for any $x,y,z\in \lf $. So the other implication is a consequence of \cite [Theorem~4.3]{H} in conjunction with Proposition~\ref {leftsolv}. \par Finally, in case the ground field $\F $ of $\lf $ is not algebraically closed, a base field extension will show the assertion. Namely, let $\overline {\F }$ be an algebraic closure of $\F $, set $\overline {\lf }:=\lf \otimes _\F \overline {\F }$, and let $\overline {L}_{a\otimes \alpha }(b\otimes \beta ):=ab\otimes \alpha \beta $ for any $a,b\in \lf $ and any $\alpha ,\beta \in \overline {\F }$ denote the left multiplication operator of $\overline {\lf }$. Since $\overline {\lf }\hspace {.3mm}^2 =\lf ^2\otimes _\F \overline {\F }$, we obtain by induction that $\overline {\lf }\hspace {.3mm}^{(n)} =\lf ^{(n)}\otimes _\F \overline {\F }$ for every non-negative integer $n$. Consequently, $\lf $ is solvable if, and only if, $\overline {\lf }$ is solvable. Moreover, we obtain for the Killing form $\overline {\kappa }$ of $\overline {\lf }$ that $\overline {\kappa }(x\otimes 1,y\otimes 1)=\tr (\overline {L}_{x\otimes 1}\circ \overline {L}_{y\otimes 1})=\tr (L_x\circ L_y)=\kappa (x,y)$ for all $x,y\in \lf $ as $\overline {L}_{a\otimes \alpha }(b\otimes \beta )=L_a(b)\otimes \alpha \beta $ for any $a,b\in \lf $ and any $\alpha ,\beta \in \overline {\F }$. This can be used to show that $\kappa (x,y)=0$ for every element $x\in \lf $ and every element $y\in \lf ^2$ if, and only if, $\overline {\kappa }(\overline {x},\overline {y})=0$ for every element $\overline {x}\in \overline {\lf }$ and every element $\overline {y}\in \overline {\lf }\hspace {.3mm}^2$.

BEGIN Proposition 7.3  
 \label {simsemisim} Every simple left or right Leibniz algebra is semisimple.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $\If $ be any solvable ideal of the simple left or right Leibniz algebra $\lf $. Then either $\If =0$, $\If =\leib (\lf )$, or $\If =\lf $. In the first two cases we have that $\If \subseteq \leib (\lf )$, and we are done. So suppose that $\If =\lf $. From Proposition~\ref {simperfect} we obtain by induction that $\lf =\lf ^{(n)}$ holds for every non-negative integer $n$. Since by hypothesis $\If $ is solvable, there exists a non-negative integer $r$ such that $\If ^{(r)} =0$. Hence $\lf =\lf ^{(r)}=\If ^{(r)}=0$ which contradicts the requirement $\leib (\lf ) \subsetneqq \lf ^2$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proposition 7.4  
 \label {semisimrad} A finite-dimensional left or right Leibniz algebra $\lf $ is semisimple if, and only if, $\leib (\lf )= \rad (\lf )$.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 It follows from Proposition \ref {ker} and Proposition \ref {rad} that $\leib (\lf )\subseteq \rad (\lf )$. This in conjunction with the semisimplicity of $\lf $ proves the ``only if"-part of the assertion, and the converse follows from Proposition \ref {rad} which says that $\rad (\lf )$ is the largest solvable ideal of $\lf $.

BEGIN Corollary 7.7  
 \label {semisimcen} If $\lf $ is a semisimple symmetric Leibniz algebra, then $\leib (\lf )=C(\lf )$.
END Corollary
 
BEGIN Proof 
 We only prove Proposition \ref {semisimrightcen} as this yields Proposition \ref {semisimleftcen} by considering the opposite algebra. \par It follows from Proposition \ref {rightker} that $\leib (\lf )\subseteq C_r(\lf )$. According to Proposition~\ref {rightcen}, $C_r(\lf )$ is an abelian ideal of $\lf $, and thus the semisimplicity of $\lf $ yields that $C_r(\lf )\subseteq \leib (\lf )$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proposition 7.8  
 \label {semisim} A left or right Leibniz algebra $\lf $ is semisimple if, and only if, $\mathfrak {L}_\mathrm {Lie}$ is semisimple.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Suppose that $\lf $ is semisimple and let $\IIf $ be any solvable ideal of the Lie algebra $\lf _\lie =\lf /\leib (\lf )$. Let $\pi :\lf \to \lf _\lie $ denote the natural epimorphism of Leibniz algebras. Then $\If :=\pi ^{-1}(\IIf )$ is an ideal of $\lf $, and it follows from Proposition~\ref {extsolv} applied to $\IIf =\If +\leib (\lf )/\leib (\lf )\cong \If /\If \cap \leib (\lf )$ that $\If $ is solvable. Hence the semisimplicity of $\lf $ yields that $\If \subseteq \leib (\lf )$, i.e., $\IIf =0$. Consequently, $\lf _\lie $ is semisimple. \par In order to prove the converse, suppose that $\lf _\lie =\lf /\leib (\lf )$ is semisimple and let $\If $ be any solvable ideal of the left or right Leibniz algebra $\lf $. Then by Proposition \ref {subalghomimsolv} we obtain that $\If +\leib (\lf )/\leib (\lf )$ is a solvable ideal of $\lf _\lie $. Since the latter Lie algebra is semisimple, we have that $\If +\leib (\lf )/\leib (\lf ) =0$, and thus $\If \subseteq \leib (\lf )$. Hence $\lf $ is semisimple.

END Corollary
 
BEGIN Proposition 7.10  
 \label {mindeg} The Killing form of every finite-dimensional semisimple left Leibniz algebra over a field of characteristic zero is minimally degenerate.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $\lf $ be a finite-dimensional semisimple left Leibniz algebra over a field of characteristic $0$, and let $\If :=\lf ^\perp $ denote the radical of the Killing form $\kappa $ of $\lf $. Recall that $\If $ is an ideal of $\lf $. The proof of \cite [Lemma 5.1]{H} shows that $\kappa _\If =\kappa _{\vert \If \times \If }$, where $\kappa _\If $ denotes the Killing form of $\If $. Then we have that $\kappa _\If (x,y)=\kappa (x,y)=0$ for every $x\in \If $ and every $y\in \If ^2$. Hence Theorem \ref {cartan} shows that $\If $ is solvable. Since $\lf $ is semisimple, we obtain that $\lf ^\perp =\If \subseteq \leib (\lf )$, and thus it follows from Lemma \ref {leftrad} that $\lf ^\perp =\leib (\lf )$, i.e., $\kappa $ is minimally degenerate.

BEGIN Theorem 7.11  
 \label {strucsemisim} If $\lf $ is a finite-dimensional semisimple left Leibniz algebra over a field of characteristic zero, then there exists a semisimple Lie subalgebra $\ssf $ of $\lf $ such that $\lf =\ssf \oplus \leib (\lf )$ and $\leib (\lf )$ is an anti-symmetric completely reducible $\ssf $-bimodule.\footnote {More precisely, $\lf $ is the hemi-semidirect product of $\ssf $ and the $\ssf $-bimodule $\leib (\lf )$.} Moreover, if $\lf $ is simple, then $\ssf $ is simple and $\leib (\lf )$ is irreducible.
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 The existence of the semisimple Lie subalgebra $\ssf $ with $\lf =\ssf \oplus \leib (\lf )$ is an immediate consequence of Levi's theorem for Leibniz algebras and Proposition~\ref {semisimrad}. It follows from Proposition \ref {leftker} that $\leib (\lf )$ is an ideal of $\lf $ such that $\leib (\lf )\lf =0$. Hence $\leib (\lf )$ is an anti-symmetric $\lf $-bimodule. In particular, $\leib (\lf )$ is also an anti-symmetric $\ssf $-bimodule. Finally, Weyl's theorem (see \cite [Theorem 6.3]{H}) yields that $\leib (\lf )$ is a completely reducible $\ssf $-bimodule. \par Suppose now that $\lf $ is simple. Then we obtain from Proposition \ref {sim} that $\ssf \cong \lf /\leib (\lf )=\lf _\lie $ is also simple. Let $M$ be a non-zero proper $\lf $-subbimodule of $\leib (\lf )$. Then $M$ is an ideal of $\lf $ that is different from $0$, $\leib (\lf )$, and $\lf $ which contradicts the simplicity of $\lf $. Hence $\leib (\lf )$ is an irreducible $\lf $-bimodule. By virtue of Proposition \ref {ker}, $\leib (\lf )$ is also an irreducible $\ssf $-bimodule.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Theorem 7.12  
 \label {1stwhiteheadlem} If $\lf $ is a finite-dimensional semisimple left Leibniz algebra over a field of characteristic zero, then $\HL ^1(\lf ,M)=0$ holds for every symmetric finite-dimensional $\lf $-bimodule $M$.
