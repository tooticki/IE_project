 \label {decadix} The following are equivalent. \begin {enumerate} \item \label {d3} The real structure $\sigma $ is admissible. \item \label {d4} The subspace $V_\sigma $ is stable by $c$. \item \label {d5} The subspace $V$ is stable by $\sigma $. \item \label {d2} The real structure $\sigma $ restricts to a $Q$-orthogonal symmetry of $V$. \item \label {d1} The subspaces $V_+:=V\cap V_\sigma $ and $V_-:=V\cap iV_\sigma $ form a $Q$-orthogonal decomposition of $V$. \end {enumerate}
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 1  
 It is immediate that (\ref {d3})$\Rightarrow $(\ref {d5}), and for the converse it suffices to observe that $\sigma \circ c$ and $c\circ \sigma $ are two algebra automorphisms of $\CC l(V)$ which coincide on $V$. The equivalence between (\ref {d3}) and (\ref {d4}) is obtained by symmetry. \par Of course (\ref {d2})$\Rightarrow $(\ref {d5}) is trivial, and to see that (\ref {d5})$\Rightarrow $(\ref {d2}) we observe that $Q(\sigma (v))=\sigma (v)^2=\sigma (v^2)=\sigma (Q(v))=Q(v)$, hence $\sigma $ restricts to a $Q$-orthogonal transformation of $V$ which is moreover involutive. \par Finally we see that $V_+$ is the $+1$-eigenspace and $V_-$ is the $-1$-eigenspace of the $\RR $-linear operator $\sigma _{|V}$, hence (\ref {d1}) and (\ref {d2}) are equivalent.

BEGIN Proposition 1  
 \label {admreal} \begin {enumerate} \item The real structures are of the form $\sigma =Ad_b\circ c$ with $b\in \Gamma _\CC $ such that $bc(b)=\lambda \in \RR $. We also have $b^T=\alpha b$, $\alpha =\pm 1$, $b^\times =\alpha c(b)$. \item The real structure $\sigma =Ad_b\circ c$ with $b\in \Gamma _\CC $ is admissible iff $c(b)=e^{i\theta }b$, with $\theta \in \RR $. In this case we can choose $b$ to satisfy $c(b)=b$ and $b^2=\lambda =\pm 1$, in which case we say that it is \emph {real and normalized}. Then $b^\times =\alpha b$, $b$ belongs to $Pin(Q)$, and is unique up to a sign. \end {enumerate}
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 2  
 It is obvious that $\sigma $ is an antilinear automorphism which preserves $V^\CC $ when it is of the form $Ad_b\circ c$ with $b$ in the Clifford group. If $bc(b)=\lambda \in \RR $ it is moreover an involution since $\sigma ^2(a)=bc(b)ac(b)^{-1}b^{-1}=a$ for all $a\in \CC l(V)$. \par Conversely, if $\sigma $ is a real structure, then $\sigma \circ c$ is an automorphism of the Clifford algebra which preserves $V^\CC $, and it is then of the form $Ad_b$ with $b\in \Gamma _\CC $. Hence $\sigma =Ad_b\circ c$. Since $\sigma $ is an involution we have $bc(b)=\lambda \in \CC $ by the calculation above. Since $c(b)$ is then equal to $b^{-1}$ up to a constant, it commutes with $b$, from which we obtain that $\lambda $ is real. \par The other properties follow from the ones just proved: since $b\in \Gamma _\CC $, $bb^\times $ is a constant, hence $c(b)b^T$ is a constant, and from $c(b)b=\lambda \in \RR $ we get that $b$ is proportional to $b^T$. The involutory property of $T$ forces the proportionality constant to be a sign $\alpha $. Then $b^\times =c(b^T)=\alpha c(b)$. \par Now it is easy to check that $\sigma $ commtutes with $c$ iff $c(b)=e^{i\theta }b$ for some $\theta \in \RR $. Then $b'={e^{i\theta /2}\over \sqrt {|\lambda |}}b$ is normalized and real and one has $Ad_b=Ad_{b'}$. If $b''$ is another normalized and real element such that $Ad_{b''}=Ad_{b}$ then $b''=\mu b'$ with $\mu \in \CC $. From reality one has $\mu \in \RR $, and from normalization one has $\mu ^2=1$. \par Since $b'$ satisfies $b'(b')^\times =\pm 1$ and is real it is in the Pin group.
END Proof

 The projection $\tau _n$ does not depend on the chosen pseudo-ortho\-normal basis. It is the unique linear form $\tau _n : \CC l(V)\rightarrow \RR $ such that $\tau _n(ab)=\tau _n(ba)$ for all $a,b\in \CC l(V)$ and $\tau _n(1)=1$. It also satisfies $\tau _n(a^T)=\tau _n(a)$.

 It is obvious that $(.,.)_\sigma $ is sesquilinear.

BEGIN Proof 5  
 Clearly $\tilde \phi (V^k)=V^k$ for $k=0,1$. Let us suppose that $\tilde \phi (V^j)=V^j$ for $j\le k$. The sum $V^0\oplus \ldots \oplus V^k\oplus V^{k+1}$ is orthogonal for the $c$-product, hence by the lemma the sum $\tilde \phi (V^0)\oplus \ldots \oplus \tilde \phi (V^k)\oplus \tilde \phi (V^{k+1})=V_0\oplus \ldots \oplus V^k\oplus \tilde \phi (V^{k+1})$ also is.

BEGIN Proof 6  
 We have $(U\psi ,U\eta )=(\psi ,U^\times U\eta )=-(\psi ,\eta )$ for all $\psi ,\eta \in K$. Thus if $K=K_+\oplus K_-$ is an orthogonal decomposition of $K$ into subspaces where $(.,.)$ is positive definite and negative definite respectively, we see that $K=UK_+\oplus UK_-$ is an orthogonal decomposition where the signs are swapped.

 Let $(e_i)_{1\le i\le n}$ be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of $V_\sigma $.

Let $U=L_{e_i}$. Since $L_{e_i}^{\times _\sigma }=L_{e_i^{\times _\sigma }}=L_{e_i}$, hence $UU^\times =-\id _{\CC l(V)}$ and we conclude by lemma \ref {neutralemma}.

 Let us call $\rho : \CC l(V)\rightarrow End(K)$ the representation homomorphism. \par If $Q_\sigma $ is not positive definite, let $e_i\in V_\sigma $ be such that $e_i^2=-1$, set $U=\rho (e_i)$ and use lemma \ref {neutralemma}. \par If $Q_\sigma $ is positive definite, then let $U : K\rightarrow S_e$, where $S_e$ is a minimal left ideal in $\CC l(V)$, be a Clifford-module isomorphism, which we know exists by irreducibility of $K$. By Garling's alternative, $(.,.)_\sigma $ is positive definite, hence its restriction to $S_e$ also is. We now transport $(.,.)_\sigma $ to $K$ thanks to $U$ by the formula $(\psi ,\eta )_U:=(U\psi ,U\eta )_\sigma $, for all $\psi ,\eta \in K$.

BEGIN Proof 9  
 The two properties are easily seen to be sufficient. Let us prove that they are necessary. First we note that since $\CC l(V)$ is simple and $\rho \not =0$, then $\rho $ is injective. For $(.,.)_x$ to be sesquilinear $x$ must satisfy $\rho (x)=\rho (x)^\times $ which is equivalent to $x=x^\times $ since $\rho $ is injective and $c$-compatible. Now we note that $a^{\times _\sigma }=\sigma (a^T)=\sigma \circ c\circ c (a^T)=Ad_b(a^\times )=ba^\times b^{-1}$. \par We must have $\rho (a^{\times _\sigma })=\rho (a)^{\times _\sigma }=\rho (x)^{-1}\rho (a)^\times \rho (x)$ and we obtain that $xb$ is a scalar by the injectivity of $\rho $.

We also know that $(.,.)_{v}$ is a $\sigma $-compatible Krein product on $K$ by proposition \ref {gprod}, and we conclude by Robinson's alternative. \item Case 2 and 3 are similar to case 1 with the extra complication that $b=\omega v$ satisfies $b^\times =b$ for $n=2,6$ mod $8$ and $b^\times =-b$ for $n=0,4$ mod $8$. \end {enumerate} It is obvious that a line $L$ is such that $B(s_L(.),.)$ is positive definite iff $L\setminus \{0\}$ lies inside the light cone. Moreover multiplication by $-1$ exchanges $C_+$ with $C_-$ and $(.,.)_v$ with $-(.,.)_v$, so that it only remains to show that $(\psi ,\psi )_v$ keeps a constant sign for a fixed non-zero $\psi $ and $v$ varying continuously in one component of $C$, which is immediate by continuity of $\rho $.

 First, since multiplication by $w$ changes chirality, it is obvious that $K_L$ and $K_R$ are orthogonal to each other for $(.,.)_w$ since they are self-orthogonal for $(.,.)$. If $n>2$ we can find a spacelike vector $e$ such that $e^2=-1$ and $B(e,w)=0$. Let $U_e : K_L\rightarrow K_R$ be the map $\psi \mapsto e\psi $. Since $(e\psi ,e\psi )_w=(e\psi ,we\psi )=-(e\psi ,ew\psi )=(\psi ,\psi )_w$, $U_e$ is an isometry for $(.,.)_w$.

BEGIN Proof 13  
 Fix any basis of $K$ and denote by $c.c. : \psi \mapsto \bar \psi $ the complex conjugation of coordinates with respect to this basis. We also denote by $c.c. : A\mapsto \bar A$ the antilinear involution on operators induced by complex conjugation of coordinates, that is : $\bar A\psi =\overline {A\bar \psi }$. Let us write $\tilde c=\rho \circ c\circ \rho ^{-1}$. Since $\tilde c$ is an antilinear involution of $End(K)$, $\tilde c \circ c.c.$ is a linear (involutive) automorphism and is thus of the form $Ad_C$ for some $C\in End(K)$. We let ${\cal C}=C\circ c.c.$ and we obtain that $\rho (c(a))={\mathcal C}\rho (a){\mathcal C}^{-1}$. \par \par The fact that $c$ is an involution translates as ${\mathcal C}^2={\tilde \epsilon }$, with ${\tilde \epsilon }$ a constant. Let $\psi \in K$ be such that ${\mathcal C}\psi \not =0$. Then ${\mathcal C}^3\psi ={\tilde \epsilon } {\mathcal C}\psi ={\mathcal C}({\tilde \epsilon }\psi )$, which shows that ${\tilde \epsilon }$ is real. From the fact that $\rho $ is $c$-compatible we obtain that $\rho (c(a))^\times =\rho (c(a)^\times )=\rho (c(a^\times ))$ and it boils down to ${\mathcal C}{\mathcal C}^\times ={\tilde \kappa }$, with ${\tilde \kappa }$ a constant, which must be real. Calculating ${\mathcal C}^2({\mathcal C}^\times )^2$ we find that ${\tilde \kappa }^2={\tilde \epsilon }^2$. Dividing ${\mathcal C}$ by $\sqrt {|{\tilde \kappa }|}$ we can suppose that ${\tilde \kappa }=\pm 1$ and ${\tilde \epsilon }=\pm 1$. It is now easy to prove the uniqueness up to a phase. \par The second part is an obvious consequence of proposition \ref {admreal}. We have ${\mathcal C}_\sigma ^\times {\mathcal C}_\sigma ={\mathcal C}^\times B^\times B{\mathcal C}=\lambda \lambda '{\mathcal C}^\times {\mathcal C}=\lambda \lambda '{\tilde \kappa }$. If $\lambda =1$ then $({\mathcal C}_\sigma )^{\times _\sigma }=B^{-1}{\mathcal C}_\sigma ^\times B={\mathcal C}_\sigma ^\times $ (see proposition \ref {gprod}), and if $\lambda =-1$, then $({\mathcal C}_\sigma )^{\times _\sigma }=(iB)^{-1}{\mathcal C}_\sigma ^\times (iB)=-{\mathcal C}_\sigma ^\times $. \par Hence we have $({\cal C}_\sigma )^{\times _\sigma }{\cal C}_\sigma =\lambda {\cal C}_\sigma ^\times {\cal C}_\sigma =\lambda {\cal C}^\times B^\times B{\cal C}=\lambda \lambda '{\cal C}^\times B^2{\cal C}=\lambda '{\cal C}^\times {\cal C}$.

 To see that (\ref {p1}) entails (\ref {p2}) consider any family ${\cal F}=(v_1,\ldots ,v_p)$ of spacelike tangent vectors at $x$ and let $S_x\subset T_xM$ be the linear subspace they span. Since $\ker \omega _x$ is timelike and $q$-dimensional, one has $\ker \omega _x\oplus S_x=T_xM$. Call $\pi _x$ the projection onto $S_x$ defined by this decomposition. It is immediate that $\omega _x(u_1,\ldots ,u_p)=\lambda \det _{{\cal F}}(\pi _x(u_1),\ldots ,\pi _x(u_p))$ for any vectors $u_1,\ldots ,u_p$, where $\det _{{\cal F}}$ is the determinant in the basis ${\cal F}$ of $S_x$ and $\lambda \in \RR $. Clearly $\lambda \not =0$ since $\omega _x$ does not vanish identically. Hence $\omega _x(v_1,\ldots ,v_p)\not =0$. \par The proof that (\ref {p2}) entails (\ref {p3}) is immediate. To obtain (\ref {p1}) from (\ref {p3}), consider the projection $\pi $ on $E_s$ defined by $TM=E_s\oplus E_t$, and extend $\omega ^s$ by the formula $$\omega _x(u_1,\ldots ,u_p):=\omega ^s_x(\pi (u_1),\ldots ,\pi (u_p))$$ Then $\omega $ is a $p$-form on $TM$ and its kernel at $x$ is clearly $(E_t)_x$.

On each $U_\alpha $ let us choose a section $\psi _\alpha $ of the spinor bundle which is constant in some trivialization $S_{|U_\alpha }\simeq U_\alpha \times \CC ^{2^{n/2}}$ and non-vanishing. \par Let us define the $p$-form \par \be \omega (X_1,\ldots ,X_p)=\sum _\alpha f_\alpha (x)H_x(\psi _\alpha ,i^r\Theta (X_1\wedge \ldots \wedge X_s)\psi _\alpha )\nonumber \ee \par The integer $r$ is $[{p\over 2}]$. It ensures that $\omega $ is a real $p$-form. Indeed: \par \bea \Theta (X_1\wedge \ldots \wedge X_p)^\times &=&{1\over p!}\sum _{\sigma }\epsilon (\sigma )X_{\sigma (p)}\ldots X_{\sigma (1)}\cr &=&{(-1)^{r}\over p!}\sum _{\tau }\epsilon (\tau )X_{\tau (1)}\ldots X_{\tau (p)}\cr &=&(-1)^{r}\Theta (X_1\wedge \ldots \wedge X_p)\nonumber \eea where $(-1)^{r}$ is the signature of the reversal permutation $(1,\ldots ,p)\mapsto (p,\ldots ,1)$. Let $(e_1,\ldots ,e_p,e_{p+1},\ldots ,e_n)$ be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of $T_x M$ such that $e_1,\ldots ,e_p$ are spacelike. Then we know that $H_x(.,i^r(e_1\ldots e_p)^{-1}.)$ is definite. Since $(e_1\ldots e_p)^{-1}=e_p\ldots e_1=(-1)^re_1\ldots e_p$, we have either:\par $$\forall \alpha \in I_x, H_x(\psi _\alpha ,i^r e_1\ldots e_p\psi _\alpha )>0$$ \par or \par $$\forall \alpha \in I_x, H_x(\psi _\alpha ,i^r e_1\ldots e_p \psi _\alpha )<0$$ \par In both cases we have $\omega _x(e_1,\ldots ,e_p)\not =0$. Now, since $\omega $ is multilinear alternate, we have for any vectors $u_1\ldots ,u_p\in {\rm Span}(e_1,\ldots ,e_p)$: \par \be \omega _x(u_1,\ldots ,u_p)=\det (u_i^j)_{1\le i,j\le p}\omega _x(e_1,\ldots ,e_p)\label {eq10} \ee where $u_i^j$ is the $j$-th component of $u_i$ in the basis $(e_1,\ldots ,e_p)$. Since $(e_1,\ldots ,e_p)$ is any orthonormal family of spatial vectors, this shows that $\omega _x(u_1,\ldots ,u_p)\not =0$ for any linearly independent family of spatial vectors. Thus $\omega $ is a space orientation. \par Conversely, since $M$ is space-orientable, there exists a Euclidean real structure $\sigma =Ad_b\circ c$ where $b$ is a smooth section of the Clifford group bundle. On the Riemannian manifold $(M,g_\sigma )$ it is well-known that there exists a $\sigma $-compatible spinor metric. Let us call $\tilde H$ such a spinor metric. Then $H(.,.)=\tilde H(.,i^r b.)$ defines a $c$-compatible spinor metric for $M$.

END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 16  
 Suppose $ee^{\times _\sigma }=0$. Then for all $a,b\in \CC l(V)$, $(ae,be)_\sigma =\tau _n(e^{\times _\sigma } a^{\times _\sigma } be)=\tau _n(a^{\times _\sigma } bee^{\times _\sigma })=0$. \par Now suppose $ee^{\times _\sigma }\not =0$. Let $(.,.)_a$ be a $\sigma $-compatible Krein spinor product on $S_e$, which exists by proposition (\ref {rob1}). \par Since $e$ is a primitive idempotent, $p:=L_e\in End(S_e)$ is a rank one projection. Note that $p(e)=e^2=e$, hence $e\in \im (p)$, so that $\im (p)=\CC e$. Observe also that $(\ker p)^\perp =\im (p^\times )$ (the orthogonal and adjoint are relative to $(,)_a$) is one-dimensional\footnote {Proof of these relations : see appendix.}. Let us call $v$ a non-zero vector in this space. \par If $v$ were isotropic, then for all $\psi ,\eta \in S_e$ one would have $(p^\times (\psi ),p^\times (\eta ))_a=(\psi ,pp^\times (\eta ))_a=0$. By the non-degeneracy of $(.,.)_a$ this would imply $pp^\times =0$ which is excluded since $ee^{\times _\sigma }\not =0$. \par \par Then we can suppose that $(v,v)=\epsilon =\pm 1$. Let us call $q\in S_e$ the orthogonal projection on $\CC v=(\ker p)^\perp $. Explicitly one has $q(\psi )=\epsilon (v,\psi )v$, and it is easy to check that $q^2=q=q^\times $. Moreover, $\ker q=v^\perp =\ker p$. Since $v$ is not isotropic, $v\notin \ker (q)$, hence $S_e=\ker (q)\oplus \CC v$. If $\psi \in \ker (q)$, then $\psi \in \ker p$, hence $pq(\psi )=p(\psi )=0$. Moreover $pq(v)=p(v)$. Thus $p=pq$. Similarly it is easy to check that $qp=q$ using $S_e=\ker p\oplus \CC e$. \par Let us call $f=L^{-1}(q)\in \CC l(V)$. Using $L$ one sees that $f^2=f$, $f^{\times _\sigma }=f$, $e=ef$, $f=fe$. This shows a). The uniqueness is easy to prove. \par Let us show b). Since we know that $(a\psi ,\phi )_\sigma =(\psi ,a^{\times _\sigma }\phi )_\sigma $ for all $a\in \CC l(V)$ and $\phi ,\psi \in S_e$ by (\ref {kreinmultadj}), then by lemma \ref {unikrein} there exists $\lambda \in \RR $ such that $(.,.)_\sigma =\lambda (.,.)_a$ on $S_e$. There thus suffices to show that $\lambda \not =0$. \par Let us consider $f$ as an element of $S_e$. Then $(f,f)_\sigma =\tau _n(f^{\times _\sigma } f)=\tau _n(f)$. Now $f$ being a non zero projection, its normalized trace is not zero. On the other hand we have $(f,f)_\sigma =\lambda (f,f)_a$. This shows that $\lambda \not =0$, and that $(.,.)_\sigma $ is $\sigma $-compatible.

BEGIN Proposition 12  
 \label {RealStructureThm} The Dirac operator and spin structure commute if and only if $\{J, X\} = [J,\nabla _X] = 0$ for all $X \in \Gamma (TM)$.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 17  
 The fact that $\{J,X\} = [J,\nabla _X] = 0$ are sufficient conditions is a straightforward calculation. \par Let us prove that they are necessary. Let $f$ be a smooth real-valued function. Since $[J, {D}]=[J,f]=0$, we deduce that $J$ commutes with $[ {D}, f] = -i \gamma (df)$. We infer easily that $J$ anti-commutes with any real vector field or differential form. Next we consider the differential operator $\nabla '= J^{-1} \nabla J$. This operator is a Clifford connection. Indeed, for any $X,Y \in \Gamma (TM)$, $\psi \in \Gamma (S)$: \par \bea \nabla _X'(Y\cdot \psi ) &=& J^{-1} \nabla _X J(Y\cdot \psi ) \cr &=& -J^{-1} \nabla _X ( Y \cdot J\psi ) \cr &=& -J^{-1} (\nabla _X^{LC} Y)\cdot J\psi + Y\cdot \nabla _X (J\psi ) \cr &=& (\nabla _X^{LC} Y)\cdot \psi + Y\cdot \nabla _X' \psi \eea \par There thus exists a complex-valued one-form $\omega $ such that: $\nabla _X' - \nabla _X= \omega (X)$. This can also be written: $\omega (X) = J^{-1} [\nabla _X, J]$. We have: \bea 0 &=& [J, {D}] \cr &=& [J, -i\sum _\mu \gamma (dx^\mu ) \nabla _\mu ] \cr &=& -i\sum _\mu \gamma (dx^\mu )[J, \nabla _\mu ] \cr &=& -i J \sum _\mu \gamma (dx^\mu ) \omega _\mu \nonumber \eea \par This implies that $\omega =0$, and thus that $[\nabla _X, J]=0$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proposition 13  
 The Dirac operator is essentially self-adjoint if and only if $X^\times =X$ for all $X \in \Gamma (TM)$, and the Clifford connection $\nabla $ is metric for $H$.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 18  
 Let us assume that the Dirac operator is self-adjoint. Let $f$ be a real-valued smooth function. Then $f$ is self-adjoint. This implies that $[ {D}, f] = -i \gamma (df)$ is anti-self-adjoint. We easily conclude from this that all real vector fields and all real-valued 1-forms are self-adjoint. In particular, the $\gamma (dx^\mu )$ are self-adjoint. Let $\psi , \phi $ be spinor fields with compact support. We have: \bea 0 &=& (\psi , {D} \phi )_H - ( {D} \psi , \phi )_H \cr &=& \int \sqrt {|g|}\sum _\mu \left [H(-i\gamma (dx^\mu ) \nabla _\mu \psi , \phi ) - H(\psi , -i\gamma (dx^\mu ) \nabla _\mu \phi )\right ]dx \cr 0 &=& i\int \sqrt {|g|}\sum _\mu \left [H(\nabla _\mu \psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) + H(\psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \nabla _\mu \phi )\right ]dx \nonumber \eea We also have that: \bea \left [\nabla _\mu , \gamma (dx^\mu )\right ] &=& \gamma (\nabla _\mu ^{LC}(dx^\mu )), \cr &=& -\sum _\alpha \Gamma ^\mu _{\mu \alpha } \gamma (dx^\alpha )\nonumber \eea Hence \bea \sum _\mu \left [\nabla _\mu , \gamma (dx^\mu )\right ]&=& -\sum _{\mu ,\alpha }\Gamma ^\mu _{\mu \alpha } \gamma (dx^\alpha )\cr &=& -\sum _\alpha \frac {\partial _\alpha \sqrt {|g|}}{\sqrt {|g|}}\gamma (dx^\alpha )\nonumber \eea from which we infer that $\sum _\mu \gamma (dx^\mu ) \nabla _\mu = \sum _\mu \nabla _\mu \gamma (dx^\mu ) +\sum _\mu \gamma (dx^\mu ) (\partial _\mu \sqrt {|g|})/ \sqrt {|g|}$. Substituting in the integral above gives us: $$ \int dx\sum _\mu \left [ \sqrt {|g|} H(\nabla _\mu \psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) + \sqrt {|g|} H(\psi , \nabla _\mu (\gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )) + (\partial _\mu \sqrt {|g|}) H(\psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) \right ] = 0 $$ Finally, an integration by part yields: $$ \int dx \sqrt {|g|}\sum _\mu \left [ H(\nabla _\mu \psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) + H(\psi , \nabla _\mu (\gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )) - \partial _\mu H(\psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) \right ]dx = 0 $$ for all $\psi , \phi \in \Gamma _c(S)$. Now, the expression between brackets can be proven to be ${\mathcal C}^\infty (M, \mathbb {C})$-linear in $\phi $ (and anti-linear in $\psi $ as well). Indeed, $H(\nabla _\mu \psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )$ is clearly linear in $\phi $. let $f \in {\mathcal C}^\infty (M, \mathbb {C})$. We replace $\phi $ by $f \phi $ in the two remaining terms: \par \bea H(\psi , \nabla _\mu (\gamma (dx^\mu ) f\phi )) - \partial _\mu H(\psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) f\phi ) &=& H(\psi , \nabla _\mu [f (\gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )]) - \partial _\mu [f H(\psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )] \cr &=& H(\psi , (\partial _\mu f) \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) + f \nabla _\mu (\gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )) \cr &&- (\partial _\mu f) H(\psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) - f \partial _\mu H(\psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) \cr &=& f [H(\psi , \nabla _\mu (\gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )) - \partial _\mu H(\psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )]\nonumber \eea \par Thus, for all $f \in {\mathcal C}^\infty (M, \mathbb {C})$ and $\psi , \phi \in \Gamma _c(S)$: $$ \int dx \sqrt {|g|} f\sum _\mu \left [ H(\nabla _\mu \psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) + H(\psi , \nabla _\mu (\gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )) - \partial _\mu H(\psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) \right ] = 0 $$ which implies that: \be \sum _\mu \left [H(\nabla _\mu \psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi ) + H(\psi , \nabla _\mu (\gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )) - \partial _\mu H(\psi , \gamma (dx^\mu ) \phi )\right ]=0\label {equationonHdivergence} \ee \par at every $x$. Now suppose that $\nabla ^0$ is a local spin connection defined around $x$. We know that $\nabla =\nabla ^0+A$ where $A$ is a scalar 1-form, and that $\nabla $ is metric if and only if $A$ has pure imaginary values. Using (\ref {equationonHdivergence}) we find that \par \be \sum _\mu (A_\mu +\bar A_\mu )H(\psi ,\gamma (dx^\mu )\phi )=0\label {eqaz} \ee \par for all spinor fields $\psi $, $\phi $ with small enough compact support containing $x$. Since $H$ is non-degenerate the orthogonal of $\{\gamma (dx^2)\phi ,\ldots ,\gamma (dx^n)\phi \}$ for $H$ is a subbundle of dimension $2^{n\over 2}-n+1\ge 1$ of the spinor bundle. Since the orthogonal of $\{\gamma (dx^1)\phi ,\ldots ,\gamma (dx^n)\phi \}$ has codimension 1 in it, we can, at least locally, consider a spinor field $\psi $ such that $H(\psi ,\gamma (dx^\mu )\phi )=0$ for $\mu =2,\ldots ,n$ and $H(\psi ,\gamma (dx^1)\phi )\not =0$. Hence $A_1+\bar A_1=0$, and of course the same can be done for the other indices. The Clifford connection $\nabla $ is thus metric. \par \par \par \par \par \par \par \par \par \par \par The converse can be proven easily following the same steps. It is in fact a standard result of spin geometry. See for example \cite {LM}.
