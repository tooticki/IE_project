 \label {schurfermat} Let $n\ge 1$. There exists $q$ such that, for all primes $p\ge q$, there exists $x,y,z\in \{1,\ldots ,p-1\}$ such that $x^n+y^n\equiv z^n \pmod p$.
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Given $n$ let $q=S(n)$. Let $p$ be a prime such that $p\ge S(n)$. Then $\Zed _p^*$, which denotes the numbers $\{1,\ldots ,p-1\}$ together with the operation of multiplication modulo $p$, forms a group. All arithmetic henceforth is in $\Zed _p^*$. \par Let $H = \{ x^n \mid x\in \Zed _p^* \}$. Clearly $H$ is a subgroup of $\Zed _p^*$. It is known that $|H|=\frac {p-1}{\gcd (n,p-1)}$ so the number of cosets is $c=\frac {p-1}{|H|} = \gcd (n,p-1) \le n$. We denote the cosets by $d_1H,\ldots ,d_cH$. \par Consider the following $c$-coloring of $\{1,\ldots ,p-1\}$: color $x$ by $i$ such that $x\in d_iH$. Since $c\le n$ and $p-1\ge S(n)$, by Schur's lemma, there exists a monochromatic $x_1,y_1,z_1$ such that $x_1+y_1=z_1$. Since they are all in the same coset, there exists $d$ such that $x_1,y_1,z_1 \in dH$. Hence $x_1=dx^n$, $y_1=dy^n$, $z_1=dz^n$. Since $dx^n + dy^n = dz^n$ we get $x^n+y^n=z^n$.
END Proof

 \label {le:cube} For all $m,c$ there is a number $H$ such that, for all $c$-colorings of $\Nat ^+$ and all intervals of length $H$ in $\Nat ^+$, there is a monochromatic $m$-cube within the interval.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 We fix $c$. We will let $H_m$ be a value of $H$ that satisfies the theorem. We prove, by induction on $m$, that $H_m$ always exists. For the base case $m = 1$, we can take $H_1 = c + 1$. This just says that for any $c$-coloring of an interval of length $c + 1$ there will be two elements that are the same color. Taking $\beta $ to be the smaller one and $\beta + \mu _1$ the larger one, $C(\beta ;\mu _1)$ is a monochromatic 1-cube. \par For the induction step, assume that $h = H_{m-1}$ exists. We show that, for any $c$-coloring of an interval of length $H_m = h \!\cdot \! (1 + c^h)$, there is a monochromatic $m$-cube. Let $COL$ be a $c$-coloring of an interval of length $H_m$. Partition the interval into $1 + c^h$ blocks of size $h$. By the pigeonhole principle, some two of those blocks have the same sequence of $h$ colors. By the induction hypothesis, the former has a monochromatic $(m-1)$-cube $C(\beta ;\mu _1,\dots ,\mu _{m-1})$, and since the color sequence of the latter is the same, it has $C(\beta ';\mu _1,\dots ,\mu _{m-1})$ with the same color and increments but $\beta ' > \beta $. Take $\mu _m = \beta ' - \beta $. Then $C(\beta ;\mu _1,\dots ,\mu _m)$ is the required monochromatic $m$-cube. This proves the lemma statement with $H = H_m$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma 12  
 Let $H,c > 0$ and let $A$ be a subset of $[1,\dots ,H]$ such that $|A| \geq H/c$. Then for some constant $C$ depending only on $c$, $A$ contains an $m$-cube where $m \geq \log \log (H) - C$.

BEGIN Lemma 15  
 \label {lem:factors} \begin {enumerate} \item If a monic polynomial in $\Zed [y]$ factors in $\Que [y]$, then it factors in $\Zed [y]$. \item A polynomial $\psi (y)$ divides a polynomial $f \in \Zed [x,y]$ if and only if, upon writing \[ f(x,y) = a_0(y)x^{n} + a_1(y)x^{n-1} +\cdots + a_{n-1}(y)x + a_n(y), \] we have that $\psi (y)$ is a factor of each $a_j(y)$. \item If $\psi (y)$ is irreducible and divides $f\cdot g$, where $g \in \Zed [x,y]$ is written as \[ g(x,y) = b_0(y)x^{n} + b_1(y)x^{n-1} +\cdots + b_{n-1}(y)x + b_n(y), \] then either $\psi (y)$ is a factor of all $a_i(y)$ or it is a factor of all $b_i(y)$. \item If $f(x,y)$ can be factored into the product of two polynomials in $x$ whose coefficients are rational functions of $y$ with integral coefficients, i.e., belong to $\Que (y)[x]$, then it can be factored into the product of two polynomials in $\Zed [x,y]$. \end {enumerate}
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Part (a) can be understood as saying the product of two monic polynomials, each with at least one rational noninteger coefficient, must have at least one rational noninteger coefficient. The intuition for (b) and (c) is that since $x$ occurs nowhere else, it cannot help $\psi (y)$ divide $f$ or $f\cdot g$ any other way than stated; proofs may be found in B\^ocher \cite [pp.~203--204]{Boc}. To prove (d), we write the given factorization in the form \[ f(x,y) = \frac {f_1(x,y)}{\varphi _1(y)}\cdot \frac {f_2(x,y)}{\varphi _2(y)}, \] where $f_1(x,y)$, $f_2(x,y)$, $\varphi _1(y)$ and $\varphi _2(y)$ are integral polynomials such that $f_1$ is not divisible by any factor of $\varphi _1(y)$ and $f_2$ is not divisible by any factor of $\varphi _2(y)$. By part~(c), since $f_1 \cdot f_2$ is divisible by $\varphi _1 \cdot \varphi _2$, $f_1$ has the complete polynomial $\varphi _2$ as a factor and $f_2$ has the complete polynomial $\varphi _1$ as a factor. By~(b) we can cancel $\varphi _2$ from the coefficients of $f_1$ and we can cancel $\varphi _1$ from the coefficients of~$f_2$. This gives us our factorization into two polynomials in $\Zed [x,y]$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Proposition~\ref {prop:Que2Zed}] Let $t_1 \geq t_0$ in the hypothesis of Theorem~\ref {thm:goal}. Recall that $g(y,t) = f(\frac {y}{T},t)$ for any $t$. Since $f(x,t_1)$ factors in $\Zed [x]$, $g(y,t_1)$ factors in $\Que [y]$. But since $g(y,t_1)$ is an integral polynomial and is monic in the one variable $y$, it factors in $\Zed [y]$ by Gauss's polynomial lemma. \par Thus we have satisfied the hypothesis of Theorem~\ref {thm:goal}---and with the same $t_0$ as in Theorem~\ref {irreducibility-contra}. Assuming its conclusion gives us \[ g(y,t) = \Psi (y,t) \Psi '(y,t), \] where $\Psi (y,t)$ and $\Psi '(y,t)$ belong to $\Que [y,t]$. Substituting back $y = xT$ yields the following equation for our original polynomial: \[ f(x,t) = \frac {\Phi (x,t) \Phi '(x,t)}{AT^{n-1}}, \] where $\Phi (x,t)$ and $\Phi '(x,t)$ both belong to $\Zed [x,t]$, $A \in \Zed $, and $T \in \Zed [t]$ . Now part~(d) of our lemma completes the proof.
