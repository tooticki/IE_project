BEGIN Definition 1  
 \label {def:WLP} $A$ is said to have the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP), if for any $k\in \mathbb {N}$ and for any fixed general linear form $L\in U^\ast $ the multiplication map $\mu _L\colon A_{k}\longrightarrow A_{k+1}$ has maximal rank.
END Definition
 
BEGIN Definition 2  
 We say that $A$ fails the WLP because of surjectivity in degree $k>0$ if one has $\dim A_{k}\geq \dim A_{k+1}$ but the multiplication $\mu _L\colon A_{k}\to A_{k+1}$ is not surjective for any linear form $L$. In analogous way one defines the failure of WLP because of injectivity. In general we say that $A$ has the WLP in degree $k>0$ if for a general linear form $L$ the multiplication map $\mu _L\colon A_{k}\to A_{k+1}$ has maximal rank.
END Definition
 
BEGIN Proposition 1  
 \label {prop:dualWLP} The following facts hold. \begin {enumerate} \item If $\mu _L:A_{k}\to A_{k+1}$ is injective, then $\mu _L:A_{j}\to A_{j+1}$ is injective for any $j\leq k$. \item $A$ is self-dual as it is Gorenstein. As a consequence it is enough to check the WLP in the case of injectivity (resp. in the case of surjectivity). \item If $A$ is a c.i. algebra of type $(d,\ldots ,d)$ then $\operatorname {socle}(A)=A_{(m+1)(d-1)}\cong \C $ and WLP holds for $A$ if for a general linear form $L$ the multiplication map $\mu _L:A_{s}\to A_{s+1}$ is injective, with $s=\lceil (m+1)(d-1)/2\rceil -1$. \end {enumerate}
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proposition 2  
 \label {prop:T} The ideal $I=(f_0,\ldots ,f_m)\subset \C [x_0,\ldots ,x_m]$, with $f_i$ linearly independent and of degree $d$, is a c.i. ideal if and only if $I^{-1}_d$ does not contain any non-zero power of a linear form $p^d\in S^dU$, and in this case $I^{-1}_d$ has dimension ${m+d\choose d}-m-1$.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 $I$ is c.i. if and only if $V(f_0,\ldots ,f_m)=\emptyset $, if and only if there is no $[p]\in \PP (U)$ such that $f_0(p)=\cdots =f_m(p)=0$. But it is well known that $d!f_i(p)=\langle f_i,p^d\rangle $, with $\langle \ ,\rangle \colon S^dU^\ast \otimes S^dU\to \C $ the duality pairing. This shows that $I$ is c.i. if and only if there is no $[p^d]\in \PP (I_d^{-1})$. Moreover $I_d^{-1}=\operatorname {Ann}(I_d)$ with respect to the duality pairing, and this fact explains the dimension formula.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 1  
 \label {rmk:vertexes} Observe that the non-zero homogeneous polynomials $q\in S^\bullet U$ define hypersurfaces $V(q)\subset \PP (U^\ast )$. To any $L\in U^\ast $ we associate a derivative $\partial _L(q)=L(q)$, defined by the action of $S^\bullet U^\ast $ on $S^\bullet U$, and therefore $L(q)=0$ means that the hypersurface $V(q)$ is a cone with a vertex point in $[L]\in \PP (U^\ast )$.
END Remark
 
BEGIN Remark 2  
 The inverse system $I^{-1}$ in association to the study of the WLP of the algebra $A=S^\bullet U^\ast /I$ has been already considered in the literature, for example it is a main theme of the article \cite {MOR}.

BEGIN Proposition 3  
 \label {prop:I_d} If $I=(q_0,\ldots ,q_m)$ is a a c.i. ideal generated by forms of degree $d\geq 2$, then $ \PP (I_d)\cap \nu _d(\PP (U^\ast ))$ is a finite set and $\dim \PP (I_d)\cap S\leq 1$. More generally one has $\dim \PP (I_d)\cap Sec_{r-1}(S)\leq \min (2r-1,m)$.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Assume $\dim \PP (I_2)\cap \nu _2(\PP (U^\ast ))\geq 1$. Consider a irreducible curve $C$ contained in that set, and consider a local analytic parametrization of this curve at a general point of the form $z_\lambda ^d=(z_0+\lambda z_1+O(\lambda ^2))^d=z_0^d+d\lambda z_0^{d-1}z_1+O(\lambda ^2)$. Then $z_0^d, z_0^{d-1}z_1\in I_d$, impossible because otherwise they could be completed to a basis of $I_d$, so they should be a c.i., but they vanish on $V(x_0)$, a contradiction. \par Similarly assume that $\dim \PP (I_d)\cap S\geq 2$. Then there exists a local analytic parametrization of a surface in $\PP (I_d)$ of the form $$z_{\lambda ,\mu }P_{\lambda ,\mu }=(z_0+\lambda z_1+\mu z_2)(P_0+\lambda P_1+\mu P_2)+o(\lambda ,\mu ),$$ which would give $$z_0P_0, z_0P_1+z_1P_0,z_0P_2+z_2P_0 \in I_d.$$ This produces a contradiction by similar reasons as above, since the three elements above are not a c.i., as they vanish on $V(z_0,P_0)$. In the general case, let us assume $m\geq \dim \PP (I_d)\cap Sec_{r-1}(S)\geq 2r$ and let us write a bijective local analytic parametrization of such a family at a general point $$\sum _{i=1}^{r}z_i(\lambda )P_i(\lambda )\in I_d,$$ with $\lambda =(\lambda _1,\ldots ,\lambda _{2r})$. Then one may expand $$\begin {array}{l} z_i(\lambda )=z_i+\sum _j\lambda _j z_{ij}+o(\lambda )\\ P_i(\lambda )=P_i+\sum _j\lambda _j P_{ij}+o(\lambda )\end {array}$$ and find the relations $$\begin {array}{l} \sum _i z_iP_i\in I_d \\\^^M\sum _i(z_iP_{ij}+z_{ij}P_i)\in I_d,\quad \forall \ j=1,\ldots ,2r.\end {array}$$ Now observe that the $2r+1$ forms above are independent by construction and they all vanish on $V(z_1,\ldots ,z_r,P_1,\ldots ,P_r)$, which has codimension $\leq 2r$ in $\PP ^m$, a contradiction, since they should be a complete intersection.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Corollary 4  
 [Injectivity Lemma]\label {cor:injlemma} Let $A=\C [x_0,\ldots ,x_m]/I$ an artinian algebra, with $I$ generated by a regular sequence of forms of degree $d$. Then for general $z\in A_1$ the multiplication map $\mu _z:A_{d-1}\longrightarrow A_d$ is injective.
END Corollary
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Otherwise for any general $[z]\in \PP (U^\ast )$ there exists some $P\in S^{d-1}U^\ast $ such that $zP\in I_d$, (note that such factorization is unique) hence $\dim (\PP (I_d)\cap S)\geq m=\dim \PP (U^\ast )$, but this contradicts the second dimension statement of Proposition \ref {prop:I_d}.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 3  
 \label {rmk:d2m3} In \cite {MN} it was observed that, as a consequence of the result above in the case $d=2$, the WLP holds for $d=2$ and $2\leq m\leq 3$. Indeed in those cases one has $s=\lceil (m+1)(d-1)\rceil -1=1$.
END Remark
 
BEGIN Remark 4  
 Proposition \ref {sec:red_I2} actually gives more precise information than Corollary \ref {cor:injlemma} on the dimension so-called {\em non Lefschetz locus}, that is the locus of $[z]\in \PP (A_1)$ such that the moltiplication map $\mu _z:A_{d-1}\to A_d$ is not injective, by showing that this locus has dimension at most $1$. We refer the reader to the recent article \cite {BoMiRoNa} for many other deep results in this context.

BEGIN Proposition 5  
 \label {prop:stratI2} Set $R_r=\{ [Q]\in \PP (S^2U^\ast )\ |\ \operatorname {rk}(Q)\leq r\}$ for any $1\leq r\leq m$, that is, $R_r$ is the projectivized set of quadrics of rank at most $r$. Let $I$ a c.i. ideal generated by $m+1$ quadrics. Then $\dim \PP (I_2)\cap R_r\leq r-1$.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 We can use induction on $r$. The case $r=1$ is covered already in Proposition \ref {sec:red_I2}. Assume that $\dim \PP (I_2)\cap R_r\geq r>1$ and let $Q$ be a general point in a $r$ dimensional irreducible subvariety of that closed set. Hence, by the inductive hypothesis, it must be $\operatorname {rk}(Q)=r$ and therefore we can write $Q=L_1^2+\cdots +L_r^2$. Since the set of quadratic forms of rank $r$ is a single orbit under the action of $GL(m+1)$, we can find a local analytical parametrization of the given $r$-dimensional component of $\dim \PP (I_2)\cap R_r$ with parameters $\epsilon =(\epsilon _1,\ldots ,\epsilon _r)$ such that $$Q_\epsilon =\sum _{i=1}^r(L_i+\epsilon _1L_{i1}+\cdots +\epsilon _rL_{ir})^2\in \PP (I_2)\cap R_r.$$ Moreover, by construction, we can assume that $Q$, $F_1=\partial _{\epsilon _1}Q_\epsilon |_{\epsilon =0},\ldots ,F_r=\partial _{\epsilon _r}Q_\epsilon |_{\epsilon =0}$ are independent. Then, computing the derivatives above, we find that $$Q=\sum L_i^2,\ F_1=\sum L_iL_{i1},\ \ldots ,\ F_r=\sum _iL_iL_{i,r}$$ are $r+1$ independent elements in $\PP (I_2)$ that vanish on $V(L_1,\ldots , L_r)\not =\emptyset $. Since $r\leq m$ and any base of $I_2$ must be a c.i., we obtain a contradiction.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 5  
 The results of this section, although very simple, strongly depend on the complete intersection hypothesis. They cannot in general be extended to the case of Gorenstein algebras $A$, even when these algebras are presented by quadrics. Indeed infinite series of counterexamples to the result in Corollary \ref {cor:injlemma} in the Gorenstein case have been provided in \cite {GoZa}, see for example their Corollary 3.8.

BEGIN Lemma 6  
 \label {lm:diff} Under the notations above, one has $\dim \langle z_1,\ldots ,z_N\rangle =N-\varepsilon =m$ and $\dim \langle Q_1,\ldots ,Q_N\rangle =N-\delta $. In particular one has $\langle z, z_1,\ldots ,z_N\rangle =U^\ast $. Moreover, the following relations hold, for any $i,j=0,\ldots ,N$. \begin {enumerate} \item [\it {i})] If $Q,Q'\in \pi _1^{-1}([z])$, then $QQ'=0\in A_{2s}$, \item [\it {ii})] $Q\left (\frac {\partial Q}{\partial \lambda _i}\right )=0\in A_{2s}$, \item [\it {iii})] $z\left (\frac {\partial Q}{\partial \lambda _i}\right )\left (\frac {\partial Q}{\partial \lambda _j}\right )=0\in A_{2s+1}$, \item [\it {iv})] For any $h\geq 0$ and for any $1\leq i_1,\ldots ,i_h\leq N$ one has $$z^{h+1}\left (\frac {\partial ^h Q}{\partial \lambda _{i_1}\cdots \partial \lambda _{i_h}}\right )=0\in A_{s+h}.$$ In particular, for any $i$, one has $z^2\frac {\partial Q}{\partial \lambda _i}=0$. \end {enumerate}
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 The first assertions of the Lemma are clear by the fact that $\pi _1(\mathcal {W})=\PP (U^\ast )$, and by the surjectivity of the tangent maps for $\pi _1$ and $\pi _2$ at a general point $([z],[Q])\in \mathcal {W}$. \par By applying $\frac {\partial }{\partial \lambda _i}$ to the relation $zQ=\sum c_j(\lambda )f_i(x)\in I_{s+1}$, with $x=(x_0,\ldots ,x_m)$ a fixed base of $U^\ast $ and $f_j(x)$ a generating set for $I_{s+1}\subset S^{s+1}U$, we immediately see that \begin {equation}\label {eq:basicrel2} z_iQ+z\frac {\partial Q}{\partial \lambda _i}\in I_{s+1}. \end {equation} Multiplying the relation above by $Q'$ and using $zQ'\in I$, we obtain $z_iQQ'\in I_{2s+1}$ and, since $A_1=\langle z,z_1,\ldots ,z_m\rangle $, we see that $A_1\cdot QQ'=\{0\}\subset A_{2r}$. By our choice of $s$ we have $\operatorname {socle}(A)_{2s}=\{0\}$, therefore we find $QQ'\in I_{2s}$. This proves (i). \par Setting $Q=Q'$, by derivations of the last relation, we get $Q\frac {\partial Q}{\partial \lambda _j}\in I_{2s}$. Next, we compute $z\frac {\partial Q}{\partial \lambda _i}\frac {\partial Q}{\partial \lambda _j}=-z_iQ\frac {\partial Q}{\partial \lambda _j}=0$, using (\ref {eq:basicrel2}). This completes the proof of {\it i}), {\it ii}) and {\it iii}). \par \par We prove {\it iv}) by induction on $h$, (we assume that it is true for $h$ and we prove it for $h+1$) the base case being the starting relation $zQ=0$. Let us assume by inductive hypothesis $$z^{h+1}F\in I_{s+h},\quad F=\frac {\partial ^h Q}{\partial \lambda _{i_1}\cdots \partial \lambda _{i_h}}.$$ By derivation with respect to $\lambda _i$ we obtain $$(h+1)z^hz_i F+z^{h+1}\frac {\partial F}{\partial \lambda _i}\in I_{s+h}.$$ Then the inductive step is immediately proved by multiplying this last relation by $z$ and using that $z^{h+1}F\in I_{s+h}$. \par

BEGIN Fact 5  
 \label {fact:HF} Let $A$ be the artinian algebra obtained from a complete intersection of quadrics in $\PP ^m$. Then one has $HF(A,k)=\dim A_k={m+1\choose k}$ for any $k\geq 0$.
END Fact
 
BEGIN Lemma 7  
 \label {lm:bdeltageq1} Let $A$ be a c.i. artinian algebra as above, with $m\geq 4$. Then the following properties hold. \begin {enumerate} \item For any two distinct points $[z],[w]\in \PP (U)$ one has $\dim \langle z,w\rangle A_1\geq 2m-1$. \item Denoting $\overline {\varUpsilon }$ the subvariety of $Gr(m-2,\PP (U))$ whose points are the $(m-2)$-planes $\Pi =V(z,w)\in Gr(m-2,\PP (U))$ such that $\dim \langle z,w\rangle A_1= 2m-1$, then $\dim \overline {\varUpsilon }\leq 3$. \end {enumerate}
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 {(1).} One has $\langle z,w\rangle A_1=(\langle z,w\rangle U^\ast +I_2)/I_2\cong \langle z,w\rangle U^\ast /(\langle z,w\rangle U^\ast \cap I_2)$. Note that $\dim \langle z,w\rangle U^\ast =2(m+1)-1=2m+1$, as it is the degree $2$ piece of the ideal generated by $z,w$. Therefore, the general bound $\dim \langle z,w\rangle A_1\geq 2m-1$ is equivalent to $\dim (\langle z,w\rangle U^\ast \cap I_2)\leq 2$. But this latter fact is clearly true, because $I_2$ is generated by a complete intersection and therefore at most $2$ independent element of $I_2$ can define hypersurfaces that contain the $2$-codimensional linear space $\Pi =V(z,w)$. \paragraph {(2)} By the calculations in the proof of statement (1), the only possibility for obtaining $\dim \langle z,w\rangle A_1= 2m-1$ is $$\dim \PP (\langle z,w\rangle U^\ast \cap I_2)=1.$$ Let us introduce the incidence variety $$\mathcal {Y}=\{(\Pi ,[F])\ |\ \Pi \in \operatorname {Gr}(m-2,\PP (U)),\ [F]\in \PP (I_2),\ \Pi \subset V(F)\},$$ endowed with the two projections $$\pi _1(\Pi ,[F])=\Pi ,\quad \pi _2(\Pi ,[F])=[F]$$ to $Gr(m-2,\PP (U))$ and $\PP (I_2)$, respectively. Let also introduce the subvariety $$\varUpsilon =\{(\Pi ,[F])\in \mathcal {Y}\ |\ \dim \pi _1^{-1}(\Pi )=1\}.$$ Then the variety in the statement is $$\overline {\varUpsilon }=\pi _1(\varUpsilon ).$$ Note that, setting $\Pi =V(z,w)$, then $\PP (\langle z,w\rangle U^\ast \cap I_2)=\pi _2\pi _1^{-1}(\Pi )$. As we have shown above, these spaces are all lines for any $\Pi \in \overline {\varUpsilon }$ and hence the irreducible components of $\varUpsilon $ are the inverse images of the irreducible components of $\overline {\varUpsilon }=\pi _1(\varUpsilon )$. We denote $$\overline {\varUpsilon }=\overline {\varUpsilon }_1\cup \cdots \cup \overline {\varUpsilon }_r, \quad \varUpsilon =\varUpsilon _1\cup \cdots \cup \varUpsilon _r,\quad \varUpsilon _i=\pi _1^{-1}(\overline {\varUpsilon }_i)$$ the corresponding decomposition into irreducible components. Observe that $\dim \varUpsilon _i=\dim \overline {\varUpsilon _i}+1$. \par Note also that $(\Pi ,[F])\in \varUpsilon $ implies $F=zL+wM$, with $\Pi =V(z,w)$, which implies that $[F]\in R_4$, and of course $\Pi $ is one of the $(m-2)$-planes contained in $V(F)$. Hence $\pi _2(\varUpsilon )\subseteq \PP (I_2)\cap R_4$ and for any $[F]\in \pi _2(\varUpsilon )$ one has $$\pi _1(\pi _2|_{\varUpsilon })^{-1}([F])\subseteq \{\Pi \ |\ \Pi \subset V(F)\}.$$ \par If for some $\Pi \in \overline {\varUpsilon }$ it were $\pi _2\pi _1^{-1}(\Pi ) \subseteq R_2$, then $\dim \PP (\langle z,w\rangle U^\ast \cap I_2)=\dim \pi _2\pi _1^{-1}(\Pi )=1$ means that $\Pi =V(z,w)$ is contained in a pencil of rank $2$ (and hence reducible) quadrics $F_{\lambda ,\mu }\in I_2$. Such a pencil has the form either $(\lambda z+\mu w)L$ or $(\alpha z+\beta w)M_{\lambda ,\mu }$. In any case the given pencil has a fixed hyperplane component, and therefore it cannot be contained in $I_2$, since this latter is generated by a complete intersection. So $\pi _2\pi _1^{-1}(\Pi ) \subseteq R_2$ is impossible. Then we have that for any component $\varUpsilon _i$ of $\varUpsilon $ a general point $(\Pi ,[F])\in \varUpsilon _i$ is such that $\operatorname {rk}(F)\geq 3$. \vskip 2mm \par It is well known that any quadric $[F]$ of rank $3$ or $4$ has the family of linear spaces $\Pi \cong \PP ^{m-2}$ contained in $V(F)$ of dimension $1$, hence for a general $[F]\in \pi _2(\varUpsilon _i)$ one has $(\dim \pi _2|_\varUpsilon )^{-1}([F])\leq 1$. Therefore we have shown that for any $i=1,\ldots ,r$ one has \begin {equation}\label {eq:dimUpsiloni}\dim \varUpsilon _i=\dim (\overline \varUpsilon _i)+1\leq \dim \pi _2(\varUpsilon _i)+1.\end {equation} By Proposition \ref {prop:stratI2} we know that $\dim \PP (I_2)\cap R_4\leq 3$ and, since $\pi _2(\varUpsilon _i)\subseteq \PP (I_2)\cap R_4$, we have $\dim \pi _2(\varUpsilon _i)\leq 3$ and therefore $\dim \varUpsilon _i\leq 4$ and $\dim \overline {\varUpsilon }_i\leq 3$. \par

 The embedded tangent space to the image of the map $\pi _2:\mathcal {W}\longrightarrow \PP (A_2)$ defined by $([z],[Q])\mapsto Q\in \PP (A_2)$ is given by $\langle Q, Q_1,\ldots ,Q_N\rangle /\langle Q\rangle $, hence it has dimension equal to $\dim \langle Q,Q_1,\ldots ,Q_N\rangle -1$.

 Assume that $\dim \mathcal {Z}(Q)\geq 3$. Then consider $g\in S^5U$ such that $I^{-1}$ is generated by $g$ as a $S^\bullet U^\ast $-module. Since $zQ=0$ for any $z\in \mathcal {Z}(Q)$, then, by Remark \ref {rmk:vertexes}, the cubic $Q(g)\in S^3U$ is a cone with vertex space $\PP \mathcal {Z}(Q)$, and we are assuming $\dim \PP \mathcal {Z}(Q)\geq 2$. But then, in a suitable coordinate system, $Q(g)$ is defined by a degree three homogeneous polynomial in two variables, which therefore may written in a suitable coordinate system as $f(x,y)=x(\alpha _1x+\beta _1y)(\alpha _2x+\beta _2y)$. Then one can easily see the vector space generated by $f_x$ and $f_y$, contained in $I^{-1}_2$ by the construction resumed in section 2.1, always contains the square of some linear form, obtaining a contradiction by Proposition \ref {prop:T}.

BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of the Claim] Recalling that $A_1=U^\ast /I_1=U^\ast $, the claim is equivalent to assert that $VU^\ast +I_2=S^2U^\ast $. First of all, using the fact that $V$ is the space of linear forms vanishing on one point $p\in \PP ^m=\PP (U)$, that is $V=H^0\mathcal {I}_p(1)$, we see that $VU^\ast =H^0\mathcal {I}_p(2)$ and it has dimension $\dim S^2U^\ast -1=14$. Then $VU^\ast +I_2\subsetneq S^2U^\ast $ if and only if $$\dim (VU^\ast \cap I_2)\geq 1+ \dim I_2+\dim VU^\ast -\dim S^2U^\ast =5.$$ But this means that in $I_2\subseteq VU^\ast =H^0\mathcal {I}_p(2)$, which is impossible.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Assume that WLP does not hold. In view of Lemma \ref {lm:ZQbound}, we have two cases. \vskip 2mm \paragraph {\bf Case 1: $\delta = 1$} Then, by Lemma \ref {lm:cokermuQ} we have $$\dim \ker \mu _Q=\dim A_2-\dim A_4+\dim \operatorname {coker}\mu _Q=5+\delta +1=7.$$ Since $\mathcal {Z}(Q)A_1\subseteq \ker \mu _Q$ and $\dim \mathcal {Z}(Q)A_1\geq 7$ by Lemma \ref {lm:bdeltageq1}, we have $$\dim \mathcal {Z}(Q)A_1=7.$$ Then Lemma \ref {lm:bdeltageq1} applies to this case. The planes $\Pi =V(z,w)$, with $\langle z,w\rangle =\PP (\mathcal {Z}(Q))=\pi _1^{-1}([Q])$, for $Q$ varying in $\pi _2(\mathcal {W})$, form a irreducible family of dimension equal to $\dim \pi _2(\mathcal {W})=4+\varepsilon -\delta =3+\varepsilon $, by formula (\ref {eq:dimW}) in Section \ref {sec:diff}. But by (2) of Lemma \ref {lm:bdeltageq1}, we know that such a family is actually $3$-dimensional, hence $\varepsilon =0$. In this case we have $\dim \pi _2(\mathcal {W})=3$ and $\dim \mathcal {W}=4$. A general fiber of $\pi _1:\mathcal {W}\to \PP (A_1)=\PP ^4$ is one point and for any $[Q]\in \pi _2(\mathcal {W})$ one has $\pi _1\pi _2^{-1}([Q])$ a line in $\PP (A_1)$. Moreover $\PP (A_1)$ is clearly covered with such lines. \par Then we take $[z]\in \PP (A_1)$ general and consider the unique $[Q]$ with $([z],[Q])\in \mathcal {W}$. Of course the line $l=\pi _1\pi _2^{-1}([Q])$ contains $z$. \par Now let us consider the sheaf map $\Phi $ (\ref {eq:Kbundle}) described at the beginning of Section \ref {sec:d=2m=4}, and let us restrict it to $l\cong \PP ^1$. We obtain an exact sequence of sheaves $$0\to \mathcal {K}_l\to A_2\otimes \OO _{\PP ^1}\stackrel {\Phi _l}\longrightarrow A_3\otimes \OO _{\PP ^1}(1)\longrightarrow \mathcal {N}_l\to 0,$$ with $\mathcal {K}_l$ and $\mathcal {N}_l$ defined as the sheaf kernel and cokernel of $\Phi _l$, respectively. \par Now, the fact that $\varepsilon =0$ implies that $\mathcal {K}_l$ is a rank $1$ torsion free sheaf on $\PP ^1$, hence it is a line bundle $\mathcal {K}_l\cong \OO _{\PP ^1}(t)$ with $t\leq 0$. A priori the sheaf inclusion $\mathcal {K}_l\hookrightarrow A_2\otimes \OO _{\PP ^1}$ may not be a vector bundle embedding, i.e. the associated fiber map $\mathcal {K}_l([w])\to A_2$ may be $0$ at some point $[w]\in \PP ^1$. However, since the zero constant $Q\in A_2$ belongs to $\ker \Phi _l([w])$ for any $[w]\in l=\pi _1\pi _2^{-1}([Q])$, we see that the vector bundle embedding $\OO _{\PP ^1}\stackrel {Q}\longrightarrow A_2\otimes \OO _{\PP ^1}$ factors through $\mathcal {K}_l$, which induces an isomorphism $\OO _{\PP ^1}\cong \mathcal {K}_l$. Then the exact sequence of sheaves above becomes a vector bundle exact sequence $$0\to \OO _{\PP ^1}\to A_2\otimes \OO _{\PP ^1}\stackrel {\Phi }\longrightarrow A_3\otimes \OO _{\PP ^1}(1)\longrightarrow \mathcal {N}_l\to 0.$$ The symmetry of $\Phi $ implies that $\mathcal {N}_l=\mathcal {K}_l^\ast (1)=\OO _{\PP ^1}(1)$ and this is impossible by degree reasons, as $\dim A_2=\dim A_3=10$. \vskip 2mm \paragraph {\bf Case 2: $\delta =0$} Then $\mathcal {Z}(Q)=\langle z\rangle $ and, by Lemma \ref {lm:kermuQ}, we have $$zA_1+\langle Q, Q_1,\ldots ,Q_N\rangle \subseteq \ker \mu _Q.$$ Since $z$ is general and hence we can apply the result of Corollary \ref {cor:injlemma}, we have $$\dim zA_1=5.$$ Moreover, by Lemma \ref {lm:cokermuQ}, we have $$\dim \ker \mu _Q=\dim A_2-\dim A_4+\delta +1=6$$ and finally, by Lemma \ref {lm:spanQi}, we have $$\dim \langle Q, Q_1,\ldots ,Q_N\rangle =5+\varepsilon .$$ Then it is easy to conclude that $$\dim (zA_1\cap \langle Q ,Q_1,\ldots ,Q_N\rangle )\geq 4+\varepsilon \geq 4.$$ Now we consider a subspace $V\subseteq \mu _z^{-1}(zA_1\cap \langle Q ,Q_1,\ldots ,Q_N\rangle )\subset A_1$ with $\dim V=4$. \vskip 2mm \paragraph {\em Claim} $A_2=VA_1$. \begin {proof}[Proof of the Claim] Recalling that $A_1=U^\ast /I_1=U^\ast $, the claim is equivalent to assert that $VU^\ast +I_2=S^2U^\ast $. First of all, using the fact that $V$ is the space of linear forms vanishing on one point $p\in \PP ^m=\PP (U)$, that is $V=H^0\mathcal {I}_p(1)$, we see that $VU^\ast =H^0\mathcal {I}_p(2)$ and it has dimension $\dim S^2U^\ast -1=14$. Then $VU^\ast +I_2\subsetneq S^2U^\ast $ if and only if $$\dim (VU^\ast \cap I_2)\geq 1+ \dim I_2+\dim VU^\ast -\dim S^2U^\ast =5.$$ But this means that in $I_2\subseteq VU^\ast =H^0\mathcal {I}_p(2)$, which is impossible. \end {proof} Then we have $zA_2=zVA_1 \subset \langle Q, Q_1,\ldots ,Q_N\rangle A_1$, which, by Lemma \ref {lm:diff} (iv) implies $$z^3A_2 \subset z^2\langle Q, Q_1,\ldots ,Q_N\rangle A_1=\{0\},$$ hence, since the socle of $A$ is generated in degree $5$, one finds $z^3=0$. But this is impossible for general $z\in A_1$, since the $z^3$'s with $z$ general generate $A_3$.
END Proof
