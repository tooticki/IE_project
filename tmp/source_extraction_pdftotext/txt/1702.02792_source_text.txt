BEGIN Proof 
 Let $f$ be a measurable solution for ${B}$ over $\alpha $ and define a map $\pi \colon \dom (f) \to \operatorname {Sol}({B})$ by setting $\pi (x) \coloneqq f_x$ for all $x \in \dom (f)$. By definition, $\pi $ is equivariant, so the pushforward measure $\pi _\ast (\mu )$ is invariant, as desired.
END Proof
