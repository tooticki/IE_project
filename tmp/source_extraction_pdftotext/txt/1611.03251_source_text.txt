 [Proof of Fact \ref {f2}] Let us apply the operator $A_m$ for fixed $m\in [n]\setminus (X_i\cup \{i\})$ to (\ref {e3}). Because vectors $\mathbf v_j$, $j\in X_i\cup \{i\}$, are eigenvectors of $A_m$ thus we get $$\lambda _{i,m} \mathbf v_i=\sum _{j\in X_i}\lambda _{j,m}\mu _{i,j}\mathbf v_j,$$ where $\lambda _{j,m}$, $j\in \{i\}\cup X_i$, is the eigenvalue corresponding to the operator $A_m$ and the eigenvector $\mathbf v_j$. Because vectors $\mathbf v_j$, $j\in X_j\subset [k+1, n]$, are linearly independent therefore $\lambda _{j,m}=\lambda $ for all $j\in \{i\}\cup X_i$. Thus the operator $A_m$ is a scalar operator on $H_i$.

 [Proof of Theorem \ref {theorem:hellyinvariansubspaces} using Lemma \ref {lemma:subsets}] Suppose that we proved Theorem \ref {theorem:hellyinvariansubspaces} for any family $\mathcal {A}$ containing $A_0$ of size less then $n$, where $n\geqslant 2d$. Let us prove Theorem \ref {theorem:hellyinvariansubspaces} for a family $\mathcal A=\{A_0,A_1\dots , A_{n-1}\}$. By induction hypothesis, for any $j\in [n-1]$ there exists an invariant non-trivial subspace $H_j$ such that it is an invariant for all operators but $A_j$. \par Denote eigenvectors of $A_0$ by $\mathbf v_1,\dots , \mathbf v_d$. Since these vectors are associated with different eigenvalues, they forms a basis of $\mathbb K^d$. Therefore, for any non-trivial invariant subspace $H$ of $A_0$ there exists $I\subseteq [d]$ such that $H=span(\mathbf v_i: i\in I).$ Indeed, assume the contrary, i.e. $H\ne span(\mathbf v_i, i\in I)$ for any $I\subseteq [d]$, i.e. there are vectors in $H$ such that they could be represented as sums of eigenvectors of $A_0$ that do not belong to $H$. Choose such a vector $\mathbf v$ that it has the minimal number of terms in its representation, i.e. \begin {equation}\label {eq:sum}\mathbf v=\sum _{i=1}^k\alpha _i\mathbf v_{l_i},\end {equation} where $\mathbf v_{l_i}\not \in H$, $\alpha _{i}\in \mathbb K, \alpha _i\ne 0,$ $i\in [k]$, and $k>1$ is minimal. Applying $A_0$ to \eqref {eq:sum} we get that \begin {equation}\label {eq:sum2} \mathbf v'=\sum _{i=1}^k \alpha _i\lambda _{l_i} \mathbf v_{l_i}\in H, \end {equation} where $\lambda _{l_i}\in \mathbb K$, $i\in [k]$, is the eigenvalue of $A_0$ corresponding to the eigenvector $\mathbf v_{l_i}$. Therefore, we have that the vector $$\mathbf v'-\lambda _{l_k} \mathbf v=\sum _{i=1}^{k-1} \alpha _i(\lambda _{l_i}-\lambda _{l_k})\mathbf v_{l_i}\in H$$ can be represented as the sum of $k-1$ eigenvectors of $A_0$ that do not belong to $H$. This contradiction shows that for each $i$, $i\in [n-1]$, we can assign a non-empty subset $M_i\subset [d]$ such that $H_i=span(\mathbf v_i:i\in M_i)$ because $H_i$ are invariant subspaces of $A_0$. By Lemma~\ref {lemma:subsets} there exists a non-empty set $I\subset [d]$ such that $$M=\bigcup _{i\in I}M_i= \bigcup _{i\in I\setminus \{j\}} M_i\ne [d]$$ for any $j\in I$, i.e. $span(\mathbf v_j:j\in M)\ne \mathbb K^d$ is a common non-trivial invariant subspace of all operators in the family~$\mathcal A$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Lemma \ref {lemma:subsets}] The proof is by induction on $q$. For $q=1$, there is nothing to prove. Assume that the inequality $p\leq 2q-2$ is proved for $q< n$, let us prove it for $q=n$. A non-empty subset $I\subseteq [p]$ is called \emph {interesting} if $\bigcup _{i\in I} M_i\ne M_j$ for any $j\in [p]$ and $\bigcup _{i\in I}M_i\ne [q]$. Assume that there is at least one interesting subset and choose an interesting subset $J$ that has the maximal cardinality. Note that there is $k\in J$ such that $M_k$ contains an \emph {unique element}, i.e. there is $x\in M_k$ such that $x\not \in M_j$ for any $j\in I\setminus \{k\}$. Let us consider the following family $\mathcal {N} =\{N_1, \dots , N_p\}$, where $N_k=\bigcup _{i\in J} M_i$ and $N_i=M_i$ for $i\ne k$. Note that for any $l \in [p]\setminus J$ we have $N_k\subset N_l$ or $N_k\cup N_l=[q]$. In the converse case, we get the interesting subset $J\cup \{l\}$ that should have the larger cardinality then $J$. Let us check that the condition of the lemma holds for the new family. Trivially, it holds for any $I\subseteq [q]\setminus \{k\}$ and $I\subseteq J$ (because $x\in N_k$ and $x\not \in N_i$, $i\in J$). Let us check that the condition holds for $I$ such that $k, l\in I$, where $l\not \in J$. We know that the condition holds for the family $\mathcal {M}$ and $I'=I\cup J$. If $\bigcup _{i\in I'} M_i=[q]$ then $\bigcup _{i\in I}N_i=[q]$. If there is $k'\in I'$ such that $M_{k'}$ contains an unique element $y$ then, since $N_k=\bigcup _{i\in I}M_i\subset N_l=M_l$, we get $k'\not \in J$. It is easy to check that the condition holds for the family $\mathcal N$ and $I$ because $N_{k'}=M_{k'}$ has the unique element $y$. \par We make such replacements of the family till it is possible. Obviously, we can not do them infinitely many times because after each replacement the total cardinality of sets increases. Finally, we get a family $\mathcal {M'}$ that for every two subsets in $\mathcal {M}'$ one contains another or their union is $[q]$. Without loss of generality assume that a subset $A=\{1,\dots , t\}\in \mathcal {M}'$ such that it does not contain another subset in $\mathcal {M}$. Denote by $K_1, \dots , K_l\in \mathcal {M}$ subsets that do not contain $A$, i.e. $[q]\setminus A\subseteq K_i$. We can certainly assume that $K_l\cap A=\emptyset $ (if for every $K_i$ we have $K_i\cap A\ne \emptyset $ then we can add the subset $[q]\setminus A$ to the family $\mathcal M'$). Note that the family $\{K_i\cap A: i\in [l-1]\}$ (where the role of $q$ is played by $k$) satisfies condition of the lemma. By the induction hypothesis, we get $l-1\leqslant 2k-2$, i.e. $l\leqslant 2k-1$. If we delete $A$ and $K_i$ from the family $\mathcal M'$ (i.e. at most $2k$ subsets) and delete elements $1,\dots , k$ from other subsets in $\mathcal {M}'$ then the new family satisfies the condition of the lemma, i.e. it has at most $2(q-k)-2$ subsets. Thus the original family $\mathcal {M}$ contains at most $2k+2(q-k)-2=2q-2$ subsets.
END Proof
