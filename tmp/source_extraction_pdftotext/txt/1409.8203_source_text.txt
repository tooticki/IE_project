BEGIN Theorem 1.2  
 \label {mainthmH2BER} There exist a one-dimensional Banach $\mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})$-bimodule~$X$ and a linear in\-jec\-tion from the Banach algebra~$\mathscr {B}(\ell _2(\N ))$ of bounded operators on the Hilbert space~$\ell _2(\N )$ into the second continuous Hochschild cohomology group of~$\mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})$ with coefficients in~$X$. Hence~$\mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})$ has homological bidimension at least two.

BEGIN Proposition 2.2  
 \label {pullbacksandsplittingsofextensions} Let~$\mathscr {A}$, $\mathscr {B}$, and~$\mathscr {C}$ be Banach algebras such that there are extensions \begin {equation}\label {ext1} \spreaddiagramcolumns {2ex}\xymatrix {\{0\}\ar [r] & \ker \alpha \ar [r] & \mathscr {A}\ar ^-{\displaystyle {\alpha }}[r] & \mathscr {C}\ar [r] & \{0\}} \end {equation} and \begin {equation}\label {ext2} \spreaddiagramcolumns {2ex}\xymatrix {\{0\}\ar [r] & \ker \beta \ar [r] & \mathscr {B}\ar ^-{\displaystyle {\beta }}[r] & \mathscr {C}\ar [r] & \{0\}\smashw {,}} \end {equation} and define $\mathscr {D}$, $\gamma $, and $\delta $ by~\eqref {expldefnpullback} and~\eqref {defngammadelta}, above. Then~$\delta $ is surjective, and the following statements concerning the extension \begin {equation}\label {ext3} \spreaddiagramcolumns {2ex}\xymatrix {\{0\}\ar [r] & \ker \delta \ar [r] & \mathscr {D}\ar ^-{\displaystyle {\delta }}[r] & \mathscr {B}\ar [r] & \{0\}} \end {equation} hold true: \begin {romanenumerate} \item \label {pullbacksandsplittingsofextensions1} \eqref {ext3} is singular if and only if~\eqref {ext1} is singular. \item \label {pullbacksandsplittingsofextensions2} Suppose that~\eqref {ext2} splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible). Then \eqref {ext3} splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible) if and only if~\eqref {ext1} splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible). \end {romanenumerate}
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 The surjectivity of~$\alpha $ implies that~$\delta $ is surjective, so that~\eqref {ext3} is indeed an extension. \par \romanref {pullbacksandsplittingsofextensions1}. The restriction of~$\gamma $ to~$\ker \delta $ is an isomorphism onto~$\ker \alpha $, and the conclusion follows. \par \romanref {pullbacksandsplittingsofextensions2}. Let $\rho \colon \mathscr {C}\to \mathscr {B}$ be a continuous algebra homomorphism which is a right inverse of~$\beta $. \par $\Rightarrow $. Suppose that $\tau \colon \mathscr {B}\to \mathscr {D}$ is a continuous algebra homomorphism which is a right inverse of~$\delta $. Then a direct calculation shows that the continuous algebra homomorphism $\gamma \circ \tau \circ \rho $ is a right inverse of~$\alpha $, so that~\eqref {ext1} splits strongly. \par $\Leftarrow $. Suppose that $\sigma \colon \mathscr {C}\to \mathscr {A}$ is a continuous algebra homomorphism which is a right inverse of~$\alpha $. Then, setting $\tau (b) = (\sigma (\beta (b)), b)$ for each $b\in \mathscr {B}$, we obtain a continuous algebra homomorphism \mbox {$\tau \colon \mathscr {B}\to \mathscr {D}$}. The definition of~$\delta $ implies that~$\tau $ is a right inverse of~$\delta $, and hence~\eqref {ext3} splits strongly. \par The proof just given applies equally to establish the other two cases.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem~{\normalfont {\ref {mainthm}}}] Our aim is to apply Proposition~\ref {pullbacksandsplittingsofextensions} with $\mathscr {B} = \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {R}})$, $\mathscr {C} = \ell _2(\N )^{\sim }$, and $\beta = \psi $. Theorem~\ref {WEBEsplitexact} shows that, for these choices, we have an extension of the form~\eqref {ext2} which splits strongly. \par Let $q\colon \ell _1(\N )\to \ell _2(\N )$ be a bounded, linear surjection. Then $\ker q$ is not complemented in~$\ell _1(\N )$ because no (complemented) subspace of~$\ell _1(\N )$ is isomorphic to~$\ell _2(\N )$. Equip~$\ell _1(\N )$ with the trivial product, let $\mathscr {A} = \ell _1(\N )\oplus \K 1$ be its unitization (defined analogously to the unitization of~$\ell _2(\N )$, above), and define $\alpha \colon \mathscr {A}\to \mathscr {C}$ by $\alpha (x+\lambda 1) = q(x)+\lambda 1$ for $x\in \ell _1(\N )$ and $\lambda \in \K $. Then~$\alpha $ is a continuous, surjective algebra homomorphism with kernel~$\ker q$, which is uncomplemented in~$\ell _1(\N )$ and hence in~$\mathscr {A}$, so that we have a singular, non-admissible ex\-ten\-sion of the form~\eqref {ext1}. \par Being surjective, $q$ has a linear right inverse $\rho \colon \ell _2(\N )\to \ell _1(\N )$, which is multiplicative be\-cause $\ell _1(\N )$ and $\ell _2(\N )$ both have the trivial product. Extend~$\rho $ to a linear map between the uni\-ti\-za\-tions~$\mathscr {C}$ and~$\mathscr {A}$ by making it unital. Then it is an algebra homomorphism which is a right inverse of~$\alpha $, so that the extension~\eqref {ext1} splits algebraically. Hence Proposition~\ref {pullbacksandsplittingsofextensions} pro\-duces a singular extension~\eqref {ext3} of $\mathscr {B} = \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {R}})$ which splits algebraically, but is not admissible.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem~{\normalfont {\ref {mainthmH2BER}}}] By Theorem~\ref {WEBEsplitexact}, there are continuous algebra homomorphisms \[ \psi \colon \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})\to \ell _2(\N )^{\sim } \qquad \text {and}\qquad \rho \colon \ell _2(\N )^{\sim }\to \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}}) \] such that~$\rho $ is a right inverse of~$\psi $. The definition of the unitization implies that we can find maps $\psi _0\colon \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})\to \ell _2(\N )$ and $\theta \colon \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})\to \mathbb {K}$ such that \[ \psi (T) = \psi _0(T) + \theta (T)1\qquad (T\in \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})). \] We see that~$\theta $ is a continuous algebra homomorphism, and $X = \mathbb {K}$ is a one-dimensional Banach $\mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})$-bimodule with respect to the operations \begin {equation}\label {onedimbimodDefns} T\cdot \lambda = \theta (T)\lambda \qquad \text {and}\qquad \lambda \cdot T = \theta (T)\lambda \qquad (T\in \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}}),\,\lambda \in X). \end {equation} Moreover, $\psi _0$ is bounded and linear. Consequently, for each $U\in \mathscr {B}(\ell _2(\N ))$, we can define a continuous, bilinear map $\Upsilon _U\colon \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})\times \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})\to X$ by \begin {equation}\label {DefnUpsilonU} \Upsilon _U(S,T) = \langle U(\psi _0(S)),\psi _0(T)\rangle \qquad (S,T\in \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})), \end {equation} where $\langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle $ denotes the usual Banach-space duality bracket on~$\ell _2(\N )$, that is, $\langle x,y\rangle = \sum _{n=1}^\infty x_ny_n$ for $x=(x_n)$ and $y=(y_n)$ in~$\ell _2(\N )$. The map~$\psi _0$ is not multiplicative; more precisely, since~$\ell _2(\N )$ has trivial multiplication, we have \[ \psi _0(ST) = \theta (S)\psi _0(T) + \theta (T)\psi _0(S)\qquad (S,T\in \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})). \] A straightforward verification based on this identity shows that~$\Upsilon _U$ is a $2$-cocycle. Hence we have a map $\Upsilon \colon U\mapsto \Upsilon _U,\, \mathscr {B}(\ell _2(\N ))\to \mathscr {Z}^2(\mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}}), X)$, which is clearly linear. \par Suppose that~$\Upsilon _U$ is a $2$-coboundary for some $U\in \mathscr {B}(\ell _2(\N ))$, so that $\Upsilon _U = \delta ^1\Omega $ for some bounded, linear map $\Omega \colon \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})\to X$. Since~$\rho $ is a right inverse of~$\psi $, we see that $\psi _0(\rho (x)) = x$ and $\theta (\rho (x)) = 0$ for each $x\in \ell _2(\N )$. Combining these identities with the definitions~\eqref {coboundDefn}--\eqref {DefnUpsilonU}, we obtain \[ \langle Ux, y\rangle = (\delta ^1\Omega )(\rho (x),\rho (y)) = \theta (\rho (x))\Omega (\rho (y)) - \Omega (\rho (x)\rho (y)) + \theta (\rho (y))\Omega (\rho (x)) = 0 \] for each $x,y\in \ell _2(\N )$ because $\rho (x)\rho (y) = \rho (xy) = 0$. This shows that $ U= 0$, so that~$0$ is the only $2$-coboundary in the image of~$\Upsilon $. Hence the composition of~$\Upsilon $ with the quotient map from~$\mathscr {Z}^2(\mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}}),X)$ onto~$\mathscr {H}^2(\mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}}),X)$ is a linear injection from~$\mathscr {B}(\ell _2(\N ))$ into~$\mathscr {H}^2(\mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}}),X)$, and the result follows.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 2.3  
 There is an underlying connection between Theorems~\ref {mainthm} and~\ref {mainthmH2BER}. To explain it, consider two extensions~\eqref {ext1} and~\eqref {ext2} of a Banach algebra~$\mathscr {C}$, where the former extension is singular and admissible, but does not split strongly, while the latter splits strongly. Then, by Proposition~\ref {pullbacksandsplittingsofextensions}, we obtain a singular, admissible extension~\eqref {ext3} of the Banach algebra~$\mathscr {B}$, and this extension does not split strongly. Hence a classical result of Johnson (see \cite [Theorem~2.1]{johnsonWed}, or \cite [Corollary~I.1.11]{helemskii} for an exposition) implies that $\ker \delta $ is a Banach $\mathscr {B}$-bimodule and $\mathscr {H}^2(\mathscr {B},\ker \delta )$ is non-zero, so that~$\mathscr {B}$ has homological bidimension at least two. \par To apply this result to $\mathscr {B} = \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})$, we take $\mathscr {C} = \ell _2(\N )^{\sim }$ and $\beta = \psi $ as in the proof of Theorem~\ref {mainthm}, so that we have an extension of the form~\eqref {ext2} which splits strongly by Theorem~\ref {WEBEsplitexact}. Choose $U\in \mathscr {B}(\ell _2(\N ))$ with $\|U\|\le 1$, and turn the vector space $\K \oplus \ell _2(\N )$ into a Banach algebra by endowing it with the product and the norm \[ (\lambda ,x)(\mu ,y) = (\langle Ux,y\rangle , 0)\qquad \text {and}\qquad \|(\lambda ,x)\| = |\lambda |+ \|x\|\qquad (x,y\in \ell _2(\N ),\,\lambda ,\mu \in \K ). \] Denote by~$\mathscr {A}$ the unitization of this Banach algebra, and let~$\alpha \colon \mathscr {A}\to \mathscr {C}$ be the natural unital projection. Then $\alpha $ is a continuous, surjective algebra homomorphism, and we have a singular, admissible extension of the form~\eqref {ext1}, which can be shown to split algebraically if and only if it splits strongly, if and only if $U=0$. Thus, choosing~$U$ non-zero, we conclude that~$\mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {R}}})$ has homological bidimension at least two. \par A similar argument shows that~$\mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {DLW}}})$ has homological bidimension at least two, where $E_{\text {\normalfont {DLW}}}$ denotes the Banach space of Dales, Loy, and Willis studied in~\cite {dlw}. To see this, take $\mathscr {B} = \mathscr {B}(E_{\text {\normalfont {DLW}}})$ and $\mathscr {C} = \ell _\infty (\Z )$, and apply \cite [Theorem~3.11(i)]{bdl} to obtain a singular, admissible extension of~$\ell _\infty (\Z )$ which does not split strongly.
