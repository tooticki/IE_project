BEGIN Definition 1.2  
 A subgroup $H$ of a finitely generated group $G$ is a {\sl homologically benign subgroup} if the HNN-extension $$G_H=\langle G,t\colon t^{-1}ht=h\,\, h\in H\rangle $$ can be embedded in an $FP_2$ group.

BEGIN Theorem 1.3  
 \label {thm:fromufp} For any fixed $l\geq 4$ and any set $S$ of integers with $0\in S$, there is an $FP_2$ group $J=J(l,S)$ and a sequence $j_1,\ldots ,j_l$ of elements of $J$ such that $j_1^sj_2^s\cdots j_l^s=1$ if and only if $s\in S$.
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 The groups $G_L(S)$ that are constructed in~\cite {ufp} depend on a connected flag simplicial complex $L$ and a set $S\subseteq \zz $. If $L$ has perfect fundamental group and contains an edge loop of length $l$ that is not homotopic to a constant map, then $J=G_L(S)$ has the claimed properties. See~\cite [section~2]{ufp} for an explicit example of a suitable $L$ in the case $l=4$; examples for larger $l$ can be obtained by taking subdivisions of this $L$. \par We expand a little by giving the precise results within~\cite {ufp} that guarantee the various properties of the group~$J=J(l,S)$. When $0\in S\subseteq \zz $, \cite [theorem~1.2]{ufp} gives a presentation for $G_L(S)$ with generators the directed edges of~$L$. By~\cite [theorem~1.3]{ufp}, the group $G_L(S)$ is $FP_2$ if and only if the fundamental group of $L$ is perfect. If $j_1,\ldots ,j_l$ is a directed loop in $L$ that does not bound a disk then by~\cite [Lemma~14.4]{ufp}, the word $j_1^sj_2^s\cdots j_l^s$ in the given generators for $J$ is equal to the identity if and only if $s\in S$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proposition 2.1  
 \label {prop:fp2} Let $H$ be given by a presentation with finitely many generators and a countable set of relators $r_1,r_2,\ldots $. The following are equivalent. \begin {itemize} \item [(i)] $H$ is $FP_2$. \item [(ii)] There exists $m$ so that for each $i>m$, the loop defined by $r_i$ represents zero in the homology of the partial Cayley complex corresponding to all the generators and the relators $r_1,\ldots ,r_m$. \item [(iii)] There is a connected free $H$-CW-complex with finitely many orbits of cells and perfect fundamental group. \end {itemize}
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Equivalence of (i) and (ii). Let $X$ be the Cayley complex for $H$ and let $X_m$ be the partial Cayley complex containing all 1-cells and only the 2-cells that correspond to the relators $r_1,\ldots ,r_m$. Let $C_*(X)$ and $C_*(X_m)$ denote the cellular chain complexes of $X$ and $X_m$. The image of the map $d_1:C_1(X)\rightarrow C_0(X)$ is isomorphic to the augmentation ideal $I_H$. Hence $H$ is $FP_2$ if and only if the kernel of $d_1$ is finitely generated as a $\zz H$-module. Since $H_1(X)$ is trivial, this kernel is equal to the image $d_2(C_2(X))$. The stated condition on loops is equivalent to $d_2(C_2(X_m))=d_2(C_2(X))$. If this holds then clearly $d_2(C_2(X))$ is finitely generated. Conversely, any finite subset of $d_2(C_2(X))$ is contained in some $d_2(C_2(X_m))$, so if $d_2(C_2(X))$ is finitely generated then there exists $m$ with $d_2(C_2(X_m))=d_2(C_2(X))$. \par (ii)$\implies $(iii) and (iii)$\implies $(i). Each $X_i$ is a connected $H$-CW-complex with finitely many orbits of cells, and if (ii) holds then $H_1(X_m)\cong H_1(X)$ is trivial. Given any $H$-CW-complex $Y$ as in (iii), pick a maximal subtree $T$ in $Y/H$, let $\widetilde T$ be the set of lifts of $T$ in $Y$, and note that $\widetilde T$ is equivariantly isomorphic to $T\times H$. The cellular chain complex $C_*(Y,\widetilde T)$ gives a finite presentation for the relative homology group $H_1(Y,\widetilde T)$ as a $\zz H$-module. Since $H_1(Y)=0$, $H_1(Y,\widetilde T)$ is isomorphic to $I_H$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma 2.2  
 \label {lem:higrope} If $R$ is a homologically benign normal subgroup of a finitely generated group $F$, then $F/R$ is embeddable in an $FP_2$ group.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Fix $R$ as in the statement, and let $H$ be an $FP_2$ group containing the group $F_R=\langle F, t\colon t^{-1}rt = r,\,\, r\in R\rangle $. Let $L$ be the subgroup of $F_R\leq H$ generated by $F$ and $t^{-1}Ft$, so that $L\cong F*_RF$. As in \cite [IV.7.6]{lynsch} there is a homomorphism $\phi :L\rightarrow F/R$ whose restriction to $F$ is equal to the quotient map $F\rightarrow F/R$ and whose restriction to $t^{-1}Ft$ is the trivial homomorphism. Viewing $L$ as a subgroup of $H$, the map $l\mapsto (l,\phi (l))$ defines a second copy of $L$ inside $H\times F/R$. Let $K$ be the HNN-extension in which the stable letter conjugates these two copies: $$K= \langle H\times F/R, s\colon s^{-1}(l,1)s = (l,\phi (l)), \,\, l\in L\rangle .$$ The group $K$ is generated by the generators for $H$, the generators for $F/R$ and the element~$s$. As defining relators we may take the relators for $F/R$, the relators for $H$, finitely many relators stating that the generators for $H$ and the generators for $F/R$ commute, and finitely many relators of the form $s^{-1}(l,1)s(l,\phi (l))^{-1}$ for $l$ in some generating set for $L$. As in~\cite [IV.7.6]{lynsch}, the relators that hold between the generators for $F/R$ can be eliminated from this presentation for $K$, leaving just the relators for $H$ and finitely many other relators. \par To see that $K$ is $FP_2$, we use Proposition~\ref {prop:fp2} applied to the presentation 2-complex with the generators and relators described above. The generators and relators for $H$ are contained in those for $K$, so we may look at the partial Cayley complex for $K$ corresponding to just these generators and relators. This 2-complex is isomorphic to a disjoint union of copies of the Cayley complex for $H$ (one copy for each coset of $H$ in~$K$). Let $r_1,r_2\ldots $ be an enumeration of the relators for $H$. Since $H$ is $FP_2$, there exists $m$ so that for $i>m$, the relator $r_i$ represents zero in the homology of the partial Cayley complex for $H$ with just the relators $r_1,\ldots ,r_m$. It follows that these same loops represent zero in the homology of the partial Cayley complex for $K$ discussed above. \par Now consider the partial Cayley complex for $K$, taking all the generators, the commutation relators between generators for $H$ and $F/R$, the finitely many relators involving $s$, and the relators $r_1,\ldots ,r_m$. For $i>m$, the loops in this complex defined by $r_i$ represent the zero element of homology, since they already represent 0 in the smaller partial Cayley complex consisting of a disjoint union of copies of the Cayley complex for $H$. Hence this presentation for $K$ satisfies condition~(ii) of Proposition~\ref {prop:fp2}, and so $K$ is $FP_2$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma 2.3  
 Let $G$ be a finitely generated group which is embeddable in an $FP_2$ group. \begin {itemize} \item {} Every finitely generated subgroup of $G$ is homologically benign in $G$. \item {} If $H$ and $K$ are homologically benign subgroups of $G$, then so are their intersection and the subgroup that they generate. \end {itemize}
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Almost identical to the proof of \cite [Lemma~IV.7.7]{lynsch}, except that it relies on the fact that a free product with amalgamation $P=M*_GN$ is $FP_2$ provided that $M$ and $N$ are $FP_2$ and $G$ is finitely generated rather than on a similar statement for finite presentability. This can be proved easily using Proposition~\ref {prop:fp2}.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma 2.4  
 \label {lem:anys} Fix $l\geq 4$, and for any integer $s$ define $v_s:= c_0^sc_1^s\cdots c_l^s d e^s$, an element of the free group $H=\langle c_0,\ldots ,c_l, d, e\rangle $ of rank $l+3$. For any $S\subseteq \zz $ with $0\in S$, the subgroup $$V_S:=\langle v_s \colon s\in S\rangle \leq \langle c_0,\ldots ,c_l, d, e\rangle $$ is homologically benign and is freely generated by the given elements.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 If a reduced word in the elements $v_s$ is written out in terms of the elements $c_0,\ldots ,c_l,d,e$, the only cancellation that can take place involves $c_0$ and $e$. Thus the subwords $(c_1^sc_2^s\cdots c_l^sd)^{\pm 1}$ survive uncancelled, which implies that the elements $v_s$ are free generators for the subgroup $V_\zz $ of~$H$. \par We claim that $V_\zz $ is benign, and hence homologically benign. To see this, define an ascending HNN-extension of the free group $H=\langle c_0,\ldots ,c_l,d,e\rangle $ by \[ u^{-1}c_iu = c_0c_1\cdots c_{i-1}c_ic_{i-1}^{-1}c_{i-2}^{-1}\cdots c_0^{-1}, \quad u^{-1}du = c_0c_1\cdots c_lde, \quad u^{-1}eu = e. \] Since $u^{-1}v_su=v_{s+1}$ for all $s\in \zz $ and $v_0=d$ it follows that $$\langle d,u\rangle \cap H = V_\zz .$$ Hence $V_\zz $ is benign in $\langle c_0,\ldots ,c_l,d,e,u\rangle $ and therefore also in the free group $H$. \par Fix some $S\subseteq \zz $, and claim that $V_S$ is homologically benign in $H$. To see this, let $J=J(l,S)$ and $j_1,\ldots , j_l\in J$ be as in the statement of Theorem~\ref {thm:fromufp}, and let $K=K(S)$ be $$K=\langle c_0,d,e\rangle * (\langle c_1,c_2,\ldots , c_l\rangle \times J) = H*_{\langle c_1,\ldots ,c_l\rangle } (\langle c_1,c_2,\ldots , c_l\rangle \times J).$$ The group $K$ is $FP_2$, since it has a presentation in which the only relators are the relators of $J$ and finitely many commutation relators between $c_1,\ldots , c_l$ and the generators of $J$. \par Define an HNN-extension $M=M(S)$ of $K$, with base group $H$ and stable letter~$t$ via $$t^{-1}c_0t=c_0,\quad t^{-1}c_it= c_ij_i\,\,\,\hbox {for $i>0$},\quad t^{-1}dt=d,\quad t^{-1}et=e.$$ The group $M$ is $FP_2$ and its subgroups $V_\zz $, $t^{-1}V_\zz t$ and $H$ are all homologically benign. The elements $t^{-1}v_st$ freely generate the free group $t^{-1}V_\zz t$. In terms of the generators for~$K$, $t^{-1}v_st = c_0^sc_1^s\cdots c_l^sj_1^s\cdots j_l^s de^s$. When a reduced word in the elements $t^{-1}v_st$ is written in these terms, the only cancellation that can take place involves $c_0$ and $e$, thus the subwords $(c_1^s\cdots c_l^s j_1^s\cdots j_l^sd)^{\pm 1}$ survive uncancelled. It follows that such a reduced word is in $H$ if and only if each subword $j_1^s\cdots j_l^s$ is equal to 1, or equivalently each $s$ that occurs lies in $S$. Hence $V_S$ is equal to $t^{-1}V_\zz t\cap H$ and is homologically benign in $M$ and in $H$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma 2.5  
 The subgroup $G$ is benign in $F$.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Almost identical to the argument in~\cite [IV.7]{lynsch}. Make a group $F^*$ defined as the fundamental group of a graph of groups with one vertex group $F$, and four edges corresponding to stable letters $u_\lambda $ for $\lambda \in \{a,b,a^{-1},b^{-1}\}$, each of which defines an ascending HNN-extension of $F$ with relations \[u_\lambda ^{-1}au_\lambda = a, \quad u_\lambda ^{-1}bu_\lambda = b, \quad u_\lambda ^{-1}c_iu_\lambda = c_0^{\gamma (\lambda )}c_1^{\gamma (\lambda )} \cdots c_{i-1}^{\gamma (\lambda )} c_i^{10} c_{i-1}^{-\gamma (\lambda )}\cdots c_0^{-\gamma (\lambda )},\] \[ u_\lambda ^{-1}du_\lambda = c_0^{\gamma (\lambda )}c_1^{\gamma (\lambda )} \cdots c_l^{\gamma (\lambda )}de^{\gamma (\lambda )},\quad u_\lambda ^{-1}eu_\lambda = e^{10},\quad u_\lambda ^{-1}hu_\lambda = \lambda h. \] In $F^*$, we have that for any word $w=\lambda _1\cdots \lambda _n$, $$u_{\lambda _1}^{-1}\cdots u_{\lambda _n}^{-1}g_\emptyset u_{\lambda _n}\cdots u_{\lambda _1}= u_{\lambda _1}^{-1}\cdots u_{\lambda _n}^{-1}hd u_{\lambda _n}\cdots u_{\lambda _1}= g_w,$$ and if $w=u\lambda $ then $u_\lambda g_w u_\lambda ^{-1} = g_u$. \par To show that $G$ is benign in $F$, it suffices to show that in $F^*$, $$G=F\cap \langle g_\emptyset ,u_a,u_b,u_{a^{-1}},u_{b^{-1}}\rangle .$$ From the equations given above, it is clear that the left-hand side is contained in the right-hand side. As in~\cite [IV.7]{lynsch}, to prove the converse it suffices to show that whenever $z\in G$ and $\lambda \in \{a,b,a^{-1},b^{-1}\}$ are such that $u_\lambda zu_\lambda ^{-1}\in F$, then in fact $u_\lambda z u_\lambda ^{-1} \in G$, or equivalently $z\in u_\lambda ^{-1} Gu_\lambda $. For this, write $z=g_{w_1}^{\epsilon _1}\cdots g_{w_n}^{\epsilon _n}$ as a reduced word in the elements $g_w$, with $\epsilon _i=\pm 1$. When this expression for $z$ is rewritten in terms of the generators for $F$ and reduced, each subword of the form $(c_1^{\gamma (w_i)}c_2^{\gamma (w_i)}\cdots c_l^{\gamma (w_i)}d)^{\epsilon _i}$ survives uncancelled, and any two such subwords are separated by a non-trivial word in the other generators $a,b,c_0,e,h$. Each of the natural free generators for $u_\lambda ^{-1}Fu_\lambda $ except $u_\lambda ^{-1}du_\lambda = c_0^{\gamma (\lambda )}c_1^{\gamma (\lambda )}\cdots c_l^{\gamma (\lambda )}de^{\gamma (\lambda )}$ has total exponent of each $c_i$ divisible by~10. From this it follows that each $\gamma (w_i)$ is congruent to $\gamma (\lambda )$ modulo 10, and hence that $w_i = x_i\lambda $ for some shorter word $x_i$, so that $z\in u_\lambda ^{-1}Gu_\lambda $ as required.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Corollary 2.6  
 \label {cor:allbenign} Every subgroup of the free group $L=\langle a,b\rangle $ is homologically benign.
END Corollary
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $N$ be a subgroup of $L$, and define a subset $S=S(N)\subseteq \nn $ as the set of G\"odel codes for words $w$ on $\{a,b,a^{-1},b^{-1}\}$ that are equal (as elements of $L$) to an element of~$N$: $$S=\{\gamma (w)\colon w \in _L N\}.$$ Now let $Y_S$ be the free product $\langle a,b,h\rangle *V_S\leq F$, where $V_S$ is as defined in the statement of Lemma~\ref {lem:anys}. By that lemma, $V_S$ is homologically benign, and hence $Y_S$ is homologically benign in $F$. Since $Y_S$ is freely generated by $\{a,b,h,v_s\colon s\in S\}$, it is easy to see that $G\cap Y_S$ is freely generated by $\{g_w\colon w\in N\}$. (Recall that $v_s = c_0^sc_1^s\cdots c_l^sde^s$.) Hence $G\cap Y_S$ is homologically benign. The subgroup generated by $G \cap Y_S$ and the finite set $\{c_0,\ldots ,c_l,d,e,h\}$, which is equal to $N*\langle c_0,\ldots ,c_l,d,e,h\rangle $, is therefore also homologically benign and the intersection of this group with $L$ is equal to $N$.
