 By equipping the product $M_0\times I$ with the symplectic structure given by the symplectization $\omega _{sp}(\xi _0)$ of the contact structure $\xi _0$ and isotoping the attaching sphere of the handle $h_k$ to an isotropic sphere, the symplectic form $\omega _{sp}(\xi _0)$ was extended by Weinstein~\cite {Weinstein} to the trace $(M_0\times I )\cup h_k$. The existence of a Stein structure on the trace (in particular, the construction of the appropriate function $f$ of the definition) is due to Eliashberg~\cite {Cieliebak&Eliashberg12, Eliashberg??}.

Then $W' = W\cup W_1$ (equipped with a suitable symplectic structure $\omega '$, based on $\omega $ and the Stein structure on $W_1$) provides a weak filling of $(M_1, \xi _1)$. \par Furthermore, if the attaching sphere of a $2$-handle bounds a surface $\Sigma $ in $M$ then we can assume that the $\omega '([\Sigma \cup D^2]) = 0$,\ where $D^2$ denotes the core of the $2$-handle.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $(-\epsilon ,\epsilon ) \times M$ be a small regular neighbourhood of $M$ in $W$, where $W$ has been extended slightly. Let $\lambda $ be a defining 1-form for $\xi $. Suppose that $\omega |_M$ is exact on the attaching sphere $S^{k-1}$ of the $k$-handle of $W_1$. Then there is a form $\overline {\omega }$ cohomologous to $\omega |_M$ which vanishes near $S^{k-1}$. By \cite [Lemma~1.10]{Massot12} one can alter the symplectic structure after attaching a sufficiently long end $ [0,2C] \times \partial W$ so that the symplectic form is given by $\overline {\omega } + d(t \lambda )$ for all $t \ge C - \epsilon $ and we still have a weak filling of $M = M \times \{C\}$. In particular, near $S^{k-1} \subset M \times \{C\}$ the symplectic form is just $d(t \lambda )$. We attach a Stein/Weinstein $k$-handle along $S^{k-1}$ and denote the resulting filling by $(W',\omega ')$. The almost complex structure $J$ on $W$ used in the definition of weak filling then extends to an almost complex structure $J'$ on $W'$ that is tamed by $\omega '$. \par Since $\omega $ is always exact near an attaching sphere $S^{k-1}$ with $k\ne 3$ and this is the case by assumption if $k=3$, the lemma follows immediately. \par In the case of a $2$-handle whose attaching sphere $S^1$ bounds a surface $\Sigma $, we can assume that the form $\overline {\omega }$ above vanishes on $\Sigma \subset M \times \{C\}$. Then since the core of a Weinstein handle is isotropic with isotropic boundary, it follows that $$\omega '([\Sigma \cup D^2]) = \int _\Sigma C \thinspace d\lambda + \int _{D^2} \omega ' = \int _{\partial \Sigma } C\thinspace \lambda = 0,$$ giving the final claim.

BEGIN Proposition 2.10  
 \label {cor:weak_product} Let $(M,\xi )$ be a contact manifold of dimension $2q{+}1$ that admits a weak symplectic filling $(W,\omega )$. Then $M \times S^2$ admits a weakly fillable contact structure.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $(W,\omega )$ be a weak filling of $(M,\xi )$. By \cite [Example~5]{Massot12} the manifold $M \times T^2$ admits a contact structure that is weakly filled by the symplectic manifold $(W \times T^2,\omega \oplus \omega _{T^2})$. According to \cite [Proposition~3.1]{BCS1} there is a Stein cobordism $Y$ from $M \times T^2$ to $M \times S^2$ which fits into the following diagram: \begin {equation}\label {eq:trianglewithy} \xymatrix { M\times T^2 \ar [dr]_(0.45){f_0} \ar [r]^(0.6){i_{0}} & Y \ar [d]^(0.4){g_Y} & M\times S^2 \ar [l]_(0.6){i_{1}} \ar [dl]^(0.45){Id} \\ & M\times S^2,} \end {equation} where $g_Y$ is a $(q{+}2)$-equivalence and $f_0$ is the product of the identity with a map of degree $1$. \par The idea of the proof is to inductively apply Lemma \ref {weak_fill} to Stein handle attachments which make up the bordism $Y$, starting from from $M \times T^2$. We first find a topological Stein structure on $Y$ where we can apply Lemma \ref {weak_fill} to each handle attachement. For this, we need to keep track of the cohmology class of the symplectic form of the filling, when restricted to the outgoing boundary. Hence we note the equality of cohomology classes $[\omega |_M \oplus \omega _{T^2}]= f_0^*\bigl ( [\omega |_M \oplus \omega _{S^2}] \bigl )$ for a symplectic form $\omega _{S^2}$ on $S^2$. \par Let $\alpha ,\beta \subset T^2$ be the standard generators of $\pi _1(T^2)$ which we consider in different $T^2$-fibers of $M \times T^2$. These are then null-homotopic in $Y$ and hence extend to maps of discs, which can be taken to be proper embeddings in $Y$ since the dimension of $Y$ is at least $6$. Let $Y_{2}$ be the bordism obtained by attaching a pair of $2$-handles along $\alpha $ and $\beta $. We then obtain decomposition of $Y = Y_2 \cup _{X_2} Y_3$, where $X_2$ is the upper boundary component of $Y_2$. Attaching these 2-handles yields $\pi _1(Y_2) = \pi _1(X_2) = \pi _1(M)$ by construction and also that the map $Y_2 \to M \times S^2$ is a surjection on $\pi _2$. This latter claim in obvious for classes in the $\pi _2(M)$-factor and for the class coming form the $S^2$-factor observe that the result of the surgery on the class $[\text {pt} \times T^2]$ is a spherical class that is mapped to $[\text {pt} \times S^2]$ under $(g_Y)_*$. \par Since $Y_2$ is formed by $2$-handle attachments, it has the homotopy type of a space obtained by attaching $(2q{+}2)$-cells to $X_2$. Hence the inclusion $X_2 \to Y_2$ is $(2q{+}1)$-connected and so $g_{X_2} \colon X_2 \to M \times S^2$ is $2$-connected: Here, and for the rest of the proof, we set $g_Z := g_Y|_Z$ for any subspace $Z \subset Y$. Since $Y_3$ is obtained from the $(2q{+}2)$-dimensional manifold $Y$ by deleting neighbourhoods of $2$-handles, the inclusion $Y_3 \to Y$ is $(2q{+}1)$-connected and so $g_{Y_3} \colon Y_3 \to M \times S^2$ is at least $3$-connected. It follows that the pair $(Y_3,X_2)$ is algebraically $2$-connected, and we will use this later in the proof. \par The fact that $Y_3$ is obtained from $Y$ by deleting neighbourhoods of $2$-handles has another important consequence. Combined with the fact that $(Y, M \times S^2)$ is algebraically $(q{+}1)$-connected, it implies that the pair $(Y_3,M \times S^2)$ is algebraically $(q{+}1)$-connected. Thus there is a handle decomposition of $Y_3$ relative to $M \times S^2$ containing only handles of index at least $q{+}2$ by a result of Wall \cite [Theorem 2.18]{BCS2} or dually there is a handle decomposition of $Y_3$ relative to $X_2$ containing only handles of index at most $q{+}2$. More precisely Wall shows inductively that given \emph {any} handle decomposition one can cancel handles of index $k < q{+}2$ with $(k{+}1)$-handles at the expense of introducing a $(k{+}2)$-handles. \par We now apply Lemma \ref {weak_fill} to $Y_2$ to obtain a weak filling $(Y_2,\omega ')$ of $X_2$. Since the $2$-handles are attached along curves that are non-trivial in rational homology it follows from the long exact sequence of the pair $(Y_2, M \times T^2)$ that the map $M \times T^2 \to Y_2$ induces an injection on cohomology. In particular, we have the following equality for cohomology classes $[\omega '] = (g_{Y_2})^*\bigl ( [\omega |_M \oplus \omega _{S^2}] \bigr )$. \par We now consider any topological Stein handle decomposition of $Y_3$ relative to $X_2$. As this pair is $2$-connected we can then apply Wall's argument to cancel all handles of index $k \le 1$ at the expense of introducing $3$-handles. In particular, the resulting handle decomposition will still be topologically Stein as $\dim (Y_3) = 2q{+}4 \ge 6$. \par We now attach the $2$-handles $h^2_i$ of $Y_3$ to $X_2$. Let $Y_{2+} = Y_2 \cup \cup _{i=1}^n h^2_i \subset Y_3$ be the union of $Y_2$ and these new $2$-handles. Let $D^2_i$ be the core of $h^2_i$. Since the pair $(Y_3, X_2)$ is $2$-connected the disc $D^2_i$ can be homotoped inside $Y_3$ to a disc $\Delta _i \subset X_2$ relative to its boundary, which by general position is embedded. Applying Lemma \ref {weak_fill} for each $2$-handle we obtain a weak filling $(Y_{2+},\omega ')$ such that $\omega '([D^2_i \cup \Delta _i]) = 0$. We claim that at the level of cohomology classes we again have $[\omega '] = (g_{Y_{2+}})^*\bigl ( [\omega |_M \oplus \omega _{S^2}] \bigr )$. To see this, consider the cohomology exact sequence of the pair $(Y_{2+}, Y_2)$: \[ \cdots \longrightarrow H^2(Y_{2+}, Y_2) \stackrel {j}\longrightarrow H^2(Y_{2+}) \longrightarrow H^2(Y_2) \longrightarrow \cdots ~. \] By construction, $[\omega ']$ and $(g_{Y_{2+}})^*\bigl ( [\omega |_M \oplus \omega _{S^2}] \bigr )$ agree when restricted to $Y_2$, so their difference lies in $j(H^2(Y_{2+}, Y_2))$, where $H^2(Y_{2+}, Y_2)$ is a free abelian group with dual basis consisting of the $2$-handles $h^2_i$. Since $D_i^2$ and $\Delta _i$ are homotopic relative to their boundary in $Y_3$, the spherical class $[D_i^2 \cup \Delta _i]$ is null-homotopic in $Y_3$. This, combined with the fact that $\omega '([D^2_i \cup \Delta _i]) = 0$, ensures that $[\omega '] - (g_{Y_{2+}})^*\bigl ( [\omega |_M \oplus \omega _{S^2}] \bigr ) = 0$. \par We next attach $3$-handles to $Y_{2+}$. In order to apply Lemma \ref {weak_fill} we must ensure that the resulting symplectic form vanishes on the attaching $2$-sphere $S^2_a$. Let $\iota _{2+} \colon Y_{2+} \to Y$ be the inclusion. Since $S^2_a$ bounds a $3$-disc in $Y$, it follows that $$(g_{Y_{2+}})_*([S^2_a]) = (g_Y)_*(\iota _{2+})_*([S^2_a]) = 0 \in H_2(M \times S^2).$$ We then have $$\langle (g_{Y_{2+}})^*\bigl ( [\omega |_M \oplus \omega _{S^2}] \bigr ), [S^2_a] \rangle = \langle [\omega |_M \oplus \omega _{S^2}], (g_{Y_{2+}})_*([S^2_a]) \rangle = 0,$$ where the angular brackets denote the natural Kronecker pairing. Thus we can again apply Lemma \ref {weak_fill}. As above the cohomology class of the symplectic structure $\omega '$ is just the restriction of $(g_{Y})^*\bigl ( [\omega |_M \oplus \omega _{S^2}] \bigr )$. Inductively applying Lemma \ref {weak_fill} to the remaining handles completes the argument.
END Proof

 [cf.~{\cite [Example 2.5]{BCS2}}] \label {exa:normal-type} We take the stable complex bundle $(B^k_\scxs , \eta ^k_\scxs ) = (BU\an {k{+}1}, \pi _{k{+}1})$ where the map $\pi _{k{+}1} \colon BU\an {k{+}1} \to BU$ is the $k$-fold connective covering of $BU$. Recall that $BU\an {k{+}1}$ is the space whose homotopy groups are trivial in degree $i \le k-1$ and such that $\pi _{k{+}1}$ induces a surjection on the $k$-th homotopy group and isomorphisms for all higher homotopy groups. We denote the bordism groups $\Omega _*(BU\an {k{+}1}; \pi _{k{+}1})$ by $\Omega _*^{U\an {k}}$. When $k = 3$, we have that $\Omega _*(BU\an {4}; \pi _4) = \Omega _*^{SU}$ is just special unitary bordism as consider in \cite [Chapter X]{Stong1}.

 Suppose that $\alpha _*([M_0, \bar \zeta _0]) = [M_1, \bar \zeta _1]$ and let $(W,\bar \zeta )$ be a $(B^{q{-}1}_{\scxs _1}, \eta ^{q{-}1}_{\scxs 1})$-nullcobordism of $(-M_0, -\alpha \circ \bscxs _0) \sqcup (M_1, \bscxs _1)$. Applying surgery below the middle dimension \cite [Proposition 2.6]{BCS2}, we can assume that $\bscxs \colon W \to B^{q{-}1}_{\scxs _1}$ is a $(q{+}1)$-equivalence. It follows from a result of Wall \cite [Theorem 2.18]{BCS2} that $W$ is built from $M_1$ by attaching handles of index $\ge q{+}1$ and dually that $W$ is obtained from $M_0$ by attaching handles of index at most $q{+}1$, verifying one direction of the equivalence. \par \par Conversely, if $(W, \zeta )$ is a topological Stein cobordism with boundary $(-M_0, -\scxs _0) \sqcup (M_1, \scxs _1)$, then the universal properties of Postnikov factorizations \cite [Chapters 2 \& 5]{Baues77} mean that there is a homotopy commutative diagram, \[ \xymatrix { -M_0 \ar [d]_{-\bscxs _0} \ar [r]^{i_0} & W \ar [d]^{\bscxs } & M_1 \ar [d]^{\bscxs _1} \ar [l]_{i_1} \\ B^{q{-}1}_{\scxs _0} \ar [dr] \ar [r]^{Bi_0} & B^{q{-}1}_{\scxs } \ar [d] & B^{q{-}1}_{\scxs _1} \ar [dl] \ar [l]_{Bi_1} \\ & BU& , } \] where $\bscxs _0, \bscxs _1$ and $\bscxs $ are all $(q{-}1)$-smoothings and for $j = 0, 1$, $i_j \colon M_j \to W$ are the inclusions and $Bi_j$ are the corresponding induced maps of complex normal $(q{-}1)$-types. Since $W$ is obtained from $M_1$ by the addition of handles on index $(q{+}1)$ or larger, the proof of \cite [Lemma 2.9 (3)]{BCS2} shows that $Bi_1$ is an equivalence of complex normal $(q{-}1)$-types. We then set $\alpha $ to be the following map of fibrations over $BU$: \[ \alpha := (Bi_1)^{-1} \circ Bi_0 \colon B^{q{-}1}_{\scxs _0} \to B^{q{-}1}_{\scxs _1},\] where $(Bi_1)^{-1}$ denotes a homotopy inverse of $Bi_1$. By definition, $(W, \bscxs )$ is a $(B^{q{-}1}_{\scxs _1}, \eta ^{q{-}1}_{\scxs _1})$-bordism which gives $\alpha _*([M_0, \bscxs _0]) = [M_1, \bscxs _1]$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 2.15  
 Notice that \cite [Theorem~3.8]{BCS2} is a direct consequence of the above result (by taking $\alpha ={\rm id}$). While \cite [Theorem~3.8]{BCS2} is symmetric for $(M_0, \zeta _0)$ and $(M_1, \zeta _1)$, in Theorem~\ref {thm:surgery_theorem_alternative} the direction of the map $\alpha $ breaks this symmetry. The above extension of our earlier result was suggested by a question from Andy Wand in Nantes in September 2013.

BEGIN Proposition 3.1  
 \label {prop:final_elements} In every dimension $2q{+} 1 \ge 5$ there exists an almost contact manifold $(M_{{max}},\varphi _{{max}})$ so that for any almost contact manifold $(M, \varphi )$ we have $$(M ,\varphi ) \prec (M_{{max}},\varphi _{{max}}).$$ Moreover, in dimensions $5$ and $7$ we can take certain almost contact structures on the non{-}trivial sphere bundles over $S^2$ as final elements: $$(M_{{max}},\varphi _{{max}}) = (S^3 \tilde \times S^2,\varphi _{{max}}) , \quad (M_{{max}},\varphi _{{max}}) = (S^5 \tilde \times S^2,\varphi _{{max}}),$$ where $\varphi _{{max}}$ is any almost contact structure whose first Chern class is primitive.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 For $(M_{{max}},\varphi _{{max}})$ we can take any almost contact $(2q{+}1)$-manifold where the corresponding stable complex manifold $(M_{{max}},\scxs _{max})$ has complex normal $(q{-}1)$-type $B^{q{-}1}_{\scxs _{max}}= BU$ and the map to $BU$ is just the identity. To construct such a manifold, we begin with {\em any} stably complex $(2q{+}1)$-manifold $\scxs \colon M \to BU$ and apply surgery below the middle dimension \cite [Proposition 2.6]{BCS2} to obtain a stably complex manifold $(M_{max}, \zeta _{max})$ where $\zeta _{max} \colon M_{max} \to BU$ is a $q$-equivalence, which then has the desired complex normal $(q{-}1)$-type. We then take $\acs _{max}$, to be any almost contact structure which stabilizes to $\zeta _{max}$, which exists by \cite [Lemma 2.17]{BCS2}. \par Now let $(M, \acs )$ be any almost contact $(2q{+}1)$-manifold with stable complex structure $\zeta $, complex normal $(q{-}1)$-type $(B^{q{-}1}_\zeta , \eta ^{q{-}1}_\zeta )$ and with $\zeta $-compatible normal $(q{-}1)$-smoothing $\bscxs \colon M \to B^{q{-}1}_\scxs $. By definition, $\eta ^{q{-}1}_\zeta \colon B^{q{-}1}_\zeta \to BU$ is a fibration and we set $\alpha = \eta ^{q{-}1}_\zeta $. Bordism of $BU$-manifolds is just ordinary complex bordism, and by \cite [p.117]{Stong1} the odd bordism groups $\Omega ^U_{2q{+}1}$ are trivial, which implies that $\alpha _*([M, \bscxs ]) = 0 = [M_{max}, \scxs _{max}]$. By Theorem \ref {thm:surgery_theorem_alternative} it follows that $(M, \scxs ) \prec (M_{max}, \scxs _{max})$ and due to the equivalence given in \eqref {eq:stable_and_unstable_Stein_cobordism} above we finally conclude that $(M, \acs ) \prec (M_{max}, \acs _{max})$. \par In dimensions $5,7$ one checks that the explicit manifolds stated in the proposition have the correct complex normal $1$- resp.\ $2$-types. For this, note that $\pi _1(BU) = \pi _3(BU) = 0, \pi _2(BU) = \Z $ and the assumption that $c_1 $ is primitive ensures that the second homotopy group of the associated type is $\Z $.

 \label {rem:maximal_is_not_unique} The almost contact manifold $(M_{max}, \varphi _{max})$ is far from being unique. Indeed, if $(M_{max}, \varphi _{max}) \prec (M', \varphi ')$ then $(M', \varphi ')$ is also maximal for the topological Stein cobordism relation. For example, for any Stein fillable almost contact manifold $(M_0, \varphi _0)$, $(M_{max} \# M_0, \varphi _{max} \# \varphi _0)$ is also maximal. Note also that $(M_{max}, \varphi _{max})$ is necessarily Stein fillable (that is, contains a Stein fillable contact structure), shown by the Stein cobordism from, say, the standard contact sphere to $(M_{max}, \varphi _{max})$.
END Remark
 
BEGIN Remark 3.3  
 \label {rem:contact_max} At the level of contact structures, it seems very unlikely that the analogue of Proposition \ref {prop:final_elements} holds. Specifically, it seems unlikely that there is a single contact $(2n{+}1)$-manifold $(M_{max}, \xi _{max})$ such that for every contact $(2n{+}1)$-manifold $(M, \xi )$ the manifold $(M_{max}, \xi _{max})$ is the out-going end of some Stein cobordism starting from $(M, \xi )$. However by Theorem \ref {thm:h-principleforhandles} we have the following: For any maximal almost contact manifold $(M_{max}, \varphi _{max})$ of dimension $(2q{+}1) \geq 5$, and for any contact $(2q{+}1)$-manifold $(M, \xi )$, $(M_{max}, \varphi _{max})$ admits a contact structure $\xi _{(M, \xi )}$ and a Stein cobordism from $(M, \xi )$ to $(M_{max}, \xi _{(M, \xi )})$.
END Remark
 
BEGIN Proposition 3.4  
 \label {Calabi_Yau} Let $n = 5$ or $7$ and let $(M,\varphi )$ be an almost contact $n$-manifold such that $c_1(\varphi ) = 0$. Then $$(M,\varphi ) \prec (S^n,\varphi _{std}),$$ where $\varphi _{std}$ denotes the almost contact structure underlying the standard contact structure on $S^n$ and the Stein cobordism $(W,J)$ can be assumed to have $c_1(J) = 0$.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $n = 2q{+}1$, so that $q = 2$ or $3$ and let $\scxs $ be the stabilization of the almost contact structure $\varphi $. Since $c_1(\varphi ) = 0$, the complex normal $(q{-}1)$-type of $(M, \scxs )$ factors through $BSU \to BU$ by \cite [Lemma 2.22 (ii), Lemma 2.23]{BCS2}. Since the complex normal $(q{-}1)$-type of $(S^n,\varphi _{std})$ is $BSU \to BU$, the lemma follows from Theorem \ref {thm:surgery_theorem_alternative} and the fact that $\Omega _5^{SU} = \Omega _7^{SU}= 0$; see \cite [p.\,248]{Stong1}.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 3.5  
 In contrast to the 3-dimensional case, there can be no minimal elements with respect to the Stein cobordism relation in dimension at least 5. For example if $(M_0, \varphi _0) \prec (M_1, \varphi _1)$ and $c_1(\varphi _1) = 0$, then the fact that $c_1(\varphi _1) = 0$ implies that $c_1(\varphi _0) =0$. To see this note that a topological Stein cobordism $(W,J)$ from $M_0$ to $M_1$ is obtained from $M_1$ by attaching high index handles, which means that $c_1(J) = 0$. But this would imply that an initial element $(M_{min},\varphi _{min}) $ must have $c_1(\varphi _{min}) = 0$. A similar argument shows that for certain choices of $M_1$ the fact that $c^q_1(\varphi _1) \neq 0$ implies $c^q_1(\varphi _{min}) \neq 0$ (cf.\ \cite [Proposition 6.2]{BCS2}). For this note that the inclusion of $M_1$ into $W$ gives an isomorphism on fundamental groups. Suppose that $\beta \in H^1(B \pi _1(W))$ is a class such that when restricted to $M_1$ \[ p^*_1(\beta ) \cup c^q_1(J)\neq 0, \] where $p_1\colon W \longrightarrow B \pi _1(W)$ is the classifying map of the universal cover of $W$. It follows that the restriction of $p^*_1(\beta ) \cup c^q_1(J)\neq 0$ to $M_0=M_{min}$ is also non{-}zero and hence that $c_1(\varphi _{min}) = c_1(J)|_{M_{min}} \neq 0$. \par In fact, these sorts of arguments show that there can be no initial elements even if one forgets about the almost contact structures, and one simply considers Pontrjagin classes rather than Chern classes.

BEGIN Lemma 4.1  
 [cf.~{\cite [Theorem 2]{Milnor&Spanier}}] \label {lem:cotangent} There is a map $f \colon ST^*S^{2k{+}1} \to S^{2k}$ such that the induced homomorphism $f_* \colon H_{2k}(ST^*S^{2k{+}1}) \to H_{2k}(S^{2k})$ is an isomorphism if and only if $k = 0, 1$ or $ 3$.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $\pi \colon ST^*S^{2k{+}1} \to S^{2k{+}1}$ be the bundle projection of the unit cotangent bundle of $S^{2k{+}1}$. If we consider $\pi $ merely as a spherical fibration, then a map $f$ as in the statement of the lemma exists if and only if $\pi $ is trivial as a spherical fibration. This is because the product map \[ f \times \pi \colon ST^*S^{2k{+}1} \to S^{2k} \times S^{2k{+}1} \] is a homology isomorphism, and so by Whitehead's theorem a homotopy equivalence, and this gives a fibre homotopy trivialisation of $\pi $. By \cite [Theorem~2]{Milnor&Spanier}, the bundle projection $\pi $ is trivial as a spherical fibration if and only if $k = 0, 1$ or $3$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proposition 4.2  
 \label {prop:filling_cotangent_spheres} Let $k \geq 1$ and let $M = (ST^*S^{2k{+}1}) \# \Sigma _0$ be the connected sum of $ST^*S^{2k{+}1}$ with some homotopy sphere $\Sigma _0$. Choose some almost contact structure $\varphi $ on $M$ and let $W^{4k+2}$ be the smooth manifold underlying a Stein filling of $(M, \acs )$. Then $W$ decomposes as a boundary connected sum \[ W =W_l\thinspace \natural W_\Sigma ,\] where $H_{2k}(W_l) = \Z /l\Z $ and $W_\Sigma $ is a $2k$-connected filling of some homotopy sphere $\Sigma $. Moreover we have the following possibilities for the topology of $W_l$: \begin {enumerate} \par \item If $l > 1$, then $W_l$ has a handle decomposition with precisely one handle of index $2k$ and two handles of index $2k{+}1$; \par \item If $l = 1$, then $W_1 \cong DT^*S^{2k{+}1}$; \par \item If $l = 0$, then we must have $k = 1, 3$ and $W_0 \cong D^{2k{+}2} \times S^{2k}$. \par \end {enumerate} In particular, $ST^*S^{2k{+}1}$ admits a subcritical filling if and only if $k = 1,3$.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 First note that $M=\del W$ is $(2k{-}1)$-connected and that $H_*(\del W) \cong H_*(S^{2k} \times S^{2k{+}1})$. It follows that any Stein filling of $M$ is $(2k{-}1)$-connected and hence by the Hurewicz Theorem the map $\pi _{2k{+}1}(W) \longrightarrow H_{2k{+}1}(W)$ is surjective. The long exact sequence of the pair $$ H_{2k{+}1}(\partial W)\stackrel {\iota } \longrightarrow H_{2k{+}1}(W) \longrightarrow H_{2k{+}1}(W,\partial W)\longrightarrow H_{2k}(\partial W) \longrightarrow H_{2k}(W) \longrightarrow 0$$ yields that $H_{2k}(W) = \Z / l\Z $ is cyclic and we also know that $H_{2k{+}1}(W)$ is torsion free since $W$ admits a handle decomposition without handles of index greater than $2k+2$ by assumption. Moreover, the intersection pairing is unimodular on a complement $H$ to $im(\iota ) \subseteq H_{2k{+}1}(W)$. We let $\{x_1,\ldots , x_{2r}\}$ be a symplectic basis for $H$ consisting of primitive elements, which can in turn be represented by spheres. Since the target is simply connected, we can use the Whitney trick to find embedded representatives in the interior of $W$. We can furthermore assume that the geometric intersection numbers of these spheres agree with their algebraic intersection numbers. \par Thus we have a configuration of embedded $(2k{+}1)$-dimensional spheres $\{S_1,\ldots , S_{2r}\}$ having a regular neighbourhood $N$ whose boundary is a homotopy sphere $\Sigma $. It follows that $W$ decomposes as a boundary connected sum $$W =W_l\thinspace \natural \thinspace W_\Sigma ,$$ where $W_\Sigma \cong N$ is $2k$-connected. This boundary connected sum is obtained by choosing an embedded path $\gamma $ from $\partial N$ to $\partial W$ and removing $N$ along with a tubular neighbourhood of $\gamma $. Note that in this decomposition $\partial W_l = M \# (-\Sigma )$. Applying Mayer-Vietoris, we conclude that $H_{2k}(W_l) \cong \Z / l\Z $. This proves the first part of the proposition. \par We now consider the topology of $W_l$ and prove the remainder of the proposition. $W_l$ is $(2k{-}1)$-connected, hence it follows by handle cancelling that $W_l$ is obtained by attaching handles of index at least $2k$ to $ST^*S^{2k{+}1} \# \Sigma _0 \# (-\Sigma )$. Turning this handle decomposition upside down gives a handle decomposition with handles of index at most $2k+2$. Then by further cancellation of handles we can find a handle decomposition with at most one handle of index $2k$ and at most two handles of index $2k{+}1$, where we use the fact that $W_l$ is simply connected. This proves case $(1)$. \par If $l = 1$, then the handle decomposition of $W_l$ reduces further to contain a single $(2k{+}1)$-handle, and $W_1$ is diffeomorphic to a linear $D^{2k{+}1}$-bundle over $S^{2k{+}1}$. This bundle must be stably trivial, otherwise $M$ will have a non{-}trivial stable tangent bundle. Moreover, by analysing the homotopy long exact sequence of the fibration \[ SO(2k{+}1) \to SO(2k{+}2) \to S^{2k{+}1}, \] one sees that any stably trivial bundle over $S^{2k{+}1}$ is either trivial or isomorphic to the unit tangent bundle of the sphere. If $k \neq 1, 3$ then $W_1$ cannot be the total space of the trivial bundle, because this would give rise to the existence of a map $f \colon M \to S^{2k}$ as in Lemma \ref {lem:cotangent} which is impossible. On the other hand, if $k = 1, 3$, then the tangent bundle of $S^{2k{+}1}$ is trivial. In both cases we conclude that there is a diffeomorphism $W_1 \cong DT^*S^{2k{+}1}$, which proves case $(2)$. \par If $l = 0$, then $H_{2k}(W) = H_{2k}(W_0) =\Z $. \begin {comment} since $W \simeq W _0 \natural W_\Sigma $, we conclude that there is a map $g \colon W \to S^{2k}$ inducing an isomorphism on $H_{2k}$. The map $f \colon \del W \to S^{2k}$ obtained by composing the inclusion $\del W \to W$ with $g$ then gives a map satisfying the hypotheses of Lemma \ref {lem:cotangent} and hence $k = 1, 3$. Moreover, \end {comment} It follows that the handle decomposition of $W_0$ has just one $2k$-handle and hence $W_0$ is diffeomorphic to a linear $D^{2k{+}2}$-bundle over $S^{2k}$. This bundle is stable and must be stably trivial, otherwise the tangent bundle of $M$ would not be stably trivial. We conclude that $W_0$ is diffeomorphic to $D^{2k{+}2} \times S^{2k}$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 4.3  
 \label {rem:6d-fillings} Although not the focus of this work, the topology of Stein fillings, as opposed to their boundaries, is of independent interest and may be relevent to certain computations in contact homology. In the case that $k = 1$, Proposition \ref {prop:filling_cotangent_spheres} determines the smooth manifolds underlying Stein fillings of almost contact structures on $S^2 \times S^3$. In this dimension there are no exotic $5$-spheres \cite {Kervaire-Milnor63} and by \cite [Theorem 6.2]{Smale62} the manifold $W_\Sigma $ is diffeomorphic to $\#_r(S^3 \times S^3)-{\rm Int}(D^6)$. Concerning the manifolds $W_l$, we conjecture that they are classified up to diffeomorphism by $l$. If this is correct, then topological Stein fillings $(W, J)$ of $S^2 \times S^3$ are classified up to stably complex diffeomorphism by their integral homology groups $H_*(W)$ along with their first Chern class $c_1(J) \in H^2(W)$.
END Remark
 
BEGIN Lemma 4.4  
 \label {lem:c_k} If $k$ is odd, there exist almost contact structures $\varphi $ on $ST^*S^{2k{+}1}$ with non{-}zero $k^{th}$-Chern class, $0\neq c_k(\varphi ) \in H^{2k}(ST^*S^{2k{+}1}) \cong \Z $.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $\varphi _{can}$ be the standard almost contact structure underlying the canonical contact structure on $M = ST^*S^{2k{+}1}$, and let $\scxs _{can}$ be the stable complex structure determined by $\varphi _{can}$. Since $\scxs _{can}$ extends over $DT^*S^{2k{+}1}$, we have that $c_k(\varphi _{can}) = c_k(\scxs _{can}) = 0$. To find a stable complex structure $\scxs $ with $c_k(\scxs ) \neq 0$, we recall that the group $[M, SO/U]$ acts freely and transitively on the set of homotopy classes of stable complex structures on $M$. Now if we let $M^\bullet := M \setminus B^{4k+1}$ be the manifold obtained by removing a ball, then there is a homotopy equivalence $M^\bullet \simeq S^{2k} \vee S^{2k+1}$ and hence \begin {equation} \label {eq:M_to_SO/U} [M^\bullet , SO/U] \cong \pi _{2k}(SO/U) \oplus \pi _{2k{+}1}(SO/U). \end {equation} Since $k$ is odd, $\pi _{4k}(SO/U) = 0$ \cite {Bott59}, and so there is no obstruction to extending a map $M^\bullet \to SO/U$ to a map $M \to SO/U$. Hence the restiction map $[M, SO/U] \to [M^\bullet , SO/U]$ is onto. Again using that $k$ is odd, the boundary map, $\pi _{2k}(SO/U) \to \pi _{2k{-}1}(U)$, in the homotopy long exact sequence of the fibration $U \to SO \to SO/U$ is non{-}zero \cite {Bott59}. Since $\pi _{2k{-}1}(U)$ classifies stable unitary bundles over $S^{2k}$ which are in turn classified by their $k^{th}$ Chern class \cite [Proposition 9.1]{Husemoller94}, it follows from \eqref {eq:M_to_SO/U} and the discussion above that we can choose $\psi \in [M, SO/U]$ such that $\scxs : = \scxs _{can} + \psi $ has $c_k(\scxs ) \neq 0$. By \cite [Lemma 2.17]{BCS2}, we know that $\scxs $ destabilizes to an almost contact structure $\varphi $, which then also has $c_k(\varphi ) \neq 0$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma 4.5  
 \label {lem:non_filling_cotangent} Let $\varphi $ be an almost contact structure on $M = ST^*S^{2k{+}1}$ with $c_k(\varphi ) \neq 0$ and let $(\Sigma ,\varphi _{\Sigma })$ be any almost contact homotopy sphere. If $k \neq 1, 3$, then neither $(M \# \Sigma , \varphi \# \varphi _{\Sigma })$ nor $\bigl ( -(M \# \Sigma ), -(\varphi \# \varphi _{\Sigma }) \bigr )$ is Stein fillable.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Suppose that $(W, J)$ is a Stein filling of $(M\#\Sigma ,\varphi \#\varphi _{\Sigma })$. Since $c_k(\varphi \#\varphi _{\Sigma }) = c_k(\varphi )$ is non{-}zero and pulls back from $c_k(J) \in H^{2k}(W)$, we conclude that $H^{2k}(W)$ is infinite. Now by Proposition \ref {prop:filling_cotangent_spheres}, this can only happen if $k = 1, 3$. Since we assumed $k \neq 1, 3$, no such Stein filling $(W, J)$ can exist. For the reversed orientation, we use \cite [Propostion 6.7]{BCS2} which states that $(M \# \Sigma , \varphi \# \varphi _{\Sigma })$ is Stein fillable if and only if $\bigl ( -(M \# \Sigma ), -(\varphi \# \varphi _{\Sigma }) \bigr )$ is Stein fillable.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem \ref {thm:mainconnsum}] We let $k \geq 5$ be odd and set $(M,\varphi ) = (ST^*S^{2k{+}1},\varphi )$, where we have $c_k(\varphi ) \neq 0$. By Lemma \ref {lem:c_k} such almost contact structures always exist. Now, by Lemma \ref {lem:non_filling_cotangent}, for any almost contact homotopy sphere $(\Sigma , \varphi _{\Sigma })$ neither $(M \# \Sigma , \varphi \# \varphi _{\Sigma })$ nor $\bigl ( -(M \# \Sigma ), -(\varphi \# \varphi _{\Sigma }) \bigr )$ is Stein fillable. \par On the other hand, we let $M^{\bullet } = M \setminus B^{4k{+}1}$ and we let $\varphi ^{\bullet }$ be the induced almost contact structure on $M^\bullet $. We set $W^{4k+2} := M^\bullet \times [0,1]$, which has a natural almost complex structure $\varphi ^\bullet \times [0, 1]$ induced by $\varphi ^{\bullet }$. Moreover, the smoothened boundary of $W$ with the induced almost contact structure is precisely $(M,\varphi ) \# (-M, -\varphi )$. Since $M$ is $(2k{-}1)$-connected, it follows from a theorem of Smale \cite [Theorem C]{Smale61}, that $M^\bullet $ admits a handle decomposition with handles of index less than or equal to $2k{+}1$. Since any handle decomposition on $M^\bullet $ gives rise to one on $M^\bullet \times I$ with handles of the same index, we have that $W = M^\bullet \times [0, 1]$ admits a handle decomposition with handles of index less than or equal to $2k{+}1$. Consequently $(W, \varphi ^\bullet \times [0, 1])$ is a topological Stein filling of $(M, \varphi ) \# (-M, -\varphi )$, which is then admits a Stein fillable contact representative $\xi _{M\# (-M)}$ by Theorem \ref {thm:h-principle}.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 4.6  
 Notice that the non{-}fillability of $(ST^*S^{2k{+}1}, \acs )$ in Theorem \ref {thm:mainconnsum} arises from the choice of the almost contact structure $\acs $, since $ST^*S^{2k{+}1}$ does admit Stein fillable contact structures. In \cite {BCS3} we shall prove a stronger version of Theorem \ref {thm:mainconnsum} which asserts the existence of $(4k{-}1)$-connected closed smooth $(8k{+}1)$-manifolds $M$, such that $M$ (and $M\# \Sigma $ for any homotopy sphere $\Sigma $) admits no Stein fillable almost contact structure at all, but $M \# (-M)$ is Stein fillable. We would like to point out that our result is on the almost contact level: we do not claim that the Stein fillable contact structure $\xi _{M\# (-M)}$ on $M\# (-M)$ found in the proof of Theorem~\ref {thm:mainconnsum} (representing the almost contact structure $\varphi \# (-\varphi )$) can be given as a connected sum $\xi _+\# \xi _-$ where $\xi _{\pm }$ is a contact structure on $\pm M$.

BEGIN Lemma 4.7  
 \label {lem:5d-almost-contact-disconnected-sum} Let $\acs $ be an almost contact stucture on the connected sum of $5$-manifolds $M_0$ and $M_1$. Then there are, up to homotopy unique, almost contact structures $\acs _0$ on $M_0$ and $\acs _1$ on $M_1$, such that $(M_0 \# M_1, \acs ) = (M_0 \# M_1, \acs _0 \# \acs _1)$.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 For $i = 0, 1$, let $M_i^\bullet := M_i - {\rm int}(D^5) \subset M_0 \# M_1$ be the punctured copy of $M_i$ contained in the connected sum. We define $\acs _i|_{M_i^\bullet } := \acs |_{M_i^\bullet }$. It remains to show that there is a unique extension of $\acs _i|_{M_i^\bullet }$ to an almost contact structure on $M_i$. Now the obstruction to extension lies in $\pi _4(SO(5)/U(2))$ and the obstruction to uniqueness lies in $\pi _5(SO(5)/U(2))$. By \cite {Massey61}, we have $\pi _4(SO(5)/U(2)) = \pi _5(SO(5)/U(2)) = 0$, which concludes the proof.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Theorem 4.8  
 \label {thm:5fill-main} Let $(M, \acs ) = (M_0 \# M_1, \acs _0 \# \acs _1)$ be a Stein fillable almost contact $5$-manifold. Assume that either $c_1(\acs ) = 0$ or that \[ c_1(\acs )(\pi _2(M_0)) = c_1(\acs )(\pi _2(M_1)) = \Z = \pi _2(BU).\] Then both $(M_0, \acs _0)$ and $(M_1, \acs _1)$ are Stein fillable.
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $\scxs , \scxs _0$ and $\scxs _1$ be the stable complex structures determined by $\acs , \acs _0$ and $\acs _1$ respectively. After stabilizing we have $(M, \scxs ) = (M_0, \scxs _0) \# (M_1, \scxs _1)$. Also, let $K_i = K(\pi _1(M_i), 1)$ so that $K(\pi _1(M), 1) = K_0 \vee K_1$. Under the assumptions of the proposition, \cite [Lemma~2.13]{BCS2} implies that the complex normal $1$-type of $(M, \scxs )$ is given by \[ (B^1_\scxs , \eta ^1_\scxs ) \cong (BSU \times \left ( K_0 \vee K_1 \right ), {\rm pr}_{BSU}) \] if $c_1(\acs ) = 0$ and \[ (B^1_\scxs , \eta ^1_\scxs ) \cong (BU \times \left ( K_0 \vee K_1 \right ), {\rm pr}_{BU}) \] if $c_1(\acs )(\pi _2(M_0)) =c_1(\acs )(\pi _2(M_1))= \pi _2(BU) = \mathbb {Z}$. Since $\eta ^1_\scxs $ is the projection to $BSU$ resp.\ $BU$, there is a canonical isomorphism $\Omega _5(B^1_\zeta ; \eta ^1_\zeta ) \cong \Omega _5^G(K_0 \vee K_1)$ for $G = U$ or $SU$, which we use in the remainder of the proof. \par Let us now assume that $c_1(\acs ) = 0$. The argument in the other cases is formally the same, and is given by replacing the map $BSU \to BU$ by ${\rm Id} \colon BU \to BU$. Let $\bscxs \colon M \to B^1_\scxs $ be a $\scxs $-compatible normal $1$-smoothing. We first consider the product smoothing $\bscxs \circ {\rm pr}_M \colon M \times [0, 1] \to M \to B^1_\scxs $ and attach a 6-dimensional $5$-handle to $M \times \{1\}$ along the connect sum locus $S^4 \times [0, 1] \subset M = M_0 \# M_1$ to obtain a bordism $W$. Since $\pi _4(SO/SU) = 0$, there is no obstruction to making this a stably complex $5$-handle (see \cite [Section 2.3]{BCS2}), and indeed there is no obstruction to extending $\bscxs \circ {\rm pr}_M$ to a normal smoothing $\bscxs '_{W} \colon W \to B^1_\scxs $. \begin {comment} \jbcomm {OPTION 1:} Now let ${\rm col}_0 \colon K_0 \vee K_1 \to K_1$ denote the map which collapses $K_0$ to a point, and consider the map \[ \bscxs _{W} : = ({\rm Id}_{BSU} \times {\rm col}_0) \circ \bscxs '_{W} \colon W_0 \longrightarrow BSU \times (K_0 \vee K_1) \longrightarrow BSU \times K_1.\] This is a normal map, and setting $\bscxs _i := \bscxs _{W}|_{M_i} \colon M_i \to BSU \times K_1$, $(W, \bscxs _W)$ gives the equation \[ [M, {\rm col}_0 \circ \bscxs ] = [M_0, \bscxs _0] + [M, \bscxs _1] \in \Omega _5^{SU}(K_1).\] Now, by Theorem \ref {thm:stein}, $[M, \bscxs ] = 0$ since $(M, \acs )$ is Stein fillable, and so $[M, {\rm col}_0, \circ \bscxs ] = 0$. Moreover, the composition ${\rm pr}_{K_1} \circ \bscxs _0 \colon M_0 \to K_1$ is null-homotopic, and since $\Omega ^{SU}_5 = 0$ (\cite [p.\,248]{Stong1}), it follows that $[M_0, \bscxs _0] = 0$. Hence $[M_1, \bscxs _1] = 0$, but $\bscxs _1 \colon M_1 \to BSU \times K_1$ is a $\scxs _1$-compatible normal $1$-smoothing. Applying Theorem \ref {thm:stein} again, we conclude that $(M_1, \acs _1)$ is Stein fillable. \par \par \par \jbcomm {OPTION 2:} \end {comment} Consider the map $\bscxs _W$ given by taking the composition of $\bscxs '_{W}$ with the collapsing map induced by the wedge sum: \par \[ W \stackrel {\bscxs '_{W}} \longrightarrow BSU \times (K_0 \vee K_1) \stackrel {{\rm col}} \longrightarrow BSU \times K_1.\] This is a normal map, and setting $\bscxs _i$ to be the restriction of $\zeta _W$ to $M_i$ we see that the bordism $(W, \bscxs _W)$ gives the equality \[ [M, {\rm col} \circ \bscxs ] = [M_0, \bscxs _0] + [M_1, \bscxs _1] \in \Omega _5^{SU}(K_1).\] Now, by Theorem \ref {thm:stein}, $[M, \bscxs ] = 0$ since $(M, \acs )$ is Stein fillable, and consequently the bordism class $[M, {\rm col} \circ \bscxs ]$ is trivial too. Moreover, since the composition ${\rm pr}_{K_1} \circ \bscxs _0 \colon M_0 \to K_1$ is null-homotopic and the bordism group $\Omega ^{SU}_5 = \Omega _5^{U} = 0$ according to \cite [p.\,248]{Stong1}, it follows that $[M_0, \bscxs _0] = 0$. Hence the bordism class $[M_1, \bscxs _1]$ is trivial. Since the map $$\bscxs _1 \colon M_1 \to BSU \times K_1$$ is a $\scxs _1$-compatible normal $1$-smoothing, Theorem \ref {thm:stein} implies that $(M_1, \acs _1)$ is Stein fillable. The same argument \emph {mutatis mutandis} shows that $(M_0, \acs _0)$ is Stein fillable as well.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 4.9  
 We point out that in dimension five the method in the proof of Theorem \ref {thm:5fill-main} does not ascend to give control over contact structures. That is, if the almost contact manifolds $(M_0, \acs _0)$ and $(M_1, \acs _1)$ are induced from contact manifolds $(M_0, \xi _0)$ and $(M_1, \xi _1)$, and even if we know that $(M_0 \# M_1, \xi _0 \# \xi _1)$ is Stein fillable, then in contrast to the situation in dimension 3, we cannot conclude that $(M_0, \xi _0)$ and $(M_1, \xi _1)$ are Stein fillable.
END Remark
 
BEGIN Remark 4.10  
 Note that in the proof of Theorem \ref {thm:5fill-main} involved constructing a nullbordism of each component of the connected sum $M_0 \# M_1$ by first adding a $5$-handle and then capping off two of the resulting boundary components. This bordism is thus far from having the correct homotopy type, but applying surgery below the middle dimension as in the proof of Theorem \ref {thm:stein} has the virtue of remedying this.

Let $\bscxs \colon M \to B^{4k{-}2}_\scxs $ be a $(4k{-}2)$-smoothing. By Theorem \ref {thm:stein} we have $[M, \bscxs ] = 0 \in \Omega _{8k{-}1}^{U\an {4k{-}1}}$. The connected sum $(M, \bscxs \# \bscxs _{ex}) : = (M, \bscxs ) \# (S^{8k{-}1}, \bscxs _{ex})$ does not change the complex normal $(4k{-}2)$-type, and \[ [M, \bscxs \# \bscxs _{ex}] = [M, \bscxs ] + [S^{8k{-}1}, \bscxs _{ex}] \in \Omega _{8k{-}1}^{U\an {4k{-}1}}. \] By Theorem~\ref {thm:S8k{-}1} the stable complex manifold $(S^{8k{-}1}, \zeta _{ex})$ is not Stein fillable, and so by Theorem \ref {thm:stein} $[S^{8k{-}1}, \bscxs _{ex}] \neq 0$, since $(BU\an {4k}, \pi _{4k})$ is the complex normal $(4k{-}2)$-type of $(S^{8k-1}, \bscxs _{ex})$. It follows that $[M, \bscxs \# \bscxs _{ex}] \neq 0$ and consequently $(M, \scxs \# \scxs _{ex})$ is not Stein fillable by Theorem \ref {thm:stein}, since $(BU\an {4k}, \pi _{4k})$ is the complex normal $(4k{-}2)$-type of $(M, \scxs \# \scxs _{ex})$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 5.2  
 \label {rem:Contact_existence} According to \cite [Proposition 6 (vi)]{Geiges97}, the hypothesis of Corollary \ref {cor:wacky} that the $(4k{-}2)$-connected $(8k{-}1)$-manifold $M$ admit an almost contact structure is equivalent to assuming that $\im (\tau _{M*}) \subseteq F_*(\pi _{4k}(BU))$. In Theorem~\ref {thm:Yang+}\,(3) below, we prove that provided $k\geq 2$, the same condition is a necessary and sufficient condition for a $(4k{-}1)$-connected $8k$-manifold to admit a stable complex structure.
END Remark
 
BEGIN Remark 5.3  
 \label {rem:Geiges-obstruction} The stable almost contact structures $\scxs $ and $\scxs \# \scxs _{ex}$ appearing in the proof of Corollary~\ref {cor:wacky} differ by precisely the {\em ``top-dimensional $\Z /2$-obstruction to stable homotopy of almost contact structures''} identified by Geiges in \cite [Theorem 4 (2b)]{Geiges97}. \par \par 
END Remark
 
BEGIN Remark 5.4  
 By \cite {BEM} the stable almost contact structure found in Corollary~\ref {cor:wacky} (as any stable complex, or even almost contact structure) can be represented by an overtwisted contact structure; according to Theorem \ref {thm:S8k{-}1} the stable almost contact structure $\zeta _{ex}$ on $S^{8k-1}$ as well as the stable contact structure found by Corollary~\ref {cor:wacky} cannot be represented by Stein fillable contact structures. It would be interesting to see if these particular stable complex structures admit fillable or tight (that is, not overtwisted) contact representatives.

BEGIN Remark 5.6  
 \label {rem:Yang_and_us} Using the Hurewicz isomorphism $\pi _{4k}(Y) \cong H_{4k}(Y)$ and the Universal Coefficient Theorem, we regard the homomorphism $\tau _{Y*} \colon \pi _{4k}(Y) \to \pi _{4k}(BSO) = \Z $ as a cohomology class $\tau _{Y*} \in H^{4k}(Y)$, which Yang denotes by $\nu $. When $k$ is even, $F_*(\pi _{4k}(BU)) \subset \pi _{4k}(BSO)$ is the subgroup of index two \cite {Bott59}, and so the condition $\im (\tau _{Y*}) \subseteq F_*(\pi _{4k}(BU))$ is equivalent to the condition that $\tau _{Y*}$ vanishes mod~$2$, which is the condition Yang uses.

BEGIN Remark 5.8  
 \label {rem:Yang+} The simplification achieved in moving from Theorem \ref {thm:Yang} to Theorem \ref {thm:Yang+} is perhaps surprising and rests on Theorem \ref {thm:bernoulli}, which is a non{-}trivial fact about the differences of reciprocals of Bernoulli numbers. Theorem~\ref {thm:Yang+} can be interpreted as a statement about the characteristic numbers (signature and $p_{k}^2$) of closed $(4k{-}1)$-connected almost complex smooth manifolds and the bordism groups $\Omega _{8k}^{U\an {4k{-}1}}$. It would be interesting to see if there are further connections between number theory and the characteristic numbers of closed $j$-connected almost complex $n$-manifolds for other values of $j$ and $n$.
END Remark
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem \ref {thm:Yang+}] For $k=1, 2$, $B_1 = \frac {1}{6}$ and $B_2 = B_4 = \frac {1}{30}$, see e.g.~\cite [p.\,12]{Hirzebruch66}. Hence \[ \frac {B_{2}+B_{1}}{B_{2}B_{1}} \cdot \frac {\sigma _Y}{2^{2}} = 9 \sigma _Y \quad \text {and} \quad \frac {B_{4}-B_{2}}{B_{4}B_{2}}= 0\] and Theorem \ref {thm:Yang} implies Theorem \ref {thm:Yang+} in these two cases. \par The case $k > 2$ will follow from a result of Wall, a fact about Bernoulli numbers (see Theorem~\ref {thm:bernoulli} in the Appendix) and from the evenness of $\sigma _Y$. As in Remark \ref {rem:Yang_and_us}, we regard $\tau _{Y*}$ as a cohomology class $\tau _{Y*} \in H^{4k}(Y)$ and define the integer \[ \tau _Y^2 : = \an {(\tau _{Y*})^2, [Y]}. \] Setting $a_k := \frac {3-(-1)^k}{2}$, Wall \cite [$(15)_m$]{Wall62} proved that the $\wh A$-genus of a $(4k{-}1)$-connected $8k$-manifold $Y$ is given by the following formula: \begin {equation} \label {eq:A2m} \wh A_{2k}(Y) = \frac {a_k^2 \cdot 2^{4k-4}\cdot B_k^2 \cdot (2^{2k}-1)^2 \cdot \tau _Y^2 - k^2 \sigma _Y}{2^{4k{+}1} \cdot k^2 \cdot (2^{4k{-}1}-1)}, \end {equation} where $\tau _Y^2 = \chi ^2$ in Wall's notation. Now let $B_k = \frac {N_k}{D_k}$ where $N_k$ and $D_k$ denote respectively the numerator and denominator of $B_k$ expressed in lowest terms. We recall from \cite [p.\,284]{Milnor&Stasheff74} that $N_k$ is odd and that $D_k = 2 D'_k$ where $D'_k$ is odd: in fact $D_k'$ is the product of odd primes $p$ such that $(p-1)$ divides $2k$. Writing $k = 2^j \cdot c$ for $c$ an odd integer, $j \geq 0$, we rewrite \eqref {eq:A2m} as \begin {equation} \label {eq:A2m-1} \wh A_{2k}(Y) = \frac {a_k^2 \cdot 2^{4k-6-2j} \cdot N_k^2 \cdot (2^{2k}-1)^2 \cdot \tau _Y^2 - (D'_k)^2 \cdot c^2 \cdot \sigma _Y} {2^{4k{+}1} \cdot c^2 \cdot (D'_k)^2 \cdot (2^{4k{-}1}-1) }. \end {equation} Since $k > 2$ and $Y$ is $(4k{-}1)$-connected, the intersection form of $Y$ is even by \cite {Wall62}, and hence $\tau _Y^2$ is an even in integer. In addition, if $k$ is even, then for $Y$ to admit a stably complex structure, $\tau _Y$ must lie in $2H^{4k}(Y)$, and so $8$ divides $\tau _Y^2$. Since $\wh A_{2k}(Y)$ is an integer, \eqref {eq:A2m-1} entails that $ 2^{4k-3-2j}$ divides $\sigma _Y$. \par To apply Theorem~\ref {thm:Yang} when $k$ is odd, we must show that \[ \Num \left ( \frac {B_{2k}+B_{k}}{B_{2k}B_{k}} \cdot \frac {\sigma _Y}{2^{4k{-}2}} \right ) \] is even, where $\Num \left ( \frac {a}{b}\right ) $ denotes the numerator of $\frac {a}{b}$, expressed in lowest terms. Since $k$ is odd, $j = 0$, and hence $2^{4k-3}$ divides $\sigma _Y$. Furthermore, the largest power of $2$ which divides $\Denom \left ( \frac {\sigma _Y}{2^{4k{-}2}} \right )$ is $2$. But \[ \Num \left ( \frac {B_{2k}+B_k}{B_{2k}B_k} \right ) = D_kN_{2k}+D_{2k}N_k = 2(D'_kN_{2k} + D'_{2k}N_k)\] is divisible by $2^2$, and condition (1) in Theorem~\ref {thm:Yang} holds. \par To apply Theorem~\ref {thm:Yang} when $k$ is even, we must show that \[ \Num \left ( \frac {B_{2k}-B_{k}}{B_{2k}B_{k}} \cdot \frac {4k \cdot \sigma _Y}{2^{4k}}\right ) \] is even. Since $k = 2^j c$ and $2^{4k-3-2j}$ divides $\sigma _Y$, the largest power of $2$ which can divide $\Denom \left ( \frac {4k \cdot \sigma _Y}{2^{4k}} \right )$ is $2^{j+1}$. By Theorem~\ref {thm:bernoulli}, $2^{j+3}$ divides $\Num \left ( \frac {B_{2k}-B_k}{B_{2k}B_k} \right )$, which ensures that condition (2) in Theorem~\ref {thm:Yang} holds.

BEGIN Lemma 5.9  
 \label {lem:delJ_is_topological} Let $q \equiv 3$~mod~$4$ and let $(W, J)$ be an almost complex $(2q{+}2)$-manifold with $\del W = S^{2q{+}1}$. The stable complex structure induced on the boundary, $(S^{2q{+}1}, S\del \acxs )$, is independent on the choice of the almost complex structure $\acxs $ up to homotopy and depends only on the oriented diffeomorphism type of $W$.
END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $(W,J_0)$ and $(W,J_1)$ be two almost complex structures on the same topological Stein filling of $S^{2q{+}1}$, which is then a $q$-connected manifold. By the Hurewicz Theorem and repeated application of the Whitney trick we can find a basis of $H_{q{+}1}(W)$ consisting of primitive elements $\{ x_1, \dots , x_n \}$ represented by embeddedings $f_i \colon S^{q{+}1} \hookrightarrow W$. The embedded spheres $f_i(S^{q{+}1})$ will intersect in the pattern determine by the intersection form of $W$, which is unimodular, since the boundary of $M$ is a sphere, and is denoted by \[ \lambda _W \colon H_{q{+}1}(W) \times H_{q{+}1}(W) \to \Z .\] \par We now consider the boundary connected sum $\big ( W\natural (-W), J_0\natural (-J_1) \bigr )$, given by reversing the orientation on $(W, J_1)$ and then attaching an almost complex $1$-handle. This manifold is again $q$-connected. By tubing together the two copies of the embeddings $f_i$, taking care to reverse the orientation along the tube, we obtain embeddedings $f_i \# (-f_i) \colon S^{q{+}1} \hookrightarrow W \natural (-W)$, which represent a basis of the anti-diagonal summand \[ L := \left \langle (x_1, -x_1) \, \dots \,, (x_n, -x_n) \right \rangle \subset H_{q{+}1}(W\natural (-W)) = H_{q+1}(W) \oplus H_{q+1}(W). \] We claim that this basis for $L$ is represented by disjoint embedded $(q{+}1)$-spheres with trivial normal bundle. The normal bundle of each embedding $f_i \# (-f_i)$, $i = 1, \dots , n$, is isomorphic to the Whitney sum of the normal bundle of $f_i$ and its inverse, and so is trivial. Moreover, the intersection form of $W \natural (-W)$ is the orthogonal sum $\lambda _W \oplus -\lambda _W$, and so for all pairs $(i, j)$, the algebraic intersection of $(x_i, -x_i)$ with $(x_j, -x_j)$ is given by \[ \lambda _{W \natural (-W)}((x_i, -x_i), (x_j, -x_j)) = \lambda _W(x_i, x_j) - \lambda _W(-x_i, -x_j) = 0 .\] By further applications of the Whitney trick, we arrive at the required disjoint embeddings $\phi _i \colon D^{q{+}1} \times S^{q{+}1} \hookrightarrow W \natural (-W)$ representing the given basis of $L$. \par The stable complex structure induced on $\phi _i(D^{q{+}1} \times S^{q{+}1})$ by $\scxs = S(J_0 \natural (-J_1))$ may be regarded as an element $\scxs _i \in \pi _{q{+}1}(SO/U)$ and since $q \equiv 3$~mod~$4$, each $\scxs _i$ lies in the image of the map $\pi _{q{+}1}(SO) \to \pi _{q{+}1}(SO/U)$. Moreover, the condition that $q \equiv 3$~mod~$4$ implies that the stabilization homomorphism $\pi _{q{+}1}(SO(q{+}1)) \to \pi _{q{+}1}(SO)$ is onto by \cite {Kervaire60}, and hence we may reframe our embeddings to obtain new embeddings $\bar \phi _i$ so that each $\scxs _i$ is trivial. It follows that there is no obstruction to extending the stable complex structure induced by $J_0 \natural (-J_1)$ on $W \natural (-W)$ over a handle attachment along $\bar \phi _i$. That is, we may perform stably complex surgeries on the embeddings $\bar \phi _i$: see \cite [Section 2.3]{BCS1}. The trace of these surgeries is a stably complex bordism, relative to the boundary, to a simply connected homology ball, which is in turn a topological ball: see \cite [Lemma 7.1]{Kervaire-Milnor63}. Moreover, the stable almost complex structure on the boundary is equal to the stabilization of $\del \acxs _0 \# (-\del \acxs _1)$. It follows that $S(\del \acxs _0 \#(-\del \acxs _1)) $ is the standard stable complex structure and thus that $S\del \acxs _0 = S\del \acxs _1$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem \ref {thm:S8k{-}1}] Suppose that $k \geq 2$. Let $(W, J)$ be a Stein filling with boundary $S^{8k{-}1}$, and consider the smooth closed oriented manifold $X$ obtained by adding the $8k$-disc to $W$ via the identity map: \[ X : = W \cup _{\rm Id} D^{8k}. \] We consider the manifold $X = W \cup _{\Id } D^{8k}$. Note that since $W$ admits an almost complex structure $\acxs $ by hypothesis, we have $\im (\tau _{X*}) = \im (\tau _{W*}) \subset F_*(\pi _{4k}(BU))$. It follows from Theorem \ref {thm:Yang+} that $X$ also admits a stable complex structure $\scxs _X$. \par Now take the resulting stably complex manifold $(X, \scxs _X)$ and remove a small open disc. The outcome is a smooth oriented manifold diffeomorphic to $W$ with an induced stable complex structure $\scxs _W$. Since $\scxs _W$ extends to $X$, we conclude that the induced stable complex structure $\del \scxs _W$ on $S^{8k{-}1}$ is homotopic to $\scxs _0$. Now by Lemma~\ref {lem:delJ_is_topological}, the stable complex structures $S \del J$ and $\del \scxs _W$ are homotopic and hence $S \del J$ is homotopic to $\scxs _0$. This shows that only the standard stable complex structure on $S^{8k{-}1}$ admits a Stein filling, which proves Theorem \ref {thm:S8k{-}1}.

 [Proof of Theorem~\ref {thm:bernoulli}] Recall that $k = 2^j c$ where $c$ is odd and $j \geq 1$. Since $k$ is even, the Bernoulli numbers $\BN _{2k}$ and $\BN _{4k}$ have the same sign. Thus, we can apply Proposition~\ref {prop:bernoulli_ord2} to obtain that \begin {align*} \ord _2 \left ( \frac {B_{2k} - B_k}{B_{2k}B_k} \right ) = 2 + \ord _2 ( \BN _{2k} - \BN _{4k} ) \geq \min ( 2k, 3 + \ord _2 k ) = 3 + \ord _2 k. \end {align*} The last step follows by a simple counting argument. Since $\ord _2 k = j$, this gives the result.
