BEGIN Theorem 3.1  
 \label {comp} The principle $\textup {HT}^{=2}_2$ is not computably true. That is, it has a computable instance with no computable solution.
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 We follow the outline of the proof given in the introduction. Let $M$ be as in Corollary \ref {usecor} for $q = \frac {1}{2}$, where we assume without loss of generality that $m \leq 2^{\frac {m}{2}}$ for all $m \geq M$. For each $i$, let $k_i = M + i$. For each $i$ with $|W_i| \geq k_i$, let $E_i$ consist of the first $k_i$ many elements enumerated into $W_i$, and let $E_i$ be undefined if $|W_i| < k_i$. Let $F_0, F_1, \ldots $ be a computable enumeration without repetitions of all finite sets of the form $E_i + s$ (over all $i, s \in \mathbb N$) such that $W_i$ contains at least $k_i$ many elements by stage $s$ (so that $E_i$ is known by stage $s$). Clearly, if $E_i$ is defined, then for all sufficiently large $s$ the set $E_i + s$ occurs in the sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots $, and conversely, every set in the sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots $ of cardinality $k_i$ has the form $E_i + s$ for some $s$. \par As explained in the introduction, it suffices to show that Corollary \ref {usecor} applies to the sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots $, since this corollary then gives the existence of a computable coloring $c : \mathbb N \rightarrow 2$ such that no $F_j$ is homogeneous for $c$. It follows that for all $i$ with $E_i$ defined, if $s$ is sufficiently large then $E_i + s$ is not homogeneous for $c$, so no solution to $c$ can contain $E_i$, and in particular $W_i$ is not a solution to $c$. \par We now verify that the hypotheses of Corollary \ref {usecor} are satisfied. Let $m \geq M$ and $n$ be given. We claim that there are at most $m$ many values of $j$ such that $|F_j|=m$ and $n \in F_j$. Let $i = m - M$, so that $|E_i| = k_i = m$. The claim asserts that there are most $m$ many values of $s$ such that $E_i + s$ occurs in the sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots $ and $n \in E_i + s$. If $n \in E_i + s$, then $n = x + s$ for some $x \in E_i$. There are $m$ many choices for $x$ and for each $x$ there is a unique $s$ with $n = x + s$, so the claim is proved. Since $m \leq 2^{\frac {m}{2}}$ by the choice of $M$, there are at most $2^{\frac {m}{2}}$ many values of $j$ such that $|F_j|=m$ and $n \in F_j$. It remains to check that the set of such $j$ can be effectively computed from $m$ and $n$. Again, let $i = m - M$. We must effectively compute the canonical index of the set $S$ of $s$ such that $W_i$ contains at least $m$ many elements by stage $s$ and $n \in E_i + s$. If $n \in E_i + s$, then $s \leq n$. So for each $s \leq n$ we can check effectively whether $W_i$ contains at least $m$ many elements by the end of stage $s$. If not, $s \notin S$. If so, we can effectively compute $E_i$ and then effectively determine whether $n \in E_i + s$, and hence whether $s \in S$. Hence, we can apply Corollary \ref {usecor} as described in the previous paragraph.

BEGIN Theorem 3.3  
 \label {main} Let $f$ be addition-like. There is a computable instance of $\textup {RT}^f_2$ such that the degree of any solution is DNC relative to $\emptyset '$.
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $b$ be a constant witnessing that $f$ is addition-like, as in part (3) of Definition~\ref {aldef}. Note that the fact that $f$ is addition-like implies that if $F$ is a finite set and $x \notin F$, then for all but finitely many $y$, we have $\min f(F,y) > \max f(F,x)$. Let $M$ be as in Corollary~\ref {usecor} for $q=\frac {1}{2}$. We may assume that $M>0$ and $M$ is sufficiently large so that $bm^2 \leq 2^{\frac {m}{2}}$ for all $m \geq M$. \par Given $i$ and $s$, for each $x \in W^{\emptyset '}_i[s]$, let $t_x$ be the least $t$ such that $x \in W^{\emptyset '}_i[u]$ for all $u \in [t,s]$. (I.e., $t_x$ measures how long $x$ has been in $W^{\emptyset '}_i$.) Order the elements of $W^{\emptyset '}_i[s]$ by letting $x \prec y$ if either $t_x<t_y$ or both $t_x=t_y$ and $x<y$. Let $E_i[s]$ be the set consisting of the least $b(M+i)$ many elements of $W^{\emptyset '}_i[s]$ under this ordering, or $E_i[s]=\emptyset $ if $W^{\emptyset '}_i[s]$ has fewer than $b(M+i)$ many elements.\footnote {This definition could be simplified by noting that there is a partial $\emptyset '$-computable function $\psi $ such that if $|W^{\emptyset '}_i| \geq b(M+i)$ then $\psi (i)$ is the canonical index of a set $E_i \subseteq W^{\emptyset '}_i$ such that $|E_i|=b(M+i)$. The limit lemma then gives us a computable binary function $g$ such that $\psi (i)=\lim _s g(i,s)$ for all $i$ such that $\psi (i)$ is defined, and we can define $E_i[s]$ to be the set with canonical index $g(i,s)$ if this set has size $b(M+i)$, and $E_i[s]=\emptyset $ otherwise. However, the current definition will make it easier to describe the adaptation of this proof to one over RCA$_0$ in the next section.} \par The following properties of this definition are the ones that matter to us: \begin {enumerate} \par \item The function taking $i$ and $s$ to $E_i[s]$ is computable. \par \item Every element of $E_i[s]$ is less than $s$, so $f(E_i[s],s)$ is defined. \par \item If $E_i[s] \neq \emptyset $ then $|f(E_i[s],s)| \geq M+i$. \par \item If $|W^{\emptyset '}_i| \geq b(M+i)$ then there is a $t$ such that $E_i[t] \neq \emptyset $ and $E_i[s]=E_i[t] \subseteq W^{\emptyset '}_i$ for all $s \geq t$. \par \end {enumerate} \par We build a computable sequence of finite sets $F_0,F_1,\ldots $ as follows. Order the pairs $i,s$ via a standard pairing function, and go through each such pair in order. If $E_i[s] = \emptyset $ then proceed to the next pair. Otherwise, let $s_0$ be least such that $E_i[t]=E_i[s]$ for all $t \in [s_0,s]$. Suppose that the following hold. \begin {enumerate} \par \item $\min f(E_i[s],s)>s_0$. \par \item If $u<s_0$ and $E_i[u] \neq \emptyset $ then $\min f(E_i[s],s) > \max f(E_i[u],u)$. \par \end {enumerate} Then add $f(E_i[s],s)$ to our sequence. We say that $f(E_i[s],s)$ was enumerated into our sequence by $i$. Otherwise do nothing. In any case, proceed to the next pair. \par Notice that if there is an $s_0$ such that $E_i[s]=E_i[s_0] \neq \emptyset $ for all $s \geq s_0$, then we add $f(E_i[s],s)$ to our sequence for all sufficiently large $s$, because for each $u<s_0$ and $n \leq \max f(E_i[u],u)$, there are only finitely many $s$ such that $n \in f(E_i[s_0],s)$, and similarly for each $n \leq s_0$. \par Now $F_0,F_1,\ldots $ is a computable sequence of finite sets, each of size at least $M$. Suppose that $n \in F_j$ and $|F_j|=m$. Then $F_j$ was enumerated by some $i < m$. (Actually $i \leq m-M$.) If $n$ is also in $F_l$ and $F_l$ was also enumerated by $i$, then we must have $F_j=f(E_i[s],s)$ and $F_l=f(E_i[t],t)$ for some $s$ and $t$ such that $E_i[t]=E_i[s]$. For each $x \in E_i[s]$, there are at most $b$ many $t$ such that $f(x,t)=n$, so there are at most $bm$ many such $l$. Thus the total number of elements of size $m$ in our sequence that contain $n$ is at most $bm^2 \leq 2^{\frac {m}{2}}$. \par By part (2) of Definition~\ref {aldef}, given $n$ and $m$, we can computably determine a stage $s \geq n$ such that for each $i<m$ and $t \geq s$, we have $\min f(E_i[n],t)>n$. It follows from the definition of our sequence that if $F$ is enumerated into it a stage at which we are working with a pair $i,t$ with $i<m$ and $t \geq s$, then $\min F > n$. So we can compute the set of all $j$ such that $|F_j|=m$ and $n \in F_j$. \par Thus the hypotheses of Corollary~\ref {usecor} are satisfied, and hence there is a computable $c$ as in that corollary. Suppose that $|W^{\emptyset '}_i| \geq b(M+i)$. Then there is an $F \subseteq W^{\emptyset '}_i$ such that $f(F,s)$ is in our sequence for all sufficiently large $s$. For each such $s$, there are $x,y \in F$ such that $c(f(x,s)) \neq c(f(y,s))$, so $F$ cannot be contained in a solution to $c$ as an instance of RT$^f_2$. Thus, if $H$ is a solution to $c$ and $W^{\emptyset '}_i \subseteq H$, then $|W^{\emptyset '}_i| < b(M+i)$, which means that $H$ is effectively immune relative to $\emptyset '$, and so has DNC degree relative to $\emptyset '$.

END Lemma
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Assume for a contradiction that $X$ has a solution $Y$ that is not hyperimmune. Let $F_0,F_1,\ldots $ be a computable sequence of pairwise disjoint finite sets such that $Y \cap F_i \neq \emptyset $ for all $i$. Let $\mathcal C$ be the collection of all $Z$ such that $\Psi (X,Z)$ holds and $Z \cap F_i \neq \emptyset $ for all $i$. Then $\mathcal C$ is a $\Pi ^0_1$ class, and is nonempty as it contains $Y$.

END Corollary
 
BEGIN Proposition 4.3  
 $2\textup {-EI}$ is equivalent to $2\textup {-DNC}$ over $\textup {RCA}_0$.
END Proposition
 
BEGIN Proof 
 We argue in RCA$_0$. First suppose that $2$-EI holds. Given $X$, let $A$ and $f$ be as in the statement of $2$-EI. Write $W_e^{X'} \approx W_i^{X'}$ if $W_e^{X'}[s]=W_i^{X'}[s]$ for all sufficiently large $s$. Notice that in this case, for each $n$ we have $n \in W_e^{X'}$ if{}f $n \in W_i^{X'}$, and $\|W_e^{X'}\| \geq m$ if{}f $\|W_i^{X'}\| \geq m$. \par Let $n_0<n_1<\cdots $ be the elements of $A$ in order. There is a function $g$ such that $W_{g(e)}^{X'}[s]=\{n_i<s : i<f(e)\}$ for all $s$. Then $W_{g(e)}^{X'} \not \approx W_e^{X'}$ for all $e$, as otherwise we would have $\|W_e^{X'}\| \geq f(e)$ but $n \in A$ for all $n \in W_e^{X'}$. \par There is a function $p$ such that $W^{X'}_{p(e)}[s]=W^{X'}_{y}[s]$ if $\Phi _e^{X'}(e)[s]=y$, and $W^{X'}_{p(e)}[s]=\emptyset $ if $\Phi _e^{X'}(e)[s]\diverges $. Let $h = g \circ p$. If $\Phi ^{X'}_e(e)=y$ then $W^{X'}_{p(e)} \approx W^{X'}_y$. But $W_{h(e)}^{X'} \not \approx W_{p(e)}^{X'}$, since $h(e)=g(p(e))$, so $W^{X'}_{h(e)} \not \approx W^{X'}_y$, and hence $h(e) \neq y$. Thus $h$ is as in the definition of $2$-DNC. \par Now suppose that $2$-DNC holds. Given $X$, let $h$ be as in the statement of $2$-DNC. We first define a function $g$ such that for each $e$, we have $g(e) \neq \Phi _i^{X'}(i)$ for all $i \leq e$. Let $\tau _0,\tau _1,\ldots $ list the elements of $\omega ^{<\omega }$. Let $(\tau )_i$ be the $i$th element of $\tau $ if $|\tau |>i$, and let $(\tau )_i=0$ otherwise. There is a function $r$ such that $\Phi ^{X'}_{r(i)}(r(i))=(\tau _k)_i$ if $\Phi ^{X'}_i(i)=k$ and $\Phi ^{X'}_{r(i)}(r(i))\diverges $ if $\Phi ^{X'}_i(i)\diverges $. Let $g(e)$ be such that $|\tau _{g(e)}|=e+1$ and $(\tau _{g(e)})_i=h(r(i))$ for all $i \leq e$. If $i \leq e$ and $\Phi _i^{X'}(i)=k$ then $(\tau _{g(e)})_i \neq (\tau _k)_i$, so $g(e) \neq k$. \par Let $D_0,D_1,\ldots $ list the finite sets. Order the elements of $W^{X'}_e[s]$ as in the proof of Theorem~\ref {main}. That is, for $x \in W^{X'}_e[s]$, let $t_x$ be the least $t$ such that $x \in W^{X'}_e[u]$ for all $u \in [t,s]$, then let $x \prec y$ if either $t_x<t_y$ or both $t_x=t_y$ and $x<y$. There is a function $q$ such that if $W^{X'}_e[s] \nsubseteq D_i$, then $\Phi ^{X'}_{q(e,i)}(q(e,i))[s]=n$ for the $\prec $-least $n \in W^{X'}_e[s] \setminus D_i$. \par We now define sequences $a_0<a_1<\cdots $ and $k_0,k_1,\ldots $ as follows. Suppose that we have defined $a_j$ and $k_j$ for all $j<e$. Let $i_e$ be such that $D_{i_e}=\{a_0,\ldots ,a_{e-1}\}$. Let $k_e=q(e,i_e)$. For $j \leq a_{e-1}$, let $m_j$ be such that $\Phi ^{X'}_{m_j}(m_j)=j$. Let $m=\max \{k_0,\ldots ,k_e,m_0,\ldots ,m_{a_{e-1}}\}$ and let $a_e=g(m)$. Notice that $a_e>a_{e-1}$. \par Let $A=\{a_0,a_1,\ldots \}$. This set exists because the $a_e$ are defined in order. Now suppose that $\|W_e^{X'}\| \geq e+1$. Then there are a finite set $F$ with $|F|=e+1$ and a $t$ such that for all $s \geq t$, every element of $F$ is in $W_e^{X'}[s]$. Let $$S=\{n\leq \max F : \exists s \geq t\, [n \notin W_e^{X'}[s]]\}.$$ By $\Sigma ^0_1$-bounding, there is a $u \geq t$ such that $\exists s \in [t,u]\, [n \notin W_e^{X'}[s]]$ for all $n \in S$. Let $G$ consist of the $e+1$ least elements of $W_e^{X'}[u]$ under the $\prec $-ordering. If $s \geq u$ then the elements of $G$ are also the least $e+1$ many elements of $W^{X'}_e[s]$ under the $\prec $-ordering. Since $|D_{i_e}|=e$, there is an $n \in G$ such that $\Phi ^{X'}_{q(e,i_e)}(q(e,i_e))[s]=n$ for all $s \geq u$, and hence $\Phi ^{X'}_{q(e,i_e)}(q(e,i_e))=n$. By the definition of $q$, we have that $n \neq a_j$ for $j<e$, and by construction, $n \neq a_j$ for $j \geq e$. Thus $n \in W^{X'}_e$ but $n \notin A$. So $A$ and the function $e \mapsto e+1$ are as required by $2$-EI.
