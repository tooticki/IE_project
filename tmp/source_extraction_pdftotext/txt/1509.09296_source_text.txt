BEGIN {\bf Theorem} 1  
 [CH]\label {oneextreme} There is a $\textsf {T}_3$ space $X$ that has countable strong fan tightness at each $x\in X$, yet ONE has a winning strategy in $\textsf {G}_1(\Omega _x,\Omega _x)$ at each $x\in X$.
END {\bf Theorem}
 
BEGIN {\bf Lemma} 2  
 \label {modestlemma} Let $(X,\tau )$ be a $\textsf {T}_1$-space with no isolated points. Assume that player ONE has a winning strategy in the game $\gone (\mathfrak {D},\mathfrak {ND})$ on $X$. Then at each $x\in X$ ONE has a winning strategy in the game $\gone (\Omega _x,\Omega _x)$.
END {\bf Lemma}
 
BEGIN Proof 
 Let $\sigma $ be a winning strategy for ONE in the game $\gone (\mathfrak {D},\mathfrak {ND})$. For each $x\in X$, define a strategy $\sigma _x$ as follows: \begin {itemize} \item {$\sigma _x(\emptyset ) = \sigma (\emptyset )\setminus \{x\}$, and } \item {for each finite sequence $(w_1,\;\cdots ,\; w_n)$ of elements of $X$, $\sigma _x(w_1,\;\cdots ,\; w_n) = \sigma (w_1,\;\cdots ,\; w_n)\setminus \{x\}$.} \end {itemize} Since $X$ has no isolated points, for each dense set $D\subset X$ and each $x\in X$, the set $D\setminus \{x\}$ is dense in $X$. Thus, $\sigma _x$ is a strategy for player ONE in the game $\gone (\mathfrak {D},\mathfrak {ND})$. Each $\sigma _x$ play of the game $\gone (\mathfrak {D},\mathfrak {ND})$ is a $\sigma $-play during which TWO never picked the element $x$. Thus, $\sigma _x$ is also a winning strategy for ONE in $\gone (\mathfrak {D},\mathfrak {ND})$. \par Now we note that at each $x\in X$ the strategy $\sigma _x$ is a winning strategy for ONE in the game $\gone (\Omega _x,\Omega _x)$: For consider a $\sigma _x$-play \[ O_1,\; w_1,\; O_2,\; w_2,\; \cdots ,\; O_n,\; w_n,\; \cdots \] For each $n$, $O_n$ is a dense set not containing the point $x$, and thus is an element of $\Omega _x$. The set $\{w_n:0<n<\omega \}$ is a discrete subset of $X$ and does not contain the point $x$. Thus, let $U$ be a neighborhood of $x$ meeting the set of moves by TWO in at most one point, say $w_n$. Since $x\neq w_n$ and $X$ is $\textsf {T}_1$, there is a neighborhood $W$ of $x$ that does not contain $w_n$. But then $U\cap W$ is a neighborhood of $x$ disjoint from $\{w_n:0<n<\omega \}$. It follows that $\{w_n:0<n<\omega \}$ is not an element of $\Omega _x$.
END Proof
