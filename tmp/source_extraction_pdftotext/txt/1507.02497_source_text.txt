BEGIN Lemma 1.1  
 \label {lem.quotient.adjoint} Let $\sA $ and $\sB $ be Grothendieck categories with localizing subcategories $\sS \subseteq \sA $ and $\sT \subseteq \sB $. Let $\pi :\sA \to \sA /\sS $ and $\pi ':\sB \to \sB /\sT $ be the quotient functors, and let $\omega $ and $\omega '$ be right adjoints to $\pi $ and $\pi '$ respectively. Consider the following diagram of functors: \begin {equation} \label {comm.diag} \UseComputerModernTips \xymatrix { \sA \ar [r]^F \ar [d]_{\pi } & \sB \ar [d]^{\pi '} \\ \sA /\sS & \sB /\sT . } \end {equation} Suppose that $F$ is right exact and $F(\sS ) \subseteq \sT $. If $L_1(\pi 'F)$, the first left derived functor of $\pi 'F$, exists, which it does when $\sA $ has enough projectives, and vanishes on $\sS $, then \begin {enumerate} \item the natural transformation $\pi 'F \to \pi 'F\omega \pi $ induced by the natural transformation $\eta :\id _{\sA } \to \omega \pi $ is an isomorphism; \item there is a unique functor $G:\sA /\sS \to \sB /\sT $ such that $\pi 'F=G\pi $; furthermore, $G\cong \pi 'F\omega $; \item $G$ is right exact; \item {} if $F$ commutes with direct sums so does $G$; \item {} if $F$ has a right adjoint so does $G$: if $F\dashv H$, then $G \dashv \pi H\omega '$. \end {enumerate}

BEGIN Proof 
 {\bf (1)} Let $a \in \sA $. Let $\G :\sA \to \sS $ be the functor that sends an object in $\sA $ to the sum of its subobjects that belong to $\sS $. The exact sequence $$ 0 \longrightarrow \G a \longrightarrow a \stackrel {\eta _a}{\longrightarrow } \omega \pi a \longrightarrow (R^1\G )a \longrightarrow 0 $$ is a ``composition'' of exact sequences \begin {align*} & 0 \longrightarrow \G a \longrightarrow a \stackrel {\a }{\longrightarrow } x \longrightarrow 0 \qquad \qquad \phantom {xxx} \hbox {and} \\ & 0 \longrightarrow x \stackrel {\b }{\longrightarrow } \omega \pi a \longrightarrow (R^1\G )a \longrightarrow 0 \end {align*} in which $\b \a =\eta _a$. Applying $\pi 'F$ to these sequences gives exact sequences $$ \xymatrix { \pi 'F( \G a) \ar [r] & \pi 'Fa \ar [rr]^{(\pi 'F)\a } && \pi 'Fx \ar [r] & 0 } $$ and $$ \xymatrix { \big (L_1(\pi 'F)\big )\big ( (R^1\G )a\big ) \ar [r]& \pi 'Fx \ar [rr]^{(\pi 'F)\b } && \pi ' F\omega \pi a \ar [r] & \pi 'F\big ((R^1\G )a\big ) \ar [r] & 0. } $$ Since $\pi 'F$ and $L_1(\pi 'F)$ vanish on $\sS $, $\pi ' F( \G a) = \big (L_1(\pi 'F)\big )\big ( (R^1\G )a\big ) = \pi 'F\big ((R^1\G )a\big ) =0$. Hence $(\pi 'F)\a $ and $(\pi 'F)\b $ are isomorphisms. But $(\pi 'F)\b \circ (\pi 'F)\a =(\pi 'F)(\b \circ \a )=(\pi 'F)\eta _a$, so $(\pi 'F)\eta _a$ is an isomorphism. \par {\bf (2)} We will now show there is a unique functor $G:\sA /\sS \to \sB /\sT $ such that $\pi 'F=G\pi $. If $\pi 'F$ were exact, the existence of a unique such $G$ is proved by Gabriel \cite [Cor.2, p.368]{Gab}. We can't appeal to op. cit. because we only know that $\pi 'F$ is right exact (and $L_1(\pi 'F)$ vanishes on $\sS $). Nevertheless, the proof at loc. cit. can be modified to establish the existence and uniqueness of $G$ such that $\pi 'F=G\pi $. (Our notation differs from Gabriel's. Our $\pi 'F$ plays the role of his $G$ and our $G$ plays the role of his $H$.) \par Let $m$ and $n$ be objects in $\sA $. Let $i:m' \to m$ be a subobject and $p:n \to n/n'$ a quotient object such that $m/m'$ and $n'$ belong to $\sS $. The maps $\varphi $ and $\psi $ defined by $\varphi (\a ):=p\a i$ and $\psi (\b ):=\pi 'F(p) \circ \b \circ \pi 'F(i)$ fit into a commutative diagram \begin {equation} \label {defn.psi} \xymatrix { \ar [d]_\varphi \Hom _{\sA }(m,n) \ar [rr]^{\pi 'F} && \Hom _{\sB /\sT }(\pi 'Fm,\pi 'Fn) \ar [d]^{\psi } \\ \Hom _{\sA }(m',n/n') \ar [rr]_{\pi 'F} && \Hom _{\sB /\sT }(\pi 'Fm',\pi 'F(n/n')). } \end {equation} \par In order to show that $\psi $ is surjective, suppose that $\d \in \Hom _{\sB /\sT }(\pi 'Fm',\pi 'F(n/n'))$. The rows in the following diagram are exact: $$ \xymatrix { 0 = \pi 'F(n') \ar [r] & \pi 'F(n) \ar [rr]^{\pi 'F(p)} && \pi 'F(n/n') \ar [r] & 0 \\ 0 = L_1(\pi 'F)(m') \ar [r] & \pi 'F(m') \ar [urr]^\d \ar [rr]_{\pi 'F(i)} && \pi 'F(m) \ar [r] & \pi 'F(m/m') = 0. } $$ Because the arrows $\pi 'F(n) \to \pi 'F(n/n')$ and $ \pi 'F(m') \to \pi 'F(m)$ are isomorphisms there is a unique morphism $\b :\pi 'F(m) \to \pi 'F(n)$ such that $$ \xymatrix { \pi 'F(n) \ar [rr]^{\pi 'F(p)} && \pi 'F(n/n') \\ \ar [u]^\b \pi 'F(m) && \pi 'F(m') \ar [ll]^{(\pi 'F)(i)}. \ar [u]_\d } $$ In other words, $\psi (\b )=\d $. Thus, $\psi $ is surjective. The uniqueness of $\b $ implies that $\psi $ is also injective, and therefore bijective. \par As $m$ and $n$ run over all objects in $\sA $, the maps $$ \psi ^{-1} \circ \pi 'F: \Hom _{\sA }(m',n/n') \longrightarrow \Hom _{\sB /\sT }(\pi 'Fm,\pi 'Fn), $$ as $m'$ and $n'$ take all possible values, determine maps $$ G: \Hom _{\sA /\sS }(\pi m, \pi n) = \liminj _{m',n'} \Hom _{\sA }(m',n/n') \longrightarrow \Hom _{\sB /\sT }(\pi 'Fm,\pi 'Fn) $$ for all objects $\pi m$ and $\pi n$ in $\sA /\sS $. If we define $G(\pi m)=\pi 'F(m)$ for all objects $\pi m \in \sA /\sS $, then $G$ becomes a functor $\sA /\sS \to \sB /\sT $. By definition, $G\pi =\pi ' F$ on objects in $\sA $. \par Suppose $\a :m \to n$ is a morphism in $\sA $. Let $m'=m$ and $n'=0$. The maps $i$ and $p$ are the identity morphisms on $m$ and $n$ so the map $\psi $ in (\ref {defn.psi}) is the identity; hence $G \pi (\a )=\psi ^{-1}\pi 'F(\a )=\pi 'F(\a )$. The functors $G\pi $ and $\pi 'F$ are therefore equal. \par To prove the uniqueness of $G$, suppose that $G':\sA /\sS \to \sB /\sT $ is ``another'' functor such that $G'\pi =\pi ' F$. If $x$ is an object in $\sA /\sS $, then $x=\pi m$ for some object $m$ in $\sA $ so $G'(x)=G'\pi (m)=\pi F(m)=G\pi (m)=G(x)$. If $\theta $ is a morphism in $\sA /\sS $, then $\theta =\pi (\a )$ for some morphism $\a $ in $\sA $ so $G'(\theta )=G'\pi (\a )=\pi ' F(\a )=G\pi (\a )=G(\theta )$. Hence $G'=G$. \par Finally, since $G\pi =\pi 'F$, $\pi ' F \omega = G \pi \omega \cong G$. \par \par {\bf (3)} By \cite [Cor. 1, p.368]{Gab}, every short exact sequence in $\sA /\sS $ is isomorphic to one of the form \begin {equation} \label {eq.G.rt.exact} \xymatrix { 0 \ar [r] & \pi a \ar [rr]^{\pi (\a )} && \pi b \ar [rr]^{\pi (\b )} && \pi c \ar [r] & 0 } \end {equation} where $ \xymatrix { 0 \ar [r] & a \ar [r]^\a & b \ar [r]^\b & c \ar [r] & 0 } $ is an exact sequence in $\sA $. Because $\pi 'F$ is right exact, $$ \xymatrix { \pi 'Fa \ar [rr]^{(\pi 'F)(\a )} && \pi 'Fb \ar [rr]^{(\pi 'F)\b } && \pi 'Fc \ar [r] & 0 } $$ is exact. There is a commutative diagram $$ \xymatrix { \pi 'Fa \ar [d]_{(\pi 'F)(\eta _a)} \ar [rr]^{(\pi 'F)\a }&& \pi 'Fb \ar [rr]^{(\pi 'F(\b )} \ar [d]^{(\pi 'F)(\eta _b)} && \pi 'Fc \ar [d]^{(\pi 'F)(\eta _c)} \ar [r] & 0 \\ \pi 'F\omega \pi a \ar @{=}[d] \ar [rr]_{(\pi 'F\omega \pi )( \a )}&& \pi 'F\omega \pi b \ar @{=}[d] \ar [rr]_{(\pi 'F\omega \pi )( \b )} && \pi 'F\omega \pi c \ar @{=}[d] \ar [r] & 0 \\ G(\pi a) \ar [rr]_{G(\pi \a )}&& G( \pi b) \ \ar [rr]_{G(\pi \b )} && G(\pi c) \ar [r] & 0 } $$ in which, by (1), the upper-most vertical arrows provide an isomorphism from the top row to the middle row. The bottom row in the diagram is therefore exact. But the bottom row is obtained by applying $G$ to (\ref {eq.G.rt.exact}) so $G$ is, as claimed, right exact. \par \par {\bf (4)} Let $x_i$, $i \in I$, be a collection of objects in $\sA /\sT $. There are objects $a_i \in \sA $ such that $x_i=\pi (a_i)$ for all $i$. Thus $$ G\bigg (\bigoplus _{i \in I} x_i\bigg ) = G\bigg (\bigoplus _{i \in I} \pi a_i\bigg ) \cong G\pi \bigg (\bigoplus _{i \in I} a_i\bigg ) = \pi 'F\bigg (\bigoplus _{i \in I} a_i\bigg ) = \bigoplus _{i \in I} \pi 'Fa_i. $$ But $\pi 'F=G\pi $ so $$ \bigoplus _{i \in I} \pi 'Fa_i = \bigoplus _{i \in I} G\pi a_i = \bigoplus _{i \in I} Gx_i. $$ Therefore $G$ commutes with direct sums. \par {\bf (5)} Suppose $F \dashv H$. Because $F$ has a right adjoint it commutes with direct sums. By (4), $G$ also commutes with direct sums. Since $\sA $ is a Grothendieck category so is $\sA /\sS $. In particular, $\sA /\sS $ is cocomplete, has a generator, and has small Hom sets. Thus, by the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, the dual of \cite [Cor.V.8, p.130]{Mac}, $G$ has a right adjoint, $G'$ say. Since $\pi \dashv \omega $ and $G \dashv G'$, $G \pi \dashv \omega G'$. But $G\pi =\pi 'F$ so $\pi 'F\dashv \omega G'$; but $H\omega '$ is also right adjoint to $\pi 'F$ so $\omega G' \cong H\omega '$ whence $G' \cong \pi \omega G' \cong \pi H \omega '$. Thus, $G \dashv \pi H \omega '$, as claimed.

BEGIN Theorem 1.2  
 \label {thm.closed.proj} \label {thm.3.2} Let $J$ be a graded ideal in an $\NN $-graded $k$-algebra $A$ and consider the diagram $$ \xymatrix { \Gr (A/J) \ar [r]^{f_*} \ar [d]^{\pi '} & \Gr (A) \ar [d]_{\pi } \\ \QGr (A/J) \ar @/^1pc/[u]^{\omega '} & \QGr (A) \ar @/_1pc/[u]_{\omega } } $$ in which $\pi $ and $\pi '$ denote the quotient functors and $\omega $ and $\omega '$ are their right adjoints. Define $i^*= \pi ' f^*\omega $ and $i^!= \pi ' f^!\omega $.

END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 {\bf (1)} This is due to P. Gabriel \cite [Cor. 2, p. 368]{Gab} and \cite [Cor. 3, p. 369]{Gab}. In particular, the diagram \begin {equation} \label {diag.i_*.comms} \xymatrix { \Gr (A/J) \ar [r]^{f_*} \ar [d]_{\pi '} & \Gr (A) \ar [d]^{\pi } \\ \QGr (A/J) \ar [r]_{i_*} & \QGr (A) } \end {equation} commutes. \par {\bf (2)} Let $\eta ':\id _{\Gr (A/J)} \to \omega '\pi '$ and $\ve ':\pi '\omega ' \to \id _{\QGr (A/J)}$ be the unit and count associated to the adjoint pair $\pi '\dashv \omega '$. Since $\ve '$ is an isomorphism, by \cite [Prop. 3(a), p. 371]{Gab}, the natural transformation $i_* \to i_*\pi '\omega '$ it induces is also an isomorphism. But $i_*\pi '\omega '=\pi f_* \omega '$ so $i_* \cong \pi f_* \omega '$. \par \par \par {\bf (3)} We need two preliminary results before completing the proof of (3). \par {\bf (3a)}: If $T \in \Fdim (A)$, then $T \otimes _A J \in \Fdim (A)$. \par \underline {Proof}: Since $A$ is left noetherian, $J=Ax_1+\cdots +Ax_s$ for some homogeneous elements $x_i \in J$. There is an integer $d$ such that $\deg (x_i) \le d$ for all $i=1,\ldots ,s$. \par Let $t \in T$ and $x \in J_m$. There is an integer $\ell $ such that $tA_{\ge \ell }=0$. \par Let $a \in A_{\ge \ell +d-m}$. Then $xa=a_1x_1+\cdots +a_sx_s$ for some elements $a_i \in A_{\deg (xa)-\deg (x_i)}\subseteq A_{\ge \ell }$. Since $ta_1=\cdots =ta_s=0$, $(t \otimes x)a=ta_1 \otimes x_1+\cdots + ta_s \otimes x_s =0$. We have shown that $(t \otimes x)A_{\ge \ell +d-m}=0$. It follows that every element in $T \otimes _AJ$ generates a finite dimensional module, i.e., $T \otimes _A J \in \Fdim (A)$. $\lozenge $ \par \par \par {\bf (3b)}: If $M \in \Gr ( A/J)$, then $\omega \pi f_*M \cong f_*\omega '\pi 'M$. \par \underbar {Proof}: Let $\overline {M}$ denote the image of $M$ under the natural map $M \to \omega \pi M$. By definition, $\omega \pi M$ is ``the'' largest essential extension $0 \to \overline {M} \to \omega \pi M \to T \to 0$ in $\Gr (A)$ such that $T \in \Fdim (A)$. \par \par \par In the next diagram $\psi $ and $\phi $ are the multiplication maps. The top row in $$ \UseComputerModernTips \xymatrix { \overline {M} \otimes _A J \ar [r]^<<<<<\a \ar [d]_\psi & (\omega \pi M) \otimes _A J \ar [r]^<<<<<\b \ar [d]^\phi & T \otimes _A J \ar [r] & 0 \\ \overline {M}J \ar [r]_\theta & (\omega \pi M)J } $$ is exact. Since $\overline {M}J=0$, there is a homomorphism $\gamma :T \otimes _A J \to (\omega \pi M)J$ such that $\gamma \b =\phi $. Since $\phi $ is surjective so is $\c $. \par \par Since $T \otimes _A J \in \Fdim (A)$ and $\c $ is surjective, $(\omega \pi M)J \in \Fdim (A)$ also. This implies that $\overline {M} \cap (\omega \pi M)J \in \Fdim (A)$. But the only submodule of $\omega \pi M$ that belongs to $\Fdim (A)$ is the zero submodule, so $\overline {M} \cap (\omega \pi M)J =0$. But $\overline {M}$ is essential in $\omega \pi M$ so $(\omega \pi M)J=0$, i.e., $\omega \pi M \in \Gr (A/J)$. \par Thus, $\omega \pi M$ is ``the'' largest essential extension of $\overline {M}$ in $\Gr (A/J)$ such that $(\omega \pi M)/\overline {M}$ is in $\Fdim (A/J)$. Hence $\omega \pi M$ and $\omega '\pi ' M$ are isomorphic as $A/J$-modules. More precisely, $\omega \pi f_*M \cong f_*\omega '\pi ' M$. This completes the proof. $\lozenge $ \par {\bf (3c)}: The functor $i_*$ is fully faithful. \par \underbar {Proof}: Let $\a $ be a non-zero morphism in $\QGr (A/J)$. Then $\pi '\omega '(\a ) \ne 0$. The image of $\omega '(\a )$ is therefore not in $\Fdim (A)$. Hence the image of $f_*\omega '(\a )$ is not in $\Fdim (A)$. It follows that $\pi f_*\omega '(\a ) \ne 0$. But $\pi f_*\omega '=i_*$ so $i_*$ is faithful. \par To see that $i_*$ is full, let $\cM ,\cN \in \QGr (A/J)$ and suppose that $\a :i_*\cM \to i_*\cN $ is a morphism. \par There are $A/J$-modules $M$ and $N$ such that $\cM =\pi ' M$ and $\cN =\pi 'N$. Fix isomorphisms $\theta _M:f_*\omega '\pi ' M \to \omega \pi f_*M$ and $\theta _N:f_*\omega '\pi ' N \to \omega \pi f_*N$. \par Then $\pi (\theta _N)\circ \a \circ \pi (\theta _M)^{-1}$ is in $\Hom _{\QGr (A)}(\pi \omega \pi f_*M,\pi \omega \pi f_*N)$. By \cite [Lemme 1, p.370]{Gab}, $\pi (\theta _N)\a \pi (\theta _M)^{-1}=\pi (\b )$ for some $\b \in \Hom _{\Gr (A)}(\omega \pi f_*M,\omega \pi f_*N)$. Therefore $\a =\pi (\theta _N^{-1}\b \theta _M)$. Since $f_*$ is full, the map $\theta _N^{-1}\b \theta _M: f_*\omega '\pi ' M \to f_*\omega '\pi ' N$ is equal to $f_*(\c )$ for some $\g \in \Hom _{\Gr (A/J)}(\omega '\pi ' M,\omega '\pi ' N)$. Hence $\a =\pi f_*(\c )$. Since $\pi f_*=i_*\pi '$, $\a =i_*\pi '(\c )$ which completes the proof that $i_*$ is full. $\lozenge $ \par \par \par {\bf (4)} We separate the proof into two parts. \par {\bf (4a)} In this part we show that $i^*:=\pi ' f^* \omega $ is left adjoint to $i_*$. \par If $N$ is a finite dimensional graded right $A$-module, then $N \otimes _A (A/J)$ is also finite dimensional. Since $f^*=- \otimes _A (A/J)$ it commutes with direct limits and therefore sends $\Fdim (A)$ to $\Fdim (A/J)$. Hence $\pi 'f^*$ vanishes on $\Fdim (A)$. \par \par We wish to apply Lemma \ref {lem.quotient.adjoint} with $F= f^*$, $\sA =\Gr (A)$, and $\sB =\Gr (A/J)$. To see that $F=f^*$ satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma \ref {lem.quotient.adjoint} we first note that $f^*$ is right exact and sends $\Fdim (A)$ to $\Fdim (A/J)$. The left derived functor $L_1(\pi 'f^*)$ exists because $\Gr (A)$ has enough projectives. We must show that $L_1(\pi 'f^*)$ vanishes on $\Fdim (A)$. Since $\pi '$ is exact, $L_1(\pi ' f^*) \cong \pi ' \circ L_1f^* \cong \pi ' \circ \Tor ^A_1(-,A/J)$ so it suffices to show that $\Tor ^A_1(T,A/J)$ is in $\Fdim (A/J)$ whenever $T \in \Fdim (A)$. But $\Tor ^A_1(T,A/J)$ is isomorphic to a submodule of $T \otimes _A J$ which is, by (3a), in $\Fdim (A)$. \par \par By Lemma \ref {lem.quotient.adjoint}(5), there is a unique functor $G:\QGr (A) \to \QGr (A/J)$ such that $\pi 'f^*=G\pi $. Furthermore $G \cong \pi 'f^*\omega $. Since $f^* \dashv f_*$, Lemma \ref {lem.quotient.adjoint}(2) tells us that $G\dashv \pi f_*\omega '$, i.e., $i_*$ is right adjoint to $i^*$. \par {\bf (4b)} In this part we show that $i^!:=\pi 'f^!\omega $ is right adjoint to $i_*$. \par To do so we will apply Lemma \ref {lem.quotient.adjoint} to the functor $F= f_*$ with $\sA =\Gr (A/J)$ and $\sB =\Gr (A)$. To see that $F=f_*$ satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma \ref {lem.quotient.adjoint} we first note that $f_*$ is right exact, in fact exact, and sends $\Fdim (A/J)$ to $\Fdim (A)$. Hence $\pi f_*$ is right exact, in fact exact, and vanishes on $\Fdim (A/J)$. Since $\pi f_*$ is exact its left derived functor $L_1(\pi f_*)$ certainly vanishes on $\Fdim (A/J)$. Lemma \ref {lem.quotient.adjoint} therefore applies. The functor $G$ in part (2) of Lemma \ref {lem.quotient.adjoint} is $i_*$. Since $f_* \dashv f^!$, Lemma \ref {lem.quotient.adjoint}(5) tells us that $G \dashv \pi ' f^!\omega $, i.e., $i_* \dashv \pi ' f^!\omega $. \par \par {\bf (5)} We will now show that $i_*(\QGr (A/J))$ is closed under submodules and quotients in $\QGr (A)$. \par \par Let $\cM \in \QGr (A/J)$ and suppose that $0 \to \cL \to i_*\cM \to \cN \to 0$ is an exact sequence in $\QGr (A)$. Let $N$ denote the image and $T$ the cokernel of the map $\omega ( i_*\cM \to \cN )$. Because $\pi \omega \cong \id _{\QGr (A)}$, the map $\pi \omega ( i_*\cM \to \cN )$ is an epimorphism. Hence $\pi T=0$; i.e., $T \in \Fdim (A)$. \par Because $\pi $ is exact and $T \in \Fdim (A)$, $\cN \cong \pi N$. Now $\cM =\pi ' M$ for some $M \in \Gr (A/J)$, so $\omega i_* \cM = \omega i_* \pi ' M = \omega \pi f_* M \cong f_*\omega '\pi ' M$. Since $J$ annihilates $f_*\omega '\pi ' M$ it annihilates $\omega i_* \cM $. But $\omega $ is left exact so $\omega \cL $ is isomorphic to a submodule of $\omega i_*\cM $ and is therefore annihilated by $J$. Hence $\omega \cL =f_*L$ for some $L \in \Gr (A/J)$. Thus, $\cL \cong \pi \omega \cL = \pi f_*L = i_* \pi 'L \in i_*(\QGr (A/J))$. Since $N$ is a quotient of $\omega i_*\cM $ it is also annihilated by $J$; hence we can apply the argument we just used for $L$ to $N$ and deduce that $\cN \in i_*(\QGr (A/J))$. \par That completes the proof of (5) and hence the proof of the theorem (see \cite [p.2928]{S} for the definition of a closed immersion).
END Proof
 
BEGIN Theorem 1.3  
 \label {thm2} Let $J$ be a two-sided graded ideal in a connected graded $k$-algebra $A$. Let $X$ be a noetherian scheme having an ample line bundle; for example, let $X$ be a quasi-projective scheme over $\Spec (k)$. If there is an equivalence of categories $\Phi :\QGr (A) \to \Qcoh (X)$, then $\QGr (A/J) \equiv \Qcoh (Z)$ for some closed subscheme $Z \subseteq X$. More precisely, there is a commutative diagram $$ \xymatrix { \QGr (A/J) \ar @{-->}[d]_{\equiv } \ar [rr]^{i_*} && \QGr (A) \ar [d]^\Phi \\ \Qcoh (Z) \ar [rr] && \Qcoh (X) } $$ in which the horizontal arrows are the natural inclusion functors and the dotted arrow is an equivalence between $ \QGr (A/J) $ and the essential image of $\Phi i_*$.
END Theorem
 
BEGIN Proof 
 By Theorem \ref {thm.3.2}, $\Projnc (A/J)$ is a closed subspace of $\Projnc (A)$. By \cite [Thm. 4.1]{S2}, the closed subspaces of $X$, or $\Qcoh (X)$, are the same things as closed subschemes of $X$ in the classical sense. Hence there is a closed subscheme $Z \subseteq X$ such that $\QGr (A/J) \equiv \Qcoh (Z)$.
