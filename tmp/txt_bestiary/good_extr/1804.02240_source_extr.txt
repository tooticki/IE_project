 \label {D37.105} Let $R$ be a commutative ring, let $\ct $ be an $R$--linear triangulated category and let $\cb \subset \ct $ be a full, replete subcategory with $\T \cb =\cb $. A \emph {$\cb $--cohomological functor} is an $R$--linear functor $H:\cb \op \la \Mod R$ which takes triangles to long exact sequences. This means that, if we have a triangle $x\la y\la z\la \T x$ with all three of $x,y,z$ belonging to $\cb $, then $H$ takes it to a long exact sequence in $\Mod R$. \par Suppose the ring $R$ is noetherian, and let $G\in \cb \subset \ct $ be an object. The $\cb $--cohomological functor $H:\cb \op \la \Mod R$ is called \emph {$G$--locally finite} if \be \item $H(\T ^iG)$ is a finite $R$--module for all $i\in \zz $. \item $H\big (\T ^iG\big )=0$ for $i\ll 0$. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee The $\cb $--cohomological functor $H$ is \emph {$G$--finite} if, in addition to the above, we have \be \setcounter {enumi}{\value {enumiv}} \item $H\big (\T ^iG\big )=0$ for $i\gg 0$. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee \edfn \par \rmk {R-2.3} Let $\ct $ be an $R$--linear triangulated category, $\cb $ a full, replete subcategory with $\T \cb =\cb $, and $H$ a $\cb $--cohomological functor. If $H$ is $G$--locally finite (respectively finite) for every $G\in \cb $ we leave out the $G$, and just say that $H$ is locally finite (respectively finite). \par Note that if $H$ is $G$--locally finite (respectively finite) then it is also $G'$--locally finite for any $G'$ obtainable from $G$ by forming in $\cb $ finite direct sums, direct summands, suspensions or triangles. Thus local finiteness (respectively finiteness) can be checked on any classical generator. \ermk \par Our main theorem says that \thm {T1.-1} Let $R$ be a noetherian ring, and $\ct $ an $R$--linear triangulated category with coproducts. Assume $\ct $ has a compact generator $G$ with $\Hom (-,G)$ a $G$--locally finite cohomological functor. Suppose further that $\ct $ is approximable. \par \par Then the restricted Yoneda functor $\cy :\ct \la \Hom \big [(\ct ^c)\op ,\Mod R\big ]$, that is the functor taking an object $t\in \ct $ to the restriction to $\ct ^c$ of the representable functor $\Hom (-,t)$, restricts on $\ct ^-_c\subset \ct $ to a full functor. In fact more is true: any map $\ph :\cy (s)\la \cy (t)$, with $s\in \ct ^-_c$ and $t\in \ct $, is equal to $\cy (f)$ for some $f:s\la t$. Furthermore the essential image of $\ct ^-_c$ is precisely the category of locally finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functors. \par If $f:s\la t$ is a morphism from $s\in \ct ^-_c$ to $t\in \ct ^+$, then $\cy (f)=0$ implies $f=0$. It follows that on the subcategory $\ct ^b_c\subset \ct ^-_c$ the functor $\cy $ is fully faithful. Furthermore the essential image of $\ct ^b_c$ is the category of finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functors. \ethm \par \nin From this we will deduce \par \cor {C0.-978} Let $\ct $ be as in Theorem~\ref {T1.-1}, but assume further that $\ct ^c$ is contained in $\ct ^b_c$. Let $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ be one of the preferred {\it t}--structures. \par Assume $\cl :\ct ^b_c\la \cs $ is an $R$--linear triangulated functor such that \be \item For any pair of objects $(t,s)$, with $t\in \ct ^c$ and $s\in \cs $, the $R$--module $\Hom \big (\cl (t),s\big )$ is finite. \item For any object $s\in \cs $ there exists an integer $A>0$ with $\Hom \big (\cl (\ct ^b_c\cap \ct ^{\leq -A})\,,\,s\big )=0$. \item For any object $t\in \ct ^c$ and any object $s\in \cs $ there exists an integer $A$ so that $\Hom \big (\cl (\T ^mt),s\big )=0$ for all $m\leq -A$. \ee Then $\cl $ has a right adjoint $\car :\cs \la \ct ^b_c$. \ecor \par \nin In the special example of $\ct =\Dqc (X)$ Theorem~\ref {T1.-1} specializes to \par \cor {C1.-3} If $X$ is a scheme proper over a noetherian ring $R$, then the restricted Yoneda functor $\cy $ gives an equivalence from the category $\dcoh (X)$ to the category of finite cohomological functors ${\dperf X}\op \la \Mod R$. \par On the larger category $\dmcoh (X)$, the functor $\cy $ is full and the essential image is the category of locally finite cohomological functors ${\dperf X}\op \la \Mod R$. \ecor \par \par \par \prf If $X$ is proper over $R$ then it is separated and quasicompact, hence the category $\ct =\Dqc (X)$ is approximable. But properness also guarantees that, for any compact generator $G\in \ct $ and any $i\in \zz $, the $R$--module $\Hom (\T ^iG,G)$ is finite. The vanishing of $\Hom (\T ^iG,G)$ for $i\ll 0$ is true more generally, it doesn't require properness. Anyway: the functor $\Hom (-,G)$ is $G$--locally finite and Theorem~\ref {T1.-1} applies. \eprf \par \rmk {R1.-7} If $R$ is a field and $X$ is projective over $R$, then the part of Corollary~\ref {C1.-3} concerning the objects in the image of $\cy $ is known---see Bondal and Van den Bergh~\cite [Theorem~A.1]{BondalvandenBergh04}. Bondal and Van den Bergh's theorem says nothing about the functor $\cy $ being fully faithful. \par The existing proofs of variants of Theorem~\ref {T1.-1}, including the current one, proceed in two steps. Starting with a finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functor $H$ one first proves that $H\cong \cy (t)$ for some $t\in \ct $, and then shows that $t$ must actually belong to $\ct ^b_c$. Bondal and Van den Bergh~\cite [Theorem~A.1]{BondalvandenBergh04} and Jack Hall~\cite [Proposition~4.1]{Hall18} rely on suitable special features that allow the functor $H:\ct ^c=\dperf X\la \Mod R$ to extend to a cohomological functor on all of $\ct =\Dqc (X)$, and then use the usual Brown representability theorem for $\Dqc (X)$. For Bondal and Van den Bergh the key is forming the double dual---this works since $R$ is assumed a field, and a finite-dimensional vector space over $R$ is canonically isomorphic to its double dual. Jack Hall relies on the fact that his functors come from morphisms of ringed spaces $c:\mathfrak {X}\la X$, and formal properties then provide adjoints \[\xymatrix @C+40pt{ \Dqc (X)\ar @<0.5ex>[r]^-{\text {natural}} &\ar @<0.5ex>[l]^-{\R Q_X^{}} \D (X) \ar @<0.5ex>[r]^-{\LL c^*}&\ar @<0.5ex>[l]^-{\R _*} \D (\mathfrak {X}) }\] \par We should recall one more result in the literature: although Ben-Zvi, Nadler and Preygel~\cite [Section~3]{BenZvi-Nadler-Preygel16} is not technically either a special case or a generalization of Theorem~\ref {T1.-1}, the reader is nonetheless encouraged to look at it---there are interesting parallels. Enhancements play a role in~\cite {BenZvi-Nadler-Preygel16}, as well as the construction of an explicit generator and estimates similar to those of \cite [Theorem~4.1]{Lipman-Neeman07}. \par \par What's different here is the generality. Let $H$ be \emph {any} locally finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functor. Under hypotheses weaker than approximability (see Proposition~\ref {P37.1005} for the precise statement) we prove that $H\cong \cy (t)$ where $t\in \ct $ is some object---the existence of $t$ is formal, not special to narrow classes of $\ct $'s or $H$'s. And by combining a careful analysis of the proof of Proposition~\ref {P37.1005}, with the theory developed in Section~\ref {S17}, we will deduce---\emph {under only the approximability hypothesis}---that $t$ must belong to $\ct ^-_c$. \ermk \par \rmk {R1.-8} The work was inspired by the lovely new proof of a vast generalization of GAGA to be found in Jack Hall~\cite {Hall18}. More precisely: it was inspired by the original idea, which is to be found in \cite [Section~2]{Hall18}---as Hall's paper became more general it developed a different tack. Let me sketch the simple idea and encourage the reader to look at \cite {Hall18} for more detail, as well as for far greater generality. Because this is only a tiny glimpse I will confine myself to the original, analytic version of GAGA in Serre~\cite {Serre56}, not to the other incarnations. \par Suppose $X$ is a scheme proper over $\C $. Then $X^{\text {an}}$ is a compact, complex analytic space, and analytification defines a functor $\cl :\dcoh (X)\la \dcoh (X^{\text {an}})$, taking a complex of $\co _X^{}$--modules with bounded, coherent cohomology to its analytification. With $\ct =\Dqc (X)$ and $\ct ^b_c=\dcoh (X)$ we have exhibited a $\C $--linear triangulated functor $\cl :\ct ^b_c\la \cs $, where $\cs =\dcoh (X^{\text {an}})$. It is a tiny exercise to show that this functor satisfies the criteria of Corollary~\ref {C0.-978}, hence has a right adjoint $\car :\cs \la \ct ^b_c$. \par To prove GAGA it suffices to show that $\car $ is an essential inverse of $\cl $. The gist of the argument is that, when you have a pair of adjoint triangulated functors between triangulated categories, there are standard techniques that render it easy to check if these functors are inverse equivalences. And the stunning feature of this particular application is that the global data one needs, about coherent analytic sheaves on the compact, complex analytic space $X^{\text {an}}$, are just the minimal ones used to prove that the hypotheses of Corollary~\ref {C0.-978} are satisfied. Once you have the right adjoint $\car $, the proof that $\cl $ and $\car $ are essential inverses reduces to applying Nakaya's lemma to some suitable finite modules over the noetherian local rings $\co _{X,x}^{}$ and $\co _{X^{\text {an}},x}^{\text {an}}$, the stalks at a closed point $x\in X$ of the structure sheaves $\co _X^{}$ and $\co _{X^{\text {an}}}^{\text {an}}$. This is starkly different from the existing proofs of GAGA in the literature, which (after a great deal of reduction) hinge on the computation of $H^i\big (X^{\text {an}},S\big )$ for a (short) list of coherent analytic sheaves $S$. \ermk \par We have already mentioned that part of the interest of the paper is that natural objects, like the subcategories $\dcoh (X)\subset \dmcoh (X)$ of the category $\ct =\Dqc (X)$, have an intrinsic description. The definitions are not hard to give, we include them in the Introduction. Before all else we recall some standard notation. \par \rmd {R1.-9} Let $\ct $ be a triangulated category. We define \be \item If $\ca \subset \ct $ is a full subcategory, then $\Smr (\ca )$ is the full subcategory of all direct summands of objects of $\ca $. \item If $\ca \subset \ct $ is a full subcategory, then $\add (\ca )$ is the full subcategory of all finite direct sums of objects of $\ca $. \item If $\ct $ has small coproducts and $\ca \subset \ct $ is a full subcategory, then $\Add (\ca )$ is the full subcategory of all coproducts of objects of $\ca $. \item If $\ca ,\cb $ are two full subcategories of $\ct $, then $\ca \star \cb $ is the full subcategory of all objects $y\in \ct $ such that there exists a triangle $a\la y\la b\la $ with $a\in \ca $ and $b\in \cb $. \item Given an object $G\in \ct $ and two integers $A\leq B$, let $\cc \subset \ct $ be the full subcategory with objects $\{\T ^{-i}G\mid A\leq i\leq B\}$. For integers $n>0$ we define the subcategories $\COprod _n\big (G[A,B]\big )$, inductively on the integer $n$, by the formulas \begin {eqnarray*} \COprod _1^{}\big (G[A,B]\big )&=&\ds \add (\cc )\ ,\\ \COprod _{n+1}^{}\big (G[A,B]\big )&=& \COprod _1^{}\big (G[A,B]\big )\star \COprod _n^{}\big (G[A,B]\big )\ . \end {eqnarray*} \item Given an object $G\in \ct $ and three integers $A\leq B$, $n>0$ we define the subcategories $\genu Gn{A,B}$ by the formula $\genu Gn{A,B}=\Smr \big [\COprod _n^{}\big (G[A,B]\big )\big ]$. \item We adopt the following conventions: \[\begin {array}{ccc}\genul GnB=\bigcup _{A}\genu Gn{A,B}, & \genuf GnA=\bigcup _B^{}\genu Gn{A,B},& \gen Gn=\bigcup _{A\leq B}^{}\genu Gn{A,B},\\*[7pt] \gen G{}=\bigcup _{n>0}^{}\gen Gn, & \genu G{}{A,B}=\bigcup _{n>0}^{}\genu Gn{A,B}, & \genul G{}B=\bigcup _{A}^{}\genu G{}{A,B},\\*[7pt] & \genuf G{}A=\bigcup _{B}^{}\genu G{}{A,B}.& \end {array} \] \item Suppose $\ct $ has coproducts, let $G$ be an object, and let $A\leq B$ be two integers. We define $\cc \subset \ct $ to be the full subcategory with objects $\{\T ^{-i}G\mid A\leq i\leq B\}$. For integers $n>0$ we define the subcategories $\Coprod _n\big (G[A,B]\big )$, inductively on the integer $n$, by the formulas \begin {eqnarray*} \Coprod _1^{}\big (G[A,B]\big )&=&\ds \Add (\cc )\ ,\\ \Coprod _{n+1}^{}\big (G[A,B]\big )&=& \Coprod _1^{}\big (G[A,B]\big )\star \Coprod _n^{}\big (G[A,B]\big )\ . \end {eqnarray*} In other words the difference between $\Coprod $ and $\COprod $ is that in $\Coprod $ we allow infinite coproducts in the formation of $\Coprod _1$. The inductive procedure is unaltered. \item We allow $A$ and $B$ to be infinite in (viii). For example $\Coprod _1^{}\big (G(-\infty ,B]\big )$ is defined to be $\Add (\cc )$ with $\cc =\{\T ^{-i}G\mid i\leq B\}$. \item Let $A\leq B$ be integers, possibly infinite. Then $\Coprod \big (G[A,B]\big )$ is the smallest full subcategory $\cs \subset \ct $, closed under coproducts, with $\cs \star \cs \subset \cs $, and with $\T ^{-i}G\in \cs $ for $A\leq i\leq B$. \item For triples of integers $A\leq B$, $n>0$ we let $\ogenu Gn{A,B}=\Smr \big [\Coprod _n\big (G[A,B]\big )\big ]$. In this formula we also allow $A$ and $B$ to be infinite, \item For pairs of integers $A\leq B$ we let $\ogenu G{}{A,B}=\Smr \big [\Coprod \big (G[A,B]\big )\big ]$. In this formula we also allow $A$ and $B$ to be infinite, but as it happens for infinite $A$ we obtain nothing new. The categories \[\Coprod \big (G(-\infty ,B]\big ),\qquad \Coprod \big (G(-\infty ,\infty )\big )\] are closed under coproducts and (positive) suspensions, and therefore contain all direct summands of their objects. \ee \ermd \par The following lemma is an easy consequence of the definitions. \par \lem {L0.-9238} Suppose $G,H$ are objects in a triangulated category $\ct $. We show \be \item If $H\in \gen G{}$ then there exists an integer $A>0$ with $H\in \genu GA{-A,A}$. \item If $\gen G{}=\gen H{}$ then there exists an integer $A>0$ with $H\in \genu GA{-A,A}$ and $G\in \genu HA{-A,A}$. \ee \elem \par \prf For (i) the assumption is $H\in \gen G{}=\cup _{A>0}^{}\genu GA{-A,A}$, hence $H$ belongs to one of the sets in the union.

These {\it t}--structures are \emph {equivalent} if and only if there exists an integer $A>0$ with $\ct _1^{\leq -A}\subset \ct _2^{\leq 0}\subset \ct _1^{\leq A}$. \edfn \par \obs {O0.2} For any \tstr \ $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ we have $\ct ^{\leq 0}=\Tm \big ({^\perp \ct ^{\geq 0}}\big )$ and $\ct ^{\geq 0}=(\T \ct ^{\leq 0})^\perp $. It immediately follows that two {\it t}--structures $(\ct _1^{\leq 0},\ct _1^{\geq 0})$ and $(\ct _2^{\leq 0},\ct _2^{\geq 0})$ are equivalent if and only if there exists an integer $A>0$ with $\ct _1^{\geq A}\subset \ct _2^{\geq 0}\subset \ct _1^{\geq -A}$. \eobs \par \obs {O0.2.5} Recall that, for any \tstr \ $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$, the categories $\ct ^-$, $\ct ^+$ and $\ct ^b$ are defined by \[ \ct ^-=\cup _{m>0}^{}\ct ^{\leq m}\ ,\qquad \ct ^+=\cup _{m>0}^{}\ct ^{\geq -m}\ ,\qquad \ct ^b=\ct ^-\cap \ct ^+\ . \] If $(\ct _1^{\leq 0},\ct _1^{\geq 0})$ and $(\ct _2^{\leq 0},\ct _2^{\geq 0})$ are equivalent {\it t}--structures we note \be \item $\ct _1^-=\ct _2^-$, $\ct ^+_1=\ct ^+_2$ and $\ct ^b_1=\ct ^b_2$. \item If $\ct ^-$ [respectively $\ct ^+$, respectively $\ct ^b$] contains a compact generator $G\in \ct ^c$, then $\ct ^-$ [respectively $\ct ^+$, respectively $\ct ^b$] contains all of $\ct ^c$. \ee \eobs \par \prf We prove (i) and (ii) for $\ct ^-$ and leave $\ct ^+$ and $\ct ^b$ to the reader. To prove (i) observe that the inclusions $\ct _1^{\leq -A}\subset \ct _2^{\leq 0}\subset \ct _1^{\leq A}$ imply \[ \bigcup _{m>0}^{}\ct _1^{\leq -A+m}\sub \bigcup _{m>0}^{}\ct _2^{\leq m}\sub \bigcup _{m>0}^{}\ct _1^{\leq A+m} \] that is $\ct _1^-\subset \ct _2^-\subset \ct _1^-$. \par For the proof of (ii) the assumption is that $G\in \ct ^-$. This makes $\ct ^-\subset \ct $ a thick subcategory containing $G$, hence $\ct ^c=\gen G{}\subset \ct ^-$. \eprf \par \par \exm {E0.3} Let $\ct $ be a triangulated category with coproducts. Given any compact object $G\in \ct $, from Alonso, Jerem{\'{\i }}as and Souto~\cite [Theorem~A.1]{Alonso-Jeremias-Souto03} we learn that $\ct $ has a unique \tstr \ $(\ct _G^{\leq 0},\ct _G^{\geq 0})$ \emph {generated} by $G$. In the notation of Reminder~\ref {R1.-9}, the aisle $\ct _G^{\leq 0}$ of this \tstr \ is nothing other than $\ct _G^{\leq 0}=\ogenul G{}0$. It follows formally that both $\ct _G^{\leq 0}$ and $\ct _G^{\geq 0}$ are closed under coproducts and direct summands---the closure under direct summands is true for any aisle and co-aisle of a \tstr , the closure of $\ct _G^{\leq 0}$ under coproducts is also true for any aisle, while the fact that $\ct _G^{\geq 0}$ is closed under coproducts may be found in \cite [Proposition~A.2]{Alonso-Jeremias-Souto03}; it comes from the compactness of the object $G$. \par If $G,H$ are two compact objects of $\ct $ with $\gen G{}=\gen H{}$, Lemma~\ref {L0.-9238}(ii) tells us that there exists an integer $A>0$ with $H\in \genu GA{-A,A}$ and $G\in \genu HA{-A,A}$. Hence $\ogenul H{}{-A}\subset \ogenul G{}0\subset \ogenul H{}A$, that is $\ct _H^{\leq -A}\subset \ct _G^{\leq 0}\subset \ct ^{\leq A}_H$. Thus the {\it t}--structures generated by $G$ and $H$ are equivalent. This leads us to \eexm \par \dfn {D0.5} If the compactly generated triangulated category $\ct $ has a single compact object $G$ that generates it, then the \emph {preferred equivalence class of {\it t}--structures} is the one containing the \tstr \^^M$\big (\ct _G^{\leq 0},\ct _G^{\geq 0}\big )$ generated by $G$. \edfn \par \rmk {R0.7} For any compact generator $G$ we have that $\gen G{}=\ct ^c$, the full subcategory of all compact objects. Any two compact generators $G,H$ satisfy $\gen G{}=\ct ^c=\gen H{}$, and Example~\ref {E0.3} says that $G$ and $H$ generate equivalent {\it t}--structures. Thus the preferred equivalence class of {\it t}--structures does not depend on the choice of compact generator. \par Now \cite [Proposition~A.2]{Alonso-Jeremias-Souto03} guarantees that, in the preferred equivalence class, there will exist some {\it t}--structures with $\ct ^{\leq 0}$ and $\ct ^{\geq 0}$ both closed under coproducts---just take $\big (\ct _G^{\leq 0},\ct _G^{\geq 0}\big )$ for a compact generator $G$. The reader should note that this property is \emph {not} stable under equivalence. In general there will be {\it t}--structures in the preferred equivalence class where $\ct ^{\geq 0}$ is not closed in $\ct $ under coproducts. \par \par From Observation~\ref {O0.2.5}(i) we learn that, as long as we stick to the preferred equivalence class of {\it t}--structures, the categories $\ct ^-$, $\ct ^+$ and $\ct ^b$ are intrinsic. \ermk \par And now for the next formal construction. \par \dfn {D0.13} Suppose $\ct $ is a triangulated category with coproducts and let $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ be a \tstr . \par An object $F$ belongs to the subcategory $\ct _c^-\subset \ct $ if, for any integer $m>0$, there exists a triangle $E\la F\la D$ with $E\in \ct ^c$ and $D\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$. \par The subcategory $\ct ^b_c$ is defined by $\ct ^b_c=\ct ^-_c\cap \ct ^b$. \edfn \par \rmk {R0.14} Note that the definition of $\ct ^-_c$ depends on the choice of a \tstr , but not much---equivalent {\it t}--structures lead to the same $\ct ^-_c$.

Once we know the category is approximable, it follows that the convenient \tstr \ is in the preferred class, and any compact generator and any \tstr \ in the preferred equivalence class fulfill the approximability criteria. \efac \par \par \fac {F0.15} As stated in the first few paragraphs of the introduction [before we presented the definitions] we will prove that, if $X$ is a quasicompact, separated scheme, then $\ct =\Dqc (X)$ is approximable and the standard \tstr \ is in the preferred equivalence class. If $X$ is noetherian then $\ct ^b_c\subset \ct ^-_c$ are just $\dcoh (X)\subset \dmcoh (X)$, for non-noetherian $X$ the description of $\ct ^b_c\subset \ct ^-_c$ is slightly more complicated, but still classical---see Example~\ref {E19.1}. The fact that the standard \tstr \ is in the preferred equivalence class tells us that $\ct ^-=\Dqcmi (X)$, $\ct ^+=\Dqcpl (X)$ and $\ct ^b=\Dqcb (X)$. \par Another example is the homotopy category $\ct $ of spectra. In this case we can take $\ct ^{\leq 0}\subset \ct $ to be the subcategory of connective spectra---the \tstr \ this defines is in the preferred equivalence class. The category $\ct $ turns out to be approximable, and the subcategory $\ct ^-_c$ is the category of spectra $X$ whose stable homotopy groups $\pi _i(X)$ are finitely generated $\zz $--modules and $\pi _i(X)=0$ for $i\ll 0$. And $\ct ^b_c\subset \ct ^-_c$ is the subcategory where all but finitely many of the $\pi _i(X)$ vanish. \par The representability we prove in Theorem~\ref {T1.-1} applies to this example but the result is not new. There is a theorem of Adams~\cite {Adams71} which says that every cohomological functor $H$ on $\ct ^c$ is the restriction of a representable one on $\ct $, and it is easy to show that finiteness or local finiteness of $H$ translate to saying that the representing object must lie in $\ct ^b_c$ or $\ct ^-_c$. But the theorem of Adams does not generalize to $\dperf X\subset \Dqc (X)$; see \cite {Neeman4,Christensen-Keller-Neeman99}. \par We will not give a proof but the interested reader can check that, if $X$ is a quasicompact, separated scheme and $Z\subset X$ is a closed subset with quasicompact complement, then the category $\ct ={\mathbf D_{\text {\bf qc},Z}}(X)$, the subcategory of $\Dqc (X)$ of all complexes supported on $Z$, is weakly approximable but not approximable. The standard \tstr \^^Mis in the preferred equivalence class. If $X$ is noetherian the categories $\ct _c^-$ and $\ct _c^b$ are (respectively) the intersections of $\dmcoh (X)$ and $\dcoh (X)$ with the category $\mathbf D_{\text {\bf qc},Z}(X)$. \efac \par \par The definitions have all been made and the reader can go back to the statements of Theorem~\ref {T1.-1} and Corollary~\ref {C0.-978}, which are now precise. Note that in both results $\ct $ has to be approximable, weakly approximable is not enough. \par We have discussed what we know, but should point out that there are many more potential examples. After all: let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $T$ be a dg $R$--algebra. Then the category $\ct =\ch ^0(\Mod T)$ is a triangulated category with coproducts and a single compact generator $T$. It has a preferred equivalence class of {\it t}--structures, one can define the intrinsic subcategories $\ct ^-$, $\ct ^+$, $\ct ^b$, $\ct ^-_c$ and $\ct ^b_c$, and in general I have no idea what they are. If $H^i(T)=0$ for $i\gg 0$ then the subcategories $\ct ^-_c$ and $\ct ^b_c$ are thick, this follows from Remark~\ref {R0.14.7}. If $H^i(T)=0$ for all $i>0$ we are in the trivial case (see Remark~\ref {R19.303}), where it's easy to prove the category $\ch ^0(\Mod T)$ approximable and work out explicitly what are $\ct ^-$, $\ct ^+$, $\ct ^b$, $\ct ^-_c$ and $\ct ^b_c$. \par So far the only other general result, producing further examples of approximable triangulated categories, is \cite [Theorem~4.1]{Burke-Neeman-Pauwels18}. It says that, under reasonable hypotheses, the recollement of two approximable triangulated categories is approximable. But for $T$ a general dga, satisfying $H^i(T)=0$ for $i\gg 0$, I have no idea when the categories $\ch ^0(\Mod T)$ are approximable. In view of Theorem~\ref {T1.-1} and Corollary~\ref {C0.-978} it would be interesting to find out, especially since the categories $\ch ^0(\Mod T)$ are of so much current active interest---their study is at the core of noncommutative algebraic geometry. Who knows, there might be a noncommutative generalization of GAGA. \par \par \section {Basics} \label {S-1} \par \par Since {\it t}--structures will play a big part in the article we begin with a quick reminder of some elementary facts. \par \par \par \rmd {R-1.1} In this section $\ct $ will be a triangulated category and $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ will be a \tstr \ on $\ct $. The category $\ca =\ct ^{\leq 0}\cap \ct ^{\geq 0}$ is abelian, it is called the heart of the \tstr . The functor $\ch (-)=\big [(-)^{\leq 0}\big ]^{\geq 0}$ is a homological functor $\ch :\ct \la \ca $. We will let $\ch ^\ell $ be the functor $\ch ^\ell (-)=\ch \big [\T ^\ell (-)\big ]=\T ^\ell \big [(-)^{\leq \ell }\big ]^{\geq \ell }$. \ermd \par \lem {L-1.3} Let $\ct $ be a triangulated category and let $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ be a \tstr \ on $\ct $. If $F$ is an object of $\ct ^-$, and $\ch ^\ell (F)=0$ for all $\ell >-i$, then $F$ belongs to $\ct ^{\leq -i}$. \elem \par \par \prf We are given that $F$ belongs to $\ct ^-=\cup _n^{}\ct ^{\leq n}$, hence $F\in \ct ^{\leq n}$ for some $n$ and the map $F^{\leq n}\la F$ is an isomorphism. But now the triangle $F^{\leq \ell -1}\la F^{\leq \ell }\la \T ^{-\ell }\ch ^\ell (F)$ informs us that, as long as $\ell >-i$, the map $F^{\leq \ell -1}\la F^{\leq \ell }$ is also an isomorphism. Composing the string of isomorphisms $F^{\leq -i}\la F^{\leq -i+1}\la \cdots \la F^{\leq n}\la F$ we have that $F^{\leq -i}\la F$ is an isomorphism---therefore $F\in \ct ^{\leq -i}$. \eprf \par \lem {L-1.5} If there is an integer $A$ and a generator $G\in \ct $ with $\Hom \big (G,\ct ^{\leq -A}\big )=0$, then \be \item Any object $F\in \ct ^-$, with $\ch ^\ell (F)=0$ for all $\ell $, must vanish. \item If $f:E\la F$ is a morphism in $\ct ^-$ such that $\ch ^\ell (f)$ is an isomorphism for every $\ell \in \zz $, then $f$ is an isomorphism. \ee \elem \par \prf To prove (i) assume $\ch ^\ell (F)=0$ for all $\ell $; Lemma~\ref {L-1.3} says that $F$ belongs to $\cap _\ell ^{}\ct ^{\leq \ell }$. But then $\Hom (\T ^iG,F)=0$ for all $i\in \zz $, and as $G$ is a generator this implies $F=0$. \par (ii) follows by applying (i) to the mapping cone of $f$. \eprf \par \lem {L-1.7} Suppose the category $\ct $ has coproducts, and the \tstr \ is such that both $\ct ^{\leq 0}$ and $\ct ^{\geq 0}$ are closed under the coproducts of $\ct $. Then: \be \item The functors $(-)^{\leq 0}$ and $(-)^{\geq 0}$ both respect coproducts. \item The heart $\ca \subset \ct $ is closed in $\ct $ under coproducts, and the functor $\ch :\ct \la \ca $ respects coproducts. \item The abelian category $\ca $ satisfies [AB4], that is coproducts are exact. \item If $E_1\la E_2\la E_3\la \cdots $ is a sequence of objects and morphisms in $\ct $, then there is a short exact sequence in the heart $\ca $ of the \tstr \[\xymatrix { 0 \ar [r] & \colim \ch ^\ell (E_i) \ar [rr]& &\ch ^\ell \Big (\hoco E_i\Big )\ar [rr] && \colim ^1\ch ^{\ell +1}(E_i)\ar [r] & 0 }\] \ee \elem \par \prf Suppose we are given in $\ct $ a collection of objects $\{E_\lambda ^{},\,\lambda \in \Lambda \}$. For each $\lambda $ we have a canonical triangle $E_\lambda ^{\leq 0}\la E_\lambda ^{}\la E_\lambda ^{\geq 1}\la \T E_\lambda ^{\leq 0}$. The coproduct of these triangles is a triangle \[\xymatrix { \ds \bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }E_\lambda ^{\leq 0} \ar [r] &\ds \bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda } E_\lambda ^{}\ar [r] &\ds \bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda } E_\lambda ^{\geq 1} \ar [r] &\ds \bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }\T E_\lambda ^{\leq 0} }\] By hypothesis $\oplus ^{}_{\lambda \in \Lambda }E_\lambda ^{\leq 0}$ belongs to $\ct ^{\leq 0}$ and $\oplus ^{}_{\lambda \in \Lambda }E_\lambda ^{\geq 1}$ belongs to $\ct ^{\geq 1}$, and the triangle above must be canonically isomorphic to \[\xymatrix { \ds \left (\bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }E_\lambda ^{}\right )^{\leq 0} \ar [r] &\ds \bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda } E_\lambda ^{}\ar [r] &\ds \left (\bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda } E_\lambda ^{}\right )^{\geq 1} \ar [r] &\ds \left (\bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }\T E_\lambda ^{}\right )^{\leq 0} }\] This proves (i). \par Since $\ct ^{\leq 0}$ and $\ct ^{\geq 0}$ are closed in $\ct $ under copoducts so is their intersection $\ca =\ct ^{\leq 0}\cap \ct ^{\geq 0}$. By (i) we know that the functors $(-)^{\leq 0}$ and $(-)^{\geq 0}$ both respect coproducts, hence so does their composition $\ch (-)=\big [(-)^{\leq 0}\big ]^{\geq 0}$. This proves (ii). \par The category $\ct $ has coproducts and its subcategory $\ca $ is closed under these coproducts, hence $\ca $ has coproducts---it satisfies [AB3]. Now suppose we are given a set $\{f_\lambda ^{}:A_\lambda ^{}\sr B_\lambda ^{},\,\lambda \in \Lambda \}$ of morphisms in $\ca $. Complete these to triangles $A_\lambda ^{}\la B_\lambda ^{}\la C_\lambda ^{}\la \T A_\lambda ^{}$ and form the coproduct \[\xymatrix { \ds \bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }A_\lambda ^{} \ar [rr]^-{\bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }f_\lambda ^{}} & & \ds \bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }B_\lambda ^{} \ar [r] & \ds \bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }C_\lambda ^{} \ar [r] & \ds \bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }\T A_\lambda ^{} }\] which is a triangle. The long exact sequence obtained by applying $\ch $ to this triangle tells us that the kernel of the map $\bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }^{}f_\lambda ^{}$ is $\ch ^{-1}\big (\bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }^{}C_\lambda ^{}\big )$, but (ii) informs us that this is $\bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }^{}\ch ^{-1}(C_\lambda ^{})$, which is $\bigoplus _{\lambda \in \Lambda }^{}\mathrm {Ker}(f_\lambda ^{})$. The right exactness of coproducts is formal, completing the proof of (iii). \par Finally (iv) follows by applying the functor $\ch $ to the triangle \[\xymatrix { \ds \bigoplus _{i=1}^\infty E_i\ar [r] & \ds \bigoplus _{i=1}^\infty E_i\ar [r] & \hoco E_i \ar [r] & \ds \bigoplus _{i=1}^\infty E_i }\] and using (ii) to compute the long exact sequence. \eprf \par \rmk {R-1.9} Remark~\ref {R0.7} tells us that, if $\ct $ is a triangulated category with coproducts and a single compact generator, then the preferred equivalence class contains {\it t}--structures $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ with $\ct ^{\leq 0}$ and $\ct ^{\geq 0}$ both closed under coproducts. This is the situation in which we will apply Lemma~\ref {L-1.7}. Note also that Remark~\ref {R0.7} warns us that not every \tstr \ in the preferred equivalence class need satisfy the property. \par We will mostly use Lemma~\ref {L-1.7}(iv) in the special case where the sequences $\ch ^\ell (E_1)\la \ch ^\ell (E_2)\la \ch ^\ell (E_3)\la \cdots $ eventually stabilize for every $\ell $. When this happens the $\colim ^1$ terms all vanish, and the natural map is an isomorphism $\colim \, \ch ^\ell (E_i)\la \ch ^\ell \big (\hoco E_i\big )$. \ermk \par \par \section {The fundamental properties of approximability} \label {S17} \par \par \par \par \lem {L17.1} Let $\ct $ be a triangulated category with a \tstr \ $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$, and let $\cs \subset \ct $ be a full subcategory with $\T \cs =\cs $.

By Lemma~\ref {L17.9} we can, by modifying the integer $A$, also have the conditions (i), (ii) and [when appropriate] (iii) hold for the the \tstr \ $(\ct _1^{\leq 0},\ct _1^{\geq 0})$ and the compact generator $G$. Thus we may assume that the {\it t}--structures are the same. We have a single \tstr \^^M$(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})=(\ct _1^{\leq 0},\ct _1^{\geq 0})$, and two compact generators $G$ and $H$. There exists an integer $A$ that works for $G$ and the \tstr \ $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$, and we need to produce an integer that works for $H$ and the \tstr \ $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$. \par We are given that $G$ and $H$ are compact generators of $\ct $, hence $\gen G{}= \ct ^c =\gen H{}$, and Lemma~\ref {L0.-9238}(ii) allows us to choose an integer $B>0$ with $G\in \genu HB{-B,B}$ and $H\in \genu GB{-B,B}$. By (i) for $G$ we know that $\T ^AG\in \ct ^{\leq 0}$ and $\Hom \big (\T ^{-A}G,\ct ^{\leq 0}\big )=0$. It immediately follows that $\genu GB{-A-2B,-A}\subset \ct ^{\leq 0}$ and that $\Hom \Big (\genu GB{A,A+2B},\ct ^{\leq 0}\Big )=0$, and as $\T ^{A+B}H\in \genu GB{-A-2B,-A}$ and $\T ^{-A-B}H\in \genu GB{A,A+2B}$ we deduce that $\T ^{A+B}H\in \ct ^{\leq 0}$ and that $\Hom \big (\T ^{-A-B}H,\ct ^{\leq 0}\big )=0$. This established (i) for $H$, if we replace $A$ by $A+B$. \par Now for (ii) and (iii): for any $F\in \ct ^{\leq 0}$ we know that there exists a triangle $E\la F\la D$ with $D\in \ct ^{\leq -1}$, with $E\in \ogenu G{}{-A,A}$, and if $\ct $ is approximable we may even choose $E$ to lie in $\ogenu GA{-A,A}$. But $G$ belongs to $\genu HB{-B,B}$, and therefore \[ \ogenu G{}{-A,A}\subset \ogenu H{}{-A-B,A+B}\qquad \text {while} \qquad \ogenu G{A}{-A,A}\subset \ogenu H{AB}{-A-B,A+B}\ . \] Thus (ii) and [when appropriate] (iii) hold for $H$ if $A$ is replaced by $\max (A+B,AB)$. \eprf \par \rmk {R17.13} We have so far proved Facts~\ref {F0.11}: Proposition~\ref {P17.7} amounts to \ref {F0.11}(i) and Proposition~\ref {P17.11} to \ref {F0.11}(ii).

The fact that $G$ is a compact generator gives the equality in $H\in \ct ^c=\gen G{}$; Lemma~\ref {L0.-9238}(i) allows us to deduce that $H\in \genu G{}{-C,C}$ for some $C>0$. Thus $\T ^{-A-C}H\in \genu G{}{A,A+2C}$, and as $\Hom \Big (\genu G{}{A,A+2C}\,,\,\ct ^{\leq 0}\Big )=0$ the Lemma follows, with $B=A+C$. \eprf \par \par \lem {L17.19} Suppose $\ct $ is a compactly generated triangulated category and let $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ be a \tstr . Assume there exists a compact generator $G$ and an integer $A>0$ so that $\Hom \big (\T ^{-A}G,\ct ^{\leq 0}\big )=0$. \par Then the subcategory $\ct ^-_c\subset \ct $ is triangulated. \elem \par \prf It is clear that $\ct ^-_c$ is closed under all suspensions and is additive. We must show that, if $R\la S\la T\la \T R$ is a triangle so that $R$ and $T$ belong to $\ct ^-_c$, then $S$ must also belong to $\ct ^-_c$. \par Choose any integer $m>0$. Because $T$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$ we may choose a triangle $T'\la T\la T''$ with $T'\in \ct ^c$ and $T''\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$. Since $T'$ is compact, Lemma~\ref {L17.17} says that we may choose an integer $B>0$ with $\Hom \big (T',\ct ^{\leq -B}\big )=0$. \par Now $R$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$, allowing us to choose a triangle $R'\la R\la R''$ with $R'\in \ct ^c$ and $R''\in \ct ^{\leq -m-B}$. We have a diagram \[\xymatrix { T'\ar [r] & T\ar [r] \ar [d] & T'' \\ \T R' \ar [r] & \T R\ar [r] &\T R'' }\] The composite from top left to bottom right is a map $T'\la \T R''$, with $\T R''\in \ct ^{\leq -m-B-1}\subset \ct ^{\leq -B}$. Since $B>0$ was chosen so that $\Hom \big (T',\ct ^{\leq -B}\big )=0$ the map $T'\la \T R''$ must vanish, hence the composite $T'\la \T R$ must factor through $\T R'\la \T R$. We produce a commutative square \[\xymatrix { T'\ar [r]\ar [d] & T \ar [d] \\ \T R' \ar [r] & \T R }\] which we may complete to a $3\times 3$ diagram where the rows and columns are triangles \[\xymatrix { R' \ar [r] \ar [d] & R\ar [r] \ar [d] & R''\ar [r] \ar [d] &\T R' \ar [d] \\ S' \ar [r] \ar [d] & S\ar [r] \ar [d] & S''\ar [r] \ar [d] &\T R' \ar [d] \\ T'\ar [r] \ar [d] & T\ar [r] \ar [d] & T'' \ar [r]\ar [d] &\T T' \ar [d] \\ \T R' \ar [r] & \T R\ar [r] &\T R''\ar [r] &\T ^2 R'' }\] Because $R'$ and $T'$ are compact, the triangle $R'\la S'\la T'$ tells us that $S'$ must be compact. Also $T''\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$ and $R''\in \ct ^{\leq -m-B}\subset \ct ^{\leq -m}$, and the triangle $R''\la S''\la T''$ implies that $S''\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$. The triangle $S'\la S\la S''$ now does the job for $S$. \eprf \par \par \par \par \pro {P17.21} Suppose $\ct $ is a compactly generated triangulated category and let $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ be a \tstr . Assume there exists a compact generator $G$ and an integer $A>0$ so that $\T ^AG\in \ct ^{\leq 0}$ and $\Hom \big (\T ^{-A}G,\ct ^{\leq 0}\big )=0$. \par Then the subcategory $\ct ^-_c$ is thick. \epro \par \par \prf We already know that $\ct ^-_c$ is triangulated, we need to prove it closed under direct summands. Suppose therefore that $S\oplus T$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$, we must prove that so does $S$. \par Consider the map $0\oplus \id :S\oplus T\la S\oplus T$. Complete to a triangle \[\xymatrix @C+40pt{ S\oplus T\ar [r]^-{0\oplus \id } & S\oplus T \ar [r] & S\oplus \T S }\] By Lemma~\ref {L17.19} we deduce that $S\oplus \T S$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$. Induction on $n$ allows us to prove that, for any $n\geq 0$, the object $S\oplus \T ^{2n+1} S$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$. To spell it out: we have proved the case $n=0$ above. For any $n$ we know that $\T ^{2n+1}(S\oplus \T S)\cong \T ^{2n+2}S\oplus \T ^{2n+1}S$ lies in $\ct ^-_c$, and induction on $n$ allows us to assume that so does $S\oplus \T ^{2n+1}S$. The triangle \[\xymatrix @C+40pt{ \T ^{2n+2}S\oplus \T ^{2n+1}S \ar [r]^-{0\oplus \id } & S\oplus \T ^{2n+1}S \ar [r] & S\oplus \T ^{2n+3} S }\] then informs us that $S\oplus \T ^{2n+3} S$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$. \par By Remark~\ref {R0.13.99} the category $\ct ^-_c$ is contained in $\ct ^-$, and the object $S\oplus \T S$ must belong to $\ct ^{\leq \ell } $ for some $\ell >0$. Hence $S$ belongs to $\ct ^{\leq \ell }$ and, for every integer $m>0$, we have that $\T ^{\ell +m}S\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$. Choose an integer $n\geq 0$ with $2n+2\geq \ell +m$; then $\T ^{2n+2}S\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$. Since the object $S\oplus \T ^{2n+1}S$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$ we may choose a triangle $K\la S\oplus \T ^{2n+1}S\la P$ with $K\in \ct ^c$ and $P\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$. Now form the octahedron on the composable morphisms $K\la S\oplus \T ^{2n+1}S\la S$. We obtain \[\xymatrix @C+40pt{ K \ar [r]\ar @{=}[d] & S\oplus \T ^{2n+1}S \ar [r]\ar [d] & P\ar [d]\\ K \ar [r] & S\ar [r]\ar [d] & Q\ar [d] \\ & \T ^{2n+2}S \ar @{=}[r] & \T ^{2n+2}S }\] The triangle $P\la Q\la \T ^{2n+2}S$, together with the fact that both $P$ and $ \T ^{2n+2}S$ belong to $\ct ^{\leq -m}$, tell us that $Q$ must belong to $\ct ^{\leq -m}$. Now the triangle $K\la S\la Q$ does the trick for $S$. \eprf \par The next few results work out how $\ct ^-_c$ behaves when $\ct $ is approximable or weakly approximable. \par \lem {L17.23} Let us fix a weakly approximable [or approximable] triangulated category $\ct $.

Choose an integer $A$ as in Proposition~\ref {P17.11}, and let $m>2A+1$ be an integer. \par Then for any $K\in \ct ^c\cap \ct ^{\leq 0}$ there exists an object $L$ and a triangle $E\la K\oplus L\la D$ with $E\in \genu G{}{1-m-A,A}$ and $D\in \genul G{}{-m+A}$. \par If $\ct $ is approximable we may further assume $E\in \genu G{mA}{1-m-A,A}$. \elem \par \prf Because $K$ belongs to $\ct ^{\leq 0}$ the result (\ref {C17.3.1}) permits us to construct, for every integer $m>0$, a triangle $E_m\la K\la D_m$ with $E_m\in \ogenu G{}{1-m-A,A}$ and $D_m\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$. If the category $\ct $ is approximable we may assume $E_m\in \ogenu G{mA}{1-m-A,A}$. \par The object $K$ is assumed compact and Lemma~\ref {L17.17} produces for us a positive integer $B$, which we may assume $\geq m+2A$, with $\Hom \big (K,\ct ^{\leq -B}\big )=0$. Since we chose $B\geq m+2A$ we have $\Hom \Big (\T \ogenu G{}{1-m-A,A}\,,\,\ct ^{\leq -B}\Big )=0$, and in particular $\Hom \big (\T E_m,\ct ^{\leq -B}\big )$. From the triangle $K\la D_m\la \T E_m$ and the fact that $\Hom \big (K,\ct ^{\leq -B}\big )$ and $\Hom \big (\T E_m,\ct ^{\leq -B}\big )$ both vanish we deduce that $\Hom \big (D_m,\ct ^{\leq -B}\big )=0$. \par From $D_m\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$ we construct a triangle $E'\la D_m\la Q$ with $E'\in \ogenu G{}{1-B-A,-m+A}$ and $Q\in \ct ^{\leq -B}$. Since $\Hom \big (D_m,\ct ^{\leq -B}\big )=0$ the map $D_m\la Q$ must vanish, hence the map $E'\la D_m$ must be a split epimorphism. Since $E'$ belongs to $\ogenu G{}{1-B-A,-m+A}\subset \ogenul G{}{-m+A}$ so does its direct summand $D_m$. \par We have learned that $K$ belongs to $\ogenu G{}{1-m-A,A}*\ogenul G{}{-m+A}$, and if $\ct $ is approximable $K$ even belongs to the smaller $\ogenu G{mA}{1-m-A,A}*\ogenul G{}{-m+A}$.

Choose an object $K'$ in one of the categories $\cx _i^{}*\cz $ above, so that $K$ is a direct summand and $K\stackrel f\la K'\la K$ is a pair of morphisms composing to the identity. Now put \begin {eqnarray*} \ca _1^{}&=&\COprod \big (G[1-m-A,A]\big )\ ,\\ \ca _2^{}&=&\COprod _{mA}^{}\big (G[1-m-A,A]\big )\ ,\\ \cc &=&\COprod \big (G(-\infty ,-m+A]\big )\ . \end {eqnarray*} By \cite [Lemma~1.7]{Neeman17} any morphism from an object in $\ct ^c$, to any of $\cx _1^{}$, $\cx _2$ or $\cz $, factors (respectively) through an object in $\ca _1^{}$, $\ca _2^{}$ or $\cc $. Now the map $f:K\la K'$ is a morphism from $K\in \ct ^c$ to an object $K'\in \cx _i^{}*\cz $, with $i=1$ or $i=2$. By \cite [Lemma~1.5]{Neeman17} it factors as $K\la K''\la K'$ with $K''\in \ca _i^{}*\cc $, with $i=1$ or $2$. Since the composite $K\la K''\la K'\la K$ is the identity we deduce that $K$ is a direct summand of the object in $K''\in \ca _i^{}*\cc $, proving the Lemma. \eprf \par \lem {L17.25} Let us fix a weakly approximable [or approximable] triangulated category $\ct $.

Now $\genul G{}{-3A-1}\subset \ct ^c$ hence the object $D$ is compact, and it belongs to $\ct ^{\leq -2A-1}$ since $G\in \ct ^{\leq A}$.

The object $E'$ belongs to $\genu G{}{-9A,-A-1}\subset \ct ^{\leq -1}$ and the triangle $E'\la D\oplus M\la D'$ guarantees that $D\oplus M$ and therefore its direct summand $M$ belongs to $\ct ^{\leq -1}$.

The category is approximable, the standard \tstr \^^Mis in preferred equivalence class, and $\ct ^-_c$ is just $\D ^-(\proj R)$, the category of bounded-above complexes which admit projective resolutions by finitely generated projectives. \par The category $\ct ^b_c$ is the intersection $\ct ^-_c\cap \ct ^b$; it consists of the objects in $\D ^-(\proj R)$ with only finitely many nonzero cohomology groups. We have an inclusion $\D ^b(\proj R)\subset \ct ^b_c$, and for $R$ general I don't know much about the difference $\ct ^b_c-\D ^b(\proj R)$. When $R$ is noetherian we have $\ct ^b_c=\D ^b(\mod R)$, which is usually much larger than $\D ^b(\proj R)$. \eexm \par \exm {E19.64} A very similar analysis works when $\ct $ is the homotopy category of spectra. The sphere $S^0$ is a compact generator. Consider the \tstr \ where $\ct ^{\leq 0}$ is the category of connective spectra---these are the spectra $F$ with $\pi _i(F)=0$ when $i<0$. Then $\Hom \big (\Tm S^0,\ct ^{\leq 0}\big )=0$ and $\T S^0\in \ct ^{\leq 0}$. And any object $F\in \ct ^{\leq 0}$ admits a triangle $E\la F\la D$ with $E\in \ogenu {S^0}1{0,0}$ and $D\in \ct ^{\leq -1}$; this just says that we may choose a bouquet of zero-spheres $E$ and a map $E\la F$ which is surjective on $\pi _0$.

Let $G$ be any such compact generator; \cite [Theorem~3.1.1(i)]{BondalvandenBergh04} tells us that $G$ is a perfect complex. Let $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ be the standard \tstr . It is easy to show that there exists an integer $A>0$ so that $\T ^{A}G\in \ct ^{\leq 0}$ and $\Hom \big (\T ^{-A}G,\ct ^{\leq 0}\big )=0$. It follows formally, from Proposition~\ref {P17.21}, that $\ct ^-_c$ is thick. \par But in this case we happen to know $\ct ^-_c$ explicitly. To state the results it might be helpful to imagine two classes of objects in $\ct =\Dqc (X)$. \be \item The objects belonging to $\ct ^-_c=\Dqc (X)^-_c$, for the $\ct ^-_c$ defined using the standard \tstr . \item The objects locally with this property.

See Example~\ref {E19.25} for a description of $\D (R)^-_c$; note that in the case of $\D (R)$ the standard \tstr \ is in the preferred equivalence class. \ee The objects satisfying (ii) are classically called \emph {pseudocoherent,} they were first studied in Illusie's expos\'es~\cite {Illusie71B,Illusie71A} in SGA6. Now \cite [Theorem~4.1]{Lipman-Neeman07} is precisely the statement that the objects satisfying (ii) all satisfy (i). It is trivial to check that the objects satisfying (i) must satisfy (ii); this means that, for the standard \tstr \ on $\ct =\Dqc (X)$, the subcategory $\ct ^-_c$ is just $\Dqcp (X)\subset \Dqc (X)$, the subcategory of pseudocoherent complexes. If $X$ happens to be noetherian then pseudocoherence simplifies to something more familiar: for noetherian $X$ we have $\ct ^-_c=\Dqcp (X)=\dmcoh (X)$. \par \par Still in the general case, where $X$ is only assumed quasicompact and quasiseparated: Since $G$ is compact it is perfect, and there exists an integer $A>0$ so that $\Hom (G,\T ^iG)=0$ for all $i\geq A$. Remark~\ref {R0.14.7} applies and teaches us that the $\ct ^-_c$ corresponding to the preferred equivalence class of {\it t}--structures is also thick. \par This ends what I know in glorious generality. In this kind of generality I have no idea if $\Dqc (X)$ is approximable, or how the $\ct ^-_c$ obtained from a \tstr \ in the preferred equivalence class compares to $\ct ^-_c=\Dqcp (X)$, the subcategory $\ct ^-_c$ that comes from the standard \tstr \ on $\ct =\Dqc (X)$.

The generality that will suffice for us is $R$--linear functors between $R$--linear categories, where $R$ is a commutative ring. \par \par \dfn {D27.109} Let $R$ be a commutative ring, let $\ct $ be an $R$--linear category, let $\ca ,\cb $ be full subcategories of $\ct $, and let $H:\cb \op \la \Mod R$ be an $R$--linear functor. An \emph {$\ca $--approximating system for $H$} is a sequence in $\ca $ of objects and morphisms $E_1\la E_2\la E_3\la \cdots $, so that \be \item There is a cofinal subsequence of $E_*$ whose objects belong to $\ca \cap \cb $. \item We are given an isomorphism $\colim \,\Hom (-,E_i)\la H(-)$. \ee \edfn \par \nin In this article we will mostly consider the case where $\ca $ is contained in $\cb $, but in a sequel we will need the more flexible notion. \par Since we will freely use approximating systems in our constructions, it is comforting to know that they are all the same up to subsequences. More precisely we have \lem {L27.113} Suppose we have an $R$--linear functor $H:\cb \op \la \Mod R$, and two $\ca $--approximating systems $E_*$ and $F_*$ for $H$. Then the systems $E_*$ and $F_*$ are ind-isomorphic. We remind the reader: this means that there exists an $\ca $--approximating system $L_*$ for the functor $H$, more explicitly $L_1\la L_2\la L_3\la \cdots $, and subsequences $E'_*\subset E_*$, $F'_*\subset F_*$ and $L'_*,L''_*\subset L_*$ with $E'_*=L'_*$ and $F'_*=L''_*$. \elem \par \prf Since we may pass to subsequences we will assume that both $E_*$ and $F_*$ belong to $\ca \cap \cb $, To slightly compress the argument we will extend the sequences by zero; we will set $E_0=F_0=L_0=0$, look at the sequences $E_0\la E_1\la E_2\la \cdots $ and $F_0\la F_1\la F_2\la \cdots $, and out of them construct the sequence $L_0\la L_1\la L_2\la \cdots $. \par Let $L_0=0$ and $L_1=E_1$, and inductively proceed as follows. Assume that, for some $m\geq 1$, the sequence $L_0\la L_1\la \cdots L_{m-1}\la L_m$ and the map from the sequence to $H(-)$ have been defined, in such a way that $L_1\la L_3\la L_5\la \cdots $ is a subsequence of $E_*$ and $L_0\la L_2\la L_4\la L_6\la \cdots $ is a subsequence of $F_*$. We wish to extend to $m+1$. There are two cases, $m$ can be odd or even, but up to interchanging $E_*$ and $F_*$ in the argument below they are the same. We will therefore assume $m$ odd and leave to the reader the even case. \par Then $L_m$ is equal to $E_J$ for some $J>0$ while $L_{m-1}$ is $F_{I}$ for some $I\geq 0$. The map $\Hom (-,L_m)=\Hom (-,E_J)\la H(-)=\colim \,\Hom (-,F_i)$ is a natural transformation from the representable functor $\Hom (-,E_J)$ to the colimit. Yoneda tells us that it corresponds to an element in $H(E_J)=\colim \,\Hom (E_J,F_i)$, where the colimit is over $i$. We may therefore choose an $I'>J$ and a morphism $L_m=E_J\la F_{I'}$ which delivers the right element in the colimit. The composite $F_{I}=L_{m-1}\la L_m\la F_{I'}$ does not have to agree with the map $F_{I}\la F_{I'}$ of the sequence $F_*$, but they have the same image in $H(F_I)=\colim \,\Hom (F_{I},F_{i})$ [where the colimit is over $i$]. That is: after composing with some $F_{I'}\la F_{I''}$ in the sequence $F_*$ they become equal.

We proceed inductively. \be \item Choose a some integer $j_1^{}$ and a preimage in $\Hom (E_1,E'_{j_1^{}})$ of $\ph _1\in \colimj \Hom (E_1,E_j)$. Call this map $f_1:E_1\la E'_{j_1^{}}$. If $E_1$ belongs to one of the prescribed subsequences of $E_*$ then choose $j_1^{}$ so that $ E'_{j_1^{}}$ belongs to the matching subsequence of $E'_*$. \item Suppose the sequence has been constructed up to an integer $m\geq 1$. In particular we have a map $E_m\la E'_{j_m^{}}$, whose image under the natural map $\Hom (E_m,E'_{j_m^{}})\la \colimj \Hom (E_m,E'_j)$ is $\ph _m$. \par We have the element $\ph _{m+1}\in \colimj (E_{m+1},E'_j)$, we can choose a preimage in $\Hom (E_{m+1}, E_J)$ for some integer $J$, and we may assume $J>j_{m}^{}$. This gives us a map $f':E_{m+1}\la E'_J$. Now the square \[\xymatrix { E_m\ar [r]^{f_m}\ar [d] & E'_{j_m^{}}\ar [d] \\ E_{m+1}\ar [r]^{f'} & E'_J }\] need not commute, but the two composites both go, via the map $\Hom (E_m,E'_J)\la \colimj \Hom (E_m,E'_j)$, to the same element $\ph _m$. Hence replacing $E'_J$ by some $E'_{j_{m+1}^{}}$ with ${j_{m+1}^{}}>J$, we may assume the square commutes. And if $E_{m+1}$ belongs to one of the prescribed subsequences of $E_*$, choose ${j_{m+1}^{}}>J$ so that $E'_{j_{m+1}^{}}$ belongs to the matching subsequence of $E'_*$. \ee We have replaced $E'_*$ by a subsequence and produced a map of sequences $f_*:E_*\la E'_*$.

We will work in some ambient $R$--linear triangulated category $\ct $, and will assume that $\ct $ has coproducts. What is special in this case is that, given a functor $H:\cb \op \la \Mod R$ and an $\ca $--approximating system $E_1\la E_2\la E_3\la \cdots $ for $H$, we can construct in $\ct $ the homotopy colimit $F=\hoco E_i$.

From \cite [Lemma~2.8]{Neeman96} we know that, for any compact object $K\in \ct $ and any sequence of objects of $\ct $, the natural map is an isomorphism $H(K)\cong \colim \,\Hom (K,E_i)\la \Hom \big (K,\hoco E_i\big )$. Thus we're automatically in the situation of Remark~\ref {R27.7}; any sequence $E_*$ in $\ca $ is an $\ca $--approximating system for $F=\hoco E_i$, over any $\cb \subset \ct ^c$. Late in the article (meaning in Section~\ref {S37}) we will therefore allow ourselves to occasionally leave unspecified the category $\cb \subset \ct ^c$, and just say that $E_*$ is an $\ca $--approximating system for $F$. \par For now we are careful to specify $\cb $, because we plan to use the lemmas in other contexts in future articles. \ermk \par In the generality of Remark~\ref {R27.7} we note the following little observation. \par \lem {L27.976} Let $\ct $ be a triangulated category with coproducts, let $\ca ,\cb $ be subcategories, and assume $E_1\la E_2\la E_3\la \cdots $ is a $\ca $--approximating system for $F\in \ct $ over $\cb $. \par If $G$ is another object of $\ct $, and if $\ph :\Hom (-,F)|_\cb \la \Hom (-,G)|_\cb $ is a natural transformation of functors on $\cb $, then there exists in $\ct $ a (non-unique) morphism $f:F\la G$ with $\ph =\Hom (-,f)|_\cb $. \elem \par \prf By Lemma~\ref {L27.33} the natural transformation $\ph :\Hom (-,F)\la \Hom (-,G)$ corresponds to an element in $\clim \Hom (E_i,G)$. Thus for each $i$ we are given in $\ct $ a morphism $f_i:E_i\la G$, compatibly with the sequence maps $E_i\la E_{i+1}$. The compatibility means that the composite \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ \ds \bigoplus _{i=1}^\infty E_i\ar [rr]^-{1-\text {\rm shift}} && \ds \bigoplus _{i=1}^\infty E_i \ar [rr]^-{(f_1^{},f_2,f_3,\ldots )} && G }\] must vanish. Hence the map $\bigoplus _{i=1}^\infty E_i\la G$ factors (non-uniquely) through $F=\hoco E_i$, which is the third edge in the triangle \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ \ds \bigoplus _{i=1}^\infty E_i\ar [rr]^-{1-\text {\rm shift}} && \ds \bigoplus _{i=1}^\infty E_i \ar [rr]^-{(f_1^{},f_2,f_3,\ldots )} && \hoco E_i\ . }\] \eprf \par \par \section {An easy representability theorem} \label {S74} \par It's time to start proving representability theorems. The main theorems in the article are a little technical---they depend on taking homotopy colimits carefully. For this reason I thought it best to illustrate the methods in a simple case, which involves no homotopy colimits. In this section we give a simple proof of an old result of Rouquier, generalizing an even older result of Bondal and Van den Bergh. \par \par \lem {L74.1} Let $R$ be a commutative, noetherian ring, let $\cs $ be an $R$--linear triangulated category, let $G\in \cs $ be an object and, with the notation of Definition~\ref {D37.105} and Remark~\ref {R-2.3}, assume $\Hom (-,G)$ is a $G$--finite cohomological functor. Let $k\geq 0$ be an integer and $H$ a finite $\gen G{2^k}$--cohomological functor. Then there exists an object $F\in \gen G{2^k}$ and an epimorphism $\Hom (-,F)|_{\gen G{2^k}}\la H(-)$. \elem \par \prf The proof is by induction on $k$. Suppose $k=0$: by hypothesis $H(\T ^{-i}G)$ is a finite $R$--module, and vanishes for $i$ outside a bounded interval $[-A,A]$. For each $i$ with $-A\leq i\leq A$ choose a finite set of generators $\{f_{ij},\,j\in J_i\}$ for the $R$--module $H(\T ^{-i}G)$. Yoneda tells us that each $f_{ij}$ corresponds to a natural transformation $\ph _{ij}:\Hom (-,\T ^{-i}G)|_{\gen G1}\la H(-)$. Define $F$ to be $F=\oplus _{i=-A}^A\oplus _{j\in J_i}^{}\T ^{-i}G$, and let $\ph :\Hom (-,F)|_{\gen G1}\la H(-)$ be the composite \[\xymatrix @C+30pt{ \Hom (-,F)|_{\gen G1}\ar @{=}[r] & \ds \bigoplus _{i=-A}^A\,\,\bigoplus _{j\in J_i}\Hom (-\,,\,\T ^{-i}G)|_{\gen G1} \ar [r]^-{(\ph _{ij})} & H(-) }\] Obviously $F$ belongs to $\gen G1$ and $\ph $ is surjective. \par Now suppose we know the Lemma for $k\geq 0$, and let $H$ be a finite $\gen G{2^{k+1}}$--cohomological functor. Then the restriction of $H$ to $\gen G{2^k}$ is a finite $\gen G{2^k}$--cohomological functor, and induction permits us to find an object $F_1\in \gen G{2^k}$ and an epimorphism $\ph :\Hom (-,F_1)|_{\gen G{2^k}}\la H(-)|_{\gen G{2^k}}$. Complete the map $\ph $ to a short exact sequence \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ 0\ar [r] & H'(-)\ar [r]^-{\s } &\Hom (-,F_1)|_{\gen G{2^k}} \ar [r]^-{\ph } & H(-)|_{\gen G{2^k}}\ar [r] & 0\ . }\] Then $H'$ is a finite $\gen G{2^k}$--cohomological functor, and induction applies again to tell us that there exists an object $F_2\in \gen G{2^k}$ and an epimorphism $\rho :\Hom (-,F_2)|_{\gen G{2^k}}\la H'(-)$. Combining the results we deduce an exact sequence of functors \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ \Hom (-,F_2)|_{\gen G{2^k}} \ar [r]^-{\s \rho } & \Hom (-,F_1)|_{\gen G{2^k}} \ar [r]^-{\ph } & H(-)|_{\gen G{2^k}}\ar [r] & 0\ . }\] Because $F_1$ and $F_2$ both lie in $\gen G{2^k}$ the functors $\Hom (-,F_i)|_{\gen G{2^k}}$ are representable for $i\in \{1,2\}$---Yoneda's lemma applies. The natural transformation $\s \rho :\Hom (-,F_2)|_{\gen G{2^k}}\la \Hom (-,F_1)|_{\gen G{2^k}}$ is $\Hom (-,\alpha )|_{\gen G{2^k}}$ for some morphism $\alpha :F_2\la F_1$, the natural transformation $\ph :\Hom (-,F_1)|_{\gen G{2^k}}\la H(-)|_{\gen G{2^k}}$ corresponds to some element $y\in H(F_1)$, and the vanishing of the composite $\ph \s \rho $ says that $H(\alpha ):H(F_1)\la H(F_2)$ must take $y$ to zero. \par Complete $\alpha : F_2\la F_1$ to a triangle $F_2\stackrel \alpha \la F_1\stackrel \beta \la F\stackrel \gamma \la \T F_2$. As $F_1$ and $\T F_2$ belong to $\gen G{2^k}$, the triangle tells us that $F$ must be in $\gen G{2^k}*\gen G{2^k}\subset \gen G{2^{k+1}}$. And now we remember that $H$ is actually a $\gen G{2^{k+1}}$--cohomological functor. The sequence $H(F)\stackrel {H(\beta )}\la H(F_1)\stackrel {H(\alpha )}\la H(F_2)$ is exact, and the vanishing of $H(\alpha )(y)$ says that there exists an element $x\in H(F)$ so that $H(\beta ):H(F)\la H(F_1)$ takes $x\in H(F)$ to $y\in H(F_1)$. By Yoneda $x$ corresponds to a natural transformation $\psi :\Hom (-,F)|_{\gen G{2^{k+1}}}\la H(-)$. The fact that $H(\beta )x=y$ translates, via Yoneda, to the assertion that the composite \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ \Hom (-,F_1)|_{\gen G{2^{k+1}}} \ar [rr]^-{\Hom (-,\beta )|_{\gen G{2^{k+1}}}} && \Hom (-,F)|_{\gen G{2^{k+1}}} \ar [r]^-{\psi } & H(-) }\] restricts to be $\ph $ on the category $\gen G{2^k}$. \par We assert that $\psi $ is surjective. Take any object $C'\in \gen G{2^{k+1}}$; we need to show the surjectivity of the map $\psi :\Hom (C',F)\la H(C')$. Now $\gen G{2^{k+1}}=\Smr \big [\gen G{2^{k}}*\gen G{2^{k}}\big ]$, so there exists an object $C''\in \cs $ with $C'\oplus C''\in \gen G{2^{k}}*\gen G{2^{k}}$. Put $C=C'\oplus C''$ and it clearly suffices to prove the surjectivity of $\psi :\Hom (C,F)\la H(C)$. Choose a triangle $A\stackrel {\alpha '}\la B\stackrel {\beta '}\la C\stackrel {\gamma '}\la \T A$ with $A,B\in \gen G{2^{k}}$. \par \par Take any $z\in H(C)$. The map $H(\beta '):H(C)\la H(B)$ takes $z$ to an element $H(\beta ')z\in H(B)$. But the map $\ph :\Hom (B,F_1)\la H(B)$ is surjective, hence there is an element $g\in \Hom (B,F_1)$ with $\ph (g)=H(\beta ')(z)$. Now $0=H(\alpha ')H(\beta ')z=H(\alpha ')\ph ((g)=\ph \Hom (\alpha ',F_1)g$, where the last equality is by the naturality of the map $\ph :\Hom (-,F_1)|_{\gen G{2^k}}\la H(-)|_{\gen G{2^k}}$. Therefore $\Hom (\alpha ',F_1)g=g\alpha '\in \Hom (A,F_1)$ lies in the kernel of $\ph :\Hom (A,F_1)\la H(A)$. The exact sequence \[\xymatrix @C+50pt{ \Hom (-,F_2)|_{\gen G{2^k}} \ar [r]^-{\Hom (-,\alpha )|_{\gen G{2^k}}} & \Hom (-,F_1)|_{\gen G{2^k}} \ar [r]^-{\ph } & H(-)|_{\gen G{2^k}} }\] tells us that there is an $f\in \Hom (A,F_2)$ with $g\alpha '=\Hom (A,\alpha )f=\alpha f$. \par In concrete terms we have produced a commutative diagram \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ A\ar [r]^{\alpha '}\ar [d]^f & B\ar [r]^{\beta '}\ar [d]^g & C \ar [r]^{\gamma '} & \T A\\ F_2\ar [r]^{\alpha } & F_1\ar [r]^{\beta } & F \ar [r]^{\gamma }& \T F_2 }\] where the rows are triangles, which we may complete to a morphism of triangles \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ A\ar [r]^{\alpha '}\ar [d]^f & B\ar [r]^{\beta '}\ar [d]^g & C \ar [r]^{\gamma '}\ar [d]^h & \T A\ar [d]^{\T f}\\ F_2\ar [r]^{\alpha } & F_1\ar [r]^{\beta } & F \ar [r]^{\gamma }& \T F_2 }\] We now have an element $h\in \Hom (C,F)$ with $h\beta '=\beta g$, or in more complicated terms $\Hom (\beta ',F)h=\Hom (B,\beta )g$. This buys us the third equality below \begin {eqnarray*} H(\beta ')z &=& \ph (g) \\ &=& \psi \Hom (B,\beta )(g) \\ &=&\psi \Hom (\beta ',F)h \\ &=&H(\beta ')\psi (h) \end {eqnarray*} The first equality is the choice of $g$, the second is because on the category $\gen G{2^k}$ we have $\ph =\psi \circ \Hom (-,\beta )$, and the fourth equality is the naturality of $\psi $. We deduce that $H(\beta '):H(C)\la H(B)$ annihilates $z-\psi (h)$. \par But the exact sequence $H(\T A)\stackrel {H(\gamma ')}\la H(C)\stackrel {H(\beta ')}\la H(B)$ tells us there exists a $z'\in H(\T A)$ with $H(\gamma ')z'=z-\psi (h)$. Since $\T A$ belongs to $\gen G{2^k}$ the map $\ph :\Hom (\T A,F_1)\la H(\T A)$ must be surjective; there is a $\lambda \in \Hom (\T A,F_1)$ with $\ph (\lambda )=z'$. Therefore \begin {eqnarray*} z-\psi (h) &=& H(\gamma ')\ph (\lambda ) \\ &=& H(\gamma ')\psi \Hom (\T A,\beta )(\lambda )\\ &=&\psi \Hom (\gamma ',F)\Hom (\T A,\beta )(\lambda )\\ &=&\psi (\beta \lambda \gamma ') \end {eqnarray*} where the second equality is the fact that on the category $\gen G{2^k}$ we have $\ph =\psi \circ \Hom (-,\beta )$, the third is the naturality of $\psi $, and the fourth is obvious. Hence $z=\psi (h+\beta \lambda \gamma ')$ is in the image of $\psi $. \eprf \par When $R$ is a field the theorem below is due to Bondal and Van den Bergh~\cite [Theorem~1.3]{BondalvandenBergh04}, and in the generality below it may be found in Rouquier~\cite [Theorem~4.16 and Corollary~4.18]{Rouquier08}. We include this new proof because it contains the simple ideas, whose more technical adaptation will yield the theorems of Section~\ref {S37}. \par \par \thm {T74.3} Let $R$ be a noetherian, commutative ring, let $\cs $ be an $R$--linear triangulated category, and assume that $G\in \cs $ is a strong generator---we remind the reader, this means that there exists some integer $n>0$ with $\gen Gn=\cs $. Assume $H$ is a finite cohomological functor, as is $\Hom (-,G)$. Then there exists a cohomological functor $H'$ with $H\oplus H'$ representable. If $\cs $ is Karoubian, meaning idempotents split, then $H$ is representable. \ethm \par \prf Choose an integer $k$ with $\gen G{2^k}=\cs $. Applying Lemma~\ref {L74.1} to the $\gen G{2^k}$--cohomological functor $H$ we can find an epimorphism $\Hom (-,F)\la H(-)$. Complete to an exact sequence $0\la H'(-)\la \Hom (-,F)\la H(-)\la 0$, and it follows that $H'$ is also a finite cohomological functor. Applying Lemma~\ref {L74.1} again we have a surjection $\Hom (-,F')\la H'(-)$, and this assembles to an exact sequence $\Hom (-,F')\la \Hom (-,F)\la H(-)\la 0$. \par Yoneda's lemma tells us that the natural transformation $\Hom (-,F')\la \Hom (-,F)$ must be of the form $\Hom (-,\alpha )$ for some $\alpha :F'\la F$, that the natural transformation $\Hom (-,F)\la H(-)$ corresponds to an element $y\in H(F)$, and that the vanishing of the composite $\Hom (-,F')\la \Hom (-,F)\la H(-)$ means that the map $H(\alpha ):H(F)\la H(F')$ must take $y\in H(F)$ to zero. Now complete $\alpha :F'\la F$ to a triangle $F'\stackrel {\alpha }\la F\stackrel {\beta }\la F''\la $. The exactness of $H(F'')\stackrel {H(\beta )}\la H(F)\stackrel {H(\alpha )}\la H(F')$, coupled with the fact that $H(\alpha )y=0$, means that there must be an element $x\in H(F'')$ with $y=H(\beta )x$. By Yoneda this means that we obtain a natural transformation $\Hom (-,F'')\la H(-)$ so that the diagram below commutes \[\xymatrix { \Hom (-,F')\ar [r]\ar @{=}[d] & \Hom (-,F)\ar [r]\ar @{=}[d] & \Hom (-,F'')\ar [d]& \\ \Hom (-,F')\ar [r] & \Hom (-,F)\ar [r] & H(-)\ar [r] & 0 }\] and the rows are exact. It immediately follows that the map $\Hom (-,F'')\la H(-)$ is a split epimorphism. \par Choose a splitting $H(-)\la \Hom (-,F'')$, for example the one coming from the diagram above. The composite $\Hom (-,F'')\la H(-)\la \Hom (-,F'')$ is an idempotent natural endomorphism of a representable functor, therefore of the form $\Hom (-,e)$ where $e:F''\la F''$ is idempotent. If $e$ splits then $H$ is representable. \eprf \par \par \par \par \par \section {A couple of technical lemmas} \label {S997} \par In Section~\ref {S37} we will prove Theorem~\ref {T1.-1}. The proof will rely heavily on a couple of technical lemmas---in this section we state these in great generality, to cover both the application to come in Section~\ref {S37} and the one to be found in the proof of \cite [Theorem~4.6]{Neeman18}. Let us therefore set up a little notation. \par \ntn {N997.1} Throughout this section $R$ will be a commutative ring, $\ct $ will be an $R$--linear triangulated category with coproducts, and $\cs \subset \ct $ will be a triangulated subcategory. The Yoneda functor $\cy :\ct \la \Hom _R^{}\big [\cs \op \,,\,\Mod R\big ]$ will be the map taking $t\in \ct $ to $\Hom (-,t)$, where $\Hom (-,t)$ is viewed as an $R$--linear functor $\cs \op \la \Mod R$. \par We remind the reader of Definition~\ref {D27.109}: suppose $\ca $ is a full subcategory of $\ct $ closed under direct summands, finite coproducts and suspensions, and $H$ is a $\cs $--cohomological functor, meaning $H:\cs \op \la \Mod R$ is an $R$--linear cohomological functor. Then a $\ca $--approximatng system for $H$ is a sequence $E_1\la E_2\la E_3\la \cdots $ in $\ca $, with a subsequence in $\ca \cap \cs $, and an isomorphism $\colim \,\cy (E_i)\la H(-)$. \entn \par \par \par \par \par \dfn {D997.203} Let $\ct $ be an $R$--linear triangulated category with coproducts and let $\cs $ be a triangulated subcategory. If $H$ is a $\cs $--cohomological functor, we define $\T H$ by the rule $\T H(s)=H(\Tm s)$. \par A \emph {weak triangle} in the category $\Hom _R^{}\big [\cs \op \,,\,\Mod R\big ]$ is a sequence of cohomological functors $A\stackrel u\la B\stackrel v\la C\stackrel w\la \T A$ such that any rotation of the following is true: given any triangle $a\stackrel {u'}\la b\stackrel {v'}\la c\stackrel {w'}\la \T a$ in the category $\cs $ and a commutative diagram \[\xymatrix { \cy (a)\ar [r]^{\cy (u')}\ar [d]^{f} & \cy (b)\ar [r]^{\cy (v')}\ar [d]^{g} & \cy (c)\ar [r]^{\cy (w')} &\cy ( \T a) \\ A\ar [r]^{u} & B\ar [r]^{v} & C\ar [r]^{w} & \T A }\] there is an extension to a commutative diagram \[\xymatrix { \cy (a)\ar [r]^{\cy (u')}\ar [d]^{f} & \cy (b)\ar [r]^{\cy (v')}\ar [d]^{g} & \cy (c)\ar [r]^{\cy (w')}\ar [d]^{h} &\cy ( \T a)\ar [d]^{\T f} \\ A\ar [r]^{u} & B\ar [r]^{v} & C\ar [r]^{w} & \T A }\] A diagram $\wh A\stackrel {\wh u}\la \wh B\stackrel {\wh v}\la \wh C\stackrel {\wh w}\la \T \wh A$ in the category $\ct $ is called a weak triangle if the functor $\cy $ takes it to a weak triangle in $\Hom _R^{}\big [\cs \op \,,\,\Mod R\big ]$. \edfn \par \rmk {R997.207} We remind the reader of Remark~\ref {R27.7} and Lemma~\ref {L27.976}: if $A$, $B$ and $C$ have $\ct $--approximating systems $\mathfrak {A}_*$, $\mathfrak {B}_*$ and $\mathfrak {C}_*$, we may form in $\ct $ the homotopy colimits $\wh A=\hoco \mathfrak {A}_*$, $\wh B=\hoco \mathfrak {B}_*$ and $\wh C=\hoco \mathfrak {C}_*$. Remark~\ref {R27.7} tells us that there are canonical maps $\alpha :A\la \cy (\wh A)$, $\beta :B\la \cy (\wh B)$ and $\gamma :C\la \cy (\wh C)$. Since our plan is to apply the lemmas in this section to prove representability theorems, we will mostly be interested in cases where $\alpha $, $\beta $ and $\gamma $ are isomorphisms. In this case Lemma~\ref {L27.976} says that the maps $u$, $v$ and $w$ may be lifted (non-uniquely) to $\ct $; we may form in $\ct $ a diagram $\wh A\stackrel {\wh u}\la \wh B\stackrel {\wh v}\la \wh C\stackrel {\wh w}\la \T \wh A$ whose image under $\cy $ is (canonically) isomorphic to $A\stackrel u\la B\stackrel v\la C\stackrel w\la \T A$. \ermk \par \lem {L997.362} Suppose $A\la B\la C\la \T A$ is a weak triangle in $\Hom _R^{}\big [\cs \op \,,\,\Mod R\big ]$. For any $s\in \cs $ the functor $\Hom \big (\cy (s),-\big )$ takes it to an exact sequence. \elem \par \prf Given any map $f:\cy (s)\la A$, we can consider the commutative diagram \[\xymatrix { \cy (s)\ar @{=}[r]\ar [d]_-{f} & \cy (s)\ar [r]\ar [d]^{uf} & 0\ar [r] & \cy (\T s) \\ A\ar [r]^{u} & B\ar [r]^{v} & C\ar [r]^{w} & \T A }\] and the fact that this commutative diagram can be extended gives the vanishing of $vuf$. \par A morphism $g:\cy (s)\la B$ so that $vg=0$ gives a commutative diagram \[\xymatrix { \cy (s)\ar @{=}[r] & \cy (s)\ar [r]\ar [d]^{g} & 0\ar [r]\ar [d] & \cy (\T s) \\ A\ar [r]^{u} & B\ar [r]^{v} & C\ar [r]^{w} & \T A }\] and the existence of an extension gives a morphism $f:\cy (s)\la A$ with $g=uf$. \eprf \par \par \lem {L1.35} With the conventions of Notation~\ref {N997.1} and Definition~\ref {D997.203} suppose we are given: \be \item A morphism $\alpha : A\la B$ in the category $\Hom _R^{}\big [\cs \op \,,\,\Mod R\big ]$. \item A morphism $\alpha _*:\mathfrak {A}_*\la \mathfrak {B}_*$ of sequences in $\ct $, and an isomorphism in $\Hom _R^{}\big [\cs \op \,,\,\Mod R\big ]$ of $\alpha :A\la B$ with the colimit of $\cy (\alpha _*):\cy (\mathfrak {A}_*)\la \cy (\mathfrak {B}_*)$. \item The sequence $\alpha _*$ is assumed to have a subsequence in $\cs $. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee With just these hypotheses we may complete $\alpha _*:\mathfrak {A}_*\la \mathfrak {B}_*$ to a sequence $\mathfrak {A}_*\stackrel {\alpha _*}\la \mathfrak {B}_*\stackrel {\beta _*}\la \mathfrak {C}_*\stackrel {\gamma _*}\la \T \mathfrak {A}_*$ of triangles in $\ct $, and the colimit of $\cy (\mathfrak {A}_*)\stackrel {\cy (\alpha _*)}\la \cy (\mathfrak {B}_*)\stackrel {\cy (\beta _*)}\la \cy (\mathfrak {C}_*)\stackrel {\cy (\gamma _*)}\la \T \cy (\mathfrak {A}_*)$ is a weak triangle $A\stackrel {\alpha }\la B\stackrel {\beta }\la C\stackrel {\gamma }\la \T A$. \par Suppose we add the following assumptions: \be \setcounter {enumi}{\value {enumiv}} \item We are given two subcategories $\ca \subset \cb \subset \cs $, closed under finite coproducts, direct summands and suspensions. \item There is a subsequence of $\alpha _*:\mathfrak {A}_*\la \mathfrak {B}_*$ such that the $\mathfrak {A}_i$ belongs to $\ca $ and the $\mathfrak {B}_i$ belong to $\cb $. Put $\cc =\Smr (\cb *\ca )$. \item Assume furthermore that we are given a $\cc $--cohomological functor $H$ and a natural transformation of $\cb $--cohomological functors $\ph : B|_\cb \la H|_\cb $. Assume that, on the category $\ca \subset \cb $, the composite \[\xymatrix @C+30pt{ A|_\ca \ar [r]^-{\alpha |_\ca } & B|_\ca \ar [r]^-{\ph |_\ca } & H|_\ca }\] vanishes. \item Assume further that the approximating system $\mathfrak {A}_*$ for $A$ is such that each morphism $\mathfrak {A}_i\la \mathfrak {A}_{i+1}$ is a split monomorphism. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee Then there exists a map $\psi :C|_{\cc }\la H$ so that $\ph :B|_\cb \la H|_\cb $ is equal to the composite \[\xymatrix @C+30pt{ B|_\cb \ar [r]^-{\beta |_{\cb }} & C|_\cb \ar [r]^-{\psi |_\cb } & H|_\cb \ . }\] \elem \par \prf We are given a morphism of sequences $\alpha _*:\mathfrak {A}_*\la \mathfrak {B}_*$, meaning for each $m>0$ we have a commutative square \[\xymatrix @C+30pt{ \mathfrak {A}_m\ar [r]^{\alpha _m}\ar [d] & \mathfrak {B}_m\ar [d] \\ \mathfrak {A}_{m+1}\ar [r]^{\alpha _{m+1}} & \mathfrak {B}_{m+1} }\] We extend this to a morphism of triangles \[\xymatrix @C+30pt{ \mathfrak {A}_m\ar [r]^{\alpha _m}\ar [d] & \mathfrak {B}_m\ar [d]\ar [r]^{\beta _m} & \mathfrak {C}_m\ar [r]^{\gamma _m}\ar [d]&\T \mathfrak {A}_m\ar [d]\\ \mathfrak {A}_{m+1}\ar [r]^{\alpha _{m+1}}& \mathfrak {B}_{m+1}\ar [r]^{\beta _{m+1}}& \mathfrak {C}_{m+1}\ar [r]^{\gamma _{m+1}} &\T \mathfrak {A}_{m+1} }\] This produces for us in $\ct $ the sequence of triangles $\mathfrak {A}_*\stackrel {\alpha _*}\la \mathfrak {B}_*\stackrel {\beta _*}\la \mathfrak {C}_*\stackrel {\gamma _*}\la \T \mathfrak {A}_*$, with a subsequence in $\cs $, and it is easy to see that the colimit of $\cy (\mathfrak {A}_*)\stackrel {\cy (\alpha _*)}\la \cy (\mathfrak {B}_*)\stackrel {\cy (\beta _*)}\la \cy (\mathfrak {C}_*)\stackrel {\cy (\gamma _*)}\la \T \cy (\mathfrak {A}_*)$ is a weak triangle $A\stackrel {\alpha }\la B\stackrel {\beta }\la C\stackrel {\gamma }\la \T A$. \par \par It remains to prove the part with the further assumptions added. Note that, by passing to a subsequence, we may assume $\mathfrak {A}_i\in \ca $ and $\mathfrak {B}_i\in \cb $, and hence $\mathfrak {C}_i\in \cb *\ca \subset \cc $. As $H$ is a cohomological functor on $\cc $ and $\ca \subset \cb \subset \cc $, we have that, for each integer $m$, the sequence $H(\T \mathfrak {A}_m)\stackrel {H(\gamma _m)}\la H(\mathfrak {C}_m)\stackrel {H(\beta _m)}\la H(\mathfrak {B}_m)\stackrel {H(\alpha _m)}\la H(\mathfrak {A}_m)$ must be exact. As $m$ increases this gives an inverse system of exact sequences, which we now propose to analyze. The short exact sequences $0\la \Ker \big (H(\gamma _m)\big ) \la H(\T \mathfrak {A}_m)\la \Ima \big (H(\gamma _m)\big )\la 0$ give an exact sequence \[ \xymatrix @C+20pt{ \clim ^1\, H(\T \mathfrak {A}_m) \ar [r] & \clim ^1\,\Ima \big (H(\gamma _m)\big )\ar [r] & \clim ^2\, \Ker \big (H(\gamma _m)\big ) } \] In (vii) we assumed that the maps $\mathfrak {A}_m\la \mathfrak {A}_{m+1}$ are split monomorphisms, hence the maps $H(\T \mathfrak {A}_{m+1})\la H(\T \mathfrak {A}_m)$ are split epimorphisms, making the sequence Mittag-Leffler. Therefore $\clim ^1\,H(\T \mathfrak {A}_m)=0$. We have $\clim ^2\, \Ker \big (H(\gamma _m)\big )=0$ just because we're dealing with a countable limit. We conclude that $\clim ^1\,\Ima \big (H(\gamma _m)\big )=0$. \par Now consider the inverse system of short exact sequences $0\la \Ima \big (H(\gamma _m)\big )\la H(\mathfrak {C}_m)\la \Ima \big (H(\beta _m)\big )\la 0$. Passing to the limit we obtain an exact sequence \[ \xymatrix @C+20pt{ \clim H(\mathfrak {C}_m) \ar [r] & \clim \Ima \big (H(\beta _m)\big )\ar [r] & \clim ^1\, \Ima \big (H(\gamma _m)\big ) } \] We have proved the vanishing of $\clim ^1\, \Ima \big (H(\gamma _m)\big )$, allowing us to conclude that the map $\clim H(\mathfrak {C}_m) \la \clim \Ima \big (H(\beta _m)\big )$ is an epimorphism. Finally we observe the exact sequences $0\la \Ima \big (H(\beta _m)\big ) \la H(\mathfrak {B}_m)\la H(\mathfrak {A}_m)$ and, since inverse limit is left exact, we deduce the exactness of \[ \xymatrix @C+20pt{ 0\ar [r] & \clim \Ima \big (H(\beta _m)\big )\ar [r] & \clim H(\mathfrak {B}_m)\ar [r] & \clim H(\mathfrak {A}_m) } \] Combining the results we have the exactness of \[ \xymatrix @C+20pt{ \clim H(\mathfrak {C}_m)\ar [r] & \clim H(\mathfrak {B}_m)\ar [r] & \clim H(\mathfrak {A}_m)\ . } \] Now Lemma~\ref {L27.33} tells us that $\ph :B|_\cb \la H|_\cb $ corresponds to an element $f\in \clim H(\mathfrak {B}_m)$, and the vanishing of the composite $A|_\ca \la B|_\ca \la H|_\ca $ translates to saying that the image of $f$ under the map $\clim H(\mathfrak {B}_m)\la \clim H(\mathfrak {A}_m)$ vanishes. The exactness tells us that $f$ is in the image of the map $\clim H(\mathfrak {C}_m)\la \clim H(\mathfrak {B}_m)$. This exactly says that there is a natural transformation $\psi :C|_\cc \la H$ with $\ph =\psi \circ \beta $. We have proved the ``extra assumptions'' part. \eprf \par \par \par \par \lem {L997.601} With the conventions of Notation~\ref {N997.1} and Definition~\ref {D997.203} suppose we are given: \be \item Two full subcategories $\ca \subset \cb $ of the category $\cs $, closed under finite coproducts, direct summands and suspensions. \item Put $\cc =\Smr (\cb *\ca )$.

Choose a triangle $a\stackrel {\alpha '}\la b\stackrel {\beta '}\la c\stackrel {\gamma '}\la \T a$ with $b\in \cb $ and $a\in \ca $. Given any element $y\in H(c)$, the map $H(\beta '):H(c)\la H(b)$ takes $y$ to an element $H(\beta ')(y)$ which must be in the image of the surjective map $\psi \beta :B(b)\la H(b)$. After all $b$ is an object in $\cb $, and the map $\psi \beta :B(b)\la H(b)$ is an epimorphism on objects $b\in \cb $. Choose an element $g\in B(b)$ mapping under $\psi \beta $ to $H(\beta ')(y)$. The naturality of $\psi \beta $ means that the square below commutes \[\xymatrix @C+40pt{ & B(b)\ar [r]^-{B(\alpha ')}\ar [d]^{\psi \beta } & B(a) \ar [d]^{\psi \beta } \\ H(c) \ar [r]^-{H(\beta ')} & H(b) \ar [r]^-{H(\alpha ')} & H(a) }\] If we apply the equal composites in the square to $g\in B(b)$ we discover that it goes to $H(\alpha ')H(\beta ')(y)=0$, where the vanishing is because $\beta '\alpha '=0$. Therefore the map $B(\alpha ')$ takes $g\in B(b)$ to an element in the kernel of $\psi \beta : B(a)\la H(a)$. As $a$ belongs to $\ca $ the map $\alpha :A(a)\la B(a)$ surjects onto this kernel; there is an element $f\in A(a)$ with $\alpha (f)=B(\alpha ')(g)$. \par We have produced elements $f\in A(a)$ and $g\in B(b)$, and Yoneda allows us to view them as natural transformations $f:\cy (a)\la A$ and $g:\cy (b)\la B$. The equality $\alpha (f)=B(\alpha ')(g)$ transforms into the assertion that the square below commutes \[\xymatrix @C+40pt{ \cy (a)\ar [r]^-{\cy (\alpha ')}\ar [d]^f & \cy (b)\ar [r]^-{\cy (\beta ')} \ar [d]^g & \cy (c)\ar [r]^-{\cy (\gamma ')} & \cy (\T A) \\ A\ar [r]^-{\alpha } & B\ar [r]^-{\beta }& C \ar [r]^-\gamma & \T A }\] The top row is the image under Yoneda of a triangle in $\cs $, while the bottom row is a weak triangle; hence we may complete to a commutative diagram \[\xymatrix @C+40pt{ \cy (a)\ar [r]^-{\cy (\alpha ')}\ar [d]^f & \cy (b)\ar [r]^-{\cy (\beta ')} \ar [d]^g & \cy (c)\ar [r]^-{\cy (\gamma ')}\ar [d]^h & \cy (\T A)\ar [d]^{\T f}x \\ A\ar [r]^-{\alpha } & B\ar [r]^-{\beta }& C \ar [r]^-\gamma & \T A }\] We have produced a morphism $h:\cy (c)\la C$, which we may view as an element $h\in C(c)$. And the commutativity of the middle square translates, under Yoneda, to the statement that $C(\beta '):C(c)\la C(b)$ takes $h\in C(c)$ to $\beta (g)\in C(b)$. Applying $\psi :C\la H$ we obtain the second equality below \begin {eqnarray*} H(\beta ')(y) &=& \psi \beta (g)\\ &=&\psi C(\beta ')(h) \\ &=&H(\beta ')\psi (h)\ . \end {eqnarray*} The first equality is by construction of $g\in B(b)$, and the third is the naturality of $\psi $. Therefore the map $H(\beta '):H(c)\la H(b)$ annihilates $y-\psi (h)$. Because $H$ is cohomological there is an element $x\in H(\T a)$ with $H(\gamma ')(x)=y-\psi (h)$. But $a\in \ca \subset \cb $ and we may choose an $\theta \in B(\T a)$ with $\psi \beta (\theta )=x$. We have \begin {eqnarray*} y-\psi (h) &=& H(\gamma ')\psi \beta (\theta )\\ &=&\psi C(\gamma ')\beta (\theta ) \end {eqnarray*} where the first equality is the construction of $\theta $, and the second is the naturality of $\psi :C\la H$. These equalities combine to the formula $y=\psi \big [h+C(\gamma ')\beta (\theta )\big ]$, which exihibits $y\in H(c)$ as lying in the image of $\psi :C(c)\la H(c)$. \eprf \par The next lemma will not be used in the current manuscript, but will be needed in the proof of \cite [Theorem~4.6]{Neeman18}. \par \lem {L997.223} With the conventions of Notation~\ref {N997.1} and Definition~\ref {D997.203} suppose we are given: \be \item Two full subcategories $\ca \subset \cb $ of the category $\cs $, closed under finite coproducts, direct summands and suspensions. \item Put $\cc =\Smr (\cb *\ca )$. \item In the category $\Hom _R^{}\big [\cs \op \,,\,\Mod R\big ]$ we are given a diagram of cohomological functors \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ & \wt B\ar [d]^-\delta \\ A\ar [r]^-{\alpha } & B\ar [r]^-{\beta } & C\ar [r]^-{\gamma }\ar [d]^-\psi & \T A\\ & & H }\] where the middle row is a weak triangle. \item The composite $\psi \beta \delta :\wt B\la H$ is surjective. \item The kernel of the map $(\psi \beta \delta )|_\cb :\wt B|_\cb \la H|_\cb $ is annihilated by $\delta :\wt B\la B$ \item The sequence \[\xymatrix @C+30pt{ A|_\ca \ar [r]^-{\alpha |_\ca } & B|_\ca \ar [r]^-{(\psi \beta )|_\ca } & H|_\ca \ar [r] &0 }\] is exact. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee Then the map $(\beta \delta ):\wt B\la C$ annihilates the kernel of $(\psi \beta \delta )|_\cc :\wt B|_\cc \la H|_\cc $. \elem \par \prf We need to show that, if $c\in \cc =\Smr (\cb *\ca )$ and $y\in \wt B(c)$ is annihilated by the map $\psi \beta \delta :\wt B(c)\la H(c)$, then $y$ is already annihilated by the shorter map $\beta \delta :\wt B(c)\la C(c)$. Note that without loss of generality we may assume $c\in \cb *\ca $. Choose therefore a triangle $a\stackrel {\alpha '}\la b\stackrel {\beta '}\la c\stackrel {\gamma '}\la \T a$ with $b\in \cb $ and $a\in \ca $, and consider the commutative diagram with exact rows \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ & & \wt B(c)\ar [d]^-{\delta }\ar [r]^-{\wt B(\beta ')} & \wt B(b)\ar [d]^-{\delta } \\ B(\T b)\ar [d]^-{\psi \beta }\ar [r]^-{B(\T \alpha ')} & B(\T a)\ar [d]^-{\psi \beta }\ar [r]^-{B(\gamma ')} & B(c)\ar [d]^-{\psi \beta }\ar [r]^-{B(\beta ')} & B(b)\ar [d]^-{\psi \beta } \\ H(\T b)\ar [r]^-{H(\T \alpha ')} &H(\T a)\ar [r]^-{H(\gamma ')} & H(c)\ar [r]^-{H(\beta ')} & H(b) }\] We are given an element $y\in \wt B(c)$ such that the vertical composite in the third column annihilates it. Therefore $\wt B(\beta ')(y)$ is an element of $\wt B(b)$ annihilated by the vertical composite in the fourth column. By assumption (v) the element $\wt B(\beta ')(y)$ is already killed by $\delta :\wt B(b)\la B(b)$, and we conclude that the equal composite in the top-right square annihilate $y$. Hence the map $\delta :\wt B(c)\la B(c)$ must take $y\in \wt B(c)$ to an element in the image of $B(\gamma ')$, and we may therefore \be \setcounter {enumi}{\value {enumiv}} \item Choose an $x\in B(\T a)$ with $B(\gamma ')(x)=\delta (y)$. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee Now recall that the vertical composite in the third column kills $y$, hence the equal composites in the middle square at the bottom must annihilate $x$. Therefore $\psi \beta (x)\in H(\T a)$ lies in the kernel of $H(\gamma ')$, which is the image of $H(\T \alpha '):H(\T b)\la H(\T a)$. And since the map $\psi \beta :B(\T b)\la H(\T b)$ is surjective we may lift further to $B(\T b)$; we can choose an element $w\in B(\T b)$ whose image under the equal composites in the bottom-left square are equal to $\psi \beta (x)$. Therefore we have that, with $x\in B(\T a)$ as in (vii) and $w\in B(\T b)$ as above, the element $x-B(\T \alpha ')(w)$ is annihilated by $\psi \beta :B(\T a)\la H(\T a)$. Now (vi) tells us that \be \setcounter {enumi}{\value {enumiv}} \item We may choose an element $v\in A(\T a)$ whose image under $\alpha :A(\T a)\la B(\T a)$ is equal to $x-B(\T \alpha ')(w)$. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee To complete the proof consider the commutative diagram with vanishing horizontal and vertical composites \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ & A(\T a)\ar [d]^-{\alpha }\ar [r]^-{A(\gamma ')} & A(c)\ar [d]^-{\alpha } \\ B(\T b)\ar [r]^-{B(\T \alpha ')} & B(\T a)\ar [d]^-{\beta }\ar [r]^-{B(\gamma ')} & B(c)\ar [d]^-{\beta } \\ &C(\T a)\ar [r]^-{C(\gamma ')} & C(c) }\] The horizontal map in the top row takes the element $v\in A(\T a)$ constructed in (viii) to $A(\gamma ')(v)$, which must be annihilated by the vertical composite in the third column. By the commutativity of the top square coupled with (viii), this means that $x-B(\T \alpha ')(w)$ is an element of $B(\T a)$ annihilated by the equal composites in the bottom square. In particular the horizontal map $B(\gamma ')$ takes $x-B(\T \alpha ')(w)$ to an element of the kernel of $\beta :B(c)\la C(c)$. But the map $B(\gamma ')$ annihilates $B(\T \alpha ')(w)$, and by (vii) it takes $x$ to $\delta (y)$. We conclude that $\beta \delta (y)=0$. \eprf \par \par \section {The main theorems} \label {S37} \par It's time to prove Theorem~\ref {T1.-1}; we should focus the general lemmas of Section~\ref {S997} on the situation at hand. Thus in this section we make the following global assumptions: \par \ntn {N37.9993} We specialize the conventions of Notation~\ref {N997.1} by setting $\cs =\ct ^c$, that is $\cs $ is the subcategory of compact objects in $\ct $. Thus in this section the functor $\cy $ of Notation~\ref {N997.1} specializes to $\cy :\ct \la \Hom _R^{}\big ([\ct ^c]\op \,,\,\Mod R\big )$, which takes an object $t\in \ct $ to $\cy (t)=\Hom (-,t)|_{\ct ^c}$. \par In the generality of Notation~\ref {N997.1} we considered $\cs $--cohomological functors $H$ and $\cb $--approximating systems $E_1\la E_2\la E_3\la \cdots $. Because we are now in the special case where $\cs =\ct ^c$ Remark~\ref {R27.99309} applies: if $F=\hoco E_i$ then the natural map $H\la \cy (F)$ must be an isomorphism. \par We will furthermore assume that we have chosen in $\ct $ a single compact generator $G$. We will suppose given a \tstr \ $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ in the preferred equivalence class, with $\ct ^{\geq 0}$ closed under coporducts. For example we could let $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ be equal to $\big (\ct _G^{\leq 0},\ct _G^{\geq 0}\big )$, see Remark~\ref {R0.7}. Let $\ca $ be the heart of the \tstr , and $\ch :\ct \la \ca $ the homological functor of Reminder~\ref {R-1.1}. We will assume given an integer $A>0$ with $\Hom \big (\T ^{-A}G,\ct ^{\leq 0}\big )=0$. The existence of such an $A$ is equivalent to the hypothesis that $\Hom (G,\T ^iG)=0$ for $i\gg 0$. And what is important for us is that this guarantees that the category $\ct ^-_c$ is a thick subcategory of $\ct $. \par Finally and most importantly: as in Notation~\ref {N997.1} the triangulated category $\ct $ is assumed to be $R$--linear for some commutative ring $R$. But from now on we add the assumption that the ring $R$ is noetherian and, with $G$ as in the last paragraph, the $R$--module $\Hom (G,\T ^iG)$ is finite for every $i\in \zz $. Combining this paragraph with the last: the functor $\cy (G)$ is $G$--locally finite. \entn \par \par \par \par Under some additional approximability assumptions, Theorem~\ref {T1.-1} describes the essential image of the functor $\cy $ taking $F\in \ct ^-_c$ to $\cy (F)=\Hom (-,F)|_{\ct ^c}$, and tells us that the functor $\cy $ is full. To show that $\cy (F)$ lies in the expected image one doesn't need any hypotheses beyond the ones above, we prove \par \lem {L1.1.3} With the assumptions of Notation~\ref {N37.9993}, for any $F\in \ct ^-_c$ the functor $\cy (F):[\ct ^c]\op \la \Mod R$ is a locally finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functor. \elem \par \par \par \prf We are given that the functor $\cy (G)$ is $G$--locally finite. In particular: for $i\ll 0$ we have $\Hom (\T ^iG,G)=0$. With $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ as in Notation~\ref {N37.9993}, that is our fixed \tstr \ in the preferred equivalence class, Remark~\ref {R0.14.7} coupled with Lemma~\ref {L17.17} tell us that, for any object $K\in \ct ^c$, there is an integer $B>0$ so that $\Hom \big (\T ^{-B}K,\ct ^{\leq 0}\big )=0$. Remark~\ref {R0.13.99} gives the inclusion in $F\in \ct ^-_c\subset \ct ^-$, hence we may choose an integer $A>0$ with $\T ^AF\in \ct ^{\leq 0}$. We deduce that $\Hom (\T ^{i}K,F)=0$ for all $i\leq -A-B$. \par The fact that the functor $\cy (G)$ is $G$--locally finite also means that, for every integer $i\in \zz $, the $R$--module $\Hom (\T ^iG,G)$ is finite. The full subcategory $\cl \subset \ct ^c$ defined by \[ \cl \eq \{L\in \ct ^c\mid \Hom (\T ^iG,L)\text { is a finite $R$--module for all }i\in \zz \} \] is thick and contains $G$, hence $\ct ^c=\gen G{}\subset \cl $. Now take any $L\in \ct ^c$ and define the full subcategory $\ck (L)\subset \ct ^c$ by \[ \ck (L)\eq \{K\in \ct ^c\mid \Hom (\T ^iK,L)\text { is a finite $R$--module for all }i\in \zz \} \] Then $\ck (L)$ is thick and contains $G$, hence $\ct ^c=\gen G{}\subset \ck (L)$. We conclude that $\Hom (\T ^iK,L)$ is a finite $R$--module for all $K,L\in \ct ^c$ and all $i\in \zz $. \par Now fix the integer $i$, the object $K\in \ct ^c$ and the object $F\in \ct ^-_c$, and we want to prove that $\Hom (\T ^iK,F)$ is a finite $R$--module. The first paragraph of the proof produced an integer $B>0$ with $\Hom \big (\T ^{-B}K,\ct ^{\leq 0}\big )=0$, and since $F$ is approximable there exists a triangle $L\la F\la D$ with $L\in \ct ^c$ and $D\in \ct ^{\leq -i-B-1}$. In the exact sequence \[\xymatrix { \Hom (\T ^iK,\Tm D)\ar [r] & \Hom (\T ^iK,L)\ar [r] & \Hom (\T ^iK,F)\ar [r] & \Hom (\T ^iK,D) }\] we have that $\Hom (\T ^iK,D)=0 =\Hom (\T ^iK,\Tm D)$, and $\Hom (\T ^iK,F)\cong \Hom (\T ^iK,L)$ must be a finite $R$--module by the second paragraph of the proof. \eprf \par \nin In Corollary~\ref {C17.29} we learned that, under some approximability hypotheses, objects in $\ct ^-_c$ can be well approximated by sequences with special properties. We don't need all these properties yet; for the next few lemmas we formulate what we will use. \par \par \dfn {D1.29} Adopting the conventions of Notation~\ref {N37.9993}, a \emph {strong $\gen Gn$--approximating system} is a sequence of objects and morphisms $E_1\la E_2\la E_3\la \cdots $ \be \item Each $E_m$ belongs to $\gen Gn$. \item The map $\ch ^i(E_m)\la \ch ^i(E_{m+1})$ is an isomorphism whenever $i\geq -m$. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee In this definition we also allow $n=\infty $, we simply declare $\gen G\infty =\gen G{}=\ct ^c$. \par Suppose we are also given an object $F\in \ct $, together with \be \setcounter {enumi}{\value {enumiv}} \item A map of the approximating system $E_*$ to $F$. \item The map in (iii) is such that $\ch ^i(E_m)\la \ch ^i(F)$ is an isomorphism whenever $i\geq -m$. \ee Then we declare $E_*$ to be a \emph {strong $\gen Gn$--approximating system for $F$.} \edfn \par \par \rmk {R1.31} Although Definition~\ref {D1.29} was phrased in terms of the particular choice of \tstr \^^M$(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$, made in Notation~\ref {N37.9993}, it is robust---up to passing to subsequences a strong $\gen Gn$--approximating system for $F$ will work for any equivalent \tstr . \ermk \par \par \par \lem {L1.1010101} With the conventions of Definition~\ref {D1.29} we have \be \item Given an object $F\in \ct ^-$ and a strong $\gen Gn$--approximating system $E_*$ for $F$, then the (non-canonical) map $\hoco E_i\la F$ is an isomorphism. \item Any object $F\in \ct ^-_c$ has a strong $\ct ^c$--approximating system. \item Any $\gen Gn$--strong approximating system $E_1\la E_2\la E_3\la \cdots $ is a strong $\gen Gn$--approximating system of the homotopy colimit $F=\hoco E_i$. Moreover $F$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$. \ee \elem \par \prf We begin by proving (iii). Suppose $E_1\la E_2\la E_3\la \cdots $ is a strong $\gen Gn$--approximating system, and let $F=\hoco E_i$. The objects $E_i$ all belong to $\gen Gn\subset \ct ^c\subset \ct ^-$. Choose an integer $n>0$ with $E_1\in \ct ^{\leq n}$. The fact that $\ch ^i(E_1)\la \ch ^i(E_m)$ is an isomorphism for all $i\geq -1$ means that $\ch ^i(E_m)=0$ for all $i>n$ and all $m$, and Lemma~\ref {L-1.3} gives that the $E_m$ all lie in $\ct ^{\leq n}$. Hence the homotopy colimit $F$ also belongs to $\ct ^{\leq n}$. \par Now Remark~\ref {R-1.9} tells us that the map $\colim \,\ch ^i(E_m)\la \ch ^i(F)$ is an isomorphism for every $i\in \zz $. By the previous paragraph the triangle $E_m\la F\la D_m$ lies in $\ct ^-$, and as $\ch ^i(E_m)\la \ch ^i(F)$ is an isomorphism for $i\geq -m$ we deduce that $\ch ^i(D_m)=0$ for all $i\geq -m$. Lemma~\ref {L-1.3} guarantees that $D_m\in \ct ^{\leq -m-1}$, and as $E_m\in \gen Gn\subset \ct ^c$ and $m>0$ is arbitrary we have that $F$ satisfies the criterion for belonging to $\ct ^-_c$. \par Next we prove (i). By (iii) the map $\hoco E_i\la F$ is a morphism from $\hoco E_i\in \ct ^-_c$ to $F\in \ct ^-$, hence it is a morphism in $\ct ^-$. The hypothesis of (i), coupled with Remark~\ref {R-1.9}, tell us that $\ch ^i\big (\hoco E_i\big )\la \ch ^i(F)$ is an isomorphism for every $i\in \zz $. By Lemma~\ref {L-1.5}(ii) the map $\hoco E_i\la F$ is an isomorphism. \par It remains to prove (ii). Note that, if we assume more approximability hypotheses on $\ct $, then (ii) is immediate from Corollary~\ref {C17.29}. But let us see that we don't yet need any strong assumptions. \par Take any $F\in \ct ^-_c$. There exists a triangle $E_1\la F\la D_1$ with $E_1\in \ct ^c$ and $D_1\in \ct ^{\leq -3}$. When $i\geq -1$ exact sequence $\ch ^{i-1}(D_1)\la \ch ^i(E_1)\la \ch ^i(F)\la \ch ^i(D)$ has $\ch ^{i-1}(D_1)=0=\ch ^i(D)$, starting the construction of $E_*$. \par Suppose now that we have constructed the sequence up to an integer $n>0$, that is we have a map $f_m:E_m\la F$, with $E_m\in \ct ^c$, and so that $\ch ^i(f_m)$ is an isomorphism for all $i\geq -m$. Lemma~\ref {L17.17} allows us to choose an integer $N>0$ so that $\Hom \big (E_m,\ct ^{\leq -N}\big )=0$. Because $F$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$ we may choose a triangle $E_{m+1}\la F\la D_{m+1}$ with $E_{m+1}\in \ct ^c$ and $D_{m+1}\in \ct ^{\leq -N-m-3}$. As in the paragraph above we show that the map $\ch ^i(E_{m+1})\la \ch ^i(F)$ is an isomorphism for all $i\geq -m-1$. And since the composite $E_m\stackrel {f_n}\la F\la D_{m+1}$ vanishes, the map $f_n$ must factor as $E_m\la E_{m+1}\la F$. \eprf \par \rmk {R37.20202025} Lemma~\ref {L1.1010101}(iii) and Remark~\ref {R27.99309} combine to tell us that a strong $\gen Gn$--approximating system for $F$, in the sense of Definition~\ref {D1.29}, is in fact an approximating system for $F$ as defined in Remark~\ref {R27.7}. Our terminology isn't misleading. \ermk \par \par \rmk {R37.2020202} Let us now specialize Lemma~\ref {L1.35} to the framework of this section. Assume we are given \be \item A morphism $\wh \alpha :\wh A\la \wh B$ in the category $\ct ^-_c$. \item Two integers $n'$ and $n$, as well as a strong $\gen G{n'}$--approximating system $\mathfrak {A}_*$ for $\wh A$ and a strong $\gen G{n}$--approximating system $\mathfrak {B}_*$ for $\wh B$. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee Lemma~\ref {L27.592} allows us to choose a subsequence of $\mathfrak {B'}_*\subset \mathfrak {B}_*$ and a map of sequences $\alpha _*:\mathfrak {A}_*\la \mathfrak {B'}_*$ compatible with $\wh \alpha :\wh A\la \wh B$. A subsequence of a strong $\gen G{n}$--approximating sequence is clearly a strong $\gen G{n}$--approximating sequence, hence $\mathfrak {B'}_*$ is a strong $\gen G{n}$--approximating sequence for $\wh B$. Now as in Lemma~\ref {L1.35} we extend $\alpha _*:\mathfrak {A}_*\la \mathfrak {B'}_*$ to a sequence of triangles, in particular for each $m>0$ this gives a morphism of triangles \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ \mathfrak {A}_m\ar [r]^{\alpha _m}\ar [d] & \mathfrak {B'}_m\ar [d]\ar [r]^{\beta _m} & \mathfrak {C}_m\ar [r]^{\gamma _m}\ar [d]&\T \mathfrak {A}_m\ar [d] \ar [r]^-{\T \alpha _m} &\T \mathfrak {B'}_m\ar [d]\\ \mathfrak {A}_{m+1}\ar [r]^{\alpha _{m+1}}& \mathfrak {B'}_{m+1}\ar [r]^{\beta _{m+1}}& \mathfrak {C}_{m+1}\ar [r]^{\gamma _{m+1}} &\T \mathfrak {A}_{m+1} \ar [r]^-{\T \alpha _{m+1}} &\T \mathfrak {B'}_{m+1} }\] Applying the functor $\ch ^i$ with $i\geq -m$ yields a commutative diagram in the heart of $\ct $ where the rows are exact, and where the vertical maps away from the middle are isomorphisms. By the 5-lemma the middle vertical map, i.e.~the map $\ch ^i(\mathfrak {C}_{m})\la \ch ^i(\mathfrak {C}_{m+1})$, must also be an isomorphism when $i\geq -m$. We conclude that $\mathfrak {C}_*$ is a strong $\gen G{n'+n}$--approximating system. Put $\wh C=\hoco \mathfrak {C}_*$. By Lemma~\ref {L1.1010101}(iii) the object $\wh C$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$ and $\mathfrak {C}_*$ is a strong $\gen G{n'+n}$--approximating system for $\wh C$, while Remark~\ref {R997.207} guarantees that the weak triangle $A\stackrel u\la B\stackrel v\la C\stackrel w\la \T A$ of Lemma~\ref {L1.35} is isomorphic to the image under $\cy $ of a weak triangle $\wh A\stackrel {\wh u}\la \wh B\stackrel {\wh v}\la \wh C\stackrel {\wh w}\la \T \wh A$ in the category $\ct ^-_c$. \par Furthermore: the homological functor $\ch $ takes each of the triangles $\mathfrak {A}_m\stackrel {\alpha _m}\la \mathfrak {B'}_m\stackrel {\beta _m}\la \mathfrak {C}_m\stackrel {\gamma _m}\la \T \mathfrak {A}_m$ to a long exact sequence, and by Remark~\ref {R-1.9} the (eventually stable) colimit is $\ch $ of the weak triangle $\wh A\stackrel {\wh u}\la \wh B\stackrel {\wh v}\la \wh C\stackrel {\wh w}\la \T \wh A$. Hence $\ch $ takes the weak triangle $\wh A\stackrel {\wh u}\la \wh B\stackrel {\wh v}\la \wh C\stackrel {\wh w}\la \T \wh A$. to a long exact sequence. \ermk \par \par \par \par \lem {L37.601} Let the conventions be as in Notation~\ref {N37.9993}.

Furthermore the object $F$ may be chosen to have a strong $\gen Gn$--approximating system. \par We will in fact prove a refinement of the above. Since $H$ is assumed to be a locally finite $\gen Gn$--cohomological functor its restriction to $\gen Gm$, for any integer $m<n$, is a locally finite $\gen Gm$--cohomological functor.

Let $F$ be defined by \[ F =\coprod _{i\in \zz }\bigoplus _{j\in J_i}\T ^i G \] and let the morphism $\ph :\cy (F)\la H$ be given by \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ \cy (F)|_{\gen G1}\ar @{=}[r]& \ds \bigoplus _{i\in \zz }\bigoplus _{j\in J_i}\cy (\T ^iG) \ar [rr]^-{(\ph _{ij})} && H }\] where $(\ph _{ij})$ stands for the row matrix with entries $\ph _{ij}$; on the $i,j$ summand the map is $\ph _{ij}$. Finally: because the \tstr \ is in the preferred equivalence class there is an integer $B>0$ with $\T ^BG\in \ct ^{\leq 0}$. For $m>0$ we define \[ E_m=\bigoplus _{i\leq m+B}\,\bigoplus _{j\in J_i}\T ^i G \] The sum is finite by hypothesis, making $E_m$ an object of $\gen G1$. The obvious map $E_m\la E_{m+1}$ is a split monomorphism, and in the decomoposition $F\cong E_m\oplus \wt F$ we have that $\wt F$, being the coproduct of $\T ^iG$ for $i= m+B+1$, belongs to $\ct ^{\leq -m-1}$. Therefore the map $\ch ^i(E_m)\la \ch ^i(F)$ is an isomorphism when $i\geq -m$, making $E_*$ is a strong $\gen G1$--approximating system for $F$. \par Now for the induction step. Suppose $n\geq 1$ is an integer and we know the Lemma for all integers $\leq n$. We wish to show it holds for $n+1$. Let $H$ be a locally finite $\gen G{n+1}$--cohomological functor. Then the restriction of $H$ to $\gen Gn$ is a locally finite $\gen Gn$--cohomological functor, and we may apply the induction hypothesis to produce in $\ct ^-_c$ a sequence $F_1\la F_2\la \cdots \la F_{n-1}\la F_n$, with compatible surjections $\ph _m:\cy (F_m)|_{\gen Gm}\la H|_{\gen Gm}$. In particular the map $\ph _n:\cy (F_n)|_{\gen Gn}\la H|_{\gen Gn}$ is an epimorphism. Complete the natural transformation $\ph _n$ to a short exact sequence \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ 0\ar [r] & H'\ar [r] &\cy (F_n)|_{\gen Gn}\ar [r]^-\ph & H|_{\gen Gn} \ar [r] & 0 }\] of functors on $\gen Gn$. Since $H|_{\gen Gn}$ and $\cy (F_n)|_{\gen Gn}$ are locally finite $\gen Gn$--cohomological functors so is $H'$, and induction applies. For any $m\leq n$ we may choose a surjection $\ph '_m:\cy (F')|_{\gen Gm}\la H'|_{\gen Gm}$, as in (i) and (ii). We wish to consider the special case $m=1$, where we can assume our $F'$ is as in (iii). That is we choose an object $F'\in \ct ^-_c$, which admits a strong $\gen G1$--approximating system and a surjection $\ph ':\cy (F')|_{\gen G1}\la H'|_{\gen G1}$. And we may further assume that our approximating system $E'_1\la E'_2\la E'_3\la \cdots $ for $F'$ is such that every morphism $E'_i\la E'_{i+1}$ is a split monomorphism. \par We have natural transformations $\cy (F')|_{\gen G1}\la H'|_{\gen G1}\la \cy (F_n)|_{\gen G1}$, and as $F'$ admits a $\gen G1$--approximating system Lemma~\ref {L27.976} tells us that the composite is equal to $\cy (\alpha _n)|_{\gen G1}$ for some morphism $\alpha _n:F'\la F_n$ in the category $\ct $.

We have constructed a map $\ph :\cy (F)\la H$ and will prove that $\ph $ is an isomorphism. \par Let us consider the restriction of the natural transformation $\ph $ to the subcategory $\gen G1\subset \ct ^c$. The natural transformation $\ph |_{\gen G1}:\cy (F)|_{\gen G1}\la H|_{\gen G1}$ is the map to $H|_{\gen G1}$ from the colimit of the sequence \[\xymatrix @C+40pt{ \cy (F_1)|_{\gen G1}\ar [r]^-{\cy (\beta _1^{})|_{\gen G1}} &\cy (F_2)|_{\gen G1}\ar [r]^-{\cy (\beta _2^{})|_{\gen G1}} &\cdots }\] and Lemma~\ref {L37.601}(ii) says the sequence is such that each map $\cy (\beta _n^{})|_{\gen G1}$ factors as $\cy (F_n)|_{\gen G1}\la H|_{\gen G1}\la \cy (F_{n+1})|_{\gen G1}$. Hence the colimit agrees with the colimit of the ind-isomorphic constant sequence $H|_{\gen G1}\la H|_{\gen G1}\la H|_{\gen G1}\la $, and this proves that the restriction of $\ph :\cy (F)\la H$ to the category $\gen G1$ is an isomorphism. Concretely: for every $i\in \zz $ the map $\ph :\Hom (\T ^iG,F)\la H(\T ^iG)$ is an isomorphism. The full subcategory $\ck \subset \ct ^c$ defined by \[ \ck \eq \left \{ K\in \ct ^c\,\left |\begin {array}{c} \forall i\in \zz \text {\rm \ the map}\\ \ph :\Hom (\T ^iK,F)\la H(\T ^iK)\\ \text {\rm is an isomorphism} \end {array} \right .\right \} \] is thick and contains $G$, hence $\ck \subset \ct ^c=\gen G{}\subset \ck $. \par It remains to prove that the $F$ we constructed belongs to $\ogenun \cg 4$. We begin with the observation that each $F_n$ in the sequence $F_1\stackrel {\beta _1^{}}\la F_2 \stackrel {\beta _2^{}}\la F_3\stackrel {\beta _3^{}}\la \cdots $ of Remark~\ref {R37.1003} has a strong $\gen Gn$--approximating system.

But now $F=\hoco F_n$, and the triangle \[\xymatrix @C+30pt{ \ds \bigoplus _{n=1}^\infty F_n \ar [r] & \ds \bigoplus _{n=1}^\infty F_n \ar [r] & F\ar [r] & \ds \bigoplus _{n=1}^\infty \T F_n }\] gives that $F$ belongs to $\ogenun \cg 2*\ogenun \cg 2\subset \ogenun \cg 4$. \eprf \par \ntn {N37.10245} This is as far as we get with the assumptions of Notation~\ref {N37.9993}.

The new assertion is that we may choose $F_n$ to lie in $\ct ^{\leq \wt A}$ for some $\wt A>0$ independent of $n$. \par Because $H$ is locally finite there exists an integer $B'>0$ with $H(\T ^{-i}G)=0$ for all $i\geq B'$. Since $H$ is cohomological it follows that $H(E)=0$ for all $E\in \genuf G{}{B'}$. And Corollary~\ref {C17.29} gives us an integer $B>0$ so that, for every integer $m>0$, every object $F\in \ct ^-_c\cap \ct ^{\leq 0}$ admits a triangle $E_m\la F\la D_m$ with $D_m\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$ and $E_m\in \genu G{}{1-m-B,B}\subset \genuf G{}{1-m-B}$. I assert that $\wt A=B+B'$ works. \par Let us begin with the $F_n$ provided by Remark~\ref {R37.1003}. Because it belongs to $\ct ^-_c\subset \ct ^-$ there exists an integer $\ell >0$ with $F_n\in \ct ^{\leq \ell }$. Applying Corollary~\ref {C17.29} to the object $\T ^\ell F_n\in \ct ^-_c\cap \ct ^{\leq 0}$, with $m=\ell -B-B'$, we learn that there exists a triangle $E\stackrel \alpha \la F_n\la D$ with $D\in \ct ^{\leq \ell -m}=\ct ^{\leq B+B'}=\ct ^{\leq \wt A}$ and $E\in \genuf G{}{\ell +1-m-B}=\genuf G{}{1+B'}$. In particular $E\in \ct ^c$, and $H(E)=0$ by the choice of $B'$. Hence the composite \[\xymatrix @C+60pt{ \cy (E)\ar [r]^-{\cy (\alpha )} &\cy (F_n)\ar [r]^-{\ph } & H }\] vanishes. \par Now we apply Lemma~\ref {L1.35} with $n'=n=\infty $. The object $F_n\in \ct ^-_c$, of Lemma~\ref {L37.601} and Remark~\ref {R37.1003}, comes with a strong $\gen Gn$--approximating system, which is certainly a strong $\ct ^c$--approximating system. The object $E\in \ct ^c$ comes with the trivial strong $\ct ^c$--approximating system $E\stackrel \id \la E\stackrel \id \la E\stackrel \id \la \cdots $. In this system the connecting maps are all identities, which are split monomorphisms. The hypotheses of Lemma~\ref {L1.35} and Remark~\ref {R37.2020202} hold and the Lemma produces for us, in $\ct ^-_c$, a weak triangle $E\stackrel \alpha \la F_n\stackrel \beta \la \wt D\la \T E$ and a factorization of $\ph :\cy (F_n)\la H$ as a composite \[\xymatrix @C+60pt{ \cy (F_n)\ar [r]^{\cy (\beta )} &\cy (\wt D)\ar [r]^-{\psi } &H\ . }\] The surjectivity of the restriction to $\gen Gn$ of $\ph $ implies the surjectivity of the restriction to $\gen Gn$ of $\psi $. \par It remains to show that $\wt D\in \ct ^-_c$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c\cap \ct ^{\leq \wt A}$. We know that, in the triangle $E\la F_n\la D\la \T E$, the object $D$ belongs to $\ct ^{\leq \wt A}$. The long exact sequence $\ch ^{i-1}(D)\la \ch ^i(E)\la \ch ^i(F_n)\la \ch ^i(D)$ tells us that $\ch ^i(\alpha ):\ch ^i(E)\la \ch ^i(F)$ is surjective if $i=1+\wt A$ and is an isomorphism when $i>1+\wt A$. The long exact sequence $\ch ^i(E)\la \ch ^i(F_n)\la \ch ^i(\wt D)\la \ch ^{i+1}(E)\la \ch ^{i+1}(F_n)$ says that $\ch ^i(\wt D)=0$ if $i\geq 1+\wt A$.

Replacing the functor $H$ by $H(\T ^{\wt A}-)$ we may assume $\wt A=0$. Let $B>0$ be the integer whose existence is given Lemma~\ref {L17.25}. Next we need to make our construction. \par We will proceed inductively, using Lemma~\ref {L37.1036}, to construct in $\ct ^-_c\cap \ct ^{\leq 0}$ a sequence \[\xymatrix @C+15pt{ E_1\ar [rr]^{\e _2}\ar [dr]_{\alpha _1}& &\ar [dl]^{\gamma _2} E_2\ar [dr]_{\alpha _2}\ar [rr]^{\e _3} & & E_3\ar [dl]^-{\gamma _3}\ar [dr]_{\alpha _3} & \cdots \\ & \wt F_1 & & \wt F_2 & & \wt F_3 }\] as well as natural transformations $\wt \ph _i:\cy (\wt F_i)\la H$, satisfying the following \be \item The restriction of $\wt \ph _i$ to the subcategory $\gen G{(i+3)B}$ is surjective. \item For each $i>0$ the square \[\xymatrix @C+40pt{ \cy (E_{i+1}) \ar [r]^-{\cy (\alpha _{i+1})}\ar [d]_-{\cy (\gamma _{i+1})} & \cy (\wt F_{i+1}) \ar [d]^{\wt \ph _{i+1}}\\ \cy (\wt F_i) \ar [r]^{\wt \ph _i} & H }\] commutes. \item The morphisms $\ch ^\ell (\gamma _i)$ and $\ch ^\ell (\alpha _{i})$ are isomorphisms whenever $\ell \geq -i$. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee To start the induction we declare $\wt F_1=F_{4B}$ and $\wt \ph _1=\ph _{4B}$. Choose a triangle $E_1\stackrel {\alpha _1}\la \wt F_1\la D_1$ with $D_1\in \ct ^{\leq -3}$; we immediately have that $\ch ^\ell (\alpha _1)$ is an isomorphism for $\ell \geq -1$. In particular for $\ell \geq 1$ we have $\ch ^\ell (E_1)\cong \ch ^\ell (F_{4B})=0$; hence $E_1\in \ct ^c\cap \ct ^{\leq 0}$. \par Suppose our induction has proceeded as far as $n$. In particular: we have produced in $\ct ^-_c\cap \ct ^{\leq 0}$ a morphism $\alpha _n:E_n\la \wt F_n$, with $E_n\in \ct ^c$, as well as a natural transformation $\wt \ph _n:\cy (\wt F_n)\la H$ which is surjective when restricted to $\gen G{(n+3)B}$. And we have done it in such a way that $\ch ^\ell (\alpha _n)$ is an isomorphism for $\ell \geq -n$. We wish to go on to $n+1$. \par Now the first paragraph of the proof gives us an object $F_{(n+4)B}\in \ct ^-_c\cap \ct ^{\leq 0}$, as well as a natural transformation $\ph _{(n+4)B}^{}:\cy (F_{(n+4)B})\la H$ whose restriction to $\gen G{(n+4)B}$ is surjective. Lemma~\ref {L37.1036}, with $m=n+3$, allows us to construct in $\ct ^-_c\cap \ct ^{\leq 0}$ the diagram \[\xymatrix { E_n\ar [rr]^{\e _{n+1}^{}}\ar [dr]_{\alpha _{n}}& &\ar [dl]^{\gamma _{n+1}} E_{n+1}\ar [dr]^{\alpha _{n+1}} & & F_{(n+4)B}\ar [dl]_-{\beta } \\ & \wt F_n & & \wt F_{n+1} }\] as well as the natural transformation $\wt \ph _{n+1}:\cy (\wt F_{n+1})\la H$ satisfying lots of properties: Lemma~\ref {L37.1036}(i) tells us that $E_{n+1}$ belongs to $\ct ^c$. Lemma~\ref {L37.1036}(ii) gives that $\ch ^\ell (\alpha _{n+1})$ and $\ch ^\ell (\gamma _{n+1})$ are isomorphisms if $\ell \geq -n-3+2=-n-1$. Lemma~\ref {L37.1036}(iii) says that $\wt \ph _{n+1}$ is an epimorphism when restricted to $\gen G{(n+4)B}$, and Lemma~\ref {L37.1036}(iv) says that the square in (ii) above commutes. This finishes the induction. \par It remains to see how to deduce the Lemma. We have produced a sequence $E_1\stackrel {\e _2}\la E_3\stackrel {\e _3}\la E_3\stackrel {\e _4}\la \cdots $ and, for each $i>0$ \be \setcounter {enumi}{\value {enumiv}} \item We define $\psi _i:\cy (E_i)\la H$ to be the composite \[\xymatrix @C+40pt{ \cy (E_{i}) \ar [r]^-{\cy (\alpha _{i})} & \cy (\wt F_i) \ar [r]^{\wt \ph _i} & H }\] \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee With these definitions we will prove \be \setcounter {enumi}{\value {enumiv}} \item The following triangles commute \[\xymatrix @C+50pt@R-20pt{ & \cy (E_{i+1}) \ar [dd]^{\psi _{i+1}}\\ \cy (E_i) \ar [rd]_-{\psi _i} \ar [ur]^-{\cy (\e _{i+1})} & \\ & H }\] \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee This permits us to make the next definitions \be \setcounter {enumi}{\value {enumiv}} \item We put $F=\hoco E_i$, and let $\psi :\cy (F)\la H$ be \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ \cy (F) \ar @{=}[r] &\colim \,\cy (E_i)\ar [r] & H }\] that is the colimit of the maps $\psi _i$. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee And with the definitions made, we will prove \be \setcounter {enumi}{\value {enumiv}} \item The object $F$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$. \item The map $\psi :\cy (F)|_{\ct ^c}\la H$ is an epimorphism. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee Together, (vii) and (viii) contain the assertion of the Lemma. All that remains is to prove (v), (vii) and (viii). \par To prove (v) the reader should consider the diagram \[\xymatrix @C+40pt@R-15pt{ &\cy (E_{i+1}) \ar [r]^-{\cy (\alpha _{i+1})}\ar [dd]^-{\cy (\gamma _{i+1})} & \cy (\wt F_{i+1}) \ar [dd]^{\wt \ph _{i+1}}\\ \cy (E_{i}) \ar [ur]^-{\cy (\e _{i+1})} \ar [dr]_-{\cy (\alpha _{i})} & & \\ &\cy (\wt F_i) \ar [r]^{\wt \ph _i} & H }\] We wish to prove the commutativity of the perimeter. The square commutes by (ii), and the triangle by applying the functor $\cy $ to the commutative triangle \[\xymatrix @C+15pt{ E_i\ar [rr]^{\e _{i+1}}\ar [dr]_{\alpha _i}& &\ar [dl]^{\gamma _{i+1}} E_{i+1}\\ & \wt F_1 & }\] \par Also: we may apply $\ch ^\ell $ to the commutative triangle. From (iii) we know that $\ch ^\ell (\alpha _i)$ is an isomorphism for $\ell \geq -i$ and also that $\ch ^\ell (\gamma _{i+1})$ is an isomorphism for $\ell \geq -i-1$. Since $\ch ^\ell (\alpha _i)=\ch ^\ell (\gamma _{i+1})\ch ^\ell (\e _{i+1})$ we learn that $\ch ^\ell (\e _{i+1})$ is an isomorphism when $\ell \geq -i$. Therefore $E_*$ is a strong $\ct ^c$--approximating system as in Definition~\ref {D1.29}, and Lemma~\ref {L1.1010101} informs us that $F=\hoco E_i$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$---that is we have proved (vii). It remains only to prove (viii). \par Suppose therefore that $C$ is an object $\ct ^c$. There exists an $n>0$ with $C\in \gen G{(n+3)B}$, and Lemma~\ref {L17.17} says that we may also choose $n$ so that $\Hom (C,\ct ^{-n-1})=0$. Because $\wt \ph _n:\cy (\wt F_n)\la H$ is surjective on $\gen G{(n+3)B}$ we have that the map $\wt \ph _n:\Hom (C,\wt F_n)\la H(C)$ is surjective. In the triangle $E_n\stackrel {\alpha _n}\la \wt F_n\la \wt D_n$ we have that $\ch ^\ell (\alpha _n)$ is an isomorphism for $\ell \geq -n$, therefore $\ch ^\ell (\wt D_n)=0$ for $\ell \geq -n$, therefore $\wt D_n\in \ct ^{\leq -n-1}$. In the exact sequence \[\xymatrix @C+15pt{ \Hom (C,E_n)\ar [rr]^-{\Hom (C,\alpha _n)}& &\Hom (C,\wt F_n)\ar [r] & \Hom (C,\wt D_n) }\] we have $\Hom (C,D_n)=0$ since $\wt D_n\in \ct ^{\leq -n-1}$. The map $\psi _n:\Hom (C,E_n)\la H(C)$ of (iv) is the composite of the two epimorphisms \[\xymatrix @C+15pt{ \Hom (C,E_n)\ar [rr]^-{\Hom (C,\alpha _n)}&& \Hom (C,\wt F_n)\ar [r]^-{\wt \ph _n} & H(C) }\] But it factors through $\psi :\Hom (C,F)\la H(C)$, which must therefore be epi. \eprf \par \rmd {R37.1050} Let $\ct $ be a triangulated category with coproducts. A morphism $f:D\la E$ is called \emph {phantom} if, for every compact object $C\in \ct $, the induced map $\Hom (C,f):\Hom (C,D)\la \Hom (C,E)$ vanishes. The phantom maps form an ideal: if $f,f':D\la E$ are phantom then so is $f+f'$, and if $D'\stackrel e\la D\stackrel f\la E\stackrel g\la E'$ are composable morphisms with $f$ phantom, then $gfe:D'\la E'$ is also phantom. \ermd \par \cor {C37.1056} Let the conventions be as in Notation~\ref {N37.1024}.

There exists an object $F\in \ct ^-_c$ and a triangle $F\stackrel f\la F'\stackrel g\la D$ with $g$ phantom. \ecor \par \prf Lemma~\ref {L37.1046} gives us an object $F\in \ct ^-_c$ and an epimorphism $\ph :\cy (F)\la H=\cy (F')$. Since $F$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$ Lemma~\ref {L1.1010101}(ii) produces for $F$ a (strong) $\ct ^c$--approximating system. Lemma~\ref {L27.976} allows us to realize the natural transformation $\ph $ as $\cy (f):\cy (F)\la \cy (F')$ for some (non-unique) $f:F\la F'$. Complete $f$ to a triangle $F\stackrel f\la F'\stackrel g\la D$. For every object $C\in \ct $ we have an exact sequence \[\xymatrix @C+15pt{ \Hom (C,F)\ar [rr]^-{\Hom (C,f)}&& \Hom (C,F')\ar [rr]^-{\Hom (C,g)} && \Hom (C,D) }\] and if $C$ is compact the map $\Hom (C,f)=\cy (f)(C)$ is surjective. It follows that $\Hom (C,g)$ is the zero map. \eprf \par Now that it's time to state the main theorem we include all the hypotheses explicitly. \par \thm {T37.1067} Let $R$ be a noetherian, commutative ring. Let $\ct $ be an $R$--linear triangulated category with coproducts, and suppose it has a compact generator $G$ such that $\Hom (-,G)$ is a $G$--locally finite cohomological functor. Assume further that $\ct $ is approximable. \par Let $\ct ^-_c\subset \ct $ be the category of Definition~\ref {D0.13}, where the \tstr \ with respect to which we define it is in the preferred equivalence class. Then the functor $\cy :\ct ^-_c\la \Hom \big ((\ct ^c)\op ,\Mod R\big )$, taking $F\in \ct ^-_c$ to $\cy (F)=\Hom (-,F)|_{\ct ^c}$, satisfies \be \item The objects in the essential image of $\cy $ are the locally finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functors. \item The functor $\cy $ is full. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee \ethm \par \prf The fact that, for any object $F\in \ct ^-_c$, the functor $\cy (F)$ is a locally finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functor was proved in Lemma~\ref {L1.1.3}. In Lemma~\ref {L1.1010101}(ii) we saw that any $F\in \ct ^-_c$ admits a $\ct ^c$--approximating system, and Lemma~\ref {L27.976} guarantees that any natural transformation $\ph :\cy (F)\la \cy (F')$ can be expressed as $\ph =\cy (f)$ for some $f:F\la F'$; that is the functor is full. It remains to show that any locally finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functor $H:(\ct ^c)\op \la \Mod R$ is in the essential image; we must show it isomorphic to $\cy (F)$ for some $F\in \ct ^-_c$. \par Proposition~\ref {P37.1005} produced a candidate $F$; we have an $F\in \ogenun \cg 4$ and an isomorphism $H\cong \cy (F)$. We wish to show that $F$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$. We proceed by induction to prove \be \setcounter {enumi}{\value {enumiv}} \item Let $\ci $ be the ideal of phantom maps. For each integer $n>0$ there exists a triangle $F_n\la F\stackrel {\beta _n}\la D_n$ with $F_n\in \ct ^-_c$ and $\beta _n\in \ci ^n$. \setcounter {enumiv}{\value {enumi}} \ee We prove (iii) by induction on $n$. The case $n=1$ is given by Corollary~\ref {C37.1056}. Now for the inductive step: assume that, for some $n\geq 1$, we are given a triangle $F_n\la F\stackrel {\beta _n}\la D_n$ with $F_n\in \ct ^-_c$ and $\beta _n\in \ci ^n$. We know that both $\cy (F_n)$ and $\cy (F)$ are locally finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functors, and the exact sequence \[\xymatrix { 0\ar [r] & \cy (\Tm D_n) \ar [r] & \cy (F_n)\ar [r] & \cy (F)\ar [r] & 0 }\] says that so is $\cy (\Tm D_n)$. Corollary~\ref {C37.1056} permits us to construct a triangle $F'\la D_n\stackrel \gamma \la D_{n+1}$ with $F'\in \ct ^-_c$ and $\gamma \in \ci $. Let $\beta _{n+1}:F\la D_{n+1}$ be the composite $F\stackrel {\beta _n}\la D_{n} \stackrel \gamma \la D_{n+1}$. Since $\beta _n\in \ci ^n$ and $\gamma \in \ci $ we deduce that $\beta _{n+1}\in \ci ^{\n +1}$. If we complete $\beta _{n+1}$ to a triangle $F_{n+1}\la F\stackrel {\beta _{n+1}}\la D_{n+1}$, the octahedral axiom allows us to find a triangle $F_n\la F_{n+1}\la F'$. Since $F_n$ and $F'$ lie in $\ct ^-_c$ so does $F_{n+1}$. This completes the proof of (iii). \par Now consider the triangle $F_4\la F\la D_4$. The morphism $F\la D_4$ is in $\ci ^4$, but $F$ belongs to $\ogenun \cg 4$. One easily shows that $\big (\ogenun \cg 1,\ci \big )$ is a projective class as in Christensen~\cite [Definition~2.2]{Christensen96}, and \cite [Theorem~1.1]{Christensen96} tells us that so is $\big (\ogenun \cg 4,\ci ^4\big )$. The map $F\la D_4$ is a morphism in $\ci ^4$ out of an object in $\ogenun \cg 4$ and must vanish, making $F$ a direct summand of $F_4\in \ct ^-_c$. Proposition~\ref {P17.21} tells us that $\ct ^-_c$ is thick, and therefore $F\in \ct ^-_c$. \eprf \par \lem {L37.2063} Let the assumptions be as in Theorem~\ref {T37.1067}. Suppose $f:F\la F'$ is a morphism in $\ct ^-_c$ and assume $F'$ belongs to $\ct ^b_c$. Then $\cy (f)=0$ implies $f=0$. \elem \par \prf Because $F'$ belongs to $\ct ^b_c$ there must be an integer $\ell $ with $F'\in \ct ^{\geq \ell }$; without loss of generality we may assume $\ell =0$. Now $F$ belongs to $\ct ^-_c$, hence there must exist a triangle $E\stackrel g\la F\stackrel h\la D$ with $E\in \ct ^c$ and $D\in \ct ^{\leq -1}$. Choose such a triangle. \par The vanishing of $\cy (f)$ means that $\Hom (E,f):\Hom (E,F)\la \Hom (E,F')$ must take $g\in \Hom (E,F)$ to zero; that means $fg=0$. But the triangle tells us that $f:F\la F'$ must factor as $F\stackrel h\la D\la F'$. As $D\in \ct ^{\leq -1}$ and $F'\in \ct ^{\geq 0}$ we have $\Hom (D,F')=0$, hence $f=0$. \eprf \par \thm {T37.2068} Let the assumptions be as in Theorem~\ref {T37.1067}. The restriction of the functor $\cy $ to the subcategory $\ct ^b_c$ is fully faithful, and the essential image is the class of finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functors. \ethm \par \prf The functor is full on all of $\ct ^-_c$, and Lemma~\ref {L37.2063} guarantees that on the subcategory $\ct ^b_c$ it is faithful. It remains to identify the essential image. Let $F$ be an object in $\ct ^-_c$, we need to show that $\cy (F)$ is finite if and only if $F\in \ct ^b_c$. \par Suppose $F\in \ct ^b_c\subset \ct ^+$ and $C\in \ct ^c\subset \ct ^-$. We can choose an integer $\ell >0$ so that $\Hom (\T ^iC,F)=0$ for all $i\geq \ell $, which implies that $\Hom (-,F)|_{\ct ^c}$ is $C$--finite. Since this is true for every $C\in \ct ^c$ we have that $\cy (F)$ is finite. \par Conversely: suppose $\cy (F)$ is finite and choose a compact generator $G$. Because $\cy (F)=\Hom (-,F)|_{\ct ^c}$ is $G$--finite there is an integer $\ell $ so that $\Hom (\T ^iG,F)=0$ for all $i\geq \ell $. But then $\Hom (T,F)=0$ for all $T\in \ogenul G{}{-\ell }=\ct _G^{\leq -\ell }$ and $F$ must belong to $\ct ^-_c\cap \ct _G^{\geq -\ell +1}\subset \ct ^b_c$. \eprf \par \section {Applications: the construction of adjoints} \label {S73} \par We prove Corollary~\ref {C0.-978}, a restricted version of which was the key tool in Jack Hall's original, simple proof of GAGA---see Remark~\ref {R1.-8}. Hall's later proof of a more general result, see~\cite {Hall18}, sidesteps the representability theorems presented here. \par \thm {T73.1} Let $R$ be a noetherian, commutative ring. Let $\ct $ be an $R$--linear triangulated category with coproducts, and assume that it is approximable. Let $\ct ^b_c\subset \ct ^-_c$ be the subcategories of Definition~\ref {D0.13}, constructed using a \tstr \ in the preferred equivalence class. Assume the category $\ct ^c$ is contained in $\ct ^b_c$. Assume further that $\ct $ has a compact generator $G$ so that $\Hom _\ct ^{}(-,G)$ is a $G$--locally finite cohomological functor. \par Let $\cl :\ct ^b_c\la \cs $ be an $R$--linear triangulated functor, and let $(\ct ^{\leq 0},\ct ^{\geq 0})$ be any \tstr \ in the preferred equivalence class. Assume further: \be \item For any pair of objects $(t,s)$, with $t\in \ct ^c$ and $s\in \cs $, the $R$--module $\Hom \big (\cl (t),s\big )$ is finite. \item For any object $s\in \cs $ there exists an integer $A>0$ with $\Hom \big (\cl (\ct ^b_c\cap \ct ^{\leq -A})\,,\,s\big )=0$. \item For any object $t\in \ct ^c$ and any object $s\in \cs $ there exists an integer $A$ so that $\Hom \big (\cl (\T ^mt),s\big )=0$ for all $m\leq -A$. \ee Then $\cl $ has a right adjoint $\car :\cs \la \ct ^b_c$. \ethm \par \prf For any pair of objects $t\in \ct ^c$, $s\in \cs $ and any integer $m\in \zz $, from (i) we learn that $\Hom \big (\cl (\T ^mt),s\big )$ is a finite $R$--module. Now (ii) and (iii) guarantee that it vanishes whenever $m\gg 0$ or $m\ll 0$. Thus $\Hom \big (\cl (-),s\big )$ is a finite $\ct ^c$--cohomological functor. The assignment taking $s\in \cs $ to the functor $\Hom \big (\cl (-),s\big )$ is a functor from $\cs $ to the category of finite $\ct ^c$--chomological functors; by Theorem~\ref {T37.1067} we can lift it through the equivalence of categories $\cy $. There is a functor $\car :\cs \la \ct ^b_c$ so that, for all objects $t\in \ct ^c$ and all objects $s\in \cs $, we have a natural isomorphism \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ \Hom \big (\cl (t),s\big )\ar [r]^-{\ph } & \Hom \big (t,\car (s)\big )\ . }\] Fix $t'\in \ct ^b_c$ and consider the following composite, which is natural in $t\in \ct ^c$, $t'\in \ct ^b_c$ \[\xymatrix @C+20pt{ \Hom (t,t')\ar [r]^-{\cl }&\Hom \big (\cl (t),\cl (t')\big )\ar [r]^-{\ph } &\Hom \big (t,\car \cl (t')\big )\ . }\] We have objects $t',\car \cl (t')\in \ct ^b_c$ and a natural transformation $\cy (t')\la \cy \big (\car \cl (t')\big )$, and Theorem~\ref {T37.2068} allows us to express it uniquely as $\cy (\alpha _{t'}^{})$ for some morphism $\alpha _{t'}^{}:t'\la \car \cl (t')$ in $\ct ^b_c$. We leave it to the reader to check that $\alpha _{t'}^{}$ is natural in $t'$; it gives a natural transformation $\alpha :\id \la \car \cl $. \par \par Now we define a natural transformation $\psi :\Hom \big (\cl (-),-\big )\la \Hom \big (-,\car (-)\big )$. For objects $t\in \ct ^b_c$, $s\in \cs $ the map is \[\xymatrix @C+10pt{ \Hom \big (\cl (t),s\big )\ar [r]^-{\car }&\Hom \big (\car \cl (t),\car (s)\big ) \ar [rr]^-{\Hom \big (\alpha _t^{},\car (s)\big )} &&\Hom \big (t,\car (s)\big )\ . }\] When restricted to $t\in \ct ^c\subset \ct ^b_c$ the map $\psi $ agrees with $\ph $ and is an isomorphism. It suffices to prove that $\psi $ is an isomorphism for all $t\in \ct ^b_c$ and all $s\in \cs $. \par Fix $t\in \ct ^b_c$ and $s\in \cs $. By (ii) we can choose an integer $A>0$ with $\Hom \big (\cl (\ct ^b_c\cap \ct ^{\leq -A})\,,\,s\big )=0$. Because $\car (s)$ belongs to $\ct ^b_c\subset \ct ^+$ we may choose an integer $A'>0$ so that $\Hom \big (\ct ^{\leq -A'},\car (s)\big )=0$. Now take $m\geq 1+\max (A,A')$, and choose a triangle $\Tm d\la e\la t\la d$ with $e\in \ct ^c$ and $d\in \ct ^{\leq -m}$. Because $t\in \ct ^b_c$ and $e\in \ct ^c\subset \ct ^b_c$ we have that $d\in \ct ^b_c\cap \ct ^{\leq -m}$. Consider the commutative diagram with exact rows \[\xymatrix @C+5pt{ \Hom \big (\cl (d),s\big )\ar [r]\ar [d]& \Hom \big (\cl (t),s\big )\ar [r]^-a\ar [d]^b& \Hom \big (\cl (e),s\big )\ar [r]\ar [d]^c&\Hom \big (\cl (\Tm d),s\big )\ar [d] \\ \Hom \big (d,\car (s)\big )\ar [r] &\Hom \big (t,\car (s)\big )\ar [r]^{a'} & \Hom \big (e,\car (s)\big )\ar [r] &\Hom \big (\Tm d,\car (s)\big ) }\] By our choice of $m$ we know that \[ \Hom \big (\cl (d),s\big )=0=\big (\cl (\Tm d),s\big ),\quad \Hom \big (d,\car (s)\big )=0=\Hom \big (\Tm d,\car (s)\big ). \] Hence $a,a'$ are isomorphisms. But $c$ is an isomorphism by the compactness of $e$, and therefore $b$ is an isomorphism. \eprf \par \par \par \def \cprime {$'$} \providecommand {\bysame }{\leavevmode \hbox to3em{\hrulefill }\thinspace } \providecommand {\MR }{\relax \ifhmode \unskip \space \fi MR } \providecommand {\MRhref }[2]{\href {http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=##1}{##2} } \providecommand {\href }[2]{##2} \begin {thebibliography}{10} \par \bibitem {Adams71} J.~Frank Adams, \emph {A variant of {E.
