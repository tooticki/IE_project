BEGIN Basic Lemma -- second form   
 [A. Beilinson] Let $F$ be a weakly constructible sheaf on an affine variety $X$. Let $n=\dim (X)$. Then there is a Zariski open $U\subset X$ with the properties below, where $j:U\to X$ denotes the inclusion, and $F'=j_!j^*F\subset F$. \begin {enumerate} \item [{\rm (1)}] $\dim (Y)<n$, where $Y$ is the complement of $U$ in $X$, \item [{\rm (2)}] $\homology ^q (X,F')=0$ for $q\neq n$. \item [{\rm (3)}] There is a finite subset $E\subset U(\C )$ and an $R$-module isomorphism of $\homology ^n (X,F')$ with $\oplus \{ F_x:x\in E\}$. \end {enumerate}
END Basic Lemma -- second form
 
BEGIN Remark 1.1  
 With $F$ on $X$ as in the lemma above, let $X'$ be the largest Zariski open subset of $X$ so that $X'$ is smooth and $F|X'$ is locally constant. The open $U$ in the statement of the lemma \emph {depends only on} $X'$ \emph {and not on} $F$, as can be seen from the proof. \par The proof given uses the Noether normalisation lemma twice. If in both these places, one uses general linear projections instead, one sees that the $U$ in the lemma can be chosen to contain any given finite subset of $X'(\C )$. In particular, \emph {the $U$ for which the lemma holds cover $X$, if $F$ is locally constant and if $X$ is smooth}.
END Remark
 
BEGIN Remark 1.2  
 The first form of the basic lemma, as given in the introduction, is an immediate consequence. If $R_X$ denotes the constant sheaf on $X$ and $v: V\to X$ is a Zariski open immersion with $W$ as its complement, then the sheaf cohomology $\homology ^q(X,F)$, where $F=v_!v^*R_X$ coincides with the singular cohomology $\homology ^q(X,W;R)$. So, the above lemma applied to $F$ and $R=\Z $ yields $Y$ with $\dim (Y)<n$ and $\homology ^q(X,Y\cup W)=0$ for $q\neq n$, and $\homology ^n(X,Y\cup W)=0$ is a free Abelian group. The universal coefficient theorem gives the same result for all $R$ and for homology as well.

 [of the basic lemma (second form)] Because the direct image of a locally constant sheaf under a covering projection is locally constant, it follows easily that the direct image of a weakly constructible sheaf under a finite morphism is weakly constructible. With $X$ and $F$ as in the lemma, by Noether normalisation, we have a finite morphism $\pi :X\to \A ^n$. Assuming the lemma for the sheaf $\pi _*F$ on $\A ^n$, we get a non-empty Zariski open $V\subset \A ^n$ with the desired properties. \par Putting $U=\pi ^{-1}V$ and denoting the inclusions of $U$ in $X$ and $V$ in $\A ^n$ by $j$ and $v$ respectively, we see that $\pi _*j_!j^*F=v_!v^*\pi _*F$. Consequently $\homology ^q(X,j_!j^*F)=\homology ^q(\A ^n,v_!v^*\pi _*F )$, and by the very choice of $V$, the latter vanishes for $q \neq n$. This proves part (2) of the lemma. Part (3) follows because $(\pi _*F)_y$ is the direct sum of $F_x$ taken over $x \in \pi ^{-1}y$. \par It remains to prove the lemma for affine space. We will proceed by induction on dimension. Given a weakly constructible sheaf $F$ on $\A ^n$, choose a \emph {nonconstant} $f$ in the co-ordinate ring of $\A ^n$ so that the restriction $F|\mathrm {D}(f)$ is locally constant, where $\mathrm {D}(f)$ and $\V (f)$, are, as usual, $\{ x|\,f(x)\neq 0\}$ and $\{x|\,f(x)=0\}$ in $\A ^n$ respectively. Clearly, $F$ may be replaced by its subsheaf $d_!d^*F$ where $d$ denotes the inclusion of $\mathrm {D}(f)$ in $\A ^n$. \emph {Thus we will assume that $F|\V (f)=0$.} Next, after a linear change of variables, we may assume that $f$ is monic in the last variable. Denote by $\pi : \A ^n \to \A ^{n-1}$ the projection $(x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_n)\mapsto (x_1,x_2,\ldots , x_{n-1})$. The restriction $\pi |\V (f)$ is now both \emph {finite} and \emph {surjective}. For $y\in \A ^{n-1}(\C )$, we consider the cohomology groups $\homology ^q (\pi ^{-1}y,F|\pi ^{-1}y)$. That this vanishes for $q>1$ is standard (e.g., Remark~1.4 below). Because $\V (f)\cap \pi ^{-1}y$ is \emph {non-empty} and the restriction of $F$ to this intersection is zero, we see that $\homology ^0(\pi ^{-1}y ,F|\pi ^{-1}y)=0$ as well. Because $\pi |\V (f)$ is a finite morphism, we may apply VPBC (Proposition~1.3A below) to conclude that $\derived ^q\pi _*F=0$ for all $q\neq 1$. For a non-empty Zariski open $U'\subset \A ^{n-1}$ (that will be chosen later), let $U=\pi ^{-1}U'$. Let $j':U'\to \A ^{n-1}$ and $j:U\to \A ^n$ denote the given inclusions. Put $G=\derived ^1\pi _*F$. Let $G'=j'_!{j'}^*G$ and let $F'=j_!j^*F$. From Corollary~1.3C below, it follows that $ \derived ^q\pi _*F'=0$ for $q\neq 1$ and also that $G'\to \derived ^1\pi _*F'$ is an isomorphism. From the Leray spectral sequence, we deduce that $\homology ^q(\A ^{n-1},G')$ is isomorphic to $\homology ^{q+1}(\A ^n, F')$ for all $q$. Checking easily that $G$ is weakly constructible (see Remark~1.5), apply the basic lemma to the pair $(\A ^{n-1}, G)$ to get a non-empty $U'\subset \A ^{n-1}$ with the desired properties. It follows that $\homology ^q(\A ^n, F')$ vanishes for all $q\neq n$. Finally, for part (3) of the lemma, $\homology ^n(\A ^n, F')=\homology ^{n-1}(\A ^{n-1},G')$ is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of stalks $G_y$ for $y\in U'(\C )$ by the induction hypothesis. But each such $G_y=\homology ^1(\pi ^{-1}y,F|\pi ^{-1}y)$ is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of stalks of $F|\pi ^{-1}y$ from Remark~1.4 below. This completes the proof of the basic lemma (modulo 1.3--1.5). \qed

 [of Proposition~1.3A] Let $L_m$ and $\overline {L}_m$ be the fibers over $m \in M$ in $L$ and $\overline {L}$ respectively. Let $j:L \to \overline {L}$ and $j_m:L_m \to \overline {L}_m$ denote the inclusions. We have the spectral sequences: \begin {equation*} \begin {split} \mathrm {E}_2^{p,q}&=(\derived ^p\overline {f}_* \derived ^q j_*A)_m \^^M\Rightarrow (\derived ^{p+q}f_*A)_m \text { and }\\ \mathrm {E}_2^{p,q}&=\homology ^p (\overline {L}_m, \derived ^q(j_m)_*A|L_m) \Rightarrow \homology ^{p+q} (L_m,A|L_m) \end {split} \end {equation*} and a homomorphism from the first to the second. The second is the Leray spectral sequence for the sheaf $A|L_m$ and the inclusion $j_m$. The first is obtained by taking stalks at $m$ of the Leray spectral sequence for the composite $L \to \overline {L} \to \nolinebreak M$ and the sheaf $A$. By the proper base-change theorem, we see that the $\mathrm {E}_2^{p,q}$ terms of the first spectral sequence coincide with $\homology ^p( \overline {L}_m, \derived ^q j_*A| \overline {L}_m)$. To prove the proposition, it suffices to check that $\derived ^qj_*A|\overline {L}_m \to \derived ^q(j_m)_*(A|L_m)$ is an isomorphism. This arrow evidently induces an isomorphism of stalks at $x \in L_m$. For the rest, one observes that (H1), (H2) and (H3) imply (H4) below and then notes that for $x \in \overline {L}_m -L_m$ the required isomorphism on stalks is a consequence. In any ``geometric situation'' where $M$ is triangulable, this is immediate. That (H4) and our assumptions on the topology of $L$ and $M$ are adequate to draw the same conclusion is left to the reader. This may be seen, for instance, by using the Kunneth formula. \par \medskip \par \noindent (H4): Every $x \in \overline {L}-L$ has a neighbourhood $U\subset \overline {L}$ with a continuous $h: (U, U\cap L) \to (V,W)$ so that \begin {enumerate} \item [{\rm (i)}] $\overline {f}(U)$ is open in $M$, \item [{\rm (ii)}] $(h,\overline {f}|U)$ induce a homeomorphism $(U, U\cap L) \to (V,W) \times \overline {f}(U)$, and \item [{\rm (iii)}] there is a sheaf $C$ on $W$ and an isomorphism $(h|U \cap L)^*C \to A|U \cap L$. \end {enumerate} \qed

BEGIN Remark 1.4  
 Consider a weakly constructible sheaf $F$ on $\A ^1$ whose restriction to the complement of a non-empty finite subset $S\subset \C $ is locally constant. Let $T$ be a tree embedded in $\C $ with $S$ as its set of vertices, and $E$ as its set of edges. Let $b(e)$ denote the barycenter of an edge $e \in E$. One checks easily that \begin {enumerate} \item [(a)] $\homology ^q(\A ^1,F)\to \homology ^q(T,F|T)$ is an isomorphism, and \item [(b)] the open covering $\{ st(v): v \in S\}$ of $T$ give a Leray covering for $F|T$ (see e.g., \cite [Chapter~VIII,~Prop.~8.1.4.(ii),~page~323]{nori:KS}), for a more general statement). \end {enumerate} The Cech complex for this covering is the arrow $ \oplus _{s \in S}F_s \to \oplus _{e \in E}F_{b(e)}$. Thus, if $F|S=0$, then $ \oplus _{e \in E}F_{b(e)} \to \homology ^1(T,F|T)$ is an isomorphism. This gives part (3) of the basic lemma for the affine line.

BEGIN Remark 1.5  
 Let $\pi : X \times \A ^1 \to X$ denote the projection. Let $V\subset X \times A^1$ be a Zariski closed subset so that $\pi |V$ is a finite surjective morphism. Let $A$ be a sheaf on $X \times \A ^1$ so that $A|V=0$ and the restriction of $A$ to the complement $V$ is locally constant. We sketch briefly a proof that $\derived ^1\pi _*A$ is weakly constructible. \par If $\pi |V$ is a finite etale morphism, then $(X \times \A ^1,V) \to X$ is a fiber bundle pair. Consequently $\derived ^1\pi _*A$ is a locally constant sheaf. For the general case, express $X$ as a finite disjoint union of Zariski locally closed smooth subvarieties $X_i$ so that $(\pi ^{-1}X_i \cap V)_{red} \to X_i$ is a finite etale morphism. By Corollary~1.3B, we see that $\derived ^1 \pi _* A|X_i$ maps isomorphically to the locally constant sheaf $\derived ^1 (\pi |X_i \times \A ^1 )_*A|X_i \times \A ^1)$. This proves the weak constructibility of $\derived ^1\pi _*A$.

 We begin as in the proof of the basic lemma. Given a constructible sheaf $F$ on $\A ^n$, choose a nonconstant $f$ in the co-ordinate ring of $\A ^n$ so that the restriction $F|\mathrm {D}(f)$ is locally constant, where $\mathrm {D}(f)$ and $\V (f)$, are, as before, $\{ x|\,f(x)\neq 0\}$ and $\{x|\,f(x)=0\}$ in $\A ^n$. The projection $\pi :\A ^n\to \A ^{n-1}$ is, once again, arranged so that $\pi |\V (f)$ is a finite (and surjective) morphism. Denote by $j:\mathrm {D}(f)\to \A ^n$ and $i:\V (f)\to \A ^n$ the inclusions. \par From Proposition~2.2 below (with $X=\A ^{n-1}$ and $A=j_!j^*F$ ) we see that $j_!j^*F$ is a subsheaf of a constructible $H'$ on $\A ^n$ so that $\derived ^q\pi _*H'=0$ for all $q\geq 0$. Taking push-outs, we obtain the commutative diagram of exact sequences below: $$ \xymatrix { 0 \ar [r]\ar [d] & j_!j^*F \ar [r]\ar [d]^-{\text {mono}} & F \ar [r]\ar [d]^-{\text {mono}} & i_*i^*F \ar [r]\ar [d]^-{\text {iso}} & 0 \\ 0 \ar [r] & H' \ar [r] & H \ar [r] &H'' \ar [r] & 0. \\ } $$ We will say that a homorphism $P\to Q$ of sheaves on $\A ^n$ is a \emph {$\pi $-isomorphism} if $\derived ^q\pi _*P \to \derived ^q\pi _*Q$ is an isomorphism for all $q\geq 0$. We shall see that all arrows in the commutative diagram below are $\pi $-isomorphisms. $$ \xymatrix { \pi ^*\pi _*H \ar [r]\ar [d] & H\ar [d] \\ \pi ^*\pi _*H'' \ar [r] & H''. \\ } $$ We have the implications: \begin {equation*} \begin {split} \derived ^q\pi _*H'& =0 \mbox { for all } q\geq 0\\ &\Rightarrow H\to H'' \mbox { is a } \pi \mbox {-isomorphism}\\ &\Rightarrow \pi _*H \to \pi _*H'' \mbox { is an isomorphism}\\ &\Rightarrow \pi ^*\pi _*H \to \pi ^*\pi _*H'' \mbox { is an isomorphism.} \end {split} \end {equation*} Next, because $\pi |\mathrm {V}(f)$ is a finite morphism, we see that $H''$ is constructible and that $\derived ^q \pi _*H''$ vanishes for $q>0$. For any sheaf $K$ on $\A ^{n-1}$, $\derived ^q \pi _*\pi ^*K$ vanishes for $q>0$. Putting $K=\nolinebreak \pi _*H''$, we deduce that $\pi ^*\pi _*H'' \to H''$ is a $\pi $-isomorphism. We conclude that the only remaining arrow in the square $\pi ^*\pi _*H \to H$ is itself a $\pi $-isomorphism. \par Now let $ \pi _*H\subset J$ with $J$ a sheaf on $\A ^{n-1}$. Taking push-outs once again yields the commutative diagram of exact sequences below: $$ \xymatrix { 0 \ar [r]\ar [d] & \pi ^*\pi _*H \ar [r]\ar [d] & \pi ^*J \ar [r]\ar [d] & M \ar [r]\ar [d]^-{\text {id.}} & 0 \\ 0 \ar [r] & H \ar [r] & G \ar [r] & M \ar [r] & 0. \\ } $$ The vertical arrows on the sides being $\pi $-isomorphisms, it follows that $\pi ^*J \to G$ is a $\pi $-isomorphism as well. It follows that $$\xymatrix @1{ \homology ^q(\A ^{n-1},J) \ar [r] & \homology ^q(\A ^n,\pi ^*J) \ar [r] & \homology ^q(\A ^n, G)} $$ are isomorphisms, for all $q\geq 0$. By the induction hypothesis, we may choose $J$ satisfying $\homology ^q(\A ^{n-1},J)=0$ for all $q>0$ with $J$ constructible. We now have $F \subset H \subset G$ with $G$ constructible and $\homology ^q(\A ^n, G)=0$ for all $q>0$. The proof of the theorem is now complete modulo Proposition~2.2. \qed

 We fix a variety $X$ and work in the category of $X$-schemes. The product $\A ^r \times X$ is denoted by $\A ^r_X$. Let $p_i:\A ^2_X \to \A ^1_X\,$, $\pi :\A ^1_X \to X\,$ and $\Pi :\A ^2_X \to X$ denote the given projections, and let $\Delta :\A ^1_X\to \A ^2_X$ denote the diagonal morphism.
END Notation
 
BEGIN Proposition 2.2  
 Let $V\subset \A ^1_X$ be a Zariski closed subset so that $\pi |V$ is a finite surjective morphism. Let $A$ be a sheaf on $\A ^1_X$ so that $A|V=0$ and the restriction of $A$ to the complement $\A ^1_X-V $ is locally constant. With $\delta : A \to C$ as above, we have: \begin {enumerate} \item [{\rm (1)}] the above $\delta : A \to C$ is a monomorphism, \item [{\rm (2)}] $\derived ^q\pi _*C=0$ for all $q\geq 0$, \item [{\rm (3)}] $C$ is weakly constructible. If $A$ is constructible, so is $C$. \end {enumerate}

 Applying $\derived ^q(p_1)*$ to the short exact sequence that defines $B$, we see that $\derived ^q(p_1)_*B=0$ for all $q$. From the Leray spectral sequence applied to $\Pi =\pi \circ p_1$ we see that $\derived ^q\Pi _*B=0$ for all $q$. \par Put $Y=\Delta (\A ^1_X) \cup p_1^{-1}V$. Then $B|Y=0$ and $B$ is locally constant on the complement of $Y$. Now $p_2|Y$ is a finite surjective morphism. So, substituting $(\A ^2_X,\A ^1_X,p_2,B)$ for $(L,M,f,A)$ in Proposition~1.3A, we get $\derived ^q(p_2)_*B=0$ for $q \neq 1$. By the Leray spectral sequence for $\Pi =\pi \circ p_2$ we deduce that $\derived ^q\pi _*C=\derived ^{q+1}\Pi _*B=0$. This proves part (2) of the proposition. That $C$ is weakly constructible follows from Remark~1.5. By Proposition~1.3A and Remark~1.4, any stalk of $C$, being isomorphic to a finite direct sum of stalks of $B$, is indeed an object of $\mathcal {N}$ if $A$ is constructible. This proves part (3). Finally, $ \pi ^*\derived ^q\pi _*A \to \derived ^q(p_2)_*p_1^*A$ is an isomorphism by Corollary~1.3B, because $V \to X$ is a finite morphism. Furthermore, $V \to X$ being surjective, the stalks of these sheaves vanish for $q=0$, and this proves part (1) of the proposition. \qed 
END Proof
 
BEGIN Remark 2.3  
 From the above proof, we see that $A \mapsto C$ is, in fact, an exact functor for $A$ as in the proposition. Furthermore $\derived ^qp_2*$ gives the short exact sequence: $$\xymatrix @1{ 0 \ar [r] & A \ar [r] & C \ar [r] & \pi ^*\derived ^1\pi _*A \ar [r] & 0. } $$

 Every constructible sheaf $F$ on an affine variety $X$ is a subsheaf of a constructible sheaf $G$ on $X$ so that the induced homomorphism $\homology ^q(X,F)\to \homology ^q(X,G)$ is zero for all $q>0$.

 This proposition is by now well known; the conventional assumption ``$\mathcal {N}$= all Noetherian $R$-modules'' plays no role in the proof. It suffices to prove the assertion in the two cases:(i) $f$ is proper, and (ii) $f$ is an open immersion. \par When $f$ is proper, the proper base-change theorem, the existence of Whitney stratifications, and Thom's isotopy lemma (see \cite [page~41]{nori:GM}) together show that $\derived ^qf_*F$ is weakly constructible. By proper base-change, the stalk of this sheaf at $y \in Y(\C )$ coincides with $\homology ^q(f^{-1}y, F|f^{-1}y)$, which is an object of $\mathcal {N}$, by Proposition~1.6. Thus $\derived ^qf_*F$ is constructible. \par When $f$ is an open immersion, one chooses a Whitney stratification: $Y$= finite disjoint union of $Y_i$ so that $f_!F|Y_i$ is locally constant for all $i$. It follows that $\derived ^qf_*F|Y_i$ is locally constant, because we are in a ``product situation''. The links $L(p)$ (see \cite [page~41]{nori:GM}) being finite simplicial complexes, we're assured (e.g., by \cite [Prop.~8.1.4(ii)]{nori:KS}) that the stalks of $\derived ^qf_*F|Y_i$ are objects of $\mathcal {N}$. This completes the proof. \qed

 Both parts follow from Lemma~3.2(b). For (a), it is sufficient to show that every constructible $P$ is contained in a constructible $Q$ with $ \Hom _{Sh(X)}(F,Q) \to \Hom _{Sh(X)}(F[U],Q)$ surjective. Denoting by $j$ and $i$ the inclusions of $U$ and its complement $Y$ in $X$ respectively, the natural arrow $P \to Q=j_*j^*P \oplus i_*i^*P$ is a monomorphism that has the desired property because $ \Hom _{Sh(X)}(F[U], i_*i^*P)=0$ and $$ \Hom _{Sh(X)}(F[U], j_*j^*P )= \Hom _{Sh(X)}(F, j_*j^*P)= \Hom _{Sh(U)}(j^*F, j^*P). $$ That $Q$ is constructible has been shown in Proposition~3.4 above. \par \par For (b), consider the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence: $$\xymatrix { 0 \ar [r] & F[V \cap W] \ar [r] & F[V] \oplus F[W] \ar [r] & F[V \cup W] \ar [r] & 0. } $$ We obtain $Q$ from $P$ as in the proof of part (a) by putting $U=V \cap W$. The surjectivity of $\Hom _{Sh(X)}(F,Q) \to \Hom _{Sh(X)}(F[V \cap W],Q)$ certainly implies the surjectivity of $$ \Hom _{Sh(X)}(F[V],Q) \oplus \Hom _{Sh(X)}(F[W],Q) \to \Hom _{Sh(X)}(F[V \cap W],Q). $$ This completes the proof of the lemma. \qed

 We proceed by induction on the number $n$ of affine open subsets required to cover $U$. Now assume that $U$ is affine (the case: $n=1$). Corollary~2.4 says that $R_U$ is admissible in $Sh(U)$. It follows that $R_X[U]$ is admissible in $Sh(X)$ (see e.g., Remark~3.8(a)). For the general case, write $U=V \cup W$ where $V$ is covered by $n-1$ affine opens and $W$ is affine open. Because $X$ is separated, by Chevalley, $V \cap W$ is covered by $n-1$ affine open subsets in $X$, so we may assume the result for $V,W$ and $V \cap W$. The admissibility of $R_X[U]$ follows from Lemma~3.5(b). \qed

 [Avoiding the use of injective objects] Let $F: \mathcal {A} \to \nolinebreak \mathcal {B}$ and $G:\mathcal {B} \to \mathcal {A}$ be adjoint functors, viz., $$ \phi (A,B) :\Hom (FA,B) \to \Hom (A,GB) $$ for all objects $A$ of $\mathcal {A}$ and $B$ of $\mathcal {B}$, is an \emph {isomorphism} functorial in $A$ and $B$ (see \cite [Chapter~IV,~page~80]{nori:Mac}). Assume that $\mathcal {A}$ and $\mathcal {B}$ are Abelian categories, and that $F$ is left exact. Then it is standard (see \cite {nori:Toh}) that $G$ takes injectives to injectives. We will not assume that $\mathcal {B}$ possesses injective objects. We will observe instead that the left exactness of $F$ ensures: \par \emph {For every monomorphism} $u:GB \to A$, \emph {there is a monomorphism} \linebreak $v:B\to B'$ \emph {so that} $Gv:GB \to GB'$ \emph {factors through u, i.e. there is} $w:A \to GB'$ \emph {so that} $Gv=w \circ u$. \emph {In particular, if} $H: \mathcal {A} \to \mathcal {C}$ \emph {is effaceable, then} $H \circ G$ \emph {is also effaceable.} The $v:B \to B'$ is obtained simply as the push-out of the natural arrow $\epsilon (B): FGB \to B$ with the monomorphism $Fu:FGB \to FA$. Denote by $t:FA \to B'$ the resulting arrow. The $w$ is then obtained as $Gt\circ \eta (A)$ where $\eta (A):A \to GFA$ is the natural arrow. For the dfns of $\epsilon (B)$ and $\eta (A)$ see \cite [Thm.~1,~page~82]{nori:Mac}. The $(F,G)$ we are concerned with are: \begin {enumerate} \item [(a)] ($j_!$ ,$j^*$) where $j:U \to X$ is an open immersion and $\mathcal {A}=C(U)$ and $\mathcal {B}=C(X)$. In particular, the admissibility of $Q$ on $U$ implies the admissibility of $j_!Q$ on $X$. \par \item [(b)] ($f^*$ ,$f_*$) where $f:X \to Y$ is a morphism and $\mathcal {A}=C(Y)$ and $\mathcal {B}=\nolinebreak C(X)$. \par \item [(c)] ($P \otimes \cdot $ , $\HHom (P,\cdot )$).

 [of Theorem~3] We first assume that $F$ is projectively elementary. \par Let $L,U,V,F,j$ be as in the dfn of ``projectively elementary''. Because $L$ is a locally constant sheaf on a variety $U$ with all stalks finitely generated projective, we see that $\EExt ^q(L,D)=0$ for all $q>0$ and for all $D$ on $U$. The spectral sequence (see \cite [Thm.~4.2.1,~page~188]{nori:Toh}) shows that $\Ext ^q_{Sh(U)}(L,D)=\homology ^q(U,\HHom (L,D))$. From Theorem~2 and Remark~3.8(c), it follows that $L$ is admissible on $U$. Replacing $(L,U)$ by $(L|V,V)$ we see that that $L|V$ is admissible on $V$ as well. From Remark~3.8(a), we see that $L[V]$ is admissible on $U$. By Lemma~3.5(a), $L/L[V]$ is admissible on $U$. By Remark~3.8(a) once again, $F=j_!(L/L[V])$ is also admissible on $X$. \par Evidently, any direct summand of an admissible is admissible. The admissibility of $P$ as in Theorem~3(a) now follows from Proposition~3.10 and Corollary~3.3. \qed

From \cite {nori:Toh}, for every object $B$ of $\mathcal {B}$, we get the spectral sequence below, functorial in $B$: $$\mathrm {E}^{p,q}_2(B)=\Ext ^p_{\mathcal {A}}(A', \derived ^qGB) \Rightarrow \Ext ^{p+q}_{\mathcal {B}}(FA',B). $$ We put $f=f_0$ and $B'=B'_0$. The given $f_0$ belongs to $\mathrm {E}^{0,e}_2(B'_0)$. Its differential $\delta f_0$ belongs to $ \mathrm {E}^{2,{e-1}}_2(B'_0)$. By the induction hypothesis, there is a a monomorphism $B'_0 \to B'_1$ in $\mathcal {B'}$ that effaces $\derived ^{e-1}GB'_0$. Thus $B'_0 \to B'_1$ induces zero on $\mathrm {E}^{2,e-1}_2$. It follows that $\delta f_0 \mapsto 0$ under $B'_0 \to B'_1$. Denoting the image of $f_0$ in $\mathrm {E}^{0,e}_2(B'_1)$ by $f_1$ we see that $f_1 \in \mathrm {E}^{0,e}_3(B'_1) \subset \mathrm {E}^{0,e}_2(B'_1)$. Continuing in this manner, using the induction hypothesis alone, we obtain a chain of elements $f_i \in \mathrm {E}^{0,e}_{i+2}(B'_i)$ for $0 \leq i <e$ and monomorphisms $B'_i \to B'_{i+1}$ in $\mathcal {B'}$ for $0 \leq i < e-1$ that take $f_i$ to $f_{i+1}$. Note that this is meaningful because $\mathrm {E}^{0,e}_{i+3} \subset \mathrm {E}^{0,e}_{i+2}$. Next note that $$ \delta f_{e-1} \in \mathrm {E}^{e+1,0}_{e+1}(B'_{e-1}) =\Ext ^{e+1}_{\mathcal {A}}(A', GB'_{e-1}). $$ Assumptions (1) and (4), combined with Remark~3.8, imply that the functor $\Ext _{\mathcal {A}}^{e+1}(A', \cdot ) \circ G|\mathcal {B'}$ is effaceable. Thus we get a monomorphism $B'_{e-1} \to B'_e$ in $\mathcal {B'}$ that effaces $\Ext ^{e+1}_{\mathcal {A}}(A', B'_{e-1})$, and as before, this monomorphism takes $f_{e-1}$ to $f_e$ with $f_e \in \mathrm {E}^{0,e}_{e+2}(B'_e)= \mathrm {E}^{0,e}_{\infty }(B'_e)$. Finally, because $e>0$, by (2), there is a monomorphism $B'_e \to B'_{e+1}$ in $\mathcal {B'}$ that effaces $\Ext ^e_{\mathcal {B}}(FA',B'_e)$. Because $ \mathrm {E}^{0,e}_{\infty }(B'_e)$ is a quotient of $\Ext ^e(FA', B'_e)$, it follows that the induced homomorphism $\mathrm {E}^{0,e}_{\infty }(B'_e) \to \mathrm {E}^{0,e}_{\infty }(B'_{e+1})$ is zero. Consequently, $f_e \mapsto 0$ in $\Hom (A', \derived ^eGB'_e) \to \Hom (A', \derived ^e GB'_{e+1})$. It follows that $f \mapsto 0$ in $\Hom (A', \derived ^eGB') \to \Hom (A', \derived ^e GB'_{e+1})$. This proves our claim. \par Now let $f$ be the identity homomorphism of $ \derived ^eGB'$. The theorem follows. \qed

 [of Theorem~4] Given a morphism $f:X \to Y$, we substitute $$ (f^*,f_*, Sh(Y), C(Y),Sh(X),C(X))= (F,G, \mathcal {A}, \mathcal {A'}, \mathcal {B}, \mathcal {B'}) $$ in Theorem~3.11. The assumptions (1) and (2) of Theorem~3.11 are valid by Theorem~3(b); assumption (3) is valid by Proposition~3.4, and assumption (4) is evident. So Theorem~4 is a consequence of Theorem~3.11. \qed

 [of Theorem~5] Once again, we apply Theorem~3.11 to $$ \mathcal {A}=\mathcal {B}=Sh(X),\ \mathcal {A'}=\mathcal {B'}=C(X), \mbox { and } (F,G)= (P \otimes \cdot \;, \HHom (P,\cdot )), $$ for any constructible sheaf $P$ on $X$. To check that the assumptions of Theorem~3.11 are valid, it remains to show that $\EExt ^q(P,Q)$ is constructible if both $P$ and $Q$ are constructible. By Proposition~3.10, it suffices to check this for $P=j_!L$ where $L$ is locally constant on $U$ and $j:U \to X$ denotes the inclusion. But $\EExt ^q(j_!L,Q)=\derived ^q j_*\HHom (L,j^*Q)$ which is constructible by Proposition~3.4. This completes the proof of Theorem~5. \qed

 [of Proposition~3.10] Let $F$ be a weakly constructible sheaf on a quasi-projective variety $X$. Let dim.supp.$F=d$. We will first find Zariski open $V \subset U\subset X$, a locally constant sheaf $L$ on $U$, and an isomorphism of $F|U$ with a direct summand of $L/L[V]$ (see 3.1 and 3.9 for notation). \par Let $Z_1$ be the support of $F$. Let $Z_2$ be the union of all the $d$-dimensional irreducible components of $Z_1$. Let $Z_3$ be the largest Zariski open subset of $Z_2$ so that $F|Z_3$ is locally constant. Let $U' \subset X$ be an affine open subset so that $U'\cap Z_1 = U' \cap Z_3$ and $U' \cap Z_3$ is Zariski dense in $Z_3$. Choose a finite surjective morphism $ U'\cap Z_1 \to \A ^d$ and extend it to a morphism $h':U' \to \A ^d$. Let $W \subset \A ^d$ be non-empty Zariski open. Put $U={h'}^{-1}W$, $Z=U \cap Z_1$ and $V=U-Z$. Denote the restriction of $h'$ to $U$ by $h:U \to W$. Put $f=h|Z:Z \to W$. The sheaf $G=F|Z$ is locally constant by assumption. The $W$ is chosen so that $f:Z \to W$ is an etale morphism (note that $f$ is already assumed to be a finite morphism); this ensures that $f_*G$ is locally constant. It follows that $L=h^*f_*G$ is also a locally constant sheaf. Note that $f^*f_*G=L|Z$ has $G$ as a direct summand because $f$ is etale. Denoting by $i:Z \to U$ the inclusion, we see that $i_*G=F|U$ is a direct summand of $i_*(L|Z)=L/L[V]$. \par From the above, we see that $F[U]$ is a direct summand of an elementary sheaf. Put $QF=F/F[U]$. Because dim.supp.$QF<d$, induction on dim.supp.$F$ proves the proposition with the length of the desired filtration bounded above by 1+dim.supp.$F$, when $X$ is quasi-projective. In the general case, one proceeds by Noetherian induction, replacing the hypothesis `` $U' \cap Z_3$ is Zariski dense in $Z_3$'' by `` $U' \cap Z_3$ is non-empty''. \qed
