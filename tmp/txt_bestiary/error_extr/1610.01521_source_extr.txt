BEGIN Proof 
 We proceed by induction on $|S|$ where the base case $|S|\leq \left ({\min _{x\in P}\mathbb {P}\left (x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )}\right )^{-1}$ is trivial. Given $w\in S$, we define $d_S^+(w)$ to be the number of arcs $(w,z)\in E(D)$ with $z\in S$. Suppose that there exists $w\in S$ with $d^+_S(w)\geq \left ({\max _{(x,y)\in E(D)}\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )}\right )^{-1}$. In this case, we apply the inductive hypothesis to $S\setminus \{w\}$ to obtain at least \[\left ({\max _{(x,y)\in E(D)}\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )}\right )^{-1}\left (|S\setminus \{w\}|- \left ({\min _{x\in P}\mathbb {P}\left (x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )}\right )^{-1}\right ).\] comparable pairs in $S$ which do not involve $w$. We then obtain the desired bound on $\comp (S)$ by considering these comparable pairs along with those of the form $(w,z)\in E(D)$ with $z\in S$. Thus, we may assume that every $w\in S$ satisfies \begin {equation}\label {outdeg}d_S^+(w)< \left ({\max _{(x,y)\in E(D)}\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )}\right )^{-1}.\end {equation} The chain $\mathcal {C}_\mu $ contains precisely $|\mathcal {C}_\mu \cap S|$ elements of $S$ and $\binom {|\mathcal {C}_\mu \cap S|}{2}$ of the comparable pairs of $S$ (since every pair in $\mathcal {C}_\mu $ is comparable). Since $k-\binom {k}{2}\leq 1$ for all $k$, we get that \[1\geq \mathbb {E}\left (|\mathcal {C}_\mu \cap S| - \binom {|\mathcal {C}_\mu \cap S|}{2}\right ) =\sum _{w\in S}\mathbb {P}\left (w\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right ) - \sum _{\substack {w,z\in S \\ (w,z)\in E(D)}}\mathbb {P}\left (w,z\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\] \[=\sum _{w\in S}\mathbb {P}\left (w\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\left (1-\sum _{\substack {z\in S\\ (w,z)\in E(D)}}\mathbb {P}\left (z\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid w\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\right )\] \[\geq \sum _{w\in S}\mathbb {P}\left (w\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\left (1-d^+_S(w){\max _{(x,y)\in E(D)}\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )}\right ).\] By \eqref {outdeg}, all of the summands are positive, and so this expression is bounded below by \[\sum _{w\in S}\left ({\min _{x\in P}\mathbb {P}\left (x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )}\right )\left (1-d^+_S(w){\max _{(x,y)\in E(D)}\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )}\right ).\] Rearranging, we obtain \[\comp (S) = \sum _{w\in S}d_S^+(w) \geq \left ({\max _{(x,y)\in E(D)}\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )}\right )^{-1}\left (|S| - \left ({\min _{x\in P}\mathbb {P}\left (x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )}\right )^{-1}\right )\] as desired.

BEGIN Proof 
 For $0\leq r\leq k-1$, let $P_r$ be the poset consisting all subsets of $[n]$ of cardinality equivalent to $\left \lceil \frac {n-k+1+2r}{2}\right \rceil $ modulo $k$ ordered by inclusion (the idea of splitting the levels of $\mathcal {P}(n)$ into equivalence classes modulo $k$ is also used by Collares Neto and Morris~\cite {RandomErdos}). Note that $P_0\cup \dots \cup P_{k-1}$ partitions $\mathcal {P}(n)$. Define $S_r:=S\cap P_{r}$ and \[t_r:=|S_r| - \binom {n}{\left \lceil \frac {n-k+1+2r}{2}\right \rceil }.\] Clearly, $\sum _{r=0}^{k-1}t_r = t$. Our goal is to show that, for $0\leq r\leq k-1$, the following holds: \begin {equation}\label {theEllCase}\comp (S_r)\geq t_r\binom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k}.\end {equation} This will imply the result since $\comp (S)\geq \sum _{r=0}^{k-1}\comp (S_r)$. \par Let $r\in \{0,\dots ,k-1\}$ be fixed. We prove \eqref {theEllCase} by induction on $t_r$. Note that \eqref {theEllCase} holds trivially if $t_r\leq 0$. Now, for $t_r\geq 1$, if $S_r$ contains an element $x$ which is comparable to at least $\binom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k}$ elements of $S_r$, then we apply the induction hypothesis to find at least $(t_r-1)\binom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k}$ comparable pairs in $S_r\setminus \{x\}$ and we are done. Therefore, we can assume that there is no such $x\in S_r$. \par Next, we show that we can assume that $S$ does not contain any extremely small sets. Let $s\in \{0,\dots ,k-1\}$ so that $\left \lceil \frac {n-k+1+2r}{2}\right \rceil \equiv s\bmod k$. Let $X$ be the set of all elements of $S_r$ of cardinality $s$. Suppose that $X\neq \emptyset $ and for each $x\in X$ let $N_{k+s}(x)$ be the elements of $P_r\setminus S_r$ of cardinality $k+s$ which are comparable to $x$. By the result of the previous paragraph, $x$ is comparable to fewer than $\binom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k}$ elements of $S_r$ and so \[|N_{k+s}(x)|> \binom {n-s}{k} - \binom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k} \geq \binom {n-k+1}{k}-\binom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k}\] which, if $n_0(k)$ is chosen large enough with respect to $k$, is at least \[\binom {n}{k-1} \geq \binom {n}{s} \geq |X|.\] Therefore, we can greedily associate each element $x$ of $X$ to an element $y_x$ of $P_r\setminus S_r$ of cardinality $k+s$ such that $x$ is comparable to $y_x$ and the $y_x$ are distinct from one another. It is clear that the set $S_r':=(S_r\setminus X)\cup \{y_x: x\in X\}$ has the same cardinality as $S_r$ and at most as many comparable pairs as $S_r$. So, in what follows, we can assume that $X=\emptyset $; that is, every element of $S_r$ has cardinality at least $k+s$. \par Now, define $P_r^*$ to be the poset obtained from $P_r$ by deleting all sets of cardinality $s$. Let $D$ be a digraph with $V(D)=P_r^*$ containing every arc $(x,y)$ where either \begin {itemize} \item $x$ and $y$ are comparable and the cardinality of $y$ is closer to $n/2$ than the cardinality of $x$, or \item $x<y$ and $|x| = n-|y|$. \end {itemize} Let $\mathcal {C}_\mu $ be a random chain in $P_r^*$ obtained by taking a maximal chain in $\mathcal {P}(n)$ uniformly at random and intersecting it with $P_r^*$. Then any two elements of $P_r^*$ of the same cardinality are equally likely to be contained in $\mathcal {C}_\mu $ and so \[\mathbb {P}\left (x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\geq \binom {n}{\left \lceil \frac {n-k+1+2r}{2}\right \rceil }^{-1}\text { for all $x\in P_r^*$}.\] Also, given $(x,y)\in E(D)$, we have \[\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right ) =\begin {cases} \binom {|x|}{|y|}^{-1} & \text {if $x>y$},\\ \binom {n-|x|}{|y|-|x|}^{-1}& \text {otherwise}. \end {cases} \] By definition of $D$ and the fact that $X=\emptyset $, we get that this quantity is always at most $\binom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k}^{-1}$. Thus, \eqref {theEllCase} holds by Lemma~\ref {randomCount}.

 [Proof of Theorem~\ref {vecSpThm}] For $0\leq r\leq k-1$, let $P_r$ be the poset consisting all subspaces of $\mathbb {F}_q^n$ of dimension equivalent to $\left \lceil \frac {n-k+1+2r}{2}\right \rceil $ modulo $k$ ordered by inclusion. Analogous to the proof of Theorem~\ref {booleanThm}, we define $S_r:=S\cap P_{r}$ and \[t_r:=|S_r| - \qbinom {n}{\left \lceil \frac {n-k+1+2r}{2}\right \rceil }{q}.\] Clearly, $\sum _{r=0}^{k-1}t_r = t$. Our goal is to prove that, for each $r=0,\dots ,k-1$, \begin {equation}\label {theEllCaseVec}\comp (S_r)\geq t_r\qbinom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k}{q}.\end {equation} \par We prove \eqref {theEllCaseVec} by induction on $t_r$ where the case $t_r\leq 0$ is trivial. By the inductive hypothesis, we can assume that every element of $S_r$ is comparable to fewer than $\qbinom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k}{q}$ other elements of $S_r$. If $S_r$ contains an element of dimension $s<k$, then we can shift all such elements up to subspaces of dimension $k+s$ without increasing the number of comparable pairs (as in the proof of Theorem~\ref {booleanThm}) since \[\qbinom {n-k+1}{k}{q} - \qbinom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k}{q} \geq \qbinom {n}{k-1}{q}\] if $n_0(k)$ is chosen large enough with respect to $k$. \par Now, we let $P_r^*$ be the poset obtained from $P_r$ by deleting all elements of dimension less than $k$ and let $D$ be a digraph with $V(D)=P_r^*$ containing every arc $(x,y)$ such that either \begin {itemize} \item $x$ is comparable to $y$ and the dimension of $y$ is closer to $n/2$ than the dimension of $x$, or \item $x<y$ and the dimension of $x$ is $n$ minus the dimension of $y$. \end {itemize} Let $\mathcal {C}_\mu $ be a uniformly random chain in $P_r^*$ obtained by taking a random maximal chain in $\Vectors {q}{n}$ and intersecting it with $P_r^*$. It is not hard to show that \[\mathbb {P}\left (x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\geq \qbinom {n}{\left \lceil \frac {n-k+1+2r}{2}\right \rceil }{q}^{-1}\text { for all $x\in P_r^*$ and}\] \[\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\leq \qbinom {\left \lceil (n+k)/2\right \rceil }{k}{q}^{-1}\text { for all $(x,y)\in E(D)$.}\] The result follows.

BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem~\ref {multisetThm} assuming Lemma~\ref {conditionalProb}] For $0\leq r\leq k-1$, let $P_r$ be the poset consisting all elements of $\{0,1,2\}^n$ of rank equivalent to $n+\left \lceil \frac {2r-k+1}{2}\right \rceil $ modulo $k$ with partial order inherited from $\{0,1,2\}^n$. Define $S_r:=S\cap P_{r}$ and \[t_r:=|S_r| - \ell _{n+\left \lceil \frac {2r-k+1}{2}\right \rceil }(n).\] Clearly, $\sum _{r=0}^{k-1}t_r = t$. We prove that, for each $r=0,\dots ,k-1$, \begin {equation}\label {theEllCaseMulti}\comp (S_r)\geq \left (\frac {\ell _{3k-1}(n)}{\ell _{2k-1}(n)} - 1\right )t_r.\end {equation} \par We prove \eqref {theEllCaseMulti} by induction on $t_r$ where the case $t_r\leq 0$ is trivial. By the inductive hypothesis, we can assume that every element of $S_r$ is comparable to fewer than $\frac {\ell _{3k-1}(n)}{\ell _{2k-1}(n)} - 1$ other elements of $S_r$. \par Next, we prove that it suffices to consider the case that $S_r$ contains no elements of rank less than $2k$. First, let $A$ be the set of all elements of $S_r$ of rank less than $k$. Clearly, each element of $A$ has rank $r$. Let us show that we can assume that $A$ is empty. For each subset $T$ of $A$, let $\Gamma (T)$ denote the elements of $L_{r+k}$ comparable to at least one member of $T$. If we had $|\Gamma (T)\setminus S_{r}|\geq |T|$ for every subset $T$ of $A$, then by Hall's Marriage Theorem~\cite {Hall} we could associate each element of $x\in A$ to an element $f(x)$ of $L_{r+k}\setminus S_{r}$ such that $x<f(x)$ and the function $f$ is injective. Given such a function $f$, it is clear that the set $S':=\left (S_r\setminus A\right )\cup f(A)$ has the same cardinality as $S_r$ and at most as many comparable pairs as $S_r$. \par Thus, we suppose that no such $f$ exists and so there there must be a set $T\subseteq A$ such that $|\Gamma (T)\setminus S_{r}| < |T|$. Since $\{0,1,2\}^n$ has the normalised matching property, we have \[\frac {|\Gamma (T)\cap S_r|}{|T|} =\frac {|\Gamma (T)|}{|T|}- \frac {|\Gamma (T)\setminus S_r|}{|T|} > \frac {|L_{r+k}|}{|L_r|} -1\] which is at least $\frac {\ell _{3k-1}(n)}{\ell _{2k-1}(n)}-1$ by Theorem~\ref {logConcave}. Putting these two facts together, we have \begin {equation}\label {gammaT}|\Gamma (T)\cap S_r| > \left (\frac {\ell _{3k-1}(n)}{\ell _{2k-1}(n)}-1\right )|T|.\end {equation} So, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be some element of $T$ which is comparable to more than $\frac {\ell _{3k-1}(n)}{\ell _{2k-1}(n)}-1$ elements of $S_r$, which is a contradiction. Thus, $S_r$ contains no elements of rank less than $k$. Applying the same argument to the elements of $S_r$ of rank $r+k$ (and using the fact that $S_r$ has no elements of rank $r$, which we just proved), we get that $S_r$ contains no elements of rank less than $2k$. \par \par Now, we let $P_r^*$ be the poset obtained from $P_r$ by deleting all elements of rank less than $2k$. By the above argument, we can assume $S_r\subseteq P_r^*$. Let $D$ be a digraph with $V(D)=P_r^*$ containing every arc $(x,y)$ such that \begin {itemize} \item $x$ is comparable to $y$ and the rank of $y$ is closer to $n$ than the rank of $x$, or \item $x<y$ and the rank of $x$ is $2n$ minus the rank of $y$. \end {itemize} Let $\mathcal {C}_\mu $ be a random chain in $P_r^*$ obtained by taking a random chain in $\{0,1,2\}^n$ chosen according to $\mu $ and intersecting it with $P_r^*$. Provided that $n_0(k)$ is sufficiently large, the theorem now follows from Lemmas~\ref {randomCount} and~\ref {conditionalProb}.

BEGIN Proposition \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 Define a weighting of the elements of $L_{i+1}$ by first assigning weight one to each element of $L_i$ and then redistributing the weight so that, for $0\leq s\leq \left \lfloor i/2\right \rfloor $, each $x\in L_i^s$ sends weight $|L_i|w_{i,s}'$ to each $y\in L_{i+1}^s$ comparable to $x$ and weight $|L_i|w_{i,s}$ to each $y\in L_{i+1}^{s+1}$ comparable to $x$. By construction of the weight functions $w_{i,s}$ and $w_{i,s}'$ we see that, after redistributing, each element of $L_i$ has weight zero and each element of $L_{i+1}$ has weight $|L_i|/|L_{i+1}|$. \par Now, we define a second weighting of $L_{i+1}$ by assigning each element of $L_i$ weight one and redistributing the weight so that each element of $L_i^s$ sends its weight evenly to the elements of $L_{i+1}$ comparable to it. Under this weighting, each $y\in L_{i+1}^s$ receives weight \[f(s):=\frac {s}{n+1-s} + \frac {i+1-2s}{n-s}.\] We claim that $f(s)$ is strictly decreasing in $s$ for $s$ in the range $0\leq s\leq \frac {i+1}{2}$. Indeed, for $0\leq s\leq \frac {i-1}{2}$, we have \begin {align*} f(s+1)-f(s) &= \left (\frac {s+1}{n-s} + \frac {i-2s-1}{n-s-1}\right )-\left (\frac {s}{n-s+1} + \frac {i-2s+1}{n-s}\right )\\ &= \frac {s(n-i-2) - (n-i)(n+1)}{(n-s+1)(n-s)(n-s-1)}=\frac {(n-i)(s-n-1)-2s}{(n-s+1)(n-s)(n-s-1)}.\end {align*} The denominator is always positive for $0\leq s\leq \frac {n-2}{2}$. If $i\in \{n-2,n-1\}$, then the numerator is clearly negative. Finally, if $1\leq i\leq n-3$, then the numerator is again negative since $0\leq s\leq \frac {i-1}{2} \leq \frac {n-2}{2}<n+1$ and $n-i-2<n-i$. Thus, $f(s)$ is strictly decreasing in $s$. \par Therefore, for $0\leq s\leq \frac {i-1}{2}$, the elements of $L_{i+1}^{\leq s}$ receive more weight on average under the second weighting than do the elements of $L_{i+1}^{\geq s+1}$. Note that, under both redistribution rules, all of the weight from $L_i^{\leq s-1}$ is sent to $L_{i+1}^{\leq s}$ and all of the weight from $L_i^{\geq s+1}$ is sent to $L_{i+1}^{\geq s+1}$. Therefore, the amount of weight received by the elements of $L_{i+1}^{\geq s+1}$ versus the amount received by elements of $L_{i+1}^{\leq s}$ is only affected by the amount of weight that the elements of $L_i^s$ choose to send to $L_{i+1}^s$ and $L_{i+1}^{s+1}$. As we have mentioned, the first redistribution rule assigns each element of $L_{i+1}$ to the same weight while the second assigns more weight to elements of $L_{i+1}$ which have fewer coordinates equal to two. Putting this all together, it must be the case that, under the first redistribution rule, each $x\in L_{i}^s$ sends more weight to each element of $L_{i+1}^{s+1}$ comparable to it than it sends to each element of $L_{i+1}^{s}$ comparable to it. This proves that $w_{i,s}' < w_{i,s}$.

BEGIN Proof 
 If there is an integer $s$ such that $0\leq s<\frac {i}{2}$ and \begin {equation} \begin {gathered} \label {j0def} 2\left |L_i\right |s(s+1)(n-i+s) (n-i+s+1) \\ \leq (i-2s-1)(i-2s)(i-2s+1)\left ((i+1)|L_{i+1}| - (n-i+s +1)|L_i|\right ), \end {gathered} \end {equation} then we let $s_0$ be the largest such integer. Otherwise, set $s_0:=0$. Note that both sides of \eqref {j0def} are non-negative for all $s$ such that $0\leq s< \frac {i}{2}$, where Lemma~\ref {ratio1} is used to verify that the right side is non-negative. If $s_0\geq 1$, then the inequality \eqref {j0def} must hold for all $0\leq i\leq n-1$ and $s$ such that $0\leq s\leq s_0$ and must fail to hold for all $s$ such that $s_0+1\leq s< \frac {i}{2}$; this is because, for fixed $0\leq i\leq n-1$ and $s$ in the range $0\leq s<\frac {i}{2}$, the left side of \eqref {j0def} is increasing in $s$ and the right side is decreasing in $s$. \par By \eqref {wExpression}, the inequality $w_{i,s}\leq \frac {2}{(i+1)\left |L_{i+1}\right |}$ can be rewritten as follows: \[(i+1)\left (\left |L_i\right |\left |L_{i+1}^{\geq s+1}\right | - \left |L_{i+1}\right |\left |L_i^{\geq s+1}\right |\right ) \leq 2\left |L_i^s\right |\left |L_i\right |(i-2s)\] or, equivalently, \begin {equation}\label {equiv}\left |L_i\right |\left ((i+1)\left |L_{i+1}^{\geq s+1}\right | - 2(i-2s)\left |L_i^s\right |\right )\leq \left |L_{i+1}\right |(i+1)\left |L_i^{\geq s+1}\right |.\end {equation} Our goal is to prove that \eqref {equiv} holds for $0\leq s< \frac {i}{2}$. The argument will either use induction on $s$ or induction on $\left \lfloor \frac {i}{2}\right \rfloor - s$ depending on whether $s\leq s_0$ or $s\geq s_0+1$. Before proving the case $s\leq s_0$, though, we need to verify the `base case' $s=0$. \par \par \begin {case2} \label {j=0} $s=0$. \end {case2} In this case, \eqref {equiv} becomes \[\left |L_i\right |\left ((i+1)\left |L_{i+1}\right | - (i+1)\left |L_{i+1}^0\right | - 2i\left |L_i^0\right |\right )\leq \left |L_{i+1}\right |(i+1)\left (\left |L_i\right | - \left |L_i^0\right |\right ).\] Since $(i+1)\left |L_{i+1}^0\right |= (i+1)\binom {n}{i+1} = (n-i)\binom {n}{i}=(n-i)\left |L_i^0\right |$, this simplifies to \begin {equation}\label {notTooBig}(i+1)\left |L_{i+1}\right |\leq (n+i)\left |L_i\right |.\end {equation} To prove \eqref {notTooBig}, we observe that each element of $L_i^r$ is comparable to $n-r$ elements of $L_{i+1}$ and each element of $L_{i+1}^r$ comparable to $i+1-r$ elements of $L_i$. Therefore, \[\sum _{r=0}^{\left \lfloor \frac {i+1}{2}\right \rfloor }(i+1-r)\left |L_{i+1}^r\right | = \sum _{r=0}^{\left \lfloor \frac {i}{2}\right \rfloor }(n-r)\left |L_{i}^r\right |.\] This equality can be rewritten as follows: \[(i+1)\left |L_{i+1}\right | - \sum _{r=0}^{\left \lfloor \frac {i+1}{2}\right \rfloor }r\left |L_{i+1}^r\right | = (n+i)\left |L_i\right | - \sum _{r=0}^{\left \lfloor \frac {i}{2}\right \rfloor }(i+r)\left |L_{i}^r\right |.\] So, after a change of index, we see that \eqref {notTooBig} is equivalent to \[\sum _{r=0}^{\left \lfloor \frac {i}{2}\right \rfloor }(i+r)\left |L_i^r\right | \geq \sum _{r=0}^{\left \lfloor \frac {i-1}{2}\right \rfloor }(r+1)\left |L_{i+1}^{r+1}\right |.\] For $0\leq r\leq \left \lfloor \frac {i-1}{2}\right \rfloor $ we have \begin {align*} (i+r)\left |L_i^r\right | &= (i+r)\binom {n}{i-r}\binom {i-r}{r} = \frac {(i+r) \left |L_{i+1}^{r+1}\right |\binom {i-r}{r}}{\binom {i-r}{r+1}}\\ &=\frac {(i+r)(r+1)}{i-2r}\left |L_{i+1}^{r+1}\right |\geq (r+1)\left |L_{i+1}^{r+1}\right |\end {align*} and so \eqref {notTooBig} holds. This completes the proof in this case. \par \begin {case2} $1\leq s\leq s_0$. \end {case2} \par We can assume, by induction and the previous case, that \eqref {equiv} is true if $s$ is replaced by $s-1$. That is, we assume that the following inequality is true: \[\left |L_i\right |\left ((i+1)\left |L_{i+1}^{\geq s}\right | - 2(i-2s+2)\left |L_i^{s-1}\right |\right )\leq \left |L_{i+1}\right |(i+1)\left |L_i^{\geq s}\right |.\] Subtracting this inequality from \eqref {equiv}, we see that it suffices to prove that \[\left |L_i\right |\left ((i+1)\left |L_{i+1}^{s+1}\right | - 2(i-2s)\left |L_i^s\right | + 2(i-2s+2)\left |L_i^{s-1}\right |\right ) \] \[\leq \left |L_{i+1}\right |(i+1)\left |L_i^{s+1}\right |.\] After substituting the values of $\left |L_{i+1}^{s+1}\right |$, $\left |L_i^s\right |$, $\left |L_i^{s-1}\right |$ and $\left |L_i^{s+1}\right |$ into the above inequality, it becomes \[\left |L_i\right |\left ((i+1)\binom {n}{i-s}\binom {i-s}{s+1} - 2(i-2s)\binom {n}{i-s}\binom {i-s}{s} + 2(i-2s+2)\binom {n}{i-s+1}\binom {i-s+1}{s-1}\right )\] \[\leq \left |L_{i+1}\right |(i+1)\binom {n}{i-s-1}\binom {i-s-1}{s+1}.\] By simplifying this expression, one can show that it is in fact equivalent to \eqref {j0def}, which holds for $s$ because $s\leq s_0$. This completes the proof in this case. \par \begin {case2} $s_0+1\leq s< \frac {i}{2}$. \end {case2} \par In the case that $i$ is odd and $s=\frac {i-1}{2}$ we have $w_{i,s}=\frac {2}{(i+1)\left |L_{i+1}\right |}$ by definition and so the result holds with equality. If $i$ is even and $s=\frac {i-2}{2}$, then $w_{i,s} = \frac {2}{i|L_{i+1}|} - \frac {4}{(2n-i)|L_{i}|}$ by \eqref {wExpression}. In this case, the bound $w_{i,s}\leq \frac {2}{(i+1)\left |L_{i+1}\right |}$ reduces to the following: \[(2n-i)|L_i|\leq 2(i+1)|L_{i+1}|.\] Since $1\leq i\leq n-1$, this inequality holds by Lemmas~\ref {ratio1},~\ref {ration-2} and~\ref {ration-1}. \par So, we are done unless $s_0< s < \frac {i}{2}-1$. We can assume, by induction on $\left \lfloor \frac {i}{2}\right \rfloor -s$, that \eqref {equiv} is true if $s$ is replaced by $s+1$. That is, we assume that the following inequality holds: \[\left |L_i\right |\left ((i+1)\left |L_{i+1}^{\geq s+2}\right | - 2(i-2s-2)\left |L_i^{s+1}\right |\right )\leq \left |L_{i+1}\right |(i+1)\left |L_i^{\geq s+2}\right |.\] Similar to the proof of the previous case, we can derive \eqref {equiv} from the above inequality provided that we can prove the following: \[\left |L_i\right |\left ((i+1)\left |L_{i+1}^{s+2}\right | - 2(i-2s-2)\left |L_i^{s+1}\right | + 2(i-2s)\left |L_i^s\right |\right )\] \[> \left |L_{i+1}\right |(i+1)\left |L_i^{s+2}\right |.\] Simplifying this expression in a similar fashion to the proof of the previous case, we see that it is equivalent to the following inequality: \[2\left |L_i\right |(s+1)(s+2)(n-i+s+1)(n-i+s+2)\] \[> (i-2s-3)(i-2s-2)(i-2s-1)\left ((i+1)\left |L_{i+1}\right | - (n-i+s+2)\left |L_i\right |\right ).\] This is precisely the negation of \eqref {j0def} with $s$ is replaced by $s+1$. This inequality holds because $s>s_0$ and $s_0$ was chosen to be the largest index satisfying \eqref {j0def}. This completes the proof of the proposition.

BEGIN Proof 
 Suppose to the contrary that there is a coordinate $\alpha \in [n]$ such that $x_\alpha =0$ and $y_\alpha =2$ and a coordinate $\beta \in [n]$ with $x_\beta =y_\beta =1$. Let $\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }:\{0,1,2\}^n\to \{0,1,2\}^n$ be the function which exchanges the $\alpha $th coordinate with the $\beta $th coordinate. Note that $x<\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }(y)$. Our goal is to show that \[\mathbb {P}\left (\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }(y)\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )> \mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\] which will contradict our choice of $x$ and $y$. \par \par Given a sequence $Z=(z_i,\dots ,z_{2n-i})$ of elements of $\{0,1,2\}^n$ with $z_i<\dots <z_{2n-i}$, $z_i=x$ and $z_{2n-i}=y$ define $\ell (Z)$ to be the smallest integer $\ell $ such that the $\alpha $th coordinate of $z_\ell $ is a two. For every such sequence, define another sequence $\pi (Z)$ as follows: \[\pi (Z):=\left (z_i,\dots ,z_{\ell (Z)-1},\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }\left (z_{\ell (Z)}\right ),\dots ,\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }\left (z_{2n-i}\right )\right ).\] Notice that $\pi (Z)$ is a chain starting with $x$ and ending at $\pi _{\alpha ,\beta }(y)$. It is not hard to see that the function $\pi $ is injective. Now, the key observation is that, by construction of $\mathcal {C}_\mu $, for any such sequence $Z$, we have \[\mathbb {P}\left (z_{i+1},\dots ,z_{2n-i}\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z_i\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\] \[ =\mathbb {P}\left (z_{i+1},\dots ,z_{\ell (Z)-1},\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }\left (z_{\ell (Z)}\right ),\dots ,\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }\left (z_{2n-i}\right )\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z_i\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right ).\] This proves $\mathbb {P}\left (\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }(y)\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\geq \mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )$ since $\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )$ is equal to the sum over all such sequences of $\mathbb {P}\left (z_{i+1},\dots ,z_{2n-i}\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z_i\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )$. In order to prove the strict inequality, all that we need is a single chain containing $x$ and $\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }(y)$ which is not a subsequence of one of the chains $\pi (Z)$ for $Z$ as above. Any chain of the form $x<z<\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }(y)$ with $z_\beta =2$ has this property. This completes the proof of the claim.

BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Lemma~\ref {conditionalProb}] Let $k\geq 1$ be a fixed integer and let $n$ be sufficiently large with respect to $k$. Let $i,j$ be integers satisfying the hypotheses of the lemma. Note that, by the symmetry of $\mu $ around level $n$ (i.e. by equations \eqref {sym1} and \eqref {sym2}), we can assume that $i<n$. The assumption $|j-n|\leq |i-n|$ can therefore be rewritten as $i<j$ and $i+j\leq 2n$. \par \begin {case4} \label {smallGap} $k\leq j-i\leq 11n/10$. \end {case4} \par It is clear that $\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )$ is equal to the sum of $\mathbb {P}\left (z_{i+1},\dots ,z_{j}\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z_i\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )$ over all sequences $z_i<z_{i+1}<\dots <z_{j}$ such that $z_i=x$ and $z_{j}=y$. The number of such sequences is clearly bounded above by $(j-i)!$ and, for every such sequence, we have \[\mathbb {P}\left (z_{i+1},\dots ,z_{j}\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z_i\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right ) = \prod _{r=i}^{j-1}\mathbb {P}\left (z_{r+1}\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z_r\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\] by \eqref {memoryless}. For $i\leq r\leq n-1$, we have that $\mathbb {P}\left (z_{r+1}\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z_r\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right ) \leq \frac {2|L_i|}{(i+1)|L_{i+1}|}\leq \frac {2}{n}$ by Corollary~\ref {OneStep} and Lemmas~\ref {ratio1},~\ref {ration-2} and~\ref {ration-1} and for $n\leq r\leq j-1$ we have $\mathbb {P}\left (z_{r+1}\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z_r\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right ) \leq \frac {2}{2n-r}$ by Corollary~\ref {OneStep}. Since $i+j\leq 2n$, we have that $i\leq n-\frac {j-i}{2}$ and so we get \begin {align*} \mathbb {P}\left (z_{i+1},\dots ,z_{j}\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z_i\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )& \leq \left (\frac {2}{n}\right )^{\left \lceil (j-i)/2\right \rceil }\frac {2^{\left \lfloor (j-i)/2\right \rfloor }}{n(n-1)\cdots (n-\left \lfloor (j-i)/2\right \rfloor + 1)}\\ & = \frac {2^{j-i} (n-\left \lfloor (j-i)/2\right \rfloor )!}{n^{\left \lceil (j-i)/2\right \rceil }n!}.\end {align*} As mentioned earlier, the number of such sequences is at most $(j-i)!$ and so we obtain \begin {equation}\label {j-iBound}\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right ) \leq \frac {2^{j-i} (j-i)!(n-\left \lfloor (j-i)/2\right \rfloor )!}{n^{\left \lceil (j-i)/2\right \rceil }n!}.\end {equation} In the case $j-i=k$, the right side is at most $2^{k}\binom {n}{k}^{-1}$ which, by \eqref {ratioAsymp} and the fact that $\frac {\ell _2(n)}{\ell _1(n)} - 1 = \frac {n-1}{2}$, is less than $\left (\frac {\ell _{3k-1}(n)}{\ell _{2k-1}(n)} - 1\right )^{-1}$ for $n_0(k)$ sufficiently large and so we are done. Also, the right side is decreasing in $j-i$ for $k\leq j-i\leq n/10$ and so we are done for $j-i$ in this range as well. \par So, we assume that $n/10 < j-i \leq 11n/10$. If we define $c:=\frac {j-i}{n}$, then \eqref {j-iBound} can be rewritten as \[\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right ) \leq \frac {2^{cn} (cn)!(n-\left \lfloor cn/2\right \rfloor )!}{n^{\left \lceil cn/2\right \rceil }n!}.\] Applying Stirling's Approximation, we see that the right side is bounded above by \[O\left (\frac {\sqrt {n} 2^{cn}\left (\frac {cn}{e}\right )^{cn}\left (\frac {n(1-c/2)}{e}\right )^{n(1-c/2)}}{n^{cn/2} \left (\frac {n}{e}\right )^n}\right )= O\left (\sqrt {n}\left (\frac {\left (2c\right )^{c}\left (1-c/2\right )}{e^{c/2}(1-c/2)^{c/2}}\right )^n\right ).\] Notice that $\frac {\left (2c\right )^{c}\left (1-c/2\right )}{e^{c/2}(1-c/2)^{c/2}}<0.99$ for $1/10 < c \leq 11/10$ and so the above expression decreases exponentially with $n$ and therefore is less than $\left (\frac {\ell _{3k-1}(n)}{\ell _{2k-1}(n)} - 1\right )^{-1}$ for $n_0(k)$ sufficiently large. This completes the proof in this case. \par \begin {case4} \label {bigSymmetricGap} $i+j=2n$ and $i < 9n/20$. \end {case4} \par In this case, we suppose further that the pair $(x,y)$ is chosen from $L_i\times L_{2n-i}$ so that $\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )$ is maximised. We prove the following claim. \par \begin {claim} \label {1To2} If there exist a coordinate $\alpha \in [n]$ such that $x_\alpha =0$ and $y_\alpha =2$, then for every coordinate $\beta \in [n]$ with $x_\beta =1$ we have $y_\beta =2$. \end {claim} \par \begin {proof} Suppose to the contrary that there is a coordinate $\alpha \in [n]$ such that $x_\alpha =0$ and $y_\alpha =2$ and a coordinate $\beta \in [n]$ with $x_\beta =y_\beta =1$.

For every such sequence, define another sequence $\pi (Z)$ as follows: \[\pi (Z):=\left (z_i,\dots ,z_{\ell (Z)-1},\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }\left (z_{\ell (Z)}\right ),\dots ,\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }\left (z_{2n-i}\right )\right ).\] Notice that $\pi (Z)$ is a chain starting with $x$ and ending at $\pi _{\alpha ,\beta }(y)$. It is not hard to see that the function $\pi $ is injective.

In order to prove the strict inequality, all that we need is a single chain containing $x$ and $\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }(y)$ which is not a subsequence of one of the chains $\pi (Z)$ for $Z$ as above. Any chain of the form $x<z<\tau _{\alpha ,\beta }(y)$ with $z_\beta =2$ has this property. This completes the proof of the claim. \end {proof} \par We now prove that, in fact, there must be at least $n/10$ coordinates $\alpha \in [n]$ such that $x_\alpha =0$ and $y_\alpha =2$. If not, then we must have that the rank of $y$ is at most $2i + (n-i) + n/10 = 11n/10+i$. However, by assumption of this case, the rank of $y$ is precisely $2n-i$. Putting this together, we get that $2n-i\leq 11n/10 +i$ which implies that $i\geq 9n/20$, a contradiction. Thus, by Claim~\ref {1To2} we have that $y_\beta =2$ for every coordinate $\beta \in [n]$ with $x_\beta \geq 1$. \par By the result of the previous paragraph and the symmetry of the distribution $\mu $, we see that $\mathbb {P}\left (y'\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )$ is equal to $\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )$ for every $y'\in L_{2n-i}$ such that \begin {itemize} \item $y'_\beta = 2$ for every coordinate $\beta \in [n]$ with $x_\beta \geq 1$, and \item $y'$ has the same number of coordinates in $\{0,1\}$ as $y$. \end {itemize} By the hypotheses of the lemma and the fact that the rank of $x$ plus the rank of $y$ is $2n$, we must have that the rank of $y$ is at most $2n-2k$. This implies that $y$ must have at least $k$ coordinates in $\{0,1\}$. Also, recall that we have proved above that there are at least $n/10\gg k$ coordinates such that $\alpha \in [n]$ such that $x_\alpha =0$ and $y_\alpha =2$. Since $i<9n/20$, we have that $x$ has at least $11n/20$ coordinates which are equal to zero. Putting all of this together, we get that, for $n_0(k)$ sufficiently large, the number of such $y'$ is at least \[\binom {\left \lceil 11n/20\right \rceil }{k} > \frac {\ell _{3k-1}(n)}{\ell _{2k-1}(n)} - 1\] by \eqref {ratioAsymp}. Since $\mathbb {P}\left (y'\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )$ is the same for all such $y'$ and the sum of this quantity over all $y'$ is at most one, we must have that $\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\leq \left (\frac {\ell _{3k-1}(n)}{\ell _{2k-1}(n)} - 1\right )^{-1}$. This completes the proof in this case. \par \begin {case4} $j-i> 11n/10$ and $i+j<2n$. \end {case4} \par In this case, we proceed by induction on $2n-i-j$. The basis of our induction will be the case $2n-i-j=0$, which is covered by Case~\ref {bigSymmetricGap}. We can write $\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )$ as \[\sum _{\substack {z\in L_{i+1} \\ x<z<y}}\mathbb {P}\left (y,z\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\] \[=\sum _{\substack {z\in L_{i+1} \\ x<z<y}}\mathbb {P}\left (z\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\] by \eqref {memoryless}. Since $\sum _{\substack {z\in L_{i+1} \\ x<z<y}}\mathbb {P}\left (z\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid x\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\leq 1$, we see that it suffices to show that \begin {equation}\label {zBound}\mathbb {P}\left (y\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \mid z\in \mathcal {C}_\mu \right )\leq \left (\frac {\ell _{3k-1}(n)}{\ell _{2k-1}(n)} - 1\right )^{-1}\end {equation} for every $z\in L_{i+1}$ such that $x<z<y$. So, let $z$ be any such element. By assumption, we have that $i+1<j$ and $(i+1)+j\leq 2n$ and so the rank of $y$ is at least as close to $n$ as the rank of $z$ is. If we have $j-(i+1) \leq 11n/10$, then \eqref {zBound} holds by the argument given in Case~\ref {smallGap} and we are done. So, we assume that $j-(i+1) > 11n/10$. If we have $(i+1)+j=2n$, then \eqref {zBound} holds by the argument given in Case~\ref {bigSymmetricGap}. Thus, we have that $j-(i+1)>11n/10$ and $(i+1)+j<2n$ and we now get that \eqref {zBound} holds by the inductive hypothesis. This completes the proof of the lemma.

BEGIN Proof 
 Fix an arbitrary total order $x_1,\dots ,x_{|P|}$ on the elements of $P$ (this will only be used to `break ties' later in the proof). The proof of this lemma amounts to a simple application of the so-called Kleitman--Winston algorithm~\cite {KleitmanWinston}. This algorithm takes, as an input, an antichain $I$ of $P$ and produces the sets $T_1,\dots ,T_k$ as well as the sets $f_1(T_1), \dots ,f_k\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^kT_r\right )$. After describing this algorithm, we will verify that these sets have all of the desired properties and that the functions $f_1,\dots ,f_k$ are well defined; i.e., we show that $f_j\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r\right )$ depends only on $\bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r$ and not on the input antichain $I$ or on the sets $T_1,\dots ,T_j$ individually. \par Given a set $S\subseteq P$ and $x\in S$, define $N_{S}(x)$ to be the set of elements of $S$ that are comparable to $x$ and let $d_{S}(x):=|N_{S}(x)|$. Set $P_0:=P$ and let $u_0$ be the element of $P_0$ such that $d_{P_0}(u_0)$ is maximum; if there is a tie, then we let $u_{0}$ be the choice which comes earliest in the total order. Now, given $i\geq 1$, the set $P_{i-1}$ and an element $u_{i-1}$ of $P_{i-1}$, the $i$th step of the algorithm will either terminate or it will produce a non-empty set $P_i\subsetneq P_{i-1}$ and an element $u_i$ of $P_i$ which it will pass to the next step. We proceed differently depending on the value of $d_{P_{i-1}}\left (u_{i-1}\right )$. \par \begin {case} \label {bigdegcase} $d_{P_{i-1}}(u_{i-1})\geq 2d_k$. \end {case} \par Let $j$ be the smallest integer in $\{1,\dots ,k\}$ such that $d_{P_{i-1}}(u_{i-1})\geq 2d_j$. If $u_{i-1}\notin I$, then we define $P_i:=P_{i-1}\setminus \{u_{i-1}\}$. On the other hand, if $u_{i-1}\in I$, then we add $u_{i-1}$ to $T_j$ and define $P_i:=P_{i-1}\setminus \left (\{u_{i-1}\}\cup N_{P_{i-1}}(u_{i-1})\right )$. It is clear that $P_i\subsetneq P_{i-1}$. \par If $P_i\neq \emptyset $, then let $u_i\in P_i$ such that $d_{P_i}(u_i)$ is maximum and, subject to this, $u_i$ comes earliest in the total order. If, in addition, $d_{P_i}(u_i)\geq 2d_j$, then we simply proceed to the next step of the algorithm. \par Suppose now that $P_i=\emptyset $ or that $d_{P_i}(u_i)< 2d_j$. In the former case, set $\ell :=k-j$ and, in the latter case, let $\ell \in \{0,\dots ,k-j\}$ be the largest integer such that $d_{P_i}(u_i)<2d_{j+\ell }$. We do the following: \begin {itemize} \item terminate the definition of $T_j$, \item set $T_{j+1},\dots ,T_{j+\ell }:=\emptyset $, \item set $f_{j}\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^{j}T_r\right ) =\dots = f_{j+\ell }\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^{j+\ell }T_r\right ):=P_{i}$. \end {itemize} If $P_i=\emptyset $, then terminate the algorithm; otherwise, proceed to the next step. \par \begin {case} \label {smalldegcase} $d_{P_{i-1}}\left (u_{i-1}\right ) < 2d_k$. \end {case} \par In this case, we simply terminate the algorithm. This concludes the description of the algorithm. \par A key feature of the algorithm is that the sequence $d_{P_0}(u_0),d_{P_1}(u_1),\dots $ is non-increasing, which follows easily from the choice of the elements $u_0,u_1,\dots $ and the fact that $P_{i}\subsetneq P_{i-1}$ for all $i\geq 1$. Since this sequence is non-increasing and $d_1>\dots >d_k$ we see that, for each $j\in \{1,\dots ,k\}$, there is a unique step of the algorithm such that the definition of $T_j$ and $f_j\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^j T_r\right )$ is finalised. Also, if $1\leq j < j' \leq k$, then $T_j$ and $f_j\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^j T_r\right )$ are defined before $T_{j'}$ and $f_{j'}\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^{j'}T_r\right )$. \par \par It is clear by construction that \eqref {CONTSinf} and \eqref {CONTdisjoint} hold and that $T_j\subseteq I$ for $1\leq j\leq k$. Also, \eqref {CONTcontainersContain} holds since we never delete an element of $I$ during the running of the algorithm. By construction, every element of $f_j\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r\right )$ is comparable to fewer than $2d_j$ other elements in $f_j\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r\right )$. Therefore, $\comp \left (f_j\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r\right )\right )< \left |f_j\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r\right )\right |d_j$ which implies that $\left |f_j\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r\right )\right |\leq m_j$ by hypothesis. This verifies that $f_j$ does, indeed, map into $\binom {P}{\leq m_j}$. For each element that we added to $T_1$, we deleted at least $2d_1+1$ elements of $P$. Therefore, $|T_1|\leq |P|/(2d_1+1) = m_{0}/(2d_1+1)$. Similarly, for $j\geq 2$, for each element that we added to $T_j$ we deleted at least $2d_j+1$ elements of $f_{j-1}\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^{j-1}T_r\right )$ and so $|T_j|\leq m_{j-1}/(2d_j+1)$. Thus, \eqref {CONTeachSSmall} holds. \par Finally, we argue that the functions $f_1,\dots ,f_k$ are well defined. Let $I$ and $I'$ be antichains yielding the same set $\bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r$ for some $j$ with $1\leq j\leq k$. Let $u_0,u_1,\dots $ and $P_0,P_1,\dots $ be the elements and subsets of $P$ produced while running the algorithm with input $I$ and let $u_0',u_1',\dots $ and $P_0',P_1',\dots $ be the elements and subsets of $P$ produced while running the algorithm with input $I'$. Let $i$ denote the minimum integer such that $d_{P_i}(u_i) < 2d_j$. We prove that $u_t=u_t'$ and $P_t=P_t'$ for all $0\leq t\leq i$. If not, let $t$ be the smallest such integer for which it fails. Clearly, $t\geq 1$. Now, if $P_t=P_t'$, then $u_t= u_t'$ follows immediately so we must have $P_t\neq P_t'$. However, since $u_{t-1}=u_{t-1}'$ and $P_{t-1}=P_{t-1}'$, the only way that we can have $P_t\neq P_t'$ is if $u_{t-1}\in I$ and $u_{t-1}'\notin I'$ or vice versa. By definition of $i$, we have $d_{P_{t-1}}(u_{t-1})\geq 2d_j$ and so $u_{t-1}\in I$ implies $u_{t-1}\in \bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r$ by the description of the algorithm. However, $u_{t-1}'\notin I'$ implies that the algorithm will not add $u_{t-1}'$ to any of the sets $T_1,\dots ,T_k$ and so $u_{t-1}'\notin \bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r$, contradicting the fact that $u_{t-1}=u_{t-1}'$. Therefore $f_j\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r\right )$ does not depend on $I$. This argument also proves that it depends only on the union $\bigcup _{r=1}^jT_r$ and not on the sets $T_1,\dots ,T_j$ individually. This completes the proof.

BEGIN Lemma \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 Apply Lemma~\ref {generalContK} to obtain the functions $f_1,\dots ,f_k$. For each antichain $I$, let $T_{1,I},\dots ,T_{k,I}$ be disjoint sets as in Lemma~\ref {generalContK} such that $I\subseteq \left (\bigcup _{r=1}^kT_{r,I}\right )\cup f\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^kT_{r,I}\right )$. Define \[\mathcal {F}:=\left \{\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^kT_{r,I}\right )\cup f\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^kT_{r,I}\right ): I\subseteq P\text { is an antichain}\right \}.\] Then \eqref {setBound} and \eqref {Fcontains} hold by construction. Let us show that \eqref {collectionBound} holds. The number of ways of choosing $T_{1,I}$ is at most $\binom {|P|}{\leq |P|/(2d_1+1)}$. Now, for $2\leq j\leq k$, given that $T_{1,I},\dots ,T_{j-1,I}$ have been chosen, we know that $T_{j,I}$ is a subset of $f_{j-1}\left (\bigcup _{r=1}^{j-1}T_{r,I}\right )$. Therefore, there are at most $\binom {m_{j-1}}{\leq m_{j-1}/(2d_{j}+1)}$ ways to choose $T_{j,I}$. This argument proves \eqref {collectionBound}.

BEGIN Theorem \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 We generate a set of containers for the antichains of $\mathcal {P}(n)$ using Lemma~\ref {containersCor}. An upper bound on the number of antichains will then follow by considering all subsets of the containers. Set $d_1:=n\sqrt {\log {n}}$, $d_2:=\sqrt {n\log {n}}$, $m_0:=2^n$, $m_1:=\frac {2\binom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }}{1-8d_1/n^2}$ and $m_2:=\frac {\binom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }}{1-2d_2/n}$. If $S$ is a subset of $\mathcal {P}(n)$ of cardinality at least $m_1$, then, by Theorem~\ref {booleanThm}, \[\comp (S)\geq \left (|S| - 2\binom {n}{\left \lceil n/2\right \rceil }\right )\left (\frac {n^2}{8}\right )\] \[ = \left (|S|-m_1\right )\left (\frac {n^2}{8}\right ) + \left (m_1 - 2\binom {n}{\left \lceil n/2\right \rceil }\right )\left (\frac {n^2}{8}\right ) \geq (|S|-m_1)d_1 + m_1d_1 = |S|d_1\] since $\left (m_1-2\binom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }\right )\left (\frac {n^2}{8}\right ) = m_1d_1$. Similarly, if $S$ has cardinality at least $m_2$, then $\comp (S)\geq |S|d_2$. Therefore, we can apply Lemma~\ref {containersCor} to $\mathcal {P}(n)$ with $k=2$ and these values of $d_1,d_2,m_0,m_1$ and $m_2$ to obtain a collection $\mathcal {F}$ of at most $\binom {2^n}{\leq 2^n/d_1}\binom {m_1}{\leq m_1/d_2}$ containers, each of cardinality at most $m_2+\frac {m_1}{d_2}+\frac {2^n}{d_1}$, such that each antichain of $\mathcal {P}(n)$ is contained in at least one container. Thus, the number of antichains in $\mathcal {P}(n)$ is at most \begin {align*}\binom {2^n}{\leq 2^n/d_1}\binom {m_1}{\leq m_1/d_2}2^{m_2+\frac {m_1}{d_2} + \frac {2^n}{d_1}} &\leq \left (e\cdot d_1\right )^{2^n/d_1}\left (e\cdot d_2\right )^{m_1/d_2}2^{m_2+\frac {m_1}{d_2} + \frac {2^n}{d_1}}\\ &= 2^{\frac {2^n\log _2(e\cdot d_1)}{d_1} + \frac {m_1\log _2(e\cdot d_2)}{d_2} + m_2 + \frac {m_1}{d_2} + \frac {2^n}{d_1}} \\ &\leq 2^{m_2 + O\left (\frac {2^n\log {n}}{d_1} + \frac {m_1\log {n}}{d_2}\right )}\end {align*} for $n$ sufficiently large. Now, bounding the exponent, we get \begin {align*}m_2 + O\left (\frac {2^n\log {n}}{d_1} + \frac {m_1\log {n}}{d_2}\right )&= \frac {\binom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }}{1-2d_2/n} + O\left (\frac {2^n\sqrt {\log {n}}}{n} + \binom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }\sqrt {\log {n}/n}\right )\\ &\leq \binom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor } + \frac {4d_2}{n} \binom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor } +O\left (\binom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }\sqrt {\log {n}/n}\right )\\ & = \left (1+O\left (\sqrt {\log {n}/n}\right )\right )\binom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }\end {align*} since $\binom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor } =\Theta \left (\frac {2^n}{\sqrt {n}}\right )$ by Stirling's Approximation. The result follows.

BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem~\ref {countVec}] For brevity, define $N:=|\mathcal {V}(q,n)|$ and note that $N=\Theta \left (q^{n^2/2}\right )$ by Theorem~\ref {wilf}. Let $d:=\sqrt {n}q^{n/4}$ and $m:=\frac {\qbinom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }{q}}{1-d\qbinom {\left \lceil (n+1)/2\right \rceil }{1}{q}^{-1}}$. Note that Theorem~\ref {wilf} also implies that $m=\Theta \left (q^{n^2/2}\right )$ and so $m$ and $N$ are of the same order of magnitude. By Theorem~\ref {vecSpThm}, if $S$ is a subset of $\Vectors {q}{n}$ of cardinality at least $m$, then \[\comp (S)\geq \left (|S|-\qbinom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }{q}\right )\qbinom {\left \lceil (n+1)/2\right \rceil }{1}{q}\] \[=\left (|S|-m\right )\qbinom {\left \lceil (n+1)/2\right \rceil }{1}{q} + \left (m-\qbinom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }{q}\right )\qbinom {\left \lceil (n+1)/2\right \rceil }{1}{q}\geq \left (|S|-m\right )d + md = |S|d.\] Thus, by Lemma~\ref {containersCor}, there is a collection of at most $\binom {N}{\leq N/d}$ containers, each of cardinality at most $m+\frac {N}{d}$, such that each antichain is contained in at least one container. Thus, the number of antichains in $\Vectors {q}{n}$ is at most \[\binom {N}{\leq N/d}2^{m+\frac { N}{d}}\leq \left (e\cdot d\right )^{\frac { N}{d}}2^{m+\frac { N}{d}}= 2^{m+ \log N + \left (\frac { N}{d}\right )\left (\log (e\cdot d) + 1\right )}\] Since $q$ is fixed, we can use Theorem~\ref {wilf} to bound the exponent as follows: \begin {align*}m+ \log N + \left (\frac { N}{d}\right )\left (\log (e\cdot d) + 1\right ) &\leq \frac {\qbinom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }{q}}{1-d\qbinom {\left \lceil (n+1)/2\right \rceil }{1}{q}^{-1}} + O\left (n^2 + \frac { N\cdot n}{d}\right )\\ &\leq \qbinom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }{q} + \frac {2d\qbinom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }{q}}{\qbinom {\left \lceil (n+1)/2\right \rceil }{1}{q}} + O\left (\frac { N\cdot n}{d}\right ).\end {align*} This completes the proof since $ N = \Theta \left (\qbinom {n}{\left \lfloor n/2\right \rfloor }{q}\right )$ and, for fixed $q$, we have $\qbinom {\left \lceil (n+1)/2\right \rceil }{1}{q}=\Theta \left (q^{n/2}\right )$.

If $S$ is a subset of $\{0,1,2\}^n$ of cardinality at least $m_1$, then, by Theorem~\ref {multisetThm}, \[\comp (S)\geq \left (|S| - 2\ell _n(n)\right )\left (\frac {n^2}{50}\right )\] \[ = \left (|S|-m_1\right )\left (\frac {n^2}{50}\right ) + \left (m_1 - 2\ell _n(n)\right )\left (\frac {n^2}{50}\right ) \geq (|S|-m_1)d_1 + m_1d_1 = |S|d_1,\] since $\left (m_1-2\ell _n(n)\right )\left (\frac {n^2}{50}\right ) = m_1d_1$. Similarly, if the cardinality of $S$ is at least $m_2$, then $\comp (S)\geq |S|d_2$.

BEGIN Proof 
 Begin by giving each element $y$ of $L_{i+1}$ a `weight' of $1$ and then redistributing the weight of $y$ evenly among the $x\in L_i$ with $x<y$. For $0\leq s\leq \left \lfloor i/2\right \rfloor $, the weight recieved by $x\in L_i^s$ is precisely \[f(s):=\frac {i-2s}{i-s} + \frac {n-i+s}{i-s+1}.\] Note that $f(s)$ is well defined as $i\geq 1$ and so $s < i$. We claim that $f(s)$ is non-decreasing for $s$ in the range $0\leq s\leq \left \lfloor i/2\right \rfloor $. Indeed, for $i\geq 2$ and $0\leq s\leq \left \lfloor (i-2)/2\right \rfloor $, we have \[f(s+1)-f(s) = \left (\frac {i-2s-2}{i-s-1} + \frac {n-i+s+1}{i-s}\right ) - \left (\frac {i-2s}{i-s} + \frac {n-i+s}{i-s+1}\right )\] \[=\frac {s(-n +i - 1) + ni - n -i^2-1}{(i-s+1)(i-s)(i-s-1)}.\] Since $n>i$ and $s\leq \frac {i-2}{2}$, this expression is bounded below by \[\frac {(i-2)(-n+i-1) + 2ni-2n-2i^2-2}{2(i-s+1)(i-s)(i-s-1)} = \frac {i(n-i-3)}{2(i-s+1)(i-s)(i-s-1)}\] which is non-negative since $i\leq n-3$. Therefore, the total weight is bounded below by $|L_i|$ multiplied by the weight recieved by an element of $L_i^0$ and bounded above by $|L_i|$ multiplied by the weight recieved by an element of $L_i^{\left \lfloor i/2\right \rfloor }$. However, clearly, the total weight is precisely $|L_{i+1}|$ and so we obtain \[\left (\frac {n+1}{i+1}\right )|L_i|\leq |L_{i+1}| \leq \left (\frac {\left \lceil i/2\right \rceil - \left \lfloor i/2\right \rfloor }{\left \lceil i/2\right \rceil } + \frac {n-\left \lceil i/2\right \rceil }{\left \lceil (i+2)/2\right \rceil }\right )|L_i|\] as desired.

BEGIN Proof 
 Distribute weights to the elements of $L_i$ in the same way as in the proof of Lemma~\ref {ratio1} and define $f(s)$ in the same way as well, except that $i=n-2$. As in that proof, for $0\leq s\leq \left \lfloor (n-4)/2\right \rfloor $, we have \[f(s+1)-f(s) =\frac {s(-n + (n-2) - 1) + n(n-2) - n -(n-2)^2-1}{((n-2)-s+1)((n-2)-s)((n-2)-s-1)}\] \[= \frac {-3s + n-5}{(n-1-s)(n-2-s)(n-3-s)}\] which is non-negative if and only if $s\leq \frac {n-5}{3}$. So, we have that $f(s)$ is non-decreasing in the range $0\leq s\leq \left \lfloor \frac {n-2}{3}\right \rfloor $ and non-increasing in the range $\left \lfloor \frac {n-2}{3}\right \rfloor \leq s\leq \frac {n-2}{2}$. It follows that \[\min \left \{f(0),f\left (\frac {n-2}{2}\right )\right \}|L_i|\leq |L_{i+1}| \leq f\left (\frac {n-2}{3}\right )|L_i|\] and the result follows since $f\left (\frac {n-2}{2}\right ) = \frac {n+2}{n} <\frac {n+1}{n-1} = f(0)$ and $f\left (\frac {n-2}{3}\right ) = \frac {4n+7}{4n-2}$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 Proceed as in the previous two proofs. This time, we have \[f(s+1)-f(s) =\frac {s(-n + (n-1) - 1) + n(n-1) - n -(n-1)^2-1}{((n-1)-s+1)((n-1)-s)((n-1)-s-1)}\] \[=\frac {-2(s+1)}{(n-s)(n-1-s)(n-2-s)}\] and so $f(s)$ is decreasing in $s$ for $0\leq s \leq \left \lfloor \frac {n-1}{2}\right \rfloor $. Therefore, \[f\left (\left \lfloor \frac {n-1}{2}\right \rfloor \right )|L_i|\leq |L_{i+1}|\leq f(0)|L_i|\] and we are done since $f\left (\left \lfloor \frac {n-1}{2}\right \rfloor \right ) = \frac {\left \lceil (n-1)/2\right \rceil - \left \lfloor (n-1)/2\right \rfloor }{\left \lceil (n-1)/2\right \rceil } + \frac {\left \lfloor (n+1)/2\right \rfloor }{\left \lceil (n+1)/2\right \rceil }$ and $f(0) = \frac {n+1}{n}$.
END Proof
