BEGIN Proof 
 (i)\!$\iff $\!(ii): By definition a graph is $k$-connected if and only if there is no separating set of cardinality $<k$. Thus, all we need to do is to show that any minimal separating set for $\Gamma (G)$ is upward closed (except, if $\Gamma (G)$ is a complete graph). Take a vertex $S\in \mathcal {S}$ where $\mathcal {S}$ is a minimal separating set. By the minimality of $\mathcal {S}$, for any two vertices $H,K\in V(G)\setminus \mathcal {S}$ there is a path $\gamma =(H,\dots ,K)$ traversing only the points in $(V(G)\setminus \mathcal {S})\cup \{S\}$. Suppose that $H$ and $K$ belong to different components (obtained after removing all the vertices in $\mathcal {S}$). So $\gamma $ necessarily visits $S$, i.e. $\gamma =(H,\dots ,S,\dots ,K)$. If $\overbar {S}\in V(G)$ and $S<\overbar {S}$, then $\bar {\gamma }=(H,\dots ,\overbar {S},\dots ,K)$ is also a path from $H$ to $K$ and therefore $\overbar {S}\in \mathcal {S}$. Since $S$ was chosen arbitrarily, $\mathcal {S}$ is upward closed. \par (i)\!$\iff $\!(iii): Menger's Theorem states that a graph is $k$-connected if and only if it contains $k$ independent paths between any two vertices. Therefore, it is enough to show that existence of $k$ independent paths between any pair of minimal subgroups implies the existence of $k$ independent paths between any pair of subgroups in $V(G)$. If there exists a unique minimal subgroup of $G$, then $\Gamma (G)$ is a complete graph on more than $k$ vertices, thus it is $k$-connected. Suppose that there are more than one minimal subgroups of $G$. Let $X,Y\in V(G)$ be two distinct vertices and $A,B$ be two minimal subgroups with $\gamma _i=(A,A_i,\dots ,B_i,B)$, $1\leq i\leq k$, are independent paths between them. Suppose that neither $X$ nor $Y$ are minimal subgroups. There are two cases that may occur: \par \emph {Case I:} $X$ and $Y$ contain a common minimal subgroup, say $A$. Then $\bar {\gamma }_i:=(X,A_i,Y)$ are independent paths provided that no coincidence occurs. If $X$ coincides with, say $A_1$, then replace $\bar {\gamma }_1$ with $(X,Y)$. If, in addition, $Y$ coincides with, say $A_2$, then substitute $(X,\dots ,B_1,B_2,\ldots ,Y)$ for $\bar {\gamma }_2$. \par \emph {Case II:} $X$ and $Y$ contain distinct minimal subgroups, say $A$ and $B$ respectively. In this case, we may simply take $\bar {\gamma }_i=(X,A_i,B_i,Y)$ as independent paths between $X$ and $Y$. If $X$ or $Y$ coincides with some inner vertex, we may simply shorten the path accordingly. \par Finally, it is easy to see that above arguments can still be applied with minor changes if one of $X$ and $Y$ is a minimal subgroup.

BEGIN Proof 
 Let $G$ be a finite abelian group such that there is a cut-vertex $M$ in $\Gamma (G)$. By Proposition~\ref {prop:upward}\,(ii), $M$ can be taken as a maximal subgroup of $G$. Actually, $M$ must be a maximal subgroup unless $\Gamma (G)$ is a complete graph. Suppose that $\Gamma (G)\cong K_n$. Obviously it must be the complete graph on two vertices. In other words, $G$ has a unique maximal subgroup and a unique minimal subgroup. This is possible only if $G\cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^2}$ for some prime number $p$. (Observe that a finite group has a unique maximal subgroup if and only if it is isomorphic to a cyclic group of prime power order.) \par Next, suppose that $\Gamma (G)$ is not complete. Clearly, there are more than one minimal subgroups, i.e. $G$ is not cyclic of prime power order. Let $A$ be a minimal subgroup of $M$. As any subgroup contains a minimal subgroup, any component of the graph obtained by removing the vertex $M$ and all the incident edges to $M$ from $\Gamma (G)$ contains at least one minimal subgroup. Let $B$ be a minimal subgroup which is not in the same component with $A$. Since $(A,AB,B)$ is a path between them, $M=AB$. Moreover, observe that for either $A$ or $B$, say $A$, the subgroup $AB$ must be the unique proper subgroup containing $A$ strictly. Otherwise, there would be a path $(A,X,Y,B)$ between $A$ and $B$, where $X$ and $Y$ are some maximal subgroups different from $AB$ that are containing $A$ and $B$ respectively. It can be easily seen that $M=AB$ is a cut-vertex of the abelian group $G$ if and only if $G$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\times \mathbb {Z}_p$, or $\mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\times \mathbb {Z}_q$ for some prime numbers $p$ and $q$.

BEGIN Proof 
 Let $G$ and $N$ be as in the hypothesis of the Proposition. Let $A$ and $B$ be two minimal subgroups of $G$. If $\kappa (G/N)=-2$, then there is a normal series $$ 1<N_1<N_2<\dots <N_x=G, $$ and we may easily form $x-2$ independent paths $\gamma _i=(A,N_iA,N_iB,B)$, $1\leq i\leq x-2$, between $A$ and $B$. (In case of a possible coincidence of the vertices we can safely shorten the paths.) A similar argument shows that we may construct $x-1$ independent paths if $\kappa (G/N)=-1$. \par Next suppose that $\kappa (G/N)\geq 0$, i.e. $|V(G/N)|\geq 1$. By the Correspondence Theorem there is a bijection between the subgroups of the quotient group $G/N$ and the subgroups of $G$ that are containing $N$. Observe that $NA$ and $NB$ correspond to some subgroups of $G/N$ that are either trivial or minimal. Then, as $G/N$ is $k$-connected by the assumption, we may construct at least $k$ additional independent paths $\gamma _j=(A,\dots ,B)$, $x\leq j\leq k+x-1$, such that the inner vertices represents some proper subgroups of $G$ containing $N$.

BEGIN Corollary \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem A] Let $G$ be a finite non-simple group and $N$ be a minimal normal subgroup of $G$. Suppose that $\Gamma (G)$ is not connected. Let $A$ be a subgroup of $G$ which does not lie in the component of $N$ in $\Gamma (G)$. Then $NA=G$, as otherwise, $(N,NA,A)$ would be a path between $N$ and $A$. Also $N\cap A=1$, as otherwise, $N$ and $A$ would be linked via the subgroup $N\cap A$. Therefore $|G:N|=|A|$. Since this equality holds for every subgroup that does not lie in the component containing $N$, it holds also for any non-trivial subgroup of $A$. As a consequence $|G:N|=|A|=q$ is a prime number. Moreover, $A$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$. To see this, suppose that there exists a proper subgroup $B$ containing $A$. Since $B$ does not lie in the same component with $N$, we have $|B|=q$, i.e. $B$ coincides with $A$. \par Let $Q$ be a Sylow $q$-subgroup of $G$ containing $A$. Since $A$ is a maximal subgroup, either $G=Q$ or $A=Q$. In the first case since $N$ is a minimal normal subgroup and $G$ is a $q$-group, the order of $N$ is $q$. As $N$ and $A$ are distinct subgroups of same order $q$ and as $G=NA$, we see that $G\cong \mathbb {Z}_q\times \mathbb {Z}_q$. Clearly, $\Gamma (\mathbb {Z}_q\times \mathbb {Z}_q)$ is not connected. \par \par In the latter case since $G$ is not a $q$-group and since $G=NA$, there must be a prime $p$ dividing $|N|$ and different from $q$. We want to show that $N$ is a $p$-group. Suppose contrarily that $N$ is not a $p$-group. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $N$ and $T=N_G(P)$. (Notice that $G\neq T$, as $N$ is a minimal normal subgroup.) By the Frattini argument $G=NT$ which, in turn, implies that $q\divides |T|$. Since $A$ is a Sylow $q$-subgroup, some conjugate of $T$ contains $A$. However, this contradicts with the maximality of $A$. Therefore, $N$ is a $p$-subgroup. Further, $N$ must be an elementary abelian subgroup since it is a minimal normal subgroup. \par \par \par Consider the normalizer $N_G(A)$. Since $A$ is a maximal subgroup, there are two possibilities. If $A$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $A$ centralizes $N$; hence, $|N|=p$ and $G\cong \mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_q$. Clearly, $\Gamma (\mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_q)$ is not connected. And if $A$ is self-normalizing, $G$ is a group described as in the second part of Theorem~A. To conclude the proof it is enough to show that $\Gamma (G)$ is not connected in such a case. \par Let $H$ be a proper non-trivial subgroup of $G$. We want to show that $H$ is either a subgroup of the unique (normal) Sylow $p$-subgroup $N$ of $G$ or it is a Sylow $q$-subgroup. Obviously, $\Gamma (G)$ is not connected if this is the case. Suppose contrarily, $H$ is neither a $p$-subgroup nor a $q$-subgroup. Then $q\divides |H|$ as $|G|=|NA|=p^{\alpha }q$ for some integer $\alpha \geq 1$. Hence, $H$ contains a conjugate of $A$ and we may suppose that $H$ contains $A$ by replacing $H$ with some conjugate of it if necessary. Then $NH=G$ and it follows that $N\cap H\triangleleft G$. (Notice that $N\cap H$ is normalized by $N$ as $N$ is an abelian subgroup and $N\cap H$ is normalized by $H$ as $N$ is a normal subgroup.) Since $N$ is a minimal normal subgroup, either $N\cap H=1$ or $N\cap H=N$ yielding either $|H|=q$ or $H=G$. However, this contradicts with the assumption that $H$ is a proper subgroup which is not a $q$-subgroup. \par

BEGIN Proof 
 Sufficiency is obvious. Let $G$ be a finite solvable group satisfying the $2$-valency condition. We want to show that there exist at least two independent paths between any pair of minimal subgroups $A_1$ and $A_2$. If $\langle A_1,A_2\rangle $ is a second maximal subgroup, then clearly there are two independent paths between them. Thus, for the rest we assume $\langle A_1,A_2\rangle $ is either $G$ or a maximal subgroup. Let $M$ be a maximal subgroup of prime index and $N$ be a minimal normal subgroup. Notice that since $G$ is solvable, there exist a subgroup of prime index and minimal normal subgroups are elementary abelian. Further, let $A_1<H_1,K_1$ and $A_2<H_2,K_2$ such that $NA_1\neq H_1$ and $NA_2\neq H_2$. \par \emph {Case I:} Suppose that $N$ is of prime index in $G$ and take $M=N$. \par \emph {Case I (a):} $A_1,A_2<M=N$. Obviously $(A_1,M,A_2)$ is a path and $\langle A_1,A_2\rangle =M\cong \mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_p$. And the order of $G$ is either $p^3$ or $p^2q$. By the product formula, $(A_1,H_1,H_2,A_2)$ is also a path and independent from the first. \par \emph {Case I (b):} $M$ and $A_1$ are distinct $p$-groups. Then $G$ is also a $p$-group and in turn $|G|=p^2$ since $M$ must be a cyclic group of prime order. However, intersection graph of a group of order $p^2$ or $pq$ consists of isolated vertices and $G$ does not satisfy $2$-valency condition in that case. \par \emph {Case I (c):} $M$ is an elementary abelian $p$-group of rank $n\geq 2$ and $A_1\cong \mathbb {Z}_q$. In particular $|G|=p^nq$. Observe that $A_1\ntriangleleft G$, as otherwise, $G$ would be an abelian group contradicting the fact that $M$ is a minimal normal subgroup. Moreover, $O_p(H_1)$ and $O_p(K_1)$ are trivial (again this is because $M$ is a minimal normal subgroup) and this in turn implies $H_1,K_1\trianglelefteq N_G(A_1)<G$. (Notice that this implies $n\geq 3$). Hence, we may assume $A_1<H_1<K_1=N_G(A_1)$. If $A_2<M$, then we have the two independent paths $(A_1,H_1,M,A_2)$ and $(A_1,K_1,T,A_2)$ where $T$ is a subgroup of order $p^{n-1}$ containing $A_2$. And if $A_2$ is a conjugate of $A_1$, then $(A_1,H_1,M,H_2,A_2)$ and $(A_1,K_1,T,K_2,A_2)$ are two independent paths between $A_1$ and $A_2$ where $H_2<K_2$. \par \emph {Case II:} Suppose that $[G:N]$ is not prime. Then $NA_1\neq G$, $NA_2\neq G$. If one of $NA_1$ and $NA_2$ coincides with $M$, say $NA_1$, then we may take $(A_1,H_1,NA_2,A_2)$ and $(A_1,K_1,M,H_2,A_2)$ as independent paths. If both $NA_1$ and $NA_2$ coincides with $M$, then we may take $(A_1,M,A_2)$ and $(A_1,H_1,N,H_2,A_2)$. Finally, if $NA_1\neq M$ and $NA_2\neq M$, then $(A_1,NA_1,NA_2,A_2)$ and $(A_1,H_1,M,H_2,A_2)$ are two independent paths between $A_1$ and $A_2$.

BEGIN Proof 
 By Lemma~\ref {lem:valency2}, all we need to do is to determine $p$-groups which do not satisfy the $2$-valency condition. Clearly, intersection graph of a group of order $p^{\alpha }$, $0\leq \alpha \leq 2$, is either empty graph or consists of isolated vertices. Hence $2$-valency condition does not hold for those groups. \par Suppose that $|G|=p^3$. If $G$ has a unique maximal subgroup, then $G\cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^3}$ and $\Gamma (G)\cong K_2$. So it is not $2$-connected in this case. If $G$ has more than one maximal subgroup and $\Phi :=\Phi (G)$ is non-trivial, then either $G$ has a unique minimal subgroup (which is $\Phi $) or there are minimal subgroups different from $\Phi $. In the first case, $G\cong Q_8$ and $\Gamma (Q_8)\cong K_4$. That is, $G$ is $3$-connected. In the latter case, $\Phi A$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$ and it is the unique subgroup of order $p^2$ containing $A$, as all the maximal subgroups contain $\Phi $. If $\Phi $ is trivial, then $G$ is elementary abelian and by the Correspondence Theorem any minimal (normal) subgroup is contained in $p+1$ maximal subgroups. Therefore, $G$ is $2$-connected in this case, as the $2$-valency condition holds. \par Suppose that $|G|=p^{\alpha }$, $\alpha >3$. Then any minimal subgroup of $G$ is contained in a subgroup of order $p^2$ and by a subgroup of order $p^3$. Hence $G$ satisfies the $2$-valency condition.

BEGIN Proof 
 Let $G$ be a group of order $p^2q$ with a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ and a Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$. It is a well-known fact that a group of order $p^2q$ must have a normal Sylow subgroup. Thus, either $P$ or $Q$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. \par \emph {Case I:} $P\cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^2}$. If $P\triangleleft G$, then $G$ has a unique subgroup of order $p$. However, this implies any $q$-subgroup is contained in one and only one subgroup (of order $pq$). Assume that $P\ntriangleleft G$. Then $Q$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and there exists a normal subgroup $M\cong \mathbb {Z}_q\rtimes \mathbb {Z}_p$ containing all subgroups of order $p$. Those two facts imply that $M$ is the unique subgroup containing $Q$. \par \emph {Case II:} $P\cong \mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_p$. \par \emph {Case II (a):} $Q\triangleleft G$. Clearly, $2$-valency condition holds in this case. \par \emph {Case II (b):} $Q\ntriangleleft G$. As was remarked earlier the Sylow $p$-subgroup must be a normal subgroup in this case. First, we shall observe that either there is no normal subgroup of $G$ of order $p$ or there are more than one. As $Q\ntriangleleft G$, the index of $N_G(Q)$ is either $p$ or $p^2$ and this implies $q\divides p-1$ or $q\divides p+1$. Consider the action of $Q$ on the subgroups of $P$ by conjugation. Since the length of an orbit is either $1$ or $q$, the number of fixed points (the number of normal subgroups of order $p$) may be congruent $0$ or $2$ modulo $q$. Next, we determine the groups in which $Q$ is contained in at most one subgroup. If $Q$ acts on $P$ irreducibly (without fixed points) and $Q$ is contained in subgroup $M$ of order $pq$, then $M\cong \mathbb {Z}_q\rtimes \mathbb {Z}_p$ and it normalizes $Q$. Moreover, it is the unique subgroup containing $Q$ as $Q\ntriangleleft G$. If there are distinct normal subgroups $U$ and $V$ of order $p$, then clearly $UQ$ and $VQ$ are distinct subgroups containing $Q$. Finally, we determine the groups in which a (non-normal) subgroup $T$ of order $p$ is not contained in a subgroup of order $pq$. As we have seen that groups in which $Q$ acts on $P$ irreducibly does not satisfy $2$-valency condition, we further assume that there exist two normal subgroups $U$ and $V$ of order $p$. Suppose that $T$ is contained in a subgroup $M$ of order $pq$. Then as $T\ntriangleleft G$, we have $M\cong \mathbb {Z}_q\rtimes \mathbb {Z}_p$. On the other hand, both $UQ$ and $VQ$ cannot be isomorphic to $\mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_q$, as otherwise, $Q<Z(G)$ implying $G$ is abelian. That is, one of $UQ$ and $VQ$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb {Z}_p\rtimes \mathbb {Z}_q$ which is impossible. Therefore, $T$ is not contained in any subgroup of order $pq$. \par \par \par \par \par

 Let $G$ be a $3$-connected group of order $p^2q$ and let $Q$ be a $q$-subgroup of $G$. Take a minimal $p$-subgroup $U$ of $G$ and let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup containing $U$. \par \emph {Case I:} $Q\triangleleft G$. Clearly, $QU$ is the unique subgroup of order $pq$ containing $U$. Moreover, there exist at least two distinct Sylow $p$-subgroups containing $U$, as otherwise, $3$-valency condition does not hold. This, in turn, implies that $N_G(U)=G$. Suppose that Sylow $p$-subgroups are cyclic. Then, $U$ is the unique subgroup of order $p$ and $QU$ is the unique subgroup containing $Q$. Again $3$-valency condition cannot be satisfied. Now, suppose that Sylow $p$-subgroups are elementary abelian. Since $U$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and since this must be the case for any minimal $p$-subgroup, $P$ is also a normal subgroup of $G$ which is a contradiction. \par \emph {Case II:} $Q\ntriangleleft G$. Since $G$ is a solvable group, the $p$-core $O_p(G)$ is a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$. Thus, we shall consider following two sub-cases. \par \emph {Case II (a):} $P\ntriangleleft G, U\triangleleft G$. Suppose that Sylow $p$-subgroups are cyclic. As in Case I, $PQ$ is the unique subgroup containing $Q$ and this case can be discarded. Now, suppose that Sylow $p$-subgroups are elementary abelian. However, by the proof of Lemma~\ref {lem:p2q} we know that no such group exists. \par \par \emph {Case II (b):} $P\triangleleft G$. As in previous cases, $P$ cannot be a cyclic subgroup. Thus $P\cong \mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_p$. We claim that $N_G(Q)=Q$. Assume contrarily that $N_G(Q)$ is a group of order $pq$. Then $N_G(Q)$ is self-normalizing and by the product formula any two distinct conjugates of it intersect at $Q$; however, $Q$ is normal in both of them which is a contradiction. Therefore, any subgroup of order $pq$ must be isomorphic to $\mathbb {Z}_p\rtimes \mathbb {Z}_q$ and since $G$ is $3$-connected there must exist at least three such subgroups containing $Q$. To write a presentation for $G$, let $a,b,c$ be three elements generating $G$ such that $a,b$ are of order $p$ and $c$ is of order $q$. Moreover, we may suppose that $c$ normalizes $\langle a\rangle $, $\langle b\rangle $, and $\langle ab^k\rangle $ where $k\geq 1$ is an integer. (Notice that any subgroup of order $p$ is generated by some element $ab^k$ for some integer $k$.) In other words, we have the relations $cac^{-1}=a^{\lambda _1}$, $cbc^{-1}=b^{\lambda _2}$, and $cab^{k}c^{-1}=(ab^k)^t=a^tb^{tk}$ for some integers $\lambda _1,\lambda _2,t$. On the other hand, $cab^{k}c^{-1}=a^{\lambda _1}b^{\lambda _2k}$ implying $\lambda _1\equiv \lambda _2\pmod {p}$ and hence we may take $\lambda :=\lambda _1=\lambda _2$. As a consequence all $p$-subgroups are normal in $G$. Notice that $\lambda =1$ implies $Q\triangleleft G$, hence $\lambda >1$. Moreover, since $a=c^qac^{-q}=a^{\lambda ^q}$, we have $\lambda ^q\equiv 1\pmod {p}$. Conversely, it can be verified that a group with this presentation is of order $p^2q$. \par Let $G$ a the group with the given presentation. To conclude the proof, we shall show that $G$ is $3$-connected. We claim $G$ satisfies $3$-valency condition. From the previous arguments, $\langle c\rangle $ is contained in at least three subgroups of order $pq$ and any element of order $q$ acts on $P$ in the same way as $c$ does. Moreover, all $p$-subgroups are normal and there are clearly more than three proper subgroups containing any subgroup of order $p$. Finally, since the maximal subgroups of $G$ form a complete graph in $\Gamma (G)$ by the product formula, we deduce that $G$ is $3$-connected.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem B] Let $G$ be a finite solvable group which is not a $p$-group. (Finite $p$-groups that are not $2$-connected are presented in Lemma~\ref {lem:pgroup2}.) Since $G$ is a solvable group by assumption, there exists a maximal subgroup $M$ of $G$ of prime index. By Lemma~\ref {lem:valency2}, it is enough to determine groups for which the $2$-valency condition does not hold. Suppose that $G$ does not satisfy $2$-valency condition. Let $A$ be a minimal subgroup of order $q$ such that $A$ is (strictly) contained in at most one proper subgroup of $G$. \par First, suppose that $q^2\divides |G|$ and let $Q$ be a Sylow $q$-subgroup containing $A$. Then either $M=Q$ and $|G|=pq^2$ where $[G:M]=p$, or $M\neq Q$ and $[G:M]=q$ as $Q$ is the unique subgroup containing $A$. The first case was considered in Lemma~\ref {lem:p2q}. In the latter case, if $Q\triangleleft G$ then $|G|=pq^2$ as $Q$ is the only proper subgroup containing $A$; hence, we again refer to Lemma~\ref {lem:p2q}. And if $Q\ntriangleleft G$, then we may further assume that $M$ is a normal subgroup. (Notice that since Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ is maximal, there must be a normal subgroup of $G$ of index $q$ in that case.) Moreover, $M$ must be a minimal normal subgroup as $Q$ is the unique proper subgroup containing $A$. Since $G$ is solvable $M\cong \mathbb {Z}_p\times \dots \times \mathbb {Z}_p$ for some prime $p$ different from $q$. However, this is impossible as $q\divides |M|$. \par Next, suppose that $A$ is a Sylow $q$-subgroup. If $|G|=pq$, clearly $2$-valency condition does not hold and the case $|G|=p^2q$ was already considered in Lemma~\ref {lem:p2q}. Suppose that $p,r\divides |G|$ where $p$ and $r$ are distinct prime numbers different from $q$. Since $G$ is solvable, there exist a Hall $\{p,q\}$-subgroup and a Hall $\{q,r\}$-subgroup containing $A$. Hence, we may assume $|G|=p^{\alpha }q$, $\alpha \geq 3$. If $A\triangleleft G$, then it is contained in more than one proper subgroup. Thus $A\ntriangleleft G$. Furthermore, $P\triangleleft G$ in this case, where $P$ is the Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Suppose to the contrary that $P\ntriangleleft G$. Since $G$ is solvable, there exists a normal subgroup $M$ of index $p$. Hence, $M$ contains all Sylow $q$-subgroups implying $[M:N_M(A)]=[G:N_G(A)]$. On the other hand, since $M$ is the unique proper subgroup of $G$ containing $A$, either $N_M(A)=A$ or $N_M(A)=M$. In the first case $N_G(A)$ would be a subgroup of order $pq$ contradicting the assumption that $A$ is contained in at most one subgroup. And in the latter case $A$ would be a normal subgroup of $G$ which is again a contradiction. Therefore $P\triangleleft G$. For the rest of the proof, we take $Q:=A$. Let $N$ be a minimal normal subgroup of $G$. Since $G$ is solvable $N$ is elementary abelian. Now we examine two cases: \par \emph {Case I:} $P=N$. Thus, $P$ is elementary abelian. We claim that $G$ does \emph {not} satisfy $2$-valency condition if and only if $Q$ acts on $P$ irreducibly ($Q$ does not normalize any proper non-trivial subgroup of $P$) and the order of $N_G(Q)$ is at most $pq$. Sufficiency is obvious. For the necessity, it is obvious that if $Q$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$, then $Q$ is self-normalizing and acts on $P$ irreducibly. If $Q$ is not maximal we argue as follows: Let $K$ be a minimal subgroup properly containing $Q$. Then either $Q$ is a normal subgroup of $K$ (hence $K\leq N_G(Q)$) or $O_p(K)$ is a non-trivial normal subgroup of $K$. In the first case, clearly $K=N_G(Q)$ and $|K|=pq$. Moreover, as $K$ is the unique proper subgroup of $G$ containing $Q$ by assumption, the action of $Q$ on $P$ is irreducible. In the latter case, since $O_p(K)$ is also a normal subgroup of $G$ which is not trivial, $P$ and $O_p(K)$ coincides by the minimality of $P$ implying $K=G$. The action of $Q$ on $P$ is irreducible in this case also. \par \emph {Case II:} $P\neq N$. \par \emph {Case II (a):} $P$ is elementary abelian. A Theorem of Gaschütz (see \cite [Theorem 7.43]{Rotman1995}) states that an abelian normal $p$-subgroup has a complement in $G$ if and only if it has a complement in a Sylow $p$-subgroup. Clearly, $N$ is complemented in the elementary abelian $p$-subgroup $P$. Let $K$ be the complement of $N$ in $G$. Then $NQ$ and $K$ are two distinct subgroups containing $A$. \par \emph {Case II (b):} $P$ is \emph {not} elementary abelian. As $NQ$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ containing $A$, we conclude that $P$ and $N$ are the only proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. Moreover, $N$ coincides with $\Phi (P)$, since $\Phi (P)$ is a non-trivial characteristic subgroup of $M$. Notice that a characteristic subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal in the whole group (see \cite [Lemma 5.20]{Rotman1995}). That is, $P$ is a $p$-group such that its Frattini subgroup $N$ is elementary abelian. Moreover, since $Q$ is contained in at most one subgroup, either $N_G(Q)=Q$ or $N_G(Q)=NQ$. Notice that in the latter case we have $NQ\cong \mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_q$. Consider the action of $Q$ on the set of subgroups of $P$ by conjugation. It is easy to see that the fixed points of this action must be precisely $P$, $N$, and the trivial subgroup. Clearly, $Q$ acts on $N$ irreducibly and by the Correspondence Theorem the induced action of $Q$ on $P/N$ is also irreducible. Conversely, if the action of $Q$ on $N$ and $P/N$ are irreducible, then $N$ is the only proper non-trivial subgroup of $P$ fixed by $Q$. To see this, take an element $a\in Q$ and consider its action. If $1<X<N$, then $X^a\neq X$ by assumption. Let $N<NX,\,X\neq P$ and $X^a=Y$. Notice that since $N$ is contained by every maximal subgroup of $G$, we have $NX\neq P$. We want to show that $X\neq Y$. By assumption $(NX/N)^a\neq NX/N$. However, $(NX/N)^a=(NX)^a/N=NY/N$ implying $X\neq Y$.

BEGIN Proof 
 Sufficiency is obvious. Let $G$ be a finite supersolvable group satisfying the $3$-valency condition. We want to show that there are at least three independent paths between any pair of minimal subgroups $A$ and $B$. Clearly, we may suppose that $\ell (G)\geq 3$, since groups of order $p^2$ and $pq$ does not satisfy even $1$-valency condition. Notice that as $G$ is supersolvable, any maximal subgroup is of prime index; and thus, if $X$ is a non-trivial subgroup of $G$ which is not minimal, then $X$ intersects any maximal subgroup non-trivially. \par \emph {Case I:} $G$ has exactly one maximal subgroup. Then $G$ is a cyclic group of prime power order $p^{\alpha }$ and it satisfies $3$-valency condition if and only if $\alpha \geq 5$ which is the case if and only if $\kappa (G)\geq 3$. \par \emph {Case II:} $G$ has exactly two maximal subgroups. If $G$ is a $p$-group, then the number of maximal subgroups $\equiv 1 \pmod {p}$ (see \cite [p.~30]{Berkovich2008}). Also, if $|G|$ is divisible by three distinct prime divisors, then it would have at least three maximal subgroups corresponding (containing the corresponding Hall subgroups). Hence $|G|=p^aq^b$. Obviously, maximal subgroups must be normal and hence $G\cong P\times Q$ is a nilpotent group where $P$ and $Q$ are Sylow $p$- and Sylow $q$- subgroups respectively. Observe that if $H\trianglelefteq P$ and $K\trianglelefteq Q$, then $HK\trianglelefteq G$ as $G$ is the direct product of $P$ and $Q$. However, since any maximal subgroup of a $p$-group is normal, $P$ and $Q$ have exactly one maximal subgroups meaning both are cyclic groups of prime power order and in turn $G$ is also a cyclic group. It can be easily observed that $3$-valency condition is equivalent to the $3$-connectedness for such groups. \par \emph {Case III:} $G$ has at least three maximal subgroups. Let $M_i$ be maximal subgroups, $X_i$ be subgroups containing $A$, and $Y_i$ be subgroups containing $B$ for $1\leq i\leq 3$. Then $(A,X_i,M_i,Y_i,B)$, $1\leq i \leq 3$, are three independent paths between $A$ and $B$. Of course, in case of a coincidence the corresponding paths can be shortened accordingly.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Corollary \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 Obviously, if there are more than three distinct prime divisors of $|G|$, then $G$ satisfies $3$-valency condition, hence is $3$-connected as well. Let $|G|=p^{\alpha }q^{\beta }r^{\gamma }$ where $p,q,r$ are distinct prime numbers and $\alpha \geq 2$. Let $A$ be a minimal subgroup. If $A$ is a $p$-subgroup, then $A$ is properly contained in a Sylow $p$-subgroup, by a Hall $\{p,q\}$-subgroup, and by a Hall $\{p,r\}$-subgroup. If $A$ is a $q$-subgroup, then $A$ is contained in Hall $\{p,q\}$-subgroup, by a Hall $\{q,r\}$-subgroup and by a maximal subgroup containing the corresponding Hall $\{q,r\}$-subgroup. Similarly, there are at least three proper subgroups containing $A$ whenever $A$ is a $r$-subgroup.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 By Lemma~\ref {lem:valency3} we know that $G$ is $3$-connected, if $3$-valency condition holds. Since $G$ is supersolvable group, any minimal subgroup is contained in at least $\ell (G)-2$ proper subgroups. Thus, $\ell (G)< 5$. This eliminates the first column of Table~\ref {table:1}. \par Let $G$ be a nilpotent group of order $p^2q^2$ and let $A$ be a minimal subgroup of $G$. Obviously, $G$ is an abelian group and the normal subgroup $A$ of $G$ is contained in a subgroup of order $pq$, by a subgroup of order $p^2q$ and by the Sylow subgroup. Hence, $G$ satisfies $3$-valency condition. \par Let $G$ be a nilpotent group of order $p^3q$. Then the Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ of $G$ is a normal subgroup and any minimal subgroup of order $p$ is contained in a subgroup of order $p^2$, by a subgroup of order $p^3$, and by a subgroup of order $pq$. Suppose that $Q$ is not contained in more than two proper subgroups. However, this is possible only if the Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ is normal and $P\cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^3}$. Thus, $G$ is cyclic as well.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 Obviously, $|G|=p^2$ implies $\Gamma (G)$ consists of isolated vertices, hence it cannot be connected. So, let's assume $|G|>p^2$. \par \emph {Case I:} $|G|=p^3$. First, suppose that $\Phi (G)\neq 1$. If all maximal subgroups of $G$ are cyclic, then $G$ has a unique minimal subgroup and its intersection graph is complete. However, $\Gamma (\mathbb {Z}_{p^3})$ has two vertices whereas $\Gamma (Q_8)$ has four, thus only the latter is $3$-connected among them. If there exists a maximal subgroup $M\cong \mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_p$, then any minimal subgroup $X$ of $M$ which is different from $\Phi (G)$ is not contained in any maximal subgroup other than $M$, as $\langle X,\Phi (G)\rangle $ uniquely determines $M$. That is, $G$ does not satisfy $3$-valency condition in such case. Now, suppose that $\Phi (G)$ is trivial, i.e. $G$ is isomorphic to the elementary abelian group of rank $3$. By the correspondence theorem, any minimal subgroup is contained in $p+1$ maximal subgroups. Also, since any two maximal subgroups of a $p$-group intersects non-trivially (by the product formula), maximal subgroups form a complete subgraph in $\Gamma (G)$. Therefore, $G$ is $3$-connected in this case. \par \emph {Case II:} $|G|=p^4$. Recall that the \emph {rank} of a $p$-group is the dimension of $G/\Phi (G)$ as a vector space over the field of $p$-elements. If the rank of $G$ is four or three, i.e. $\Phi (G)\cong 1 \text { or } \mathbb {Z}_p$, then for any minimal subgroup $X$ we may form $\Phi (G)X$ which is contained in at least $p+1$ maximal subgroups of $G$. Clearly, $G$ is $3$-connected in this case. On the other hand, if the rank of $G$ is one, i.e. $G\cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^4}$, then $\Gamma (G)$ has exactly three vertices and hence cannot be $3$-connected. Now we shall confine ourselves to the case $G$ is of rank two. \par Suppose that $\Phi (G)\cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^2}$. If $G$ has a unique minimal subgroup then it is isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_{16}$ and its intersection graph is complete, hence $3$-connected as well. Let us assume there exists a minimal subgroup $X$ of $G$ which is different from the minimal subgroup $P$ of $\Phi (G)$. Notice that $P$ is a necessarily normal subgroup of $G$. Then the only maximal subgroup containing $X$ is $M:=\Phi (G)X$ as any maximal subgroup contains $\Phi (G)$. This in turn implies that $PX$ is the only subgroup of order $p^2$ containing $X$, since $P$ is the Frattini subgroup of $M$. Therefore $G$ does not satisfy $3$-valency condition in such a case, hence it is not $3$-connected. \par Suppose that $\Phi (G)\cong \mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_p$. If $G$ is abelian, then it is isomorphic to $\mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\times \mathbb {Z}_{p^2}$ and any minimal subgroup is contained in the Frattini subgroup, hence it is $3$-connected. If $G$ is not abelian, then either $Z(G)=\Phi (G)$ or $Z(G)<\Phi (G)$. This is because, any cyclic extension of a central subgroup is abelian and $Z(G)$ intersects any normal subgroup non-trivially whenever $G$ is a $p$-group. Let $Z(G)=\Phi (G)$. Then a minimal subgroup $P$ is normal in $G$ if and only if $P$ is a subgroup of $\Phi (G)$. We show that $G$ is $3$-connected in such a case. Let $P_i$, $1\leq i\leq p+1$ be minimal subgroups of $\Phi (G)$ and let $X,Y$ be two arbitrary minimal subgroups that are not contained in $\Phi (G)$. We show that there are at least three independent paths between any pair of minimal subgroups. Clearly, this holds if the endpoints are $P_i$ and $P_j$ for any $i\neq j$. Let $A_i:=P_iX$ for $1\leq i\leq p+1$. Since $X\nleq \Phi (G)$ and $|A_i|=p^2$, $A_i\cap A_j=X$ for $i\neq j$. Then, we may form three internally independent paths $(X,A_1,M,P_i)$, $(X,A_2,N,P_i)$, and $(X,A_3,T,P_i)$ between $X$ and $P_i$ where $M,N,$ and $T$ are mutually distinct maximal subgroups. Let $B_i:=P_iY$ for $1\leq i\leq p+1$. Clearly, $(X,A_i,B_i,Y)$, $1\leq i \leq p+1$ are independent paths between $X$ and $Y$. \par \par Let $Z(G)<\Phi (G)$. Obviously, $Z:=Z(G)$ is the unique minimal normal subgroup of $G$. If all minimal subgroups of $G$ are contained in $\Phi (G)$, then clearly $3$-valency condition holds and $G$ is $3$-connected by Lemma~\ref {lem:valency3}. We want to show that under these conditions $G$ is unique up to isomorphism. \par (I) There exists a maximal subgroup $A$ which is abelian, moreover $A\cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\times \mathbb {Z}_p$. By the N/C lemma (see \cite [Theorem 7.1]{Rotman1995}), $N_G(\Phi (G))/C_G(\Phi (G))=G/C_G(\Phi (G))$ can be embedded into $\mathrm {Aut}(\Phi (G))\cong \mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_p$ which is of order $(p^2-1)(p^2-p)$. Then $C_G(\Phi (G))=\Phi (G)$ implies $p^2\divides |\mathrm {Aut}(\Phi (G))|$ and this is impossible. Also, since the center of $G$ is a proper subgroup of $\Phi (G)$, then $C_G(\Phi (G))$ is not the whole group $G$ either. Thus, $A:=C_G(\Phi (G))$ is an abelian subgroup of order $p^3$; and since any maximal subgroup $Y$ of $A$ different from $\Phi (G)$ is cyclic, $A\cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\times \mathbb {Z}_p$. \par (II) $A:=C_G(\Phi (G))$ is the unique abelian group of order $p^3$, moreover $M\cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\rtimes \mathbb {Z}_p$ for any maximal subgroup $M$ different from $A$. Suppose that there exists an abelian subgroup $B\cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\times \mathbb {Z}_p$ different from $A$. Then, as $\langle A,B\rangle =G$ and $A\cap B=\Phi (G)$, the center $Z$ of $G$ contains $\Phi (G)$ which is a contradiction. Therefore, any maximal subgroup $M$ other than $A$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\rtimes \mathbb {Z}_p$, since any non-Frattini subgroup of order $p^2$ is cyclic. \par (III) $G$ has a presentation $$ \langle a,b,c\mid a^{p^2}=b^p=1, ab=ba, a^p=c^{kp}, bcb^{-1}=c^{1+p}, aca^{-1}=c^{1+mp}b^n \rangle $$ for some suitable values of the prime $p$ and integers $k,m,n$. Let $a,b\in A$ and $c\in M$ such that $a,c$ are of order $p^2$ and $b$ is of order $p$. Clearly, those elements generate $G$ and we have $ab=ba$, $a^p,c^p\in Z$, and $bcb^{-1}=c^{1+p}$ as $\langle b,c\rangle \cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\rtimes \mathbb {Z}_p$. Moreover, any conjugate of $c$ can be written as $c^{\gamma }b^{\beta }$ for some integers $\gamma ,\beta $; and since $ac^pa^{-1}=c^p=c^{rp}$ where $\gamma \equiv r \pmod {p}$, we have $r=1$. \par (IV) $p=3$. We want to show that for $p>3$, there is an element $g$ of order $p$ such that $g\notin \Phi (G)$. Then the subgroup generated by this element is a minimal one and it is not contained in the Frattini subgroup contrary to our assumption. Thus, we shall deduce $p=3$. Using the above relations, we may obtain $b^{\beta }c^{\gamma }=c^{\gamma }b^{\beta }c^{\beta \gamma p}$ and $ac^x=c^xab^{xn}u$ where $u=c^{(\frac {1}{2}x(x-1)n+xm)p}$. Clearly $ac^x\notin \Phi (G)$ for $p\nmid x$. By some further computation $$ (ac^x)^p=c^{xp\{1+\frac {1}{6}(p-1)p(p+1)xn\}}a^pb^{\frac {1}{2}p(p-1)xn}u^{\frac {1}{2}p(p-1)}=c^{xp\{1+\frac {1}{6}(p-1)p(p+1)xn\}}a^p. $$ However, this formula implies that $(ac^{-k})^p=1$ for $p\neq 3$. \par (V) Without loss of generality we may take $k=1, m=0, n=-1$. Suppose that $p=3$. Clearly, $k\in \{-1,1\}$ and $m,n\in \{-1,0,1\}$. However, $n=0$ implies that $C_G(\langle c\rangle )$ is an abelian group of order $p^3$ (compare with (I)). As $C_G(\langle c\rangle )$ is different from $A$, this contradicts with (II). Moreover, using the relation presented in (IV), we see that $(ac^k)^3=c^{3(n-k)}$. Therefore, $n$ and $k$ have opposite parity, as otherwise, $\langle ac^k\rangle $ would be a minimal subgroup which is not contained in $\Phi (G)$. Thus, there are totally six distinct triples $(k,m,n)$ that we shall consider. If triples $(k_1,m_1,n_1)$ and $(k_2,m_2,n_2)$ yields isomorphic groups, we simply write $(k_1,m_1,n_1)\sim (k_2,m_2,n_2)$. Now substituting $a^{-1}$ for $a$ yields an automorphism of $G$ showing that $(1,0,-1)\sim (-1,0,1)$,\, $(1,-1,-1)\sim (-1,1,1)$, and $(1,1,-1)\sim (-1,-1,1)$. Also, it can be verified that the automorphisms $\varphi \colon a\mapsto a, b\mapsto b, c\mapsto c^2$ and $\psi \colon a\mapsto ab, b\mapsto b, c\mapsto b^{-1}cb$ yields $(1,0,-1)\sim (-1,1,1)$ and $(1,0,-1)\sim (1,1,-1)$ respectively. Hence, we have $$ (1,0,-1)\sim (1,-1,-1)\sim (1,1,-1)\sim (-1,0,1)\sim (-1,1,1)\sim (-1,-1,1) $$ Conversely, it can be verified that a group with this presentation is of order $81$ and all minimal subgroups are contained in $\Phi (G)$. \par \par \par Next suppose that there are minimal subgroups of $G$ which do not lie in $\Phi (G)$. Let $X$ be such a minimal subgroup. Observe that $X$ is contained in exactly one maximal subgroup, say $M$. Otherwise, there exist two distinct maximal subgroups such that their intersection strictly contains $\Phi (G)$ which is impossible. For the rest of the proof we assume that $G$ is a $3$-connected group. Then, there exist two subgroups $Y$ and $W$ of order $p^2$ containing $X$, as otherwise, $3$-valency condition would not be satisfied. Since $Y,W,$ and $\Phi (G)$ are maximal subgroups of $M$ intersecting trivially, we see that $M\cong \mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_p\times \mathbb {Z}_p$. Moreover, $M$ contains all minimal subgroups of $G$, as otherwise, there would be another maximal subgroup of $G$ which is abelian and this implies that $\Phi (G)$ is in the center of $G$ contrary to our assumption. In other words, any maximal subgroup $L$ of $G$ different from $M$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\rtimes \mathbb {Z}_p$. We want to show that $G$ has a presentation $$ G\cong \langle a,b,c\mid a^{p^2}=b^p=c^p=1, bc=cb, bab^{-1}=a^{p+1}, cac^{-1}=ab \rangle . $$ Let $a,b\in L$ and $c\in M$ such that $a$ is of order $p^2$ and $b,c$ are of order $p$. Clearly, those elements generate $G$ and we have $bc=cb$, $a^p\in Z$, and $bab^{-1}=a^{p+1}$ as $\langle a,b\rangle \cong \mathbb {Z}_{p^2}\times \mathbb {Z}_p$. Moreover, any conjugate of $a$ can be written as $a^{\alpha }b^{\beta }$ for some integers $\alpha ,\beta $; and since $ca^pc^{-1}=a^p=a^{rp}$ where $\gamma \equiv r \pmod {p}$, we have $r=1$. One may observe that distinct conjugates of $\langle a \rangle $ are generated by $a^{1+mp}b$ for $1\leq m\leq p$; and $c\in M$ can be chosen in a way that $cac^{-1}=ab$ holds. Conversely, it can be verified that a group with this presentation is of order $p^4$ and has the desired structure for $p>3$. Notice that the generators $a$ and $b$ commutes for $p=2$. Also the element $ac$ clearly does not belong to $\Phi (G)$; however its order is $p$ for $p=3$. For the classification of groups of order $p^4$, the reader may refer to \cite [p.~140]{Burnside1955}. \par 
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Theorem C] It can be easily verified that nilpotent groups of order $p^2q$ do not satisfy the $3$-valency condition. (This is also a consequence of Lemma~\ref {lem:p2q-2}.) Also, a nilpotent group of order $pqr$ is cyclic and does not satisfy the $3$-valency condition. Then the first part of the Theorem follows from Lemmas \ref {lem:valency3}, \ref {lem:pgroup3}, and \ref {lem:order}. \par For the second part we argue as follows. Let $A$ and $B$ be two distinct minimal subgroups of a finite solvable group $G$ such that there are at least four distinct prime divisors of $|G|$. Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are of same order, say $p$. Let $A_q$, $A_r$, and $A_s$ be some maximal Hall subgroups of $G$ containing $A$ such that their indexes is a power of prime numbers $q$, $r$, and $s$ respectively. Also, let $B_q$, $B_r$, and $B_s$ be some maximal Hall subgroups containing $B$. (Of course, $[G:B_q]=q^{\alpha }$ for some integer $\alpha $, and so on.) By the product formula $(A,A_q,B_r,B)$, $(A,A_r,B_s,B)$, and $(A,A_s,B_q,B)$ are three independent paths between $A$ and $B$. Similar arguments can be applied if $|A|\neq |B|$.
