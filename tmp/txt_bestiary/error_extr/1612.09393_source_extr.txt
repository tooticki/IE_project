BEGIN Proof 
 Let \begin {enumerate} \item [-] $X=\Spec (A)$. \item [-] $Z= \Spec (A/(f))$ and let $\overline {A}:= A/(f)$. \item [-] $\mathfrak {m}\subset A$ be the maximal ideal of the closed point $p$. \item [-] $F(p)$ denote the residue field of $p$. \par \par \end {enumerate} \par \noindent $\Step {1}$: Since $X/F$ is smooth, $\dim _{F(p)}(\mathfrak {m}/\mathfrak {m}^2)=d$. Choose $\{x_{\scr 1},...,x_{\scr d-1}\} \subset {\mathfrak m}$ such that they span a $d-1$ dimensional $F(p)$-subspace of $\mathfrak {m}/\mathfrak {m}^2$. In this step we claim that there exists $y \in A$ such that \begin {enumerate} \par \item $y\ {\rm mod}\ \mathfrak {m}$ is a primitive element of $ F(p)/F$. \item The set $\{x_1,...,x_{d-1},h(y)\}$ (modulo $\mathfrak {m}^2$) gives a $F(p)$-basis of ${\mathfrak m}/{\mathfrak m}^2$, where $h$ is the minimal polynomial of $y\ {\rm mod}\ \mathfrak {m}$. \item The map $(x_1,\ldots ,x_{d-1},{y}):X \xrightarrow {\eta } \A ^d$ is \'{e}tale at $p$. \item The map $\eta $ induces an isomorphism on residue fields $F(\eta (p)) \to F(p)$. \end {enumerate} \par \par \par Now let $w\in \mathfrak {m}$ be an element such that $\{x_{\scr 1},...,x_{\scr d-1},w\}$ span $\mathfrak {m}/\mathfrak {m}^2$ as a $F(p)$-vector space. Let $c$ be a primitive element of $F(p)/F$ and $h$ be its minimal polynomial. Choose $\hat {y}\in A$ such that $$\hat {y} \equiv c \mod \mathfrak {m}.$$ Since $c$ is separable over $F$, $h'(c)\neq 0$. Thus $h'(\hat {y}) \notin \mathfrak {m}$ or equivalently $h'(\hat {y})$ is a unit in the ring $A/\mathfrak {m}^2$. Choose $\epsilon \in \mathfrak {m}$ such that $$ \epsilon \equiv \frac {w-h(\hat {y})}{h'(\hat {y})} \ \syn {mod} \ \mathfrak {m}^2.$$ Thus the $F(p)$-span of $\{x_{\scr 1},...,x_{\scr d-1},h(\hat {y})+\epsilon h'(\hat {y})\}$ is $\mathfrak {m}/\mathfrak {m}^2$. Let $${y}=\hat {y}+\epsilon .$$ We note that $$h({y})=h(\hat {y}+\epsilon ) \equiv h(\hat {y})+\epsilon h'(\hat {y}) \mod \mathfrak {m}^2.$$ Hence $\{x_1,\ldots ,x_{d-1},h(y)\}$ gives a $F(p)$-basis for $\mathfrak {m}/\mathfrak {m}^2$. \par Now let $\eta $ be the map $(x_1,\ldots ,x_{d-1},{y}):X \xrightarrow {} \A ^d_F$. Since $y \ \syn {mod} \ \mathfrak {m}$ is a primitive element of $F(p)$, one observes that $F(\eta (p)) \to F(p)$ is an isomorphism. It remains to show that $\eta $ is \'{e}tale at $p$. The maximal ideal of $\eta (p)$ in $F[X_1,...,X_d]$ is $\mathfrak {n}=(X_1,\ldots ,X_{d-1},h(X_d))$. As $\{x_1,\ldots ,x_{d-1},h(y)\}$ is a $F(p)$-basis for $\mathfrak {m}/\mathfrak {m}^2$, {that $\eta $ is \'{e}tale at $p$} follows from the surjectivity of $$\mathfrak {n}/\mathfrak {n}^2\xrightarrow {\eta ^*}\mathfrak {m}/\mathfrak {m}^2 .$$ \par \par \noindent $\Step {2}$: Let $U$ be an open neighbourhood of $p$ in $X$ such that $\eta _{\scr {|U}}$ is \'{e}tale. Let $$ B= (X\setminus U) \ \sqcup Z.$$ In this step we modify $x_1,\ldots ,x_{d-1}$ to $z_1,\ldots ,z_{d-1}$ so that \begin {enumerate} \item The map $\tilde {\eta }=(z_1,\ldots ,z_{d-1},{y}):X \rightarrow \A ^d_F$ is \'{e}tale on $U$. \item The set $\{z_1,\ldots ,z_{d-1},h({y})\}$ is a $F(p)$ basis for $\mathfrak {m}/\mathfrak {m}^2$. \item The map $B \xrightarrow {(z_1,\ldots ,z_{d-1})}\A ^{d-1}_F$ is finite. \end {enumerate} \par Let $\tilde {A}:= A/I(B)$ and $\tilde {\mathfrak {m}}$ denote the image of $\mathfrak {m}$ in $\tilde {A}$. For any element $\alpha \in A$, let $\tilde {\alpha }$ denote its image in $\tilde {A}$. Choose $y_1,...,y_m \in A$ which generate $A$ as an $F$ algebra. We expand this generating set to include the $x_i$'s. In particular \begin {align*} A & = F[x_{\scr 1},...,x_{\scr d-1},y_{\scr 1},...,y_{\scr m}],\\ \tilde {A} & = F[\tilde {x}_{\scr 1},...,\tilde {x}_{\scr d-1},\tilde {y}_{\scr 1},...,\tilde {y}_{\scr m}]. \end {align*} The image of $y_{\scr i}$ in $A/\mathfrak {m}$ satisfies a non-constant monic polynomial, say $f_{\scr i}$, over $F$. Let \begin {align*} y_{\scr i,0} & \ :=\ f_i(y_{\scr i}) \in \mathfrak {m}.\\ x_{\scr i,0} & \ := \ x_{\scr i} \\ A_{\scr 0} & \ := \ F[x_{\scr 1,0},..,x_{\scr d-1,0},y_{\scr 1,0},...,y_{\scr m,0}] \\ \tilde {A}_{\scr 0} & \ := \ F[\tilde {x}_{\scr 1,0},..,\tilde {x}_{\scr d-1,0},\tilde {y}_{\scr 1,0},...,\tilde {y}_{\scr m,0}] \end {align*} Clearly, $\tilde {A}$ is finite over $\tilde {A}_{\scr 0}$. \\ \par For $0 \leq r \leq m-1$, we inductively define $A_{\scr r+1}$ and elements $x_{\scr i,r+1}, y_{\scr i, r+1}$ as follows. By \ref {nntrick1}, we choose an integer $\ell _{\scr r}>1$ such that the following definitions make $\tilde {A}_{\scr r}$ a finite $\tilde {A}_{\scr r+1}$-algebra. Since any sufficiently large choice of $\ell _r$ works, we assume that $\ell _r$ is a multiple of the $\Char (F)$. Let \begin {align*} x_{\scr i,r+1}:= & \ \ x_{\scr i,r}-(y_{\scr m-r,r})^{\ell _{\scr r}^i} & \ \forall \ 1\leq i \leq d-1\\ y_{\scr i,r+1}:= & \ \ y_{\scr i,r}-(y_{\scr m-r,r})^{\ell _{\scr r}^{d-1+i}} & \ \forall \ 1\leq i \leq m-r-1 \\ A_{\scr r+1} := & \ \ F[x_{\scr 1,r+1},..,x_{\scr d-1,r+1},y_{\scr 1,r+1},...,y_{\scr m-r-1,r+1}] \\ \tilde {A}_{\scr r+1} := & \ \ F[\tilde {x}_{\scr 1,r+1},..,\tilde {x}_{\scr d-1,r+1},\tilde {y}_{\scr 1,r+1},...,\tilde {y}_{\scr m-r-1,r+1}] \end {align*} Since, $x_{\scr i,0}$ and $y_{\scr i,0}$ belong to $ \mathfrak {m}$, inductively one can observe \begin {align*} & y_{\scr i,r} \in \mathfrak {m} \\ & x_{\scr i,r} \in \mathfrak {m} \\ & x_{\scr i,r+1} \equiv x_{\scr i,r} \ {\rm mod} \ \mathfrak {m}^2 \end {align*} For ease of notation, let us rename $$ z_{\scr i}:= x_{\scr i,m}.$$ Note that for all $i\leq d-1$, $ z_i- x_i$ is of the form $\beta _i^{k_i}$ for $\beta _i\in \mathfrak {m}$ and an integer $k_i$ divisible by $\Char (F)$. This ensures requirements (1) and (2) of Step 2. Recall that $m$ is an integer such that $\{y_1,...,y_m\}$ are the chosen generators of $A$ as an $F$ algebra. It is now straightforward to see that $\{z_{\scr 1},...,z_{\scr d-1}\}\subset \mathfrak {m}$ such that $\tilde {A}$ is a finite algebra over $\tilde {A}_{\scr m}=F[\tilde {z}_{\scr 1},...,\tilde {z}_{\scr d-1}]$. \\ \par \par \noindent $\Step {3}$: In this step we will further modify $y$ while ensuring that $(1)$ and $(2)$ of the above step continue to hold. Since the map $\tilde {\eta }_{\scr |B}:B\to \A ^{d-1}_F$ is finite, there exists finitely many points $\{p,p_1,...,p_t\}\subset B$ which are contained in the zero locus $\syn {Z}(z_{\scr 1},...,z_{\scr d-1})$. Let $\mathfrak {m}_i$ be the maximal ideal corresponding to $p_i$ for $1\leq i \leq t$. By Chinese remainder theorem, choose $\delta \in A$ such that \begin {align*} \delta \equiv 0 & \ \syn {mod}\ \mathfrak {m} & \\ \delta ^{\scr {\rm char}(F)} \equiv {-y} & \ \syn {mod} \ \mathfrak {m}_i \ \ \forall \ 1 \leq i \leq t & ...(\text {note that } A/\mathfrak {m}_i \ \text {is perfect}) \end {align*} Let $$ z= y+\delta ^{\scr {{\rm char}( F)}}.$$ For later use, we note that $$ z\equiv 0 \ \syn {mod} \ \mathfrak {m}_i \ \ \ \forall \ 1\leq i \leq t.$$ Using the fact that $z-y$ is ${\rm char}(F)$-th power of an element of $\mathfrak {m}$, it is straightforward to deduce the following from (1) and (2) of the above step. \begin {enumerate} \item The map $\varphi : X\to \A ^d_F$ defined by $(z_{\scr 1},...,z_{\scr d-1},z)$ is \'{e}tale at $p$. \item $\{z_{\scr 1},...,z_{\scr d-1},h(z)\}$ is an $F(p)$-basis of $\mathfrak {m}/\mathfrak {m}^2$. \item $z \ \syn {mod}\ \mathfrak {m}$ is the primitive element $c$ of $F(p)/F$. \end {enumerate} \par We further claim that we have the following equality of ideals of $\tilde {A}=A/(I(B))$ : $$\sqrt {\left (\tilde {z}_{\scr 1},...,\tilde {z}_{\scr d-1},h(\tilde {z})\right )} = \tilde {\mathfrak {m}}.$$ To see the claim, we first observe \begin {align*} h(z) & \in \tilde {\mathfrak {m}} \\ h(z) & \notin \tilde {\mathfrak {m}}_i \ \ \ \forall \ 1\leq i \leq t. \end {align*} The first containment follows as $h$ is the irreducible polynomial of $z \ \syn {mod} \ \mathfrak {m}$. Moreover, since $h(0)\neq 0$, the second statement follows from the fact that $z\equiv 0 \ \syn {mod} \ \mathfrak {m}_i.$ \par As $\{\tilde {\mathfrak {m}},\tilde {\mathfrak {m}}_1,...,\tilde {\mathfrak {m}}_t\}$ are the only prime ideals of $\tilde {A}$ containing the ideal $(\tilde {z}_{\scr 1},...,\tilde {z}_{\scr d-1})$, and $h(z)\notin \mathfrak {m}_i \ \forall \ i$, we conclude that $\tilde {\mathfrak {m}}$ is the unique prime ideal of $\tilde {A}$ containing the ideal $\left (\tilde {z}_{\scr 1},...,\tilde {z}_{\scr d-1},h(\tilde {z})\right )$. Therefore $$\sqrt {\left (\tilde {z}_{\scr 1},...,\tilde {z}_{\scr d-1},h(\tilde {z})\right )} = \tilde {\mathfrak {m}}.$$ \par \par \par \noindent $\Step {4}$: We claim that in fact $$\big (\tilde {z}_{\scr 1},...,\tilde {z}_{\scr d-1},h(\tilde {z})\big ) = \tilde {\mathfrak {m}}.$$ Note that both are $\tilde {\mathfrak {m}}$-primary ideals and hence it is enough to show the equality in the localization $\tilde {A}_{\tilde {\mathfrak {m}}}.$ But the equality holds in this local ring by Nakayama's Lemma since it holds modulo $\tilde {\mathfrak {m}}^2$ as $\{ z_{\scr 1},...,z_{\scr d-1},h(z)\}$ $\syn {mod} \ \mathfrak {m}^2$ gives a basis of $\mathfrak {m}/\mathfrak {m}^2$ (see condition (2) of the the above Step). \\ \par \noindent $\Step {5}$: Recall that $\varphi : X\to \A ^d_F$ is the map defined by $(z_{\scr 1},...,z_{\scr d-1},z)$. We claim that $p$ is the unique point in $\varphi ^{-1}\varphi (p)\intersection Z$. In fact we have that $p$ is the unique point of $\varphi ^{-1}\varphi (p)\intersection B$. This is a direct consequence of Step 3, since the ideal defining $\varphi ^{-1}\varphi (p)\intersection B$ in $B=\Spec (\tilde {A})$ is equal to $(\tilde {z}_{\scr 1},...,\tilde {z}_{\scr d-1},h(\tilde {z}))=\tilde {\mathfrak m}$. Indeed, what we have observed is that the scheme $\varphi ^{-1}\varphi (p)\intersection B$ is reduced and has $p$ as the only underlying point. Thus the same holds for $\varphi ^{-1}\varphi (p)\intersection Z$. If $\mathfrak {n}$ denotes the maximal ideal in the coordinate ring of $\A ^d_F$ of the point $\varphi (p)$, then $\mathfrak {n}\overline {A} = \overline {\mathfrak {m}}$. Recall that $\overline {A}:=A/(f)$ and $Z=\Spec (\overline {A})$. \\ \par \par \noindent $\Step {6}$: In this step we prove the rest of the theorem using a trick used in the proof of \cite [3.5.1]{chk}. In fact, the argument in this step has been directly taken from {\it loc. cit.} The map $\varphi :Z\to \A ^d_F$ is finite. Let $\mathfrak {n}$ be the maximal ideal of $\varphi (p)$ in $F[X_1,...,X_d]$. By Step 5, $\mathfrak {n}\overline {A}=\overline {\mathfrak {m}}$ and the map $$ \frac {F[X_1,...,X_d]}{\mathfrak {n}} \xrightarrow {\varphi ^*} \frac {\overline {A}}{\mathfrak {n}{\overline {A}}} $$ is an isomorphism, in particular surjective. By Nakayama's lemma, there exists a $g\in F[X_1,...,X_d]\backslash \mathfrak {n}$ such that the map $$ F[X_1,...,X_d]_g \to \overline {A}_g $$ is surjective. In particular, if $V=\A ^d_F\backslash \syn {Z}(g)$, then $$Z \intersection \varphi ^{-1}(V) \to V$$ is a closed immersion. Note that $V$ is an open neighbourhood of $\varphi (p)$. \\ \par \noindent Let $D\subset X$ be the maximal closed subset on which the map $\varphi $ is not \'{e}tale. Clearly $p\notin D$. Also, since $D$ is a subset of $B$ (see Step 2) and $p$ is the only point in $\varphi ^{-1}\varphi (p)\intersection B$, we must have $\varphi (p)\notin \varphi (D)$. However, the map $\varphi _{|B}$ is finite, we have that $\varphi (D)$ is a closed subset of $\A ^d_F$. Let $$ W:= \big ( \A ^d_F\backslash \varphi (D) \big ) \intersection \big ( \A ^d_F\backslash \syn {Z}(g)\big ). $$ Thus $\varphi ^{-1}(W)\to W$ is \'{e}tale. Moreover, $\varphi ^{-1}(W)$ is an open neighbourhood of $p$. It is now clear that $\varphi $ and $W$ satisfy conditions (1) and (2) of the Lemma. Condition (3) is also immediate since the map $\varphi $ is defined by $(z_{\scr 1},...,z_{\scr d-1},z)$ and $z_{\scr i}$ vanish on $p$ for $1\leq i\leq d-1$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Lemma \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 The proof is similar to that of \ref {nntrick1} (see \cite [page 2]{mum}) and hence we only give a sketch. Since $\dim (Z)= n-1$, $\phi _1, \phi _2,\ldots ,\phi _n$ cannot be algebraically independent. Thus there exists a non-zero polynomial $f \in k[Y_1,...,Y_n]$ such that $f(\phi _1, \phi _2,\ldots ,\phi _n)=0$. Let $\ell $ be any integer greater than $n\dg (f)$ where $\dg (f)$ is the total degree of $f$. Let $\tilde {Q}\in k[Y_n]$ be a polynomial such that $Q=\tilde {Q}(\phi _n)$. Inductively define $\tilde {Q}_i$ for $1\leq i \leq n-1$ as follows: \begin {align*} & \tilde {Q}_{n-1} : = \tilde {Q} \\ & \tilde {Q}_i := Y_{i+1} - \tilde {Q}_{i+1}^\ell & \hspace {-10cm} \forall \ 1 \leq i \ \leq n-2. \end {align*} Notice that the polynomials $\tilde {Q}_i$'s are defined such that $$ \tilde {Q}_i(\phi _1,...,\phi _n) = Q_i.$$ Moreover, we note that if $d=Y_n$-degree of $\tilde {Q}$ then each $\tilde {Q}_i$ is monic in $Y_n$ of degree ${\ell }^{n-i-1}d$. Consider the elements $Z_1,...,Z_{n-1}\in k[Y_1,...,Y_n]$ defined as follows: $$ Z_i := Y_i - \tilde {Q}_i^\ell \ \ \ \forall 1 \leq i \leq n-1.$$ \par We leave it to the reader to check that $$ k[Z_1,...,Z_{n-1},Y_n] = k[Y_1,...,Y_n].$$ For future reference, we note that the map $$\eta :\A ^n_F\xrightarrow {(Y_1-\tilde {Q}_1^\ell ,\ldots ,Y_{n-1}-\tilde {Q}_{n-1}^\ell ,Y_n)}\A ^n_F $$ is an automorphism. It is enough to show that the polynomial $f$, expressed in the variables $Z_1,...,Z_{n-1},Y_n$ is monic in $Y_n$. Let us write $f$ as $$f=\Sigma _{I=(i_1,\ldots i_n)} \alpha _I \cdot m_{I}$$ where $m_I$'s are monomials in $Y_1,...,Y_n$ and $\alpha _I \in k$. We leave it to the reader to verify that when expressed in new coordinates $Z_1,\ldots Z_{n-1},Y_n$, each monomial $m_I$ becomes a polynomial which is monic in $Y_n$ of $Y_n$-degree equal to $i_n+\Sigma _{k=1}^{n-1} i_k\cdot {\ell }^{n-k}\cdot d$. Since $\ell > n \dg (f)$, one can show that these $Y_n$-degrees are distinct. Thus in the coordinates $Z_1,...,Z_{n-1},Y_n$, $f$ remains monic in $Y_n$.

BEGIN Proof 
 The argument here is directly taken from \cite [3.5.1]{chk}. We construct an open neighbourhood $V$ of $\Psi (p)$ in $\A ^{d-1}_F$, such that if $Z_V:=\Psi ^{-1}(V) \cap \syn {Z}(f)$ then \begin {enumerate} \item [(i)] $Z_V \subset Z$ \item [(ii)] $\Phi $ is \'{e}tale at all points in $Z_V$ \item [(iii)] $\Phi |_{Z_V}: Z_V \rightarrow \A ^ 1_V $ is closed immersion \end {enumerate} Let $B$ be the smallest closed subset of $\syn {Z}(f)$ containing all points of $\syn {Z}(f)$ at which $\Phi $ is not \'{e}tale and also containing $\syn {Z}(f)\backslash Z$. Since $\Psi _{|\syn {Z}(f)}$ is a finite map, $\Psi (B)$ is closed in $\A ^{d-1}_F$. Moreover, because of conditions $(2)$ and $(3)$ of Definition \ref {defpresents}, we have $\Psi (p) \notin \Psi (B)$. Thus, we can choose affine open subset $W \subset \A ^{d-1}_F$ such that $\Psi (p) \in W \subset \A ^{d-1}_F \backslash \Psi (B)$. Let $Z_W= Z\cap \Psi ^{-1}(W)$. We have following commutative diagram of affine schemes and consequently their coordinate rings. \par \par \begin {center} \begin {minipage}{.4\textwidth } \begin {tikzpicture} \node (E) at (0,0){$Z_W$}; \node at (2,1) (F) {$\A ^1_W$}; \node at (2,-1) (A) {$W$}; \draw [->] (E)--(F) node [midway,above] {$\Phi $}; \draw [->] (F)--(A) node [midway,right] {$\pi $} ; \draw [->] (E)--(A) node [midway, left,below] {$\Psi $} ; \end {tikzpicture} \end {minipage} \begin {minipage}{.2\textwidth } \begin {tikzpicture} \node (E) at (0,0){$ F[Z_W]$}; \node at (2,1) (F) {$F[\A ^1_W]$}; \node at (2,-1) (A) {$F[W]$}; \draw [->] (F)--(E) node [midway,above] {$\Phi ^{*}$}; \draw [->] (A)--(F) node [midway,right] {} ; \draw [->] (A)--(E) node [midway, left,below] {$\Psi ^{*}$} ; \end {tikzpicture} \end {minipage} \par \end {center} \par \par Let $\Psi (p)=q$ and ${\mathfrak m}_q$ be the maximal ideal in $F[W]$ corresponding to $q$. Thus the ideal corresponding to $S=\Psi ^{-1}(q)\intersection Z$ in $F[Z_W]$ is ${\mathfrak m}_q\cdot F[Z_W]$. Since $\Phi $ is radicial as well as \'{e}tale at $S$, $$\Phi _{|S}:S\inj \A ^1_W$$ is a closed immersion. Thus the map on the coordinate rings $$F[\A ^1_W] \twoheadrightarrow \frac {F[Z_W]}{{\mathfrak m}_q F[Z_W]}$$ is surjective. The surjectivity of the above map is equivalent to $$ C\tensor _{F[W]} \frac {F[W]}{{\mathfrak m}_q}=0 $$ where $$C:={\rm Coker}\big (F[\A ^1_W] \rightarrow F[Z_W]\big ).$$ But $C$ is a finite $F[W]$ module. Hence by Nakayama's lemma $C_{{\mathfrak m}_q}=0$. Thus there exists $h \in F[W]\backslash {\mathfrak m}_q$ such that $C_h=0$ or equivalently $$ {F[\A ^1_W]}_h \twoheadrightarrow {F[Z_W]}_h $$ is surjective. Let $V := W\backslash \syn {Z}(h)$. The coordinate ring of $Z_V:=\Psi ^{-1}(V)\intersection \syn {Z}(f)$ is $F[Z_W]_h$ and that of $\pi ^{-1}V$ is $F[\A ^1_W]_h$. Thus the surjectivity of the above map implies that $$ Z_V \inj \A ^1_V$$ is a closed immersion as required. \\ \par Let $U\subset X$ be the maximal open subset containing points at which $\Phi $ is \'{e}tale. To finish the proof, we need to show that $U,V, \Phi _{|U}, \Psi _{|U}$ satisfy conditions $(1),(2),(3)$ of Theorem \ref {gabberfinite}. (1) is clearly satisfied by the definition of $U$. To see (2), note that $\Psi _{|Z(f)}$ is finite, and hence, as $Z_V= \Psi ^{-1}(V) \intersection Z(f)$, $\Psi _{|Z_V}:Z_V \to V$ is finite. (3) is precisely the condition (iii) mentioned at the beginning of the proof. By the construction of $W$, subsequently $V$, it follows that $\Psi ^{-1}(V) \cap \syn {Z}(f) \subset U$.

BEGIN Proof 
 The condition that $f(0,Y_2,...,Y_d)$ and $g(0,Y_2,...,Y_d)$ are nonzero polynomials with no common irreducible factors is equivalent to the condition that no irreducible component of $\syn {Z}(f)\intersection \syn {Z}(g)$ is contained in $\syn {Z}(Y_1)$. \par By Noether normalization trick \ref {nntrick1}, we may assume, by a suitable coordinate change, that the projection $$ (X_2,...,X_{d}) : \syn {Z}(f)\intersection \syn {Z}(g) \xrightarrow {\eta } \A ^{d-1}_F$$ is finite. Note that since $d\geq 3$, the image of every irreducible component of $\syn {Z}(f)\intersection \syn {Z}(g)$ under $\eta $ is of dimension at least one. Thus we may choose closed points $z_1,...,z_\tau $, one in each irreducible component of $\syn {Z}(f)\intersection \syn {Z}(g)$ such that $\eta (z_i)$ are pairwise distinct and also different from $\eta (p)$. For every closed point $x$ of $\A ^d_F$, either $X_1$ or $X_1+1$ is non-vanishing on $x$. Thus for each $z_i$, we choose $\epsilon _i=0$ or $1$, such that $X_1+\epsilon _i$ does not vanish on $z_i$. By Chinese remainder theorem, there exists a polynomial $\gamma \in F[X_2,...,X_{d}]$ such that $$ \gamma (\eta (z_i))= \epsilon _i \ \ \ \text {and} \ \ \ \gamma (p)=0.$$ It is now straightforward to check that $$Y_1:= X_1-\gamma \ \ \ \text {and} \ \ \ Y_i:=X_i \ \ \forall \ 2\leq i\leq d$$ satisfies our requirement.

Let $$\overline {\Phi }:=(\overline {\phi }_2,...,\overline {\phi }_d) \ \ \text {and} \ \ \overline {\Psi }:=(\overline {\phi }_2,...,\overline {\phi }_{d-1}).$$ By Lemma \ref {nakarg}, there exist neighbourhoods $\overline {V}\subset \A ^{d-1}_F$ and $\overline {U}\subset \overline {X}$ of $\overline {\Psi }(p)$ and $p$ respectively such that if $$ \overline {Z}_{\overline {V}}:= \overline {Z}\intersection \overline {\Psi }^{-1}(\overline {V})$$ then the following conditions of Theorem \ref {gabberfinite} \begin {enumerate} \item $\overline {\Phi }_{|\overline {U}}$ is \'{e}tale \item $\overline {\Psi }_{|\overline {Z}_{\overline {V}}} : \overline {Z}_{\overline {V}} \to \overline {V}$ is finite \item $\overline {\Phi }_{|\overline {Z}_{\overline {V}} } : \overline {Z}_{\overline {V}} \to \A ^1_{\overline {V}}$ is a closed immersion \end {enumerate} {are satisfied.}\\ Further, by Lemma \ref {normalizev}, we also assume (without loss of generality) that if $E$ is the closed subset of ${Z(\bar {f})}$ defined by $$ {E:=Z(\bar {f})\backslash \overline {\Psi }^{-1}(\overline {V})} $$ then \begin {enumerate} \item [(4)] $ \dim ( E \intersection \syn {Z}(\overline {\phi }_2,...,\overline {\phi }_{d-2}) ) = 0.$ \end {enumerate} Note that (4) is vacuously satisfied unless $d\geq 4$. Indeed for $d = 3$, $\A ^{d-2}_{F}\setminus V$ is a finite set, and since $\Psi _{|Z(f)}:Z(\bar {f})\rightarrow \A ^{d-2}_F$ is finite, $E$ is thus a finite set. \par \noindent $\Step {1}$: Since $\syn {Z}(\overline {f}) \xrightarrow {(\overline {\phi }_2,...,\overline {\phi }_{d-1})} \A ^{d-2}_F$ is finite (see \ref {defpresents}(1)), for $2\leq i \leq d$, the image of $X_i$ in $F[X_2,...,X_d]/(\overline {f})$ satisfies a monic polynomial $$ P_i(T) := T^{m_i}+a_{m_i-1,i}T^{m_i-1} + \cdots + a_{0,i} $$ where each $a_{i,j} \in F[\overline {\phi }_2,...,\overline {\phi }_{d-1}]$. So $P_i(X_i)$ is zero in $F[X_2,...,X_d]/(\bar {f})$. Note that each $\overline {\phi }_i$ is an element of $F[X_2,...,X_d]$. Thus we have a map of algebras $$F[\overline {\phi }_2,...,\overline {\phi }_{d-1}][T] \rightarrow F[X_1,...,X_d][T]/(f).$$ We let $\tilde {P}_i(T)$ be the image of the polynomial $P_i(T)$ under this map. Since $P_i(X_i)$ is zero in $F[X_2,...,X_d]/(\bar {f})$, $\tilde {P}_i(X_i)$ maps to zero via the map $$ F[X_1,...,X_d]/(f) \xrightarrow {X_1\mapsto 0} F[X_2,...,X_d]/(\overline {f}).$$ Therefore $$ \tilde {P}_i(X_i) = X_1g_i$$ for some $g_i\in F[X_1,...,X_d]/(f)$. We claim that the map $$ \syn {Z}(f) \xrightarrow {(\overline {\phi }_2,...,\overline {\phi }_{d},X_1,X_1g_2,...,X_1g_d)} \A ^{2d-1}_F $$ is finite. This is clear because for $i\geq 2$, each $X_i$ satisfies the monic polynomial $\tilde {P}_i(T)-X_1g_i$ with coefficients which are polynomial expressions in the functions defining the above map. Applying \ref {nntrick1} repeatedly to this map (see Remark \ref {q=phin}), we get $\phi _2,...,\phi _d\in F[X_1,...,X_d]$ such that $$ \phi _i \equiv \overline {\phi }_i \ \ \syn {mod} \ X_1$$ and the map $(\phi _2,...,\phi _{d})_{|\syn {Z}({f})}$ is finite. \par \par \noindent $\Step {2}$: Consider the maps \begin {enumerate} \item [] $\widetilde {\Phi } :\A ^d_F \xrightarrow {(X_1,\phi _2,...,\phi _d)} \A ^{d}_F$ \item [] $\widetilde {\Psi }:\A ^d_F \xrightarrow {(X_1,\phi _2,...,\phi _{d-1})} \A ^{d-1}_F$. \end {enumerate} Note that for all points $x\in \syn {Z}(X_1)$, $\widetilde {\Phi }$ is \'{e}tale at $x$ iff $\syn {Z}(X_1)\xrightarrow {\overline {\phi }_2,...,\overline {\phi }_{d}} \A ^{d-1}_F$ is \'{e}tale at $x$. Let $E$ be the closed subset of $\syn {Z}(\overline {f})\subset \syn {Z}(f)$ defined in Step 0. We have the following: \begin {enumerate} \item $\widetilde {\Phi }_{|\syn {Z}(f)}$ is finite. In fact, the map $(\phi _2,...,\phi _d)_{|\syn {Z}(f)}$ is finite. \item $\widetilde {\Psi }(p) \notin \widetilde {\Psi }(E)$ (this follows from the definition of $E$) \item $\widetilde {\Phi }$ restricted to $\syn {Z}(\overline {f})\backslash E$ is a locally closed immersion. \item $\widetilde {\Phi }$ is \'{e}tale at all points in $\syn {Z}(\overline {f})\backslash E$. \end {enumerate} By condition (4) of Step 0, $$E\intersection \syn {Z}(\overline {\phi }_2,...,\overline {\phi }_{d-2})= E\intersection \syn {Z}(\phi _2,...,\phi _{d-2}) \footnote {where by convention $\syn {Z}(\phi _2,...,\phi _{d-3})$ is the whole of $\A ^d_F$ if $d\leq 3$.} $$ is finite. Let $Q$ be any non-constant polynomial expression in $\phi _d$ which vanishes on the finite set $$\bigg (E\intersection \syn {Z}(\phi _2,...,\phi _{d-2})\bigg ) \union \big \{p\big \}.$$ Let $\ell $ be a large enough integer which is divisible by $\Char (F)$. Let $\phi _1=X_1$ and as in Lemma \ref {nntrick}, let $ Q_{d-1}:= Q$ and $$ Q_i : = \phi _{i+1}-Q_{i+1}^\ell \ \ \forall \ i\leq d-2 . $$ Let $$ \Phi :=(\phi _1-Q_1^\ell ,\ldots , \phi _{d-1}-Q_{d-1}^\ell ,\phi _d): \A ^d_F \longrightarrow \A ^d_F$$ $$ \Psi :=(\phi _1-Q_1^\ell ,\ldots , \phi _{d-1}-Q_{d-1}^\ell ): \A ^d_F \to \A ^{d-1}_F.$$ \par By Lemma \ref {nntrick} $\Psi _{|\syn {Z}(f)}$ is finite. We let $S$ be the finite set of points in $\Psi ^{-1}\Psi (p)\intersection \syn {Z}(f)$. To finish the proof, it suffices to verify the conditions (2)-(4) of Definition \eqref {defpresents}. We first note that $S\subset \syn {Z}(\phi _1,...,\phi _{d-2})$. This is because if $x\in S$, then by definition of $S$, $$ \phi _{i+1}-Q_{i+1}^\ell (x) = Q_{i}(x) = 0 \ \ \ \forall \ \ i\leq d-2.$$ And thus $$ \phi _i-Q_i^{\ell }(x) = \phi _i(x) = 0 \ \ \ \forall \ \ i\leq d-2.$$ \par We now show that $S$ is disjoint from $E$. First note that $S \subset \syn {Z}(\phi _1)=\syn {Z}(X_1)$. Also {$\Psi (p)=0$ since $Q(p)=0$ and $\phi _i(p)=0$ for $1\leq i\leq d-1$}. Let $x\in S\intersection E$ if possible. Hence $x$ is necessarily in $E\intersection \syn {Z}(\phi _2,...,\phi _{d-2})$ by the above argument. In particular we note that $\phi _{d-2}(x)=0$. Now we claim that $$ \phi _{d-1}(x)=0.$$ Since $\Psi (x)=0$ we have $(\phi _{d-2}-Q_{d-2}^\ell )(x)=0$. But as $\phi _{d-2}(x)=0$, we conclude that $$ Q_{d-2}(x)=0.$$ Thus $$\phi _{d-1}(x)=(Q_{d-2}-Q^{\ell })(x)=0.$$ This proves the claim. Consequently, $x\in Z(\phi _2,\ldots \phi _{d-1})$. By definition of $E$, $x \in E$ implies $\bar {\Psi }(x)\notin \bar {V}$ where $\bar {V}$ is as defined in Step 0. As $\bar {V}$ is a neighborhood of $0=\Psi (p)$, we have $\bar {\Psi }(x) \neq 0$. But as $x\in E \subset Z(X_1)$, we have $$ \bar {\Psi }(x)= (\phi _2,...,\phi _{d-1})(x)=(\bar {\phi }_2,...,\bar {\phi }_{d-1})(x).$$ Hence $\phi _i(x)\neq 0 $ for some $ i$ with $2\leq i \leq d-1.$ This is a contradiction to the fact that $x\in Z(\phi _2,\ldots \phi _{d-1})$. Hence $S$ must be disjoint from $E$. Hence $ \tilde {\Phi }$ is a locally closed immersion on $S$ by property (3) of Step 2. \par As in the proof of Lemma \ref {nntrick}, we let $$\A ^{d-2}_F\xrightarrow {\ \ \eta \ \ } \A ^{d-2}_F$$ be the automorphism defined by $$\eta ={(Y_1-\tilde {Q}_1^\ell ,\ldots ,Y_{d-1}-\tilde {Q}_{d-1}^\ell ,Y_d)}$$ where $\tilde {Q}_i\in F[Y_1,...,Y_d]$ are polynomials satisfying $Q_i= \tilde {Q}_i(\phi _1,...,\phi _{d})$. It is straightforward to check that $$ \Phi = \eta \circ \tilde {\Phi }. $$ Hence $\Phi $ is a locally closed immersion on $S$, this proves condition (4) of Definition \ref {defpresents}. \par From Lemma \ref {nakarg} we have $Z(f) \cap \Psi ^{-1}(V) \subset X$. This with the fact that $Z=Z(f)\cap X$ implies conditions (2) of Definition \ref {defpresents}. For checking condition (3), i.e. to check $\Phi $ is \'{e}tale at all points in $S$, we note that since $\ell $ is divisible by $\Char (F)$, $\Phi $ is \'{e}tale precisely at those points where $\widetilde {\Phi }$ is \'{e}tale. In particular $\Phi $ is \'{e}tale at all points of $\syn {Z}(\overline {f})\backslash E$.

BEGIN Lemma \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 Without loss of generality, we may assume $C$ is irreducible and hence we simply have to show that the set $$ \big \{ x \in C^{(1)} \ | \ \dg _{{F}}(Y(x)) = \dg _{{F}}(x) \big \}$$ is infinite. Let $x_1,...,x_q$ be the $F$-rational points of $\A ^1_F$. Let $C' : = C\backslash Y^{-1}(\{x_1,...,x_q\})$. $C'$ is a dense open subset of $C$ as $Y_{|C}$ is finite. Now, any point $x \in C'$ of prime degree satisfies $\dg _{{F}}(Y(x))=\dg _{{F}}(x)$. By Lang-Weil estimates \cite {lw}, for all large enough prime number $\ell $, there is a point $x\in C'^{(1)}$ of degree $\ell $. Hence, since $\ell $ is a prime, we must have $\dg _{{F}}(Y(x))=\dg _{{F}}(x)$. This proves the lemma.

 By Lang-Weil estimates \cite {lw} there exists $c'\in \N $ such that for all $n\geq 1$, $$ \hash \big ( \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr = n} \big ) \leq c'\cdot q^{n}.$$ \par \par For reasons which be clear during the course of the calculations below, we choose $r_0$ and $c$ as follows. {Recall that $m$ is the $X$-degree of $f$.} Let $r_0$ be any integer satisfying \begin {enumerate} \item [(i)] $r_0 > {\rm max} \big \{ \dg (p), \dg (p_1),...,\dg (p_t), \dg (q_1),..., \dg (q_s)\big \}$. \item [(ii)] $\displaystyle {\Bigg ( \sum _{i>r_0/m} \frac {1}{q^{i}} \Bigg )\cdot \Bigg ( c'+ \binom {m}{2} + \frac {m}{2} \Bigg ) <1-\sum _{x\in T}q^{- \dg (x)}.}$ \end {enumerate} Note that it is always possible to ensure (ii) as $$ \Bigg (\sum _{i>r_0/m} \frac {1}{q^{i}}\Bigg ) \to 0 \ \ \ \text {as} \ \ \ r_0\to \infty $$ and as degrees of points in $T$ are distinct we have $$ \sum _{x\in T}q^{-\dg (x)} < \sum _{i=1}^\infty q^{-i} \leq 1.$$ Let $$ c = \sum _{x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r_0}} \dg (x). $$ \par Let $d\geq c+2r_0$ be any integer and $r:=(d-c)/{3}$. Let \begin {align*} \sT & := \big \{ \phi \in A_{\scr \leq d} \ | \ \phi \mbox { satisfies (a) } \ \text {and} \ \phi (x)=1 \ \forall \ x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r_0} \backslash T \big \}. \\ \sT _b & := \big \{\phi \in \sT \ | \ \phi \ \text {does not satisfy} (b_{r}) \big \} \\ \sT _c & := \big \{\phi \in \sT \ | \ \phi \ \text {does not satisfy} (c_{r}) \big \} \\ \sT _d & := \big \{\phi \in \sT \ | \ \phi \ \text {does not satisfy} (d_{r}) \big \} \end {align*} Let $$\delta := \frac {\hash \sT }{\hash A_{\scr \leq d}}, \ \^^M\delta _b := \frac {\hash \sT _b}{\hash A_{\scr \leq d}}, \ \^^M\delta _c := \frac {\hash \sT _c}{\hash A_{\scr \leq d}}, \ \^^M\delta _d := \frac {\hash \sT _d}{\hash A_{\scr \leq d}}. $$ \\ \\ In the following steps we will estimate $\delta ,\delta _b,\delta _c,\delta _d$. \\ \\ \noindent $\Step {1}:$ (Estimation for $\delta $) : Note that the condition that $\phi $ belongs to $\sT $ depends solely on the image of $\phi $ in the zero dimensional ring $$ \prod _{x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\leq {r_0}}} (\sO _x/m_x). $$ Since the {dimension over $F$} of the above ring is $c$ and since $d\geq c$, by \cite [Lemma 2.1]{poonen} the map $$ A_{\scr \leq d} \stackrel {\rho }{\longrightarrow } \prod _{x\in \syn {Z}(f)\leq {r_0}} (\sO _x/m_x)$$ is surjective. One can easily see that $\sT $ is a coset of $\Ker (\rho )$. Therefore $$ \delta = \prod _{x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r_0}}q^{-\dg (x)}.$$ \\ \par \par \noindent $\Step {2}:$ (Estimation for $\delta _b$) : Let $x \in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \scr \leq r}$ where recall that $r=(d-c)/{3}$. The following are equivalent : \begin {enumerate} \item [(i)] $\phi \in \sT $ and $\phi (x)=0$ and $\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}(x)=0$. \item [(ii)] $\phi \in \sT $ and $\phi \ \syn {mod} \ {\mathfrak m}_x^2$ lies in the kernel of the linear map $\frac {\partial }{\partial X}: \frac {{\mathfrak m}_x}{{\mathfrak m}_x^2} \to F(x).$ \end {enumerate} \par Let us first consider the case when $\dg (x)>r_0$. In this case, each of the above condition for $\phi $ depends only on its image in the zero dimensional ring $$ \Bigg (\prod _{\substack { q\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq {r_0}}} } (\sO _q/m_q) \Bigg )\times (\sO _x/m_{x}^2) .$$ The cardinality of the above ring is $$\bigg (\prod _{y\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r_0}} q^{\dg (y)}\bigg ) \cdot q^{3 \dg (x)}.$$ Let us call an element $\xi $ in the above ring as a favorable value iff all $\phi $ mapping to $\xi $ satisfy the above conditions. It is an easy exercise to check that the set of all favorable values has cardinality $q^{\dg (x)}$. Thus the ratio of the number of favorable values to the cardinality of the ring is nothing but $\delta q^{-2 \dg (x)}$. The {dimension over $F$} of this ring is $c+3 {\cdot \dg (x)}$. Since $d\geq c+3{\cdot \dg (x)}$, by \cite [Lemma 2.1]{poonen}, $A_{\scr \leq d}$ surjects onto this ring. Due to this, the ratio of $\phi \in A_{\scr \leq d}$ satisfying the above two conditions to the $\# A_{\scr \leq d}$ is nothing but $\delta q^{-2 \dg (x)}$. In other words, $$ \frac { \hash \big \{ \phi \in \sT \ | \ \phi (x)=0, \ \frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}(x)=0 \big \}}{\hash A_{\scr \leq d}} = \delta \cdot q^{-2 \dg (x)}.$$ \par Now let us consider the case where $\dg (x)\leq r_0$. We claim that unless $x\in T$, there is no $\phi \in \sT $ which vanishes on $x$. This follows from the definition of $\sT $. So let us assume $ x\in T$. In this case, the above two conditions for $\phi $ depend solely on the image of $\phi $ in the ring $$ \Bigg (\prod _{\substack { q\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq {r_0}}\\ q\neq x } } (\sO _q/m_q) \Bigg )\times (\sO _x/m_{x}^2) .$$ Proceeding in a manner similar to the case where $\dg (x)>r_0$, we find that for $x\in T$, $$ \frac { \hash \big \{ \phi \in \sT \ | \ \phi (x)=0, \ \frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}(x)=0 \big \}}{\hash A_{\scr \leq d}} = \delta \cdot q^{- \dg (x)}.$$ \par \par Since $$ \sT _b = \Union _{\substack {x \in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r} \text { such that} \\ \ x\in T \ {\text or} \ \dg (x)> r_0}} \hspace {-5mm} \big \{ \phi \in \sT \ | \ \phi (x)=0, \ \frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}(x)=0 \big \}$$ \par \par \par we get an estimate \begin {align*} \delta _b & \leq \sum _{x\in T} \delta q^{- \dg (x)} + \sum _{\substack {x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r} \text { such that} \\\dg (x)>r_0}} \delta \cdot q^{-2 \dg (x)} \\ & \leq \delta \bigg ( \sum _{x\in T} q^{- \dg (x)}+ \sum _{r_0<i\leq r} c'q^{-i}\bigg ) \end {align*}\\ where recall that $c'$ was the constant in Lang-Weil estimates such that $\# \syn {Z}(f)_{=n} \leq c' q^n$. \\ \par \noindent $\Step {3}:$ (Estimation for $\delta _c$): Let $y\in \A ^1_F$ with $i:=\dg (y)\leq r$. Let $$ \sT _c^y := \Big \{ \phi \in \sT \ | \ \exists \ \text {distinct} \ x_1, x_2 \in \syn {Z}(f)_{=i} \ \text {with}\ Y(x_1)=Y(x_2)=y \ \text {and} \ \phi (x_1)=\phi (x_2)=0\Big \}.$$ First, note that $\sT _c^y$ is empty unless $i>r_0$. This is because the only points of degree $\leq r_0$ on which a $\phi \in \sT $ vanishes are the points in $T$. However, by choice, all points in $ x \in T$ have different degrees and satisfy $\deg (x)=\deg (Y(x))$. Thus, let us assume $i>r_0$. In this case, we claim that $$ \frac { \hash \sT _c^y } {\hash A_{\scr \leq d}} \leq \delta \cdot {m\choose 2}\cdot q^{-2i}.$$ For fixed $x_1,x_2$ with $Y(x_1)=Y(x_2)=y$, $$ \Big \{ \phi \in \sT \ | \ \phi (x_1)=\phi (x_2)=0 \Big \}$$ is a coset of the kernel of the following map $$ A_{\scr \leq d} \longrightarrow \bigg ( \prod _{q\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq {r_0}}} (\sO _q/m_q) \bigg ) \times (\sO _{x_1}/m_{{x_1}}) \times (\sO _{x_2}/m_{{x_2}}) $$ which is surjective by \cite [2.1]{poonen}. Thus $$ \frac { \hash \Big \{ \phi \in \sT \ | \ \phi (x_1)=\phi (x_2)=0.\Big \}} {\hash A_{\scr \leq d}} \leq \delta \cdot q^{-2i}.$$ To prove the claim we now simply observe that since $f$ is monic in $X$ of degree $m$ there are atmost $m\choose {2}$ possible choices for a pair $\{x_1,x_2\}$ as above. \\ \par \noindent As discussed above, since $\sT _c^y$ is empty unless $i>r_0$, we have $$ \sT _c = \Union _{\substack {y\in \A ^1_F \\ r_0< \dg (y)\leq r}} \sT _c^y.$$ For a fixed $i$, $$ \hash \big \{ y\in \A ^1_F \ | \ \dg (y)=i\big \} \leq q^i.$$ From this, it is elementary to deduce $$ \delta _c=\frac {\hash \sT _c}{\hash A_{\scr \leq d}} \leq \delta \Big ( \sum _{r_0<i\leq r} {m \choose 2} q^{-i}\Big ).$$\\ \par \par \noindent $\Step {4}:$ (Estimation for $\delta _d$): As in the above step, let $y\in \A ^1_F$ with $i:=\dg (y)\leq r$. Let $$ \sT _d^y := \Big \{ \phi \in \sT \ | \ \exists \ x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r} \ \text {with} \ \phi (x)=0 \ , \ Y(x)=y \ \text {and}\ \dg (x)> i .\Big \}.$$ \par We first claim that $\sT _d^y$ is empty unless $\dg (y)>r_0/m$. Otherwise, there would exist a $\phi \in \sT $ and an $x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r}$ with $Y(x)=y$, $\phi (x)=0$ and $\dg (x)> \dg (y)$. But as $f$ is monic in $X$ of degree $m$, the maximum degree of a point $x$ lying over $y$ is $m \cdot \dg (y)\leq r_0$. Which means $x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r_0}$. However as $\phi \in \sT $, the only points in $\syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r_0}$ on which $\phi $ vanishes are those in $T$. Thus $x\in T$. But by \eqref {notationa2}(5)(c), for such $x$, $\dg (Y(x))=\dg (y)=\dg (x)$ which is a contradiction. \\ \par We will now estimate $$ \frac { \hash \sT _d^y } {\hash A_{\scr \leq d}}.$$ \par Fix a point $x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\leq r}$ with $\dg (x)>i$ and $Y(x)=y$. For this $x$, we first note that because of \eqref {notationa2}(5)(c), $x\notin T$. \par For $\dg (x)>r_0$ we note that $$ \frac { \hash \Big \{ \phi \in \sT \ | \ \phi (x)=0.\Big \}} {\hash A_{\scr \leq d}} \leq \delta \cdot q^{-\dg (x)}\leq \delta \cdot q^{-2i}.$$ This is deduced, as before, from the surjectivity of $$ A_{\scr \leq d} \longrightarrow \bigg (\prod _{q\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq {r_0}}} (\sO _q/m_q) \bigg )\times (\sO _{x}/m_{{x}})$$ \par If $\dg (x)\leq r_0$, $\Big \{ \phi \in \sT \ | \ \phi (x)=0\Big \}$ is empty as there is no points in $\syn {Z}(f)\backslash T$ on which a $\phi \in \sT $ vanishes. And hence, the above estimate trivially holds in this case also. \par As $f$ is monic in $X$ of degree $m$, and $\dg (x)\geq 2i$, there are at most $\frac {m}{2}$ possible choices for $x\in \syn {Z}(f)$ such that $Y(x)=y$. This shows that $$ \frac { \hash \sT _d^y } {\hash A_{\scr \leq d}} \leq \delta \cdot \frac {m}{2}\cdot q^{-2i}.$$ \par \par \par \par Since, as discussed above, $\sT _d^y$ is empty unless $\dg (y)>r_0/m$, we have $$ \sT _d = \Union _{y\in (\A ^1_F)_{\scr \geq r_0/m}} \sT _d^y.$$ \par \par For a fixed $i$, $$ \hash \big \{ y\in \A ^1_F \ | \ \dg (y)=i\big \} \leq q^i.$$ Thus $$ \delta _d=\frac {\hash \sT _d}{\hash A_{\scr \leq d}} \leq \delta \Big ( \sum _{r_0/m<i\leq r} \frac {m}{2}\ q^{-i}\Big ).$$ \\ \noindent $\Step {5}:$ (Estimation for $\sP $): If we let $$ \sP _d := \Big \{ \phi \in A_{ \scr \leq d} \ | \ \phi \ {\rm satisfies}\ (a), (b_{\scriptscriptstyle (d-c)/{3}}), (c_{\scriptscriptstyle (d-c)/{3}}), (d_{\scriptscriptstyle (d-c)/{3}}) \ {\rm and} \ \phi (x)=1 \ \forall \ x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr \leq r_0} \backslash T \Big \},$$ then $$\sP _d = \sT \backslash (\sT _b\cup \sT _c \cup \sT _d). $$ Therefore \begin {align*} \frac {\hash \sP _d}{\hash A_{\scr \leq d}} & \geq \delta - \delta _b- \delta _c -\delta _d \\ & \geq \delta \Bigg [1 - \sum _{x\in T}q^{- \dg (x)} - \sum _{r_0<i\leq r} c'q^{-i}- \sum _{r_0<i\leq r} {m \choose 2} q^{-i} - \sum _{r_0/m<i\leq r} \frac {m}{2}\ q^{-i} \Bigg ] \\ & \geq \delta \Bigg [ 1- \sum _{x\in T}q^{- \dg (x)} - \Bigg ( \sum _{r_0/m<i \leq r} \frac {1}{q^{i}} \Bigg )\cdot \Bigg ( c'+ \binom {m}{2} + \frac {m}{2} \Bigg ) \Bigg ] \end {align*} Note that in the above expression $r=(d-c)/{3}$. As $d\to \infty $, so does $r$. Hence we observe that $$ \syn {inf} \Big ( \frac {\hash \sP _d}{\hash A_{\scr \leq d}} \Big ) \geq \delta \Bigg [ 1- \sum _{x\in T}q^{- \dg (x)}- \Bigg ( \sum _{i>r_0/m} \frac {1}{q^{i}} \Bigg )\cdot \Bigg ( c'+ \binom {m}{2} + \frac {m}{2} \Bigg ) \Bigg ] $$ which is positive, thanks to the definition of $r_0$. Thus the lower density of $$\sP = \Union _d \sP _d$$ is positive as required.

 The proof is identical to that of \cite [2.6]{poonen}. We reproduce the argument verbatim here for the convenience of the reader. We will bound the probability of $\phi $ constructed as $$\phi =\phi _0+g^p X+h^p$$ and for which there is a point $x\in \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr > (d-c)/{3}}$ with $\phi (x)= \frac {\del \phi }{\del X}(x)= 0$. Note that if $\phi $ is of the above form, then $$ \frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}=\frac {\partial \phi _0}{\partial X}+g^p.$$ Further, if $\phi _0\in A_{\scr \leq d}$, $g \in A_{\scr \leq d-1/p}$ and $h\in A_{\scr \leq d/p}$, then $\phi \in A_{\scr \leq d}$. Define $$W_0:=\syn {Z}(f) \ \ \ \text {and} \ \ \ W_1:=\syn {Z}\Big (f,\frac {\del \phi }{\del X}\Big ).$$ Note that $\syn {dim}(W_0)=1$. \\ Let $$ \gamma := \rdown {\frac {d-1}{p}} \ \ \ \text {and} \ \ \ \eta = \rdown {\frac {d}{p}}.$$ \par \noindent Claim 1: The probability (as a function of $d$) of choosing $\phi _0 \in A_{\scr \leq d}$ and $g\in A_{\scr \leq (d-1)/p}$ such that $\syn {dim}(W_1)=0$ is $1-o(1)$ as $d\to \infty $.\\ \\ Let $V_1,...,V_{\ell }$ be $F$ irreducible components of $W_0$. Clearly $\ell \leq \dg (f)$ (where $\dg (f)$ is the total degree). Since the projection onto the $Y$ coordinate is finite on $\syn {Z}(f)$ (by \eqref {notationa2}(2)), we know that $Y(V_k)$ is of dimension one for all $k$. We will now bound the set $$ G_k^{\rm bad} := \Big \{ g \in A_{\scr \leq \gamma } \ | \ \frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}= \frac {\partial \phi _0}{\partial X}+g^p \ \text {vanishes identically on}\ V_k \Big \}.$$ If $g,g'\in G_k^{\rm bad}$, then $g-g'$ vanishes on $V_k$. Thus if $G_k^{\rm bad}$ is non-empty, it is a coset of the subspace of functions in $A_{\scr \gamma }$ which vanish identically on $V_k$. The codimension of that subspace, or equivalently the dimension of the image of $A_{\scr \gamma }$ in the regular functions on $V_k$ is at least $\gamma +1$, since no polynomial in $Y$ vanishes on $V_k$. Thus the probability that $\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}$ vanishes on $V_k$ is at most $q^{-\gamma -1}$. Thus, the probability that $\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}$ vanishes on some $V_k$ is at most $\ell q^{-\gamma -1}=o(1)$. Since $\dim (W_1)=0$ iff $\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}$ does not identically vanish on any component $V_k$, the claim follows. \\ \par \par We will now estimate the probability of choosing $h$ such that there is no bad point in $Z(f)$, i.e. a point in $\syn {Z}(f)_{\scr > (d-c)/{3}}$ where both $\phi $ and $\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}$ vanish. Note that the set of such bad points is precisely $$ \syn {Z}(\phi )\intersection W_1 \intersection \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr > (d-c)/{3}}.$$ \noindent Claim 2: Conditioned on the choice of $\phi _0$ and $g$ such that $W_1$ is finite, the probability of choosing $h$ such that $$ \syn {Z}(\phi )\intersection W_1 \intersection \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr > (d-c)/{3}}=\emptyset $$ is $1-o(1)$ as $d\to \infty $. \\ \\ It is clear by the Bezout theorem that $\hash W_1 = O(d)$. For a given $x\in W_1$, the set $$H^{\rm bad} = \big \{ h\in A_{\eta } \ | \ \phi =\phi _0+g^pX+h^p \text { vanishes on } x \big \} $$ is either $\emptyset $ or a coset of $\Ker \big ( A_{\scr \eta } \xrightarrow {ev_x} F(x)\big )$ where $F(x)$ is the residue field of $x$. For the purpose of this claim, we only need to consider $x$ such that $\dg (x)>(d-c)/{3}$. In this case, \cite [Lemma 2.5]{poonen} implies that $$ \frac {\hash H^{\rm bad}}{\hash A_{\scr \eta }} \leq q^{-\nu } \ \ \ \text {where } \ \nu =\syn {min}(\eta +1,(d-c)/{3}).$$ Thus, the probability that both $\phi $ and $\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}$ vanish at such $x$ is at most $q^{-\nu }$. There are at most $\hash W_1$ many possibilities for $x$. Thus the probability that there exists a 'bad point', i.e. point in $x\in W_1$ with $\dg (x)> (d-c)/{3}$ such that both $\phi $ and $\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial X}$ vanish at such $x$ is at most $\big (\hash W_1\big )q^{-\nu } = O(dq^{-\nu })$. Since as $d\to \infty $, $\nu $ grows linearly in $d$, $O(dq^{-\nu })=o(1)$. In other words, the probability of choosing $h$ such that there is no bad point is $1-o(1)$. \\ \par \par Combining the above two claims, it follows that the probability of choosing $\phi =\phi _0+g^pX+h^p$ such that $$\syn {Z}(\phi )\intersection W_1 \intersection \syn {Z}(f)_{\scr > (d-c)/{3}}=\emptyset $$ is equal to $(1-o(1))(1-o(1))=1-o(1)$. This shows that $\mu (Q)=0$.

BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of Lemma \ref {phiexists}] Let $\overline {Q}$ denote the complement of $Q$ in $A$. Let $\sP $ be as in Lemma \ref {findg}. To prove Lemma \ref {phiexists} we need to show that $\sP \intersection \overline {Q}$ is non-empty. However, combining the above two lemma's, we in fact get that $\mu (\sP \intersection \overline {Q})>0$. This finishes the proof.

BEGIN Lemma \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 \underline {Step(1)}: In this step we will show that with the given choice of $d$, it is possible to choose $h_1$ which satisfies condition (1) of the Lemma. \\ We claim that $$ \hash S_{=i} \leq \hash (\A ^1_F)_{\scr =i} \ \ \forall \ i\geq 1.$$ As explained in Remark \ref {sfinite}, $\syn {Z}(\phi )\intersection \syn {Z}(f)$ is finite. By Bezout theorem, $\hash S\leq \dg (\phi )\dg (f) = dm$. Thus the above claim holds for all $i> (d-c)/{3}$ by the choice of $d$. On the other hand, the claim also holds for $i\leq (d-c)/{3}$, since by Lemma \ref {phiexists}, $Y$ is radicial at $S_{\scr \leq (d-c)/{3}}$. Thus we can choose a set theoretic map $S \xrightarrow {\tilde {h}} \A ^1_F$ which is injective and preserves degree of points. By Chinese remainder theorem, there exists an $h_1\in F[X,Y]$ such that for all $x\in S$ $$ h_1(x)= \tilde {h}(x).$$\\ \par \noindent \underline {Step(2)}: Now, using the $h_1$ from above step, we will find a $h_2\in F[X,Y]$ which satisfies conditions (1) and (2) of the Lemma. It is sufficient to find an $h_2\in F[X,Y]$ such that \begin {align*} (i) \ \ h_2 \equiv h_1 &\ \ \ \ \syn {mod} \ {\mathfrak m}_x \ \ \forall \ x\in S \\ (ii) \ \ \frac {\partial h_2}{\partial X}(x) & = 0 \ \ \ \forall \ x\in S \\ (iii) \ \ \frac {\partial h_2}{\partial Y}(x) & = 1 \ \ \ \forall \ x\in S \end {align*} \par First, we claim that for any closed point $x\in \A ^2_F$, there exists an $h_x \in F[X,Y]$ such that \begin {align*} \ \ h_x \equiv h_1 &\ \ \ \ \syn {mod} \ {\mathfrak m}_x \\ \ \ \frac {\partial h_x}{\partial X}(x) & = 0 \\ \ \ \frac {\partial h_x}{\partial Y}(x) & = 1 \end {align*} We choose a polynomial $f_1\in F[X]$ such that $f_1(x)=0$ and $\partial f_1/\partial X(x)\neq 0$. To see that such a choice is possible, let $\pi _1:\A ^2_F\to \A ^1_F$ be the projection on to the $X$-coordinate. The minimal polynomial of any primitive element of the residue field of $\pi _1(x)$ satisfies our requirement. Similarly, we choose $f_2\in F[Y]$ such that $f_2(x)=0$ and $\partial f_2/\partial Y(x)\neq 0.$ Using Chinese remainder theorem and the fact that the residue field $F(x)$ is perfect, we choose $g_1,g_2 \in F[X,Y]$ such that $$g_1^p(x) = - \frac { \partial h_1/ \partial X(x)}{\partial f_1/ \partial X(x)},$$ $$g_2^p(x) = \frac { \big (1-\partial h_1/ \partial Y(x)\big )}{\partial f_2/ \partial Y(x)}.$$ We leave it to the reader that $$ h_x = h_1 + g_1^p f_1 + g_2^p f_2 $$ satisfies the requirement of our claim. Now, by Chinese remainder theorem, there exists $h_2\in F[X,Y]$ such that $$ h_2 \equiv h_x \ \ \ \syn {mod} \ {\mathfrak m}_x^2 \ \ \forall \ x\in S.$$ It is straightforward to see that $h_2$ satisfies conditions (1) and (2) of the Lemma. \\ \par \noindent \underline {Step (3)}: Choose a non-constant polynomial $\beta \in F[Y]$ such that $\beta (x)=0$ for all $x\in S$. Since $f$ is monic in $X$, $\syn {Z}(f)\xrightarrow {Y} \A ^1_F$ is a finite map. Thus $\beta :\syn {Z}(f) \to \A ^1_F$ is also a finite map. As $\syn {dim}(\syn {Z}(f))=1$, for a sufficiently large integer $\ell $, $$h:=h_2-\beta ^{p\ell }$$ defines a finite map $\syn {Z}(f) \xrightarrow {h} \A ^1_F$ by Noether normalization trick (see \eqref {nntrick1}). Clearly $h$ continues to satisfy conditions (1) and (2) of the Lemma since $\beta ^{p\ell } \in {\mathfrak m}_x^2$ for all $x\in S$. \par 
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of theorem \ref {dtwo}] Let $\phi ,h$ be as in Lemmas \ref {phiexists} and \ref {hexists} respectively. Let $\widetilde {\Phi }$ be the map $\A ^2_F \xrightarrow {(\phi ,h)} \A ^{2}_F$, and $\widetilde {\Psi }:=\phi $. Recall that $\tilde {S}:= \phi ^{-1}(0)\intersection \syn {Z}(f)$ (with reduced scheme structure). By Remark \ref {sfinite} it is finite. \par \noindent \underline {Step 1}: We claim that there exists a $g\in F[X,Y]$ such that if $W_g:=\A ^2_F\backslash \syn {Z}(g)$, then $\widetilde {\Phi }(\tilde {S})\subset W_g$ and $$ \widetilde {\Phi }_{|\widetilde {\Phi }^{-1}(W_g)\intersection \syn {Z}(f)} : \widetilde {\Phi }^{-1}(W_g)\intersection \syn {Z}(f) \longrightarrow W_g$$ is a closed immersion. The proof of this claim is a repetition of the argument in \cite [3.5.1]{chk} (see also \eqref {nakarg}). Let $\{p, x_1,...,x_n\}$ be the set of points in $\tilde {S}$. Since $\widetilde {\Phi }$ is \'{e}tale and radicial at all points of $\tilde {S}$ (see \eqref {phiexists}(2) and \eqref {hexists}(1) ) we have $ \widetilde {\Phi }^{-1}(\widetilde {\Phi }(\tilde {S})) \to \A ^2_F$ is a closed immersion. Let $y_0,...,y_n$ be the points in $\widetilde {\Phi }(\tilde {S})$. Let $\eta _i$ be the maximal ideal in $F[X,Y]$ corresponding to the closed point $y_i$. Thus the above closed immersion gives us a surjective map $$ F[X,Y] \twoheadrightarrow \frac { F[\syn {Z}(f)]}{ \eta _0\cdots \eta _n}$$ where $F[\syn {Z}(f)]$ is the coordinate ring of $\syn {Z}(f)$. If $C$ denotes the cokernel of $F[X,Y] \to F[\syn {Z}(f)]$ (as $F[X,Y]$ modules), then the above surjective map implies that $$C \tensor \frac {F[X,Y]}{\eta _0\cdots \eta _n} = 0 .$$ Note that $\widetilde {\Phi }_{| \syn {Z}(f)}$ is a finite map, since $h$ is a finite map (\eqref {hexists}(3)). Thus $F[\syn {Z}(f)]$ is a finite $F[X,Y]$ module. Thus, by Nakayama's lemma, there exists an element $g \in F[X,Y]$ such that $g \notin \eta _0\cdots \eta _n $ and $C_g=0$. In other words, the map $$ F[X,Y]_g \twoheadrightarrow F[\syn {Z}(f)]_g$$ is surjective. This proves the claim since if $W_g:= \A ^2_F \backslash \syn {Z}(g)$, the above surjectivity is equivalent to the following being a closed immersion $$ \widetilde {\Phi } : \syn {Z}(f) \intersection \widetilde {\Phi }^{-1}(W_g) \to W_g.$$ \\ \par \noindent \underline {Step 2}: Let $E$ be the smallest closed subset of $\syn {Z}(f)$ satisfying the following three conditions \begin {enumerate} \item [(i)] $x\in E$ if $x\in \syn {Z}(f)$ and $\widetilde {\Phi }$ is not \'{e}tale at $x$. \item [(ii)] $\syn {Z}(f)\backslash Z\subset E$. \item [(iii)] $\syn {Z}(f) \backslash \big (\widetilde {\Phi }^{-1}(W_g) \intersection \syn {Z}(f)\big ) \subset E$. \end {enumerate} Since $\tilde {S}$ contains at least one point in each irreducible component of $\syn {Z}(f)$, (iii) implies that $E$ is finite (see also Remark \ref {sfinite}). Moreover, by the above step and condition (iii) we have $$ \syn {Z}(f) \backslash E \longrightarrow \A ^2_F$$ is a locally closed immersion. Moreover, $\tilde {S}$ and $E$ are disjoint, and hence $\phi (p) \notin \phi (E)$. Since $E$ is finite, we choose a non-constant polynomial expression $Q$ in $h$ which vanishes on $p$ as well as $E$. For an integer $\ell >>0$ and divisible by $\Char (F)$, we claim that $(\phi -Q^\ell , h)$ presents $(W,\syn {Z}(f),p)$. Let $$ \Phi := (\phi -Q^\ell , h) \ \ \ \ \text {and} \ \ \ \Psi := \phi -Q^{\ell }.$$ \par To prove the claim we need to verify the conditions of the Definition (1)-(4) \ref {defpresents}. Condition (1), i.e. finiteness of $\Psi _{|\syn {Z}(f)}$, follows by \eqref {nntrick1} since $\ell $ is large, and $h_{|\syn {Z}(f)}$ is finite. As $Q$ vanishes on $p$ and $E$, $\Psi (p)\notin \Psi (E)$ follows from $\phi (p)\notin \phi (E)$. Thus if $S:= \Psi ^{-1}\Psi (p)\intersection Z$, then $S \subset \syn {Z}(f)\backslash E$. Conditions (2) to (4) of \eqref {defpresents} follow from the conditions (i) to (iii) of $E$ in the beginning of this step.
