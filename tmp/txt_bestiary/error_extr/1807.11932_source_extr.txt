 This is immediate from regarding $h \in \MC (V \otimes A[t,dt])$ as a cdga map $S\Sigma ^{-1}V^* \to A[t,dt]$ or a dga map $T\Sigma ^{-1}V^* \to A[t,dt]$. Then \begin {center} \begin {tikzcd} A \arrow [r,"i"] & A[t,dt] \arrow [r,shift left,"f_0"] \arrow [r,shift right,swap,"f_1"] & A \end {tikzcd} \end {center} is a good path object for $A$ in the model category of (c)dgas; here $i$ denotes the natural inclusion.

BEGIN Proof 
 Consider the element $h(z) \in V$. If $h$ is a dgla morphism, then $h(z)$ has degree 0, and $d(h(z)) = h(dz)$, from which a direct computation shows $\xi = e^{h(z)} \cdot \eta $. Conversely, if $\xi $ and $\eta $ are gauge equivalent by $\xi = e^x \cdot \eta $, then define $h(a) = \xi $, $h(b) = \eta $ and $h(z) = x$. The same computation shows that $h$ is a dgla morphism.

BEGIN Theorem \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 Consider first the $L_{\infty }$-case. We lift the homotopy $H_{\xi ,x}$ between $\xi $ and $x * \xi $ to $SU$ in the following sense: Let $f$ be the cdga map $H_{\id ,x} \circ e^{\theta } \circ i \colon SU \to SU$. Then $x * \xi = \xi \circ f$ and the identity map of $SU$ is left homotopic to $f$ via $H_{\id , x} \colon C(SU) \to SU$, defined by \[ H_{\id ,x}(u) = u,\^^MH_{\id ,x}(\bar {u}) = x(\bar {u}),\^^MH_{\id ,x}(\widehat {u}) = 0. \] \par We now show that $f = e^{[\tilde {x},d]}$, where $\tilde {x}$ is the constant derivation of $SU$ corresponding to $x$. First convert the homotopy $H_{\id ,x}$ into a Sullivan homotopy between the identity morphism of $SU$ and $f$. Using the explicit homotopy from $\id $ to an automorphism of the form $e^{[s,D]}$, constructed in~\cite [Theorem 3.4]{bl05}, the map $e^{z\theta } + se^{z\theta } dz \colon C(SU) \to C(SU)[z,dz]$ defines a Sullivan homotopy between the automorphisms $\id $ and $e^{[s,D]}$ of $C(SU)$. Then defining $F, G \colon SU \to SU[z]$ to be the compositions \[ F = H_{\id ,x} \circ e^{z\theta } \circ i,\ G = H_{\id ,x} \circ se^{z\theta } \circ i, \] we obtain that $F+Gdz \colon SU \to SU[z,dz]$ is a Sullivan homotopy from $\id $ to $f$. Since the constant term of $F$ is always the identity on $SU$, the map $F$ is formally invertible and the integral formula from~\cite {bl05} gives \[ f = \exp \left [\,\int _0^1 GF^{-1}\,dz, \,d \,\right ]. \] Finally we show that $G=\tilde {x}F$, from which it follows immediately that the integral converges and evaluates to $\tilde {x}$, concluding the proof of the theorem. Indeed, $H_{\id ,x}s$ and $\tilde {x}H_{\id ,x}$ are both $H_{\id ,x}$-derivations $S(U \oplus \bar {U} \oplus \widehat {U}) \to SU$, and they agree on $U \oplus \bar {U} \oplus \widehat {U}$: \begin {align*} &H_{\id ,x}s(u) = H_{\id ,x}(\bar {u}) = x(\bar {u}),\^^MH_{\id ,x}s(\bar {u}) = H_{\id ,x}(\widehat {u}) = 0,\^^MH_{\id ,x}s(\widehat {u}) = 0,\\ \shortintertext {and} &\tilde {x}H_{\id ,x}(u) = \tilde {x}(u) = x(\bar {u}),\^^M\tilde {x}H_{\id ,x}(\bar {u}) = \tilde {x}x(\bar {u}) = 0,\^^M\tilde {x}H_{\id ,x}(\widehat {u}) = 0. \end {align*} Hence $H_{\id ,x}s=\tilde {x}H_{\id ,x}$, which gives $G=\tilde {x}F$ as required. \par Now suppose $\xi $ is a Maurer--Cartan element in an $A_{\infty }$-algebra. In the $A_{\infty }$-case, the integral formula no longer applies due to the lack of graded commutativity. However, we can reduce to the $L_{\infty }$-case as follows. Since $k$ is commutative, its representing dga map $\xi \colon TU \to k$ factors as $\xi =\xi ' \circ p$, where $p \colon TU \to SU$ is the canonical projection and $\xi ' \colon SU \to k$ is a cdga map. Similarly there are factorizations $x * \xi = (x * \xi )' \circ p$ and $H = H' \circ p$. Then $\xi '$ and $(x * \xi )'$ are Maurer--Cartan elements in the $L_{\infty }$-algebra represented by $SU$, and the cdga map $H'$ defines a left homotopy between them. By definition $(x * \xi )' = x * \xi '$, hence by the $L_{\infty }$-case, \[ x * \xi = (x * \xi ') \circ p = \xi ' \circ e^{[\tilde {x},d_{SU}]} \circ p = \xi ' \circ p \circ e^{[\tilde {x},d_{TU}]} = \xi \circ e^{[\tilde {x},d_{TU}]}. \] This proves the $A_{\infty }$-case.

BEGIN Lemma \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 \hfill \begin {enumerate} \item Since elements of $S'V$ and $T'V$ are finite sums of tensor powers, it suffices to prove that a linear map $f \colon V = \invlim _i V_i \to B$ extends to continuous maps $V^{\widehat {\otimes }n} \to B$ for all $n \geq 2$. Since $f$ is determined by $V_i \to B$, we define $f^{\otimes n} \colon V_{i_1} \otimes V_{i_2} \otimes \dots \otimes V_{i_n} \to B$, and take the inverse limit to obtain a map on $V^{\widehat {\otimes }n}$. \item This follows the same argument as above, but instead we extend $f$ to $V_{i_1} \otimes V_{i_2} \otimes \dots \otimes V_{i_n}$ by $\sum _{j=0}^{n-1} 1^j \otimes f \otimes 1^{n-1-j}$. \qedhere \end {enumerate}

BEGIN Lemma \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 First note that the object $S'\Sigma ^{-1}(V \otimes A)^*$ makes sense: $V$ is finite-dimensional, so $V \otimes A$ is discrete and its dual is pseudocompact. Recall that $V \otimes A \cong ((V \otimes A)^*)^*$. So there is a correspondence between $(\Sigma (V \otimes A))^0$ and continuous degree 0 linear maps $\Sigma ^{-1}(V \otimes A)^* \to k$, which correspond to continuous degree 0 algebra maps $S'\Sigma ^{-1}(V \otimes A)^* \to k$ by \cref {result:universal}. The Maurer--Cartan condition corresponds to the correct axioms for differentials on $S'\Sigma ^{-1}(V \otimes A)^*$ by the same argument as the usual (non-continuous) cdga case.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Theorem \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 We prove the $L_{\infty }$-case; the $A_{\infty }$-case can be reduced to the $L_\infty $-case as before. For $V = \Sigma ^{-1}(V \otimes A)^*$, consider \[ C(S'V) \coloneqq (S'(V \oplus \bar {V} \oplus \widehat {V}), D), \] where $\bar {V} \cong \Sigma V$ and $\widehat {V} \cong V$, and $D$ are defined as in $C(SV)$. As before, we can also define an automorphism $e^{\theta } = \sum _{n=0}^{\infty } \theta ^n / n!$ of $C(S'V)$; note that the Sullivan condition still holds on the differential $D$ of $S'V$, so the series still converges. \par While $C(S'V)$ is not a cylinder object, we can treat it as if it were one: by \cref {result:universal} and \cref {result:mccts}, $\xi $ and $\eta $ are left homotopic if and only if there is a cdga map $H'$ such that the diagram commutes: \begin {center} \begin {tikzcd} S'V \arrow [d,shift left,"e^{\theta } \circ \, i"] \arrow [d,shift right,swap,"i"] \arrow [r,shift left,"\xi '"] \arrow [r,shift right,swap,"\eta '"] & k \\ C(S'V) \arrow [ur,swap,dashed,bend right,"H'"] & \end {tikzcd} \end {center} The rest of the proof is the same as \cref {result:gauge_short_a}, replacing $C(SV)$ with $C(S'V)$ everywhere. The Sullivan condition still holds on the differential $d'$ of $S'V$, so the exponential $e^{[\tilde {x}',d']}$ converges as before.

BEGIN Theorem \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 Using that $\tilde {x}^2 = 0$ (as the square of a constant odd derivation is 0), the same argument as for~\eqref {eq:exptheta} gives \[ e^{[\tilde {x},d]} (v) = v + \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac {(\tilde {x}d)^n(v)}{n!}. \] \par From \cref {result:gauge_short_a} and \cref {result:gauge_short_b}, the Maurer--Cartan element $x * \xi $ is represented by the cdga map $\xi \circ e^{[\tilde {x},d]} \colon SV \to k$, so the restriction of $\xi \circ e^{[\tilde {x},d]}$ to $V$ is $\ev _{x * \xi }$. Applying $\xi \circ e^{[\tilde {x},d]}$ to an element $v \colon \Sigma V \to k$ in $V$ is equivalent to forming a tree by successive compositions. Since $\tilde {x}$ and $d$ are derivations, each $(\tilde {x}d)^n (v)$ is a sum of words determined by sequences $d_{i_1}$, $d_{i_2}$, \dots , $d_{i_n}$, for any $i_1, \dots , i_n \geq 1$. Hence at each step: \begin {enumerate} \item Applying $d_i$ to $v \in V$ gives the composition $\frac {1}{i!} v \circ \ell _i$. Applying $\id ^{\otimes j-1} \otimes d_i \otimes \id ^{\otimes k-j}$ to an element of $V^{\otimes k}$ therefore corresponds to composition with an $i$-star along $j$. \item Applying $\tilde {x}$ to $v \in V$ is the evaluation $\ev _x(v)$. Applying $\id ^{\otimes j-1} \otimes \tilde {x} \otimes \id ^{\otimes k-j}$ to an element of $V^{\otimes k}$ therefore corresponds labelling the $j$th leaf with $x$. \item Applying $\xi $ to $v \in V$ is the evaluation $\ev _{\xi }(v)$. Since $\xi $ extends to a cgda map, this corresponds to labelling all remaining leaves with $\xi $. \end {enumerate} \par Every sequence $d_{i_1}$, $d_{i_2}$, \dots , $d_{i_n}$ gives words of the form $(-1)^n T(x,\xi ) / i_1! \dots i_n! $. Indeed, regard $\xi $ and $x$ as elements in $\Sigma V$, so that $\xi $ and $x$ have degrees 0 and $-1$ respectively. Then by graded symmetry of the $\ell _i$, there must be exactly one $x$ on each vertex, and every term can be written as $\ell _i(\eta _1,\dots ,\eta _{i-1},x)$, which equals $[\eta _1,\dots ,\eta _{i-1},x]$ by our grading convention. Finally, each $\tilde {x}d$ introduces a sign $-1$, as both $\ell _i$ and $x$ both have odd degree. \par To determine the coefficient, it remains to count how many ways compositions give rise to the same word. By graded commutativity, we can form the trees such that each composition or labelling by $x$ always fills the last unlabelled leaf on each vertex. With this restriction, the number of ways a tree can be built is $r$, the number of monotone orderings of its vertices.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Theorem \protect \let \reserved@d = *\def \par 
BEGIN Proof 
 The calculation is similar to the $L_{\infty }$-case in \cref {result:gauge_formula}, except the lack of graded commutativity means that each $m_i$ can take more than one $x$. Each sequence $d_{i_1}$, $d_{i_2}$, \dots , $d_{i_n}$ gives words of the form $(-1)^n T_{\lambda }(x,\xi )$.
END Proof
 
BEGIN Proof 
 [Proof of~\cref {thesame}] First note that the equivalence of (\ref {lefthtp}) and (\ref {sullivanhtp}) is immediate by completeness of $V$. Also, if $V$ is finite-dimensional, then the equivalence of (\ref {gaugeeq}) and (\ref {lefthtp}) is immediate by \cref {result:gauge_short_b} and \cref {result:gauge_formula}. Finally in the infinite dimensional case, by completeness of $V$ we have $V = \invlim V_i$ where $V_i$ are all finite-dimensional complete dglas. Hence (\ref {gaugeeq}) and (\ref {lefthtp}) are equivalent for $V$, as they are equivalent for each $V_i$.

BEGIN Proof 
 By~\cref {thesame}, two Maurer--Cartan elements in $\lie {g} \otimes \Omega (M)$ are gauge equivalent if and only if their representing cdga maps are left homotopic. But $M$ is contractible, so $\Omega (M)$ is weakly equivalent to $\mathbb {R}$. By nilpotence of $\lie {g}$, homotopy classes of maps $S\lie {g} \to \Omega (M)$ correspond to homotopy classes of maps $S\lie {g} \to \mathbb {R}$. Hence $\mathscr {MC}(\lie {g},\Omega (M)) \cong \mathscr {MC}(\lie {g})$.
