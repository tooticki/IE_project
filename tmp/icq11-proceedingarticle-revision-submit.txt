Abstract. Quasicrystals are characterized by the diﬀraction patterns which consist of pure bright
peaks. Substitution tilings are commonly used to obtain geometrical models for quasicrystals. We
consider certain substitution tilings and show how to determine a quasicrystalline structure for the
substitution tilings computationally. In order to do this, it is important to have the Meyer property
on the substitution tilings. We use the recent result of Lee-Solomyak in [18] which determines the
Meyer property on the substitution tilings from the expansion maps.
Keywords: Quasicrystals, Pure point diﬀraction, Self-aﬃne tilings, Overlap coincidence, Meyer

1. Introduction
For the study of geometric structures of quasicrystals, substitutions are commonly used to create
mathematical models. Many known examples such as the Penrose tiling and the Robinson tiling
can be created by this method. Mathematically quasicrystals are characterized as the structures of
models whose diﬀraction patterns consist purely of Bragg peaks without diﬀuse background. The
diﬀraction is described by the diﬀraction measure of the point sets representing the models and the
diﬀraction measure is a Fourier transformation of an autocorrelation of a Dirac measure deﬁned on
the point sets.
Let Λ = (Λi )i≤m be a multi-colour point set in Rd . We consider a measure of the form ν =
∑
i≤m ai δΛi , where δΛi =
x∈Λi δx and ai ∈ C. The autocorrelation of ν is

∑

γ(ν) = lim

n→∞

(ν|Bn ∗ νe|Bn ),
Vol(Bn )

where ν|Bn is a measure of ν restricted on the ball Bn of radius n and νe is the measure, deﬁned
by νe(f ) = ν(fe), where f is a continuous function with compact support and fe(x) = f (−x). The
d of the autocorrelation (see [10]). When the
diﬀraction measure of ν is the Fourier transform γ(ν)
d is a pure point measure, we say that Λ has pure point diﬀraction spectrum
diﬀraction measure γ(ν)
and so the structures of quasicrystals.
There are many criteria in literature which characterize the structures of quasicrystals. One of
the criteria is that the pure point diﬀractivity of Λ is equivalent to pure point dynamical spectral
property of Λ [8, 20, 15, 11, 3, 19]. Another criterion is that regular model sets are pure point

diﬀractive [10, 21, 4, 13]. A third criterion is ‘almost periodicity’, which says that if a uniformly
discrete set Λ admits an autocorrelation, then Λ is pure point diﬀractive if and only if for all ϵ > 0,
the set
{t ∈ Rd : density(Λ \ (Λ − t + Bϵ )) ≤ ϵ}
is relatively dense (see [22, 4, 11]). When we restrict to the setting of substitution tilings or point
sets, the equivalent criterion to the almost periodicity can be described by the notion of overlap
coincidence [22, 13]. This overlap coincidence plays an important role on getting the computational
algorithm to determine the pure point diﬀractivity on the substitution tilings. The detail justiﬁcation
about the algorithm and the main theorem can be found in [1]. We provide a few examples in the
last section some of which are not mentioned there.
2. Preliminary
2.1. Tilings. We begin with a set of types (or colours) {1, . . . , m}, which we ﬁx once and for all. A
tile in Rd is deﬁned as a pair T = (A, i) where A = supp(T ) (the support of T ) is a compact set in Rd ,
which is the closure of its interior, and i = l(T ) ∈ {1, . . . , m} is the type of T . We say that a set P of
tiles is a patch if the number of tiles in P is ﬁnite and the tiles of P have mutually disjoint interiors. We
say that two patches P1 and P2 are translationally equivalent if P2 = g+P1 for some g ∈ Rd . A tiling of
∪
Rd is a set T of tiles such that Rd = {supp(T ) : T ∈ T } and distinct tiles have disjoint interiors. We
always assume that any two T -tiles with the same colour are translationally equivalent (hence there
are ﬁnitely many T -tiles up to translations). Let Ξ(T ) := {x ∈ Rd : T = x + T ′ for some T, T ′ ∈ T }.
We say that T has ﬁnite local complexity(FLC) if for each radius R > 0 there are only ﬁnitely many
equivalent classes of patches whose support lies in some ball of radius R. We say that T is repetitive
if for every compact set K ⊂ Rd , {t ∈ Rd : T ∩ K = (t + T ) ∩ K} is relatively dense.
2.2. Substitutions.

where τ 2 − τ − 1 = 0. The tiles A1 and A2 satisfy the following tile-equations
τ A1

= A1 ∪ (A2 + τ )

τ A2

= A1

Continuously iterating the tiles and subdividing them, we can construct a tiling.
2.2.2. Substitutions on tilings. We say that a linear map Q : Rd → Rd is expansive if all its eigenvalues
lie outside the closed unit disk in C.
Definition 2.1. Let A = {T1 , . . . , Tm } be a ﬁnite set of tiles in Rd such that Ti = (Ai , i); we will
call them prototiles. Denote by PA the set of non empty patches. We say that Ω : A → PA is a

tile-substitution (or simply substitution) with an expansive map Q if there exist ﬁnite sets Dij ⊂ Rd
for i, j ≤ m such that
Ω(Tj ) = {u + Ti : u ∈ Dij , i = 1, . . . , m}

(2.1)
with

QAj =

∪

(Dij + Ai )

for j ≤ m.

i=1

Here all sets in the right-hand side must have disjoint interiors; it is possible for some of the Dij to
be empty.
We say that T is a substitution tiling if T is a tiling and Ω(T ) = T with some substitution Ω. We
say that substitution tiling is primitive if the corresponding substitution matrix S, with Sij = ♯(Dij ),
is primitive, i.e. S ℓ is a positive matrix for some ℓ ∈ Z+ . A repetitive primitive substitution tiling
with FLC is called a self-aﬃne tiling. Let ΛT = (Λi )i≤m be the multi-colour point set representing
T . For any self-aﬃne tiling which satisﬁes (2.2), we deﬁne an m × m array Φ for which each entry
is Φij ,
Φij = {f : x 7→ Qx + d : d ∈ Dij }
and call Φ a matrix function system (MFS) for the substitution Ω. We compose
Φ ◦ Φ = ((Φ ◦ Φ)ij ),
where
(Φ ◦ Φ)ij =

∪m
k=1

{
Φik ◦ Φkj and Φik ◦ Φkj :=

{ g ◦ f : g ∈ Φik , f ∈ Φkj }
∅ if Φik = ∅ or Φkj = ∅ .

We write Φ2 for Φ ◦ Φ and similarly Φn for n-fold composition of Φ for n ∈ Z+ . We write Φn (x) for
(Φn ij (x))i≤m where x ∈ Λj and n ∈ Z+ .
2.3. Overlaps. Overlap and overlap coincidence are originally deﬁned with tiles in substitution
tilings [22]. For computational reason, we deﬁne overlaps with the corresponding representative
points of tiles here. A triple (u, y, v), with u + Ti , v + Tj ∈ T and y ∈ Ξ(T ), is called an overlap (or
real overlap) if
(2.3)

(u + Ai − y)◦ ∩ (v + Aj )◦ ̸= ∅,

where Ai = supp(Ti ) and Aj = supp(Tj ). We deﬁne (u + Ai − y) ∩ (v + Aj ) the support of an overlap
(u, y, v) and denote it by supp(u, y, v). We say that two overlaps (u, y, v) and (u′ , y ′ , v ′ ) are equivalent
if there exists g ∈ Rd such that u − y = g + u′ − y ′ and v = g + v ′ , where u + Ti , u′ + Ti ∈ T and
v + Tj , v ′ + Tj ∈ T for some 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m. Denote by [(u, y, v)] the equivalence class of an overlap.
An overlap (u, y, v) is a coincidence if
u − y = v and u + Ti , v + Ti ∈ T for some i ≤ m.
For an overlap O = (u, y, v) in T , we deﬁne k-th inﬂated overlap
Φk O = {(u′ , Qk y, v ′ ) : u′ ∈ Φk (u), v ′ ∈ Φk (v), and (u′ , Qk y, v ′ ) is an overlap}.
Definition 2.2. We say that a self-aﬃne tiling T admits an overlap coincidence if there exists
ℓ ∈ Z+ such that for each overlap O in T , Φℓ O contains a coincidence.

We say that a discrete point set Ξ is a Meyer set if Ξ is relatively dense and Ξ − Ξ is uniformly
discrete. For α ∈ Ξ(T ), deﬁne
Eα := {(u, Qn α, v) : (u, Qn α, v) is overlap in T and n ∈ N }.
Theorem 2.3. [16, 13] Let T be a self-aﬃne tiling in Rd such that Ξ(T ) is a Meyer set. Then the
following are equivalent;
(i) ΛT is pure point diﬀractive.
(ii) T admits an overlap coincidence.
(iii) There exists ℓ ∈ Z+ such that for any overlap O in Eα , Φℓ O contains a coincidence.
In actual computation, it is not easy to determine whether a given triple is an overlap, since the
interior intersection is hard to determine. So we introduce a notion of potential overlaps. From (2.3),
for any overlap (u, y, v) in T it is easy to observe that
|u − y − v| ≤ R := 2 · max{diam(Ai ) : i ≤ m},
where diam(A) is the diameter of A.1 We say that a triple (u, y, v), with u + Ti , v + Tj ∈ T for some
i, j ≤ m and y ∈ Ξ(T ), is called a potential overlap if |u − y − v| ≤ R. Similarly to the k-th iterated
overlap, for each potential overlap O = (u, y, v) in T , we deﬁne k-th inﬂated potential overlap
Φk O = {(u′ , Qk y, v ′ ) : u′ ∈ Φk (u), v ′ ∈ Φk (v), and (u′ , Qk y, v ′ ) is a potential overlap}
and the equivalence class of Φk O
[Φk O] = {[O′ ] : O′ ∈ Φk O} .
It is proved in [22, 16] that the number of equivalence classes of overlaps for a tiling which has the
Meyer property is ﬁnite. And it is shown in [17] that substitution tiling with pure point diﬀraction
spectrum necessarily have the Meyer property. So to obtain overlap coincidence, we assume the
Meyer property of Ξ(T ). The next theorem gives a criterion on Q for the Meyer property.
A set of algebraic integers Θ = {θ1 , · · · , θr } is a Pisot family if for any 1 ≤ j ≤ r, every Galois
conjugate γ of θj with |γ| ≥ 1 is contained in Θ.
Theorem 2.4. [18] Let T be a self-aﬃne tiling in Rd with a diagonalizable expansion map Q.
Suppose that all the eigenvalues of Q are algebraic conjugates with the same multiplicity. Then Ξ(T )
is a Meyer set if and only if the set of all the eigenvalues of Q is a Pisot family.
Under Pisot family condition on Q, it is easy to show the Meyer property in practice. The main
new result of the above theorem is showing the partial converse.
Let ξ ∈ Rd be a ﬁxed point under the substitution such that ξ ∈ Φ(ξ). When there is no confusion,
we will identify ξ with a coloured point (ξ, i) in ΛT with ξ ∈ Rd . We ﬁnd a basis of Rd
B = {α1 , . . . , αd } ⊂ Ξ(T ).
For any α ∈ B and any M ∈ Z≥0 , deﬁne
∪
Gα,M :=
{[(y, Qn α, z)] : y, z ∈ ΦN +k+n (ξ) and (y, Qn α, z) is a potential overlap} ,
0≤n≤M
1It is possible to take a smaller R. See [1] for details.

Gα .

α∈B

From the Meyer property of Ξ(T ), there exists M ∈ Z≥0 such that Gα,M = Gα,M +1 (refer [1] to ﬁnd
M ).
Lemma 2.5. Let α ∈ B. If Gα,M = Gα,M +1 for some M (= Mα ) ∈ Z≥0 , then
Gα,M = Gα .
Let Gcoin be the set of all equivalence classes of overlaps in T which lead to coincidence after
♯G-iterations and Gres := G \ Gcoin . Draw a graph whose vertices are elements in G and edges from
a potential overlap O to O′ are k-multiple if the inﬂated potential overlap ΦO contains k-copies of
O′ for some k ∈ Z+ . For simplicity, we use the same name G for the graph. Similarly Gcoin and Gres
stand for the induced graphs of G for the corresponding set. For any graph G, we denote by ρ(G)
the spectral radius of the graph G.
Theorem 2.6. Let T be a self-aﬃne tiling in Rd such that Ξ(T ) is a Meyer set. Then T admits an
overlap coincidence if and only if ρ(Gcoin ) > ρ(Gres ).
To show the ‘only if’ part, it is inevitable to estimate the contribution of potential overlaps whose
tiles meet only at the boundaries. So a result on the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the tile boundaries is
shown on the way of proving the above theorem (see [1]).
Summarizing the results, we provide an algorithm to determine the pure point diﬀraction of a
point set which represents a substitution tiling.
Algorithm : We assume that T is a self-aﬃne tiling in Rd with expansion map Q for which Ξ(T )
is a Meyer set and Ti = (Ai , i), i ≤ m, are prototiles such that
QAj =

αk .
(iv) Find all the potential overlaps G which occur from the translations Qn αk with 1 ≤ k ≤ d
and n ∈ Z+ .
(v) Find all the potential overlaps Gcoin which lead to coincidences within ♯G-iterations.

3. Computation with an algorithm
For one-dimension substitutions, it is not diﬃcult to determine overlaps. For this case, we use
overlaps directly to check overlap coincidence as it is shown in Example 3.1. In higher dimension, it
is diﬃcult to determine all the overlaps. So adopting the notion of potential overlaps, we determine
the overlap coincidence. We implemented Mathematica programs which perform our algorithm to
check the overlap coincidence for self-aﬃne tilings. Readers can get the Mathematica programs in
the website given in [2]. Below, we present two examples where the algorithm was applied, the fractal
Penrose tiling in Example 3.2 and a fractal chair tiling in Example 3.3.
Example 3.1. There is a Pisot type substitution
deﬁned

 by a → ab, b → c, c → a (see [6, 9]). The
1 0 1



corresponding substitution matrix is M =  1 0 0 
 . The PF-eigenvalue of M is λ for which
0 1 0
λ − λ − 1 = 0 and a left eigenvector of M corresponding to λ is (λ2 , 1, λ). Let T1 (T2 , or T3 ) be the
3

2

intervals of length λ2 (1, or λ) starting from 0, respectively. We can construct a substitution tiling T
attaching these intervals to a bi-inﬁnite ﬁxed sequence as tiles. For any ﬁxed repetitive substitution
tiling T , it is enough to check overlap coincidence in one side of the tiling.

All overlaps are [λ2 −λ+T1 , 0+T1 ], [λ+T1 , 0+T1 ], [1+T1 , 0+T1 ], [0+T2 , 0+T1 ], [λ2 −λ−1+T2 , 0+T1 ],
[λ2 − λ + T2 , 0 + T1 ], [λ2 − 1 + T2 , 0 + T1 ], [1 + T3 , 0 + T1 ], [λ2 − λ + T3 , 0 + T1 ], [0 + T3 , 0 + T1 ],
[−λ + 1 + T3 , 0 + T1 ], [λ2 − λ + 1 + T3 , 0 + T1 ], [−λ2 + 1 + T3 , 0 + T2 ], [−λ + 1 + T3 , 0 + T2 ]. Every
overlap admits coincidence when Φ10 is applied to the pair of representative points of overlap tiles.
For example, for an overlap [λ2 − λ + T1 , 0 + T1 ], we look at




{λ2 − λ}
{0}




 and Φ10  ∅ 
Φ10 
∅




∅
∅
Observe that λ9 ∈ (Φ10 )11 (λ2 − λ) ∩ (Φ10 )11 (0). Thus ΛT is pure point diﬀractive.
Example 3.2. Bandt-Gummelt in [7] gave two fractal Penrose tilings by fractal kites and darts
having exact matching condition (see Figure 1 (a)). We conﬁrm that these tilings admit overlap
coincidence.
Thus the tilings have pure point diﬀractive spectrum. The expanding matrix Q =
(
)
t 0
where t2 − t − 1 = 0 and the MFS Φ is 20 × 20 matrix such that Φ = (Fij ) and Fij = {f :
0 t
f = Qx+d,
d ∈ Dij }. We give the digit set matrix (Dij ) in Figure 2, where w = cos(π/5)+i sin(π/5),
√
t=

(1+ 5)
,

and c ∈ C satisﬁes f (t2 i) = i with f (z) = zt w4 + c.

Figure 2. Digit set matrix of fractal Penrose tiling
Example 3.3. Bandt found an aperiodic tiling by modifying the construction of crystallographic
tiling [5]. He called it a fractal chair tiling. Note, to avoid confusion, that this tiling is not the fractal
version of ordinary chair tiling in [12, 22, 14], not like Example 3.2. A single tile in the fractal chair
tiling is a 3-reptile, i.e., it is subdivided into shrunk 3 similar copies, while the ordinary chair tile is
a 4-reptile. The tile equations are given by
λAn = An ∪ (An + αn−1 ) ∪ (An+1 + αn )
where λ = −2α2 + α and α2 − α + 1 = 0 and n of An is a cyclic index modulo 6. The computation
shows that the tiling does not admit overlap coincidence. So the point structure representing the
tiling is not pure point diﬀractive, which means that there is continuous part in the diﬀraction
pattern. Nonetheless the diﬀraction has a relatively dense set of Bragg peaks, since the tiling has
the Meyer property (see [23, 17]). It would be interesting to know the reason why this tiling gives
a structure which is not pure point diﬀractive and understand the continuous part of the diﬀraction
spectrum more concretely. The ﬁgure is given in Figure 1(b).
