Remark 2.2. Note that a KN tableau in [14] is of shape λ. One may consider KNcλn
here as the dual crystal of the KN tableaux of shape λ in [14]. This immediately
implies (??). The same holds for the case of type Bn in the next subsection.

Remark 3.5. One can also determine pL T, R T q by the following algorithm [20, (3.6)],
which will be useful in later arguments:
(s-1) Let yi “ T R piq for 1 ď i ď htpT R q. First, slide down the box y1 in T R as far
as the entry of T L in the same row is no greater than y1 . If no entry of T L
is greater than y, we place y1 next to T L p1q.
(s-2) Next, slide down y2 until it is above y1 and the entry of T L in the same
row is no greater than y2 . Repeat the same process with the other boxes
y3 , y4 , . . . until there is no moving down.
(s-3) Slide each box x in T L to the right if its right position is empty (indeed the
number of such boxes is a).
(s-4) Define R T to be the tableau determined by the boxes yi ’s in T R together
with boxes x ’s which have moved from T L by (s-3), and define L T to be the
tableau with the remaining boxes on the left.
For example, let T be as in Example 3.4 .

Remark 3.7. When we consider the admissibility of a pair pT2 , T1 q, it is convenient
body
to assume that Ti
and Titail for i “ 1, 2 are separated by a common horizontal
line so that the vertical positions of the other column tableaux L Ti , R Ti for i “
1, 2 are determined accordingly (see the dashed lines in Example 3.8 ). Then the
condition (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) are equivalent to saying that pT2R , L T1 q and pR T2 , T1L q
form semistandard tableaux with respect to this vertical position, respectively.

Remark 5.6. The `-tuples pT`tail , . . . , T1tail q and pT` , . . . , T1 q form tableaux
of shape ν and τ π , respectively, which are not necessarily rns-semistandard. But they
become rns-semistandard when T is equivalent to an rns- semistandard tableau of
a relatively small shape as an element of l-crystals. More precisely, if T ”l S for

some S P SSTrns pγq with γ1 ă `, then pT`tail , . . . , T1tail q and pT` , . . . , T1 q are
rns-semistandard [18, Lemma 4.2], which implies that pT`tail , . . . , T1tail q “ Ttail

type so called marginally large tableaux is isomorphic to Bp8q (see also [2]). One
may define an embedding of KNgλ into the crystal of marginally large tableaux by
mapping T to T 1 ” T b Hγ , where Hγ is a highest element in KNgµ with xωγ , hi y " 0
for all i. Unlike in type A, it does not seem to be easy in general to describe T 1 since
the insertion scheme in types BCD [23, 24] is more involved. On the other hand,
the embedding Ξλ in Theorem 5.9 uses only the Schützenberger’s jeu de taquin
sliding and RSK.
