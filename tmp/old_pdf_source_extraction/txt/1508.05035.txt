Remarks.
• It follows readily from the definition that ρ(u) = 1 − log u for 1 ≤ u ≤ 2, and so
u2 = e1/2 = 1.6487 . . . and u3 = e2/3 = 1.9477 . . .. For k > 3, it does not seem that uk
has a simple closed form expression.
• Theorem 1.1 is the special case k0 = 2 of Theorem 1.2 .

Theorem 1.3. Let ε > 0 and let A > 0. There is an m0 = m0 (ε, A) with the following
property: If m > m0 , and χ is a quadratic character modulo m, then there are at least

Remark. If q 0 is the largest divisor of q supported on the primes not exceeding y, then
Ψq (x, y) = Ψq0 (x, y). So the assumption in Proposition 2.2 that P + (q) ≤ y does not entail
any loss of generality.

Remark. Any improvement on Siegel’s lower bound for L(1, χ) would boost the number of `
