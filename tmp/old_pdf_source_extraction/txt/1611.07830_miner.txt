*** The following are equivalent.

1. The real structure σ is admissible.

2. The subspace Vσ is stable by c.

3. The subspace V is stable by σ.

4. The real structure σ restricts to a Q-orthogonal symmetry of V .
5. The subspaces V+ := V ∩ Vσ and V− := V ∩ iVσ form a Q-orthogonal

decomposition of V .

*** It is immediate that (1 )⇒(3 ), and for the converse it suﬃces to observe
that σ ◦ c and c ◦ σ are two algebra automorphisms of Cl(V ) which coincide on
V . The equivalence between (1 ) and (2 ) is obtained by symmetry.
Of course (4 )⇒(3 ) is trivial, and to see that (3 )⇒(4 ) we observe that
Q(σ(v)) = σ(v)2 = σ(v2) = σ(Q(v)) = Q(v), hence σ restricts to a Q-orthogonal
transformation of V which is moreover involutive.
Finally we see that V+ is the +1-eigenspace and V− is the −1-eigenspace of the
R-linear operator σ|V , hence (5 ) and (4 ) are equivalent.

***

1. The real structures are of the form σ = Adb ◦ c with b ∈ ΓC such that

bc(b) = λ ∈ R. We also have bT = αb, α = ±1, b× = αc(b).

2. The real structure σ = Adb◦c with b ∈ ΓC is admissible iﬀ c(b) = eiθb, with
θ ∈ R. In this case we can choose b to satisfy c(b) = b and b2 = λ = ±1, in
which case we say that it is real and normalized. Then b× = αb, b belongs
to P in(Q), and is unique up to a sign.

*** It is obvious that σ is an antilinear automorphism which preserves V
when it is of the form Adb ◦ c with b in the Cliﬀord group. If bc(b) = λ ∈ R it
is moreover an involution since σ2(a) = bc(b)ac(b)−1b−1 = a for all a ∈ Cl(V ).
Conversely, if σ is a real structure, then σ◦ c is an automorphism of the Cliﬀord
, and it is then of the form Adb with b ∈ ΓC. Hence
algebra which preserves V
σ = Adb ◦ c. Since σ is an involution we have bc(b) = λ ∈ C by the calculation
above. Since c(b) is then equal to b−1 up to a constant, it commutes with b,
from which we obtain that λ is real.
The other properties follow from the ones just proved: since b ∈ ΓC, bb× is a
constant, hence c(b)bT is a constant, and from c(b)b = λ ∈ R we get that b
is proportional to bT . The involutory property of T forces the proportionality
constant to be a sign α. Then b× = c(bT ) = αc(b).
Now it is easy to check that σ commtutes with c iﬀ c(b) = eiθb for some θ ∈ R.
Then b(cid:48) = eiθ/2√
|λ| b is normalized and real and one has Adb = Adb(cid:48). If b(cid:48)(cid:48) is another
normalized and real element such that Adb(cid:48)(cid:48) = Adb then b(cid:48)(cid:48) = µb(cid:48) with µ ∈ C.
From reality one has µ ∈ R, and from normalization one has µ2 = 1.
Since b(cid:48) satisﬁes b(cid:48)(b(cid:48))× = ±1 and is real it is in the Pin group.

*** The projection τn does not depend on the chosen pseudo-orthonormal basis.
It is the unique linear form τn : Cl(V ) → R such that τn(ab) = τn(ba) for all
a, b ∈ Cl(V ) and τn(1) = 1. It also satisﬁes τn(aT ) = τn(a).

*** The σ-product is a non-degenerate hermitian form on Cl(V ). The
associated quadratic form restricts to Qσ on V and to Q on Vσ. It satisﬁes

(w1 . . . wk, w1 . . . wk)σ = Q(w1) . . . Q(wk)

(2)
for any vectors w1, . . . , wk ∈ Vσ. Moreover if (ei)1≤i≤n is a pseudo-orthonormal
basis of Vσ for Q then (eI )I⊂{1;...;n} is a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Cl(V ) for
the σ-product.

*** It is obvious that (., .)σ is sesquilinear. Moreover we have (b, a)σ =
τn(σ(bT )a) = τn(σ(b)T a) = τn(aT σ(b)) = τn(σ(aT )b) = (a, b)σ.
If v ∈ V , then (v, v)σ = τn(σ(v)v) = 1
Let us prove (2 ). We have :

2 τn(σ(v)v + vσ(v)) = Qσ(v).

(w1 . . . wk, w1 . . . wk)σ = τn(σ(wT

Let (ei)1≤i≤n be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Vσ. Then (eI , eI )σ = ±1 by
property (2 ). Moreover if I (cid:54)= J, (eI , eJ )σ = τn(eT
I eJ ) = ±τn(eI∆J ) = 0.
Hence (eI )I⊂{1;...;n} is a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Cl(V ), which shows that
(., .)σ is not degenerate.

*** Let φ : (V, B) → (V (cid:48), B(cid:48)) be an isometry between two real vector spaces
equipped with nondegenerate bilinear forms. Let c, c(cid:48) be the canonical real
structures on Cl(V, B) and Cl(V (cid:48), B(cid:48)) respectively. Then the isomorphism ˜φ :
Cl(V, B) → Cl(V (cid:48), B(cid:48)) which canonically extends φ transforms (., .)c into (., .)c(cid:48).

*** For any a, b ∈ Cl(V, B) we have

n ◦ ˜φ(c(aT )b)

where the last step follows from the uniqueness of the normalized trace.

*** Let φ : (V, B) → (V, B) be an isometry. Then ˜φ(V k) = V k for all k.

*** Clearly ˜φ(V k) = V k for k = 0, 1. Let us suppose that ˜φ(V j) = V j for
j ≤ k. The sum V 0 ⊕ . . .⊕ V k ⊕ V k+1 is orthogonal for the c-product, hence by
the lemma the sum ˜φ(V 0) ⊕ . . . ⊕ ˜φ(V k) ⊕ ˜φ(V k+1) = V0 ⊕ . . . ⊕ V k ⊕ ˜φ(V k+1)
also is. Since we obviously have ˜φ(V k+1) ⊂ V 0 ⊕ . . . ⊕ V k+1 we obtain that
˜φ(V k+1) = V k+1.

*** Let (K, (., .)) be a ﬁnite dimensional space equipped with a non-degenerate
hermitian form. If there exists U ∈ End(K) such that U×U = −IdK, then (., .)
is neutral.

*** We have (U ψ, U η) = (ψ, U×U η) = −(ψ, η) for all ψ, η ∈ K. Thus if
K = K+ ⊕ K− is an orthogonal decomposition of K into subspaces where
(., .) is positive deﬁnite and negative deﬁnite respectively, we see that K =
U K+ ⊕ U K− is an orthogonal decomposition where the signs are swapped.
Since dim(U K±) = dim K± we conclude by Sylvester’s law of inertia.

*** (Garling’s alternative) The σ-product on Cl(V ) is positive deﬁnite whenever
Qσ is. It is neutral in every other case.

*** Let (ei)1≤i≤n be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Vσ. Using property (2 ) of
proposition ?? on the basis (eI ) we see that (., .)σ is positive deﬁnite if Q|Vσ is,
and we know that Q|Vσ and Qσ have the same signature.
If Qσ (or equivalently Q|Vσ ) is not positive deﬁnite, then there exists i such that

2. The quadratic form Qσ on V is positive deﬁnite.

3. The restriction of the quadratic form Q to Vσ is positive deﬁnite.

*** There exists a non-degenerate hermitian form (., .)K
σ on K such that ρ is

*** Let (K, (., .)) be a space equipped with a non-degenerate hermitian form,
and let (., .)(cid:48) be a hermitian form such that for all ψ, φ ∈ K, and for all A ∈
B(K), one has (Aψ, φ)(cid:48) = (ψ, A×φ)(cid:48), where A× is the adjoint of A for (., .).
Then there exists λ ∈ R such that (., .)(cid:48) = λ(., .).

*** (Robinson’s alternative) Let K be an irreducible spinor module and (., .)K
be a σ-compatible Krein spinor product.
If Qσ is positive deﬁnite, then (., .)K is deﬁnite, if Qσ is not positive deﬁnite,
then (., .)K is neutral.

*** Let us call ρ : Cl(V ) → End(K) the representation homomorphism.
If Qσ is not positive deﬁnite, let ei ∈ Vσ be such that e2
i = −1, set U = ρ(ei)
and use lemma 2.3 .
If Qσ is positive deﬁnite, then let U : K → Se, where Se is a minimal left
ideal in Cl(V ), be a Cliﬀord-module isomorphism, which we know exists by
irreducibility of K. By Garling’s alternative, (., .)σ is positive deﬁnite, hence
its restriction to Se also is. We now transport (., .)σ to K thanks to U by the
formula (ψ, η)U := (U ψ, U η)σ, for all ψ, η ∈ K. Let us check that (., .)U is
σ-compatible:

∀a ∈ Cl(V ), (ρ(a)ψ, η)U = (U ρ(a)ψ, U η)σ

= (LaU ψ, U η)σ by the intertwining property of U
= (U ψ, La×σ U η)σ
= (U ψ, U ρ(a×σ )η)σ
= (ψ, ρ(a×σ )η)U

Now (ψ, ψ)U = 0 ⇒ (U ψ, U ψ)σ = 0 ⇒ U ψ = 0 ⇒ ψ = 0, hence (., .)U is
deﬁnite, therefore (., .)K is by lemma 2.4 .

*** If the form Qσ is positive deﬁnite then there exists a σ-compatible scalar
product on every irreducible spinor module.
If there exists at least one σ-
compatible scalar product on at least one irreducible spinor module then Qσ is
positive deﬁnite.

*** Let ρ be a c-compatible representation of Cl(V ) on a Krein space (K, (., .)).
Let σ = Adb ◦ c be an admissible real structure. Let x ∈ Cl(V ) and let (., .)x =
(., ρ(x).). Then (., .)x is a σ-compatible Krein product on K iﬀ x = x× and x is
proportional to b−1.

*** The two properties are easily seen to be suﬃcient. Let us prove that they
are necessary. First we note that since Cl(V ) is simple and ρ (cid:54)= 0, then ρ is
injective. For (., .)x to be sesquilinear x must satisfy ρ(x) = ρ(x)× which is
equivalent to x = x× since ρ is injective and c-compatible. Now we note that
a×σ = σ(aT ) = σ ◦ c ◦ c(aT ) = Adb(a×) = ba×b−1.
We must have ρ(a×σ ) = ρ(a)×σ = ρ(x)−1ρ(a)×ρ(x) and we obtain that xb is a
scalar by the injectivity of ρ.

*** Let ρ be a c-compatible representation of Cl(V ) on a Krein space (K, (., .)).
Let σ = Adb ◦ c be an admissible real structure with b real.

1. If b× = b, (., .)b := (., ρ(b)−1.) is a σ-compatible Krein product on K.
2. If b× = −b, (., .)b := (., iρ(b)−1.) is a σ-compatible Krein product on K.

*** Let L be a line in V . Then

• The unique admissible real structure which restricts to sL is σv := Adv ◦ c,

where v ∈ L is a non-zero vector.

• The unique admissible real structure which restricts to −sL is σωv :=

Adωv ◦ c, where v ∈ L is a non-zero vector.

*** Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional real vector space of even dimension with non-
degenerate quadratic form Q. Let ρ be a c-compatible irreducible representation
on the Krein space (K, (., .)). Then:

1. The signature of Q is anti-Lorentzian iﬀ there exists v ∈ V such that

(., .)v := (., ρ(v)−1.) is deﬁnite.

2. If n = 2 or n = 6 modulo 8, then the signature of Q is Lorentzian iﬀ there

exists v ∈ V such that (., .)v := (., ρ(ωv)−1.) is deﬁnite.

3. If n = 0 or n = 4 modulo 8, then the signature is Lorentzian iﬀ there

exists v ∈ V such that (., .)v := (., iρ(ωv)−1.) is deﬁnite.

In every case, (., .)v is deﬁnite ⇔ v ∈ C, and there exists λ = ±1 such that
λ(., .)v positive deﬁnite ⇔ v ∈ C+ and λ(., .)v negative deﬁnite ⇔ v ∈ C−.

***

1. We know that Q has anti-Lorentz signature iﬀ there exists a line L such
that B(sL(.), .) is positive deﬁnite. Observe that B(sL(.), .) = Qσ, where
σ = Adv ◦ c, for any non-zero v ∈ L. We also know that (., .)v is a σ-
compatible Krein product on K by proposition 2.4 , and we conclude by
Robinson’s alternative.

2. Case 2 and 3 are similar to case 1 with the extra complication that b = ωv

satisﬁes b× = b for n = 2, 6 mod 8 and b× = −b for n = 0, 4 mod 8.

It is obvious that a line L is such that B(sL(.), .) is positive deﬁnite iﬀ L\{0} lies
inside the light cone. Moreover multiplication by −1 exchanges C+ with C− and
(., .)v with −(., .)v, so that it only remains to show that (ψ, ψ)v keeps a constant
sign for a ﬁxed non-zero ψ and v varying continuously in one component of C,
which is immediate by continuity of ρ.

*** Let w be a spacelike non-zero element of V and let (ψ, ψ)w := (ψ, wψ).
Then KL and KR are orhogonal to each other for (., .)w. If n > 2, the form
(., .)w is neutral on each half-spinor module KL and KR.

*** First, since multiplication by w changes chirality, it is obvious that KL
and KR are orthogonal to each other for (., .)w since they are self-orthogonal
If n > 2 we can ﬁnd a spacelike vector e such that e2 = −1 and
for (., .).
B(e, w) = 0. Let Ue : KL → KR be the map ψ (cid:55)→ eψ. Since (eψ, eψ)w =
(eψ, weψ) = −(eψ, ewψ) = (ψ, ψ)w, Ue is an isometry for (., .)w. Thus (., .)w,
which is globally neutral, must have the same signature on KR and KL, hence
the result.

*** Let u, v ∈ V . If n > 2, u + χv is Krein positive iﬀ u + v and u− v are both
timelike and future-directed.

*** First, using the fact that KL and KR are self-orthogonal we have

(ψ, (u + χv)ψ) = (ψL, (u − v)ψL) + (ψR, (u + v)ψR)

with ψ = ψL + ψR, ψL/R ∈ KL/R. If u± v are timelike and future-directed then
(., (u ± v).) are both scalar products, hence the two summands are positive.
Conversely, if u + v is timelike and past-directed, we can take ψL = 0 and
ψR (cid:54)= 0 to obtain a negative result. Similarly u − v cannot be past-directed. If
u + v is spacelike we can use lemma 2.6 to see that there exists a ψR such that
(ψR, (u + v)ψR) < 0. A similar conclusion holds if u − v is spacelike.

*** If u + χv + r is Krein-positive, then u is timelike and future-directed.

*** Let ρ : Cl(V ) → End(K) be an irreducible c-compatible representation.
Then there exists an antilinear operator C : K → K implementing c, i.e. such
that

ρ(c(a)) = Cρ(a)C−1

for all a ∈ Cl(V ). This operator can be chosen to satisfy C2 = ˜ and C×C = ˜κ,
with ˜ and ˜κ some signs, and in that case is unique up to multiplication by eiθ,
θ ∈ R.
Let σ = Adb ◦ c be an admissible real structure, with b in the Cliﬀord group
such that b2 = λ = ±1, b× = λ(cid:48)b, λ(cid:48) = ±1, and c(b) = b. Let B = ρ(b). Then σ
is implemented on K by Cσ = BC = CB.
σ Cσ = λλ(cid:48)˜κ, and if (., .)σ is a σ-compatible Krein product
We have C2
on K, then (Cσ)×σ = λC×

σ and (Cσ)×σCσ = λ(cid:48)C×C.

σ = λ˜, C×

*** Fix any basis of K and denote by c.c. : ψ (cid:55)→ ¯ψ the complex conjugation
of coordinates with respect to this basis. We also denote by c.c. : A (cid:55)→ ¯A
the antilinear involution on operators induced by complex conjugation of
coordinates, that is : ¯Aψ = A ¯ψ. Let us write ˜c = ρ ◦ c ◦ ρ−1. Since ˜c is an
antilinear involution of End(K), ˜c ◦ c.c. is a linear (involutive) automorphism
and is thus of the form AdC for some C ∈ End(K). We let C = C ◦ c.c. and we
obtain that ρ(c(a)) = Cρ(a)C−1.
The fact that c is an involution translates as C2 = ˜, with ˜ a constant. Let
ψ ∈ K be such that Cψ (cid:54)= 0. Then C3ψ = ˜Cψ = C(˜ψ), which shows that ˜ is
real. From the fact that ρ is c-compatible we obtain that ρ(c(a))× = ρ(c(a)×) =
ρ(c(a×)) and it boils down to CC× = ˜κ, with ˜κ a constant, which must be real.
that ˜κ = ±1 and ˜ = ±1. It is now easy to prove the uniqueness up to a phase.
The second part is an obvious consequence of proposition 2.2 . We have C×
σ Cσ =
σ B = C×
C×B×BC = λλ(cid:48)C×C = λλ(cid:48)˜κ.
σ (see
proposition 2.4 ), and if λ = −1, then (Cσ)×σ = (iB)−1C×
Hence we have (Cσ)×σCσ = λC×

Calculating C2(C×)2 we ﬁnd that ˜κ2 = ˜2. Dividing C by(cid:112)|˜κ| we can suppose

If λ = 1 then (Cσ)×σ = B−1C×
σ (iB) = −C×

σ Cσ = λC×B×BC = λλ(cid:48)C×B2C = λ(cid:48)C×C.

*** The following claims are equivalent.

1. There exists a p-form ω such that Ker(ωx) is a timelike q-dimensional

subspace of TxM for all x ∈ M .

2. There exists a p-form ω such that for every linearly independent family

(v1, . . . , vp) of spacelike tangent vectors at x, ωx(v1, . . . , vp) (cid:54)= 0.

3. Given any decomposition T M = Es ⊕ Et of the tangent bundle into the
sum of a spacelike and timelike subbundle, there exists a non-vanishing
top form ωs of Es.

*** To see that (1 ) entails (2 ) consider any family F = (v1, . . . , vp) of spacelike
tangent vectors at x and let Sx ⊂ TxM be the linear subspace they span. Since
Kerωx is timelike and q-dimensional, one has Kerωx ⊕ Sx = TxM . Call πx
the projection onto Sx deﬁned by this decomposition.
It is immediate that
ωx(u1, . . . , up) = λ detF (πx(u1), . . . , πx(up)) for any vectors u1, . . . , up, where
detF is the determinant in the basis F of Sx and λ ∈ R. Clearly λ (cid:54)= 0 since ωx
does not vanish identically. Hence ωx(v1, . . . , vp) (cid:54)= 0.
The proof that (2 ) entails (3 ) is immediate. To obtain (1 ) from (3 ), consider
the projection π on Es deﬁned by T M = Es⊕ Et, and extend ωs by the formula

ωx(u1, . . . , up) := ωs

x(π(u1), . . . , π(up))

Then ω is a p-form on T M and its kernel at x is clearly (Et)x.

*** There exists a c-compatible spinor metric iﬀ (M, g) is time orientable when
p, q are even, and iﬀ (M, g) is space orientable when p, q are odd.

*** We deal with the odd case only, the even case being completely similar.
Let us suppose that there exists a c-compatible spinor metric H. Consider a
covering of M by open sets (Uα)α∈A such that T M and S are trivial over Uα,
and a subordinate partition of unity (fα)α∈A. For each x ∈ M we let Ix be the
ﬁnite set of indices α such that fα(x) (cid:54)= 0. On each Uα let us choose a section ψα
of the spinor bundle which is constant in some trivialization S|Uα (cid:39) Uα × C2n/2

Let (e1, . . . , ep, ep+1, . . . , en) be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of TxM such that
e1, . . . , ep are spacelike. Then we know that Hx(., ir(e1 . . . ep)−1.) is deﬁnite.
Since (e1 . . . ep)−1 = ep . . . e1 = (−1)re1 . . . ep, we have either:

∀α ∈ Ix, Hx(ψα, ire1 . . . epψα) > 0

or

∀α ∈ Ix, Hx(ψα, ire1 . . . epψα) < 0

In both cases we have ωx(e1, . . . , ep) (cid:54)= 0. Now, since ω is multilinear alternate,
we have for any vectors u1 . . . , up ∈ Span(e1, . . . , ep):

ωx(u1, . . . , up) = det(uj

i )1≤i,j≤pωx(e1, . . . , ep)

(10)

where uj
i is the j-th component of ui in the basis (e1, . . . , ep). Since (e1, . . . , ep) is
any orthonormal family of spatial vectors, this shows that ωx(u1, . . . , up) (cid:54)= 0 for
any linearly independent family of spatial vectors. Thus ω is a space orientation.
Conversely, since M is space-orientable, there exists a Euclidean real structure
σ = Adb ◦ c where b is a smooth section of the Cliﬀord group bundle. On the
Riemannian manifold (M, gσ) it is well-known that there exists a σ-compatible
spinor metric. Let us call ˜H such a spinor metric. Then H(., .) = ˜H(., irb.)

also that (Kerp)⊥ = Im(p×) (the orthogonal and adjoint are relative to (, )a) is
one-dimensional8. Let us call v a non-zero vector in this space.
If v were isotropic, then for all ψ, η ∈ Se one would have (p×(ψ), p×(η))a =
(ψ, pp×(η))a = 0. By the non-degeneracy of (., .)a this would imply pp× = 0
which is excluded since ee×σ (cid:54)= 0.
Then we can suppose that (v, v) =  = ±1. Let us call q ∈ Se the orthogonal
projection on Cv = (Kerp)⊥. Explicitly one has q(ψ) = (v, ψ)v, and it is easy
to check that q2 = q = q×. Moreover, Kerq = v⊥ = Kerp. Since v is not
isotropic, v /∈ Ker(q), hence Se = Ker(q) ⊕ Cv. If ψ ∈ Ker(q), then ψ ∈ Kerp,
hence pq(ψ) = p(ψ) = 0. Moreover pq(v) = p(v). Thus p = pq. Similarly it is
easy to check that qp = q using Se = Kerp ⊕ Ce.
Let us call f = L−1(q) ∈ Cl(V ). Using L one sees that f 2 = f , f×σ = f ,
e = ef , f = f e. This shows a). The uniqueness is easy to prove.
Let us show b). Since we know that (aψ, φ)σ = (ψ, a×σ φ)σ for all a ∈ Cl(V )
and φ, ψ ∈ Se by (??), then by lemma 2.4 there exists λ ∈ R such that
(., .)σ = λ(., .)a on Se. There thus suﬃces to show that λ (cid:54)= 0.
Let us consider f as an element of Se. Then (f, f )σ = τn(f×σ f ) = τn(f ). Now
f being a non zero projection, its normalized trace is not zero. On the other
hand we have (f, f )σ = λ(f, f )a. This shows that λ (cid:54)= 0, and that (., .)σ is
σ-compatible.

*** The Dirac operator and spin structure commute if and only if {J, X} =
[J,∇X ] = 0 for all X ∈ Γ(T M ).

*** The fact that {J, X} = [J,∇X ] = 0 are suﬃcient conditions is a
straightforward calculation.
Let us prove that they are necessary. Let f be a smooth real-valued function.
Since [J, D] = [J, f ] = 0, we deduce that J commutes with [D, f ] = −iγ(df ).
We infer easily that J anti-commutes with any real vector ﬁeld or diﬀerential
form. Next we consider the diﬀerential operator ∇(cid:48) = J−1∇J. This operator is
a Cliﬀord connection. Indeed, for any X, Y ∈ Γ(T M ), ψ ∈ Γ(S):

X (Y · ψ) = J−1∇X J(Y · ψ)
∇(cid:48)
= −J−1∇X (Y · Jψ)
= −J−1(∇LC

There thus exists a complex-valued one-form ω such that: ∇(cid:48)
This can also be written: ω(X) = J−1[∇X , J]. We have:

X − ∇X = ω(X).

*** The Dirac operator is essentially self-adjoint if and only if X× = X for all
X ∈ Γ(T M ), and the Cliﬀord connection ∇ is metric for H.

*** Let us assume that the Dirac operator is self-adjoint. Let f be a real-valued
smooth function. Then f is self-adjoint. This implies that [D, f ] = −iγ(df ) is
anti-self-adjoint. We easily conclude from this that all real vector ﬁelds and all
real-valued 1-forms are self-adjoint. In particular, the γ(dxµ) are self-adjoint.
Let ψ, φ be spinor ﬁelds with compact support. We have:

for all ψ, φ ∈ Γc(S). Now, the expression between brackets can be proven to be
C∞(M, C)-linear in φ (and anti-linear in ψ as well). Indeed, H(∇µψ, γ(dxµ)φ) is
clearly linear in φ. let f ∈ C∞(M, C). We replace φ by f φ in the two remaining
terms:

H(ψ,∇µ(γ(dxµ)f φ)) − ∂µH(ψ, γ(dxµ)f φ) = H(ψ,∇µ[f (γ(dxµ)φ)]) − ∂µ[f H(ψ, γ(dxµ)φ)]

= f [H(ψ,∇µ(γ(dxµ)φ)) − ∂µH(ψ, γ(dxµ)φ)]

Thus, for all f ∈ C∞(M, C) and ψ, φ ∈ Γc(S):

[H(∇µψ, γ(dxµ)φ) + H(ψ,∇µ(γ(dxµ)φ)) − ∂µH(ψ, γ(dxµ)φ)] = 0

locally, consider a spinor ﬁeld ψ such that H(ψ, γ(dxµ)φ) = 0 for µ = 2, . . . , n
