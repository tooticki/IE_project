Lemma 3. [Ber, Proposition 2] Let A1, A2, ..., Al be a commuting family of matrices in Mn×n(C). Let F be the
algebra of matrices in Mn×n(C) generated by A1, A2, ..., Al and the identity. Then

dimF ≤ (l + 1)n2− 2

Lemma 4. [Ber, Proposition 1] Let L be an algebra over C, A, Z commutative subalgebras in L, A1, A2, ..., Al ∈ A,
X1, ..., Xp, Y1, ..., Yq ∈ L. Let us assume that Z lies in the center of the algebra L, Z ⊂ A, A is the commutative

has dimension at most (pq)(l+1)/2(l + 1)(l+1)/2.
