A BERESTYCKI-LIONS TYPE RESULT AND APPLICATIONS

CLAUDIANOR O. ALVES, RONALDO C. DUARTE AND MARCO A. S. SOUTO

Abstract. In this paper we show an abstract theorem involving the existence
of critical points for a functional I, which permit us to prove the existence of
solutions for a large class of Berestycki-Lions type problems. In the proof of
the abstract result we apply the deformation lemma on a special set associated
with I, which we call of Pohozaev set.

1. Introduction

At the last years a lot of authors have dedicated a special attention for existence

of solution for elliptic problems of the type
−∆u = g(u),

in RN ,

(1.1)
where N ≥ 2, ∆ denotes the Laplacian operator and g is a continuous function
verifying some conditions.

The main motivation comes from of the seminal paper due to Berestycki and
Lions [15], which has considered the existence of solution for (1.1) by assuming
that N ≥ 3 and the following conditions on g:
≤ lim sup
s→0+
s2∗−1 ≤ 0,
g(s)

−∞ < lim inf
s→0+

≤ −m < 0,

ξ > 0 such that G(ξ) > 0,

there is

where G(s) =(cid:82) s

0 g(t) dt.

In [16], Berestycki, Gallouet and Kavian have studied the case where N = 2 and

the nonlinearity g possesses an exponential growth of the type

lim sup
s→0+

g(s)
eβs2 = 0,

∀β > 0.

In the two above mentioned papers, the authors have used the variational method
to prove the existence of solution for (1.1). The main idea is to solve the minimization
problems

for N ≥ 3 and N = 2 respectively. After that, the authors showed that the
minimizer functions of the above problems are in fact ground state solutions of
(1.1). By a ground state solution, we mean a solution u ∈ H 1(RN ) \ {0} that
satisﬁes

E(u) ≤ E(v)

for all nontrival solution v of (1.1),

where E : H 1(RN ) → R is the energy functional associated to (1.1) given by

After, Jeanjean and Tanaka in [37] showed that the mountain pass level of E is

a critical level and it is indeed the lowest critical level.
A version of the problem (1.1) for the critical case have been made in Alves,
Souto and Montenegro [5] for N ≥ 3 and N = 2, see also Zhang and Zhou [51] for
N = 3. The reader can found in Alves, Figueiredo and Siciliano [4], Chang and
Wang [20] and Zhang, do ´O and Squassina [52] the same type of results involving
the fractional Laplacian operator, more precisely, for a problem like

(−∆)αu = g(u),

in RN ,

(1.2)
with α ∈ (0, 1) and N ≥ 1.
We would like point out that the method used in the above papers works well
because g does not depend on x, −∆ and (−∆)α are homogeneous operators and
there is a Pohozaev identity associated with (1.1) and (1.2) . When one of these
facts is not veriﬁed it is necessary to change the arguments.
In [43], Pomponio
and Watanabe have studied the existence of solution for (1.1) changing −∆ by
−∆p − ∆q, that is, the following problem has been considered
(1.3)

−∆pu − ∆qu = g(u),

in RN .

In this case, there is a loss of homogeneity in the operator, then the arguments
used in the previous paper does not work well. To overcome this diﬃculty, the
authors have used a result found in Jeanjean [38, Theorem 1.1] to solve the problem.
However, the fact that above problem has a Pohozaev identity is crucial in their
approach. In [12], Azzollini and Pomponio have considered the existence of solution
for the following class of problem

(1.4)

−∆u + V (x)u = g(u),

in RN .

By supposing some geometry conditions on V , the authors also used [38, Theorem
1.1] as well as the fact that there is a Pohozaev identity associated with the problem.
The read is invited to see that in the papers [43] and [12] a Pohozaev identity is
a key point to prove that a sequence of approximate solutions for (1.3) and (1.4)
are bounded.

Motivated by above papers, we were led for the following problem: If g is a
discontinuous function how to get a solution for problems (1.1), (1.2) or (1.3) ?
The main diﬃculty is related to the fact that the classical variational methods to
C 1 functional cannot be applied. Moreover, in this situation, there is no Pohozaev

identity associated with the problem. A second problem that we are interesting is
a version of (1.3) involving fractional Laplacian problem, more precisely,

3

(−∆)αu + (−∆)βu = g(u),

in RN ,

(1.5)
where α, β ∈ (0, 1), N > 2 max{α, β} and g be a continuous function. This
problem becomes interesting, because the authors do not know a Pohozaev identity
associated with it. Finally, another problem that we are interesting is the following
Anisotropic problem

in RN ,

where 1 < p1 < ... < pn < N and g be a continuous function. Here, as in
last problem the authors do not know a Pohozaev identity associated with (1.6).
From these above commentaries a new approach must be developed to solved them.
Having theses problems in mind, in the present paper we show that there is an
abstract result behind of the famous result due to Berestycki and Lions [15], which
can be used to solve a lot of problems where the existence of a Pohozaev identity
is not clear. An advantage of our main result is related to the fact that it can be
applied for a lot of problems where the nonlinearity g is continuous, and also, for
some problems where the nonlinearity g is discontinuous.
Before stating our abstract theorem we need to ﬁx some notations. In the sequel
(X,|| ||) is a reﬂexive Banach space and ψ1, ..., ψn, Φ : X → R are continuous
functionals verifying:
There is an application ∗ : [0,∞) × X → X and λ1, ..., λn, λΦ ∈ R such that
(X1) ψi(∗(t, u)) = tλiψi(u);
(X2) Φ(∗(t, u)) = tλΦ Φ(u);
(X3) 0 < max{λ1, ..., λp} < λΦ;
∀u ∈ X;
(X4)
(X5) For each u ∈ X ﬁxed, the application t (cid:55)−→ ∗(t, u) is continuous.
There are subsets X +, X r ⊂ X that are weak closed and a function Q : X + → X r
verifying:
(X6) ψi(Q(u)) ≤ ψi(u), ∀u ∈ X +, ∀i ∈ {1, ..., n};
(X7) Φ(Q(u)) ≥ Φ(u), ∀u ∈ X +;
(X8) If u ∈ X r, then ∗(t, u) ∈ X r for all t ≥ 0.

∗(0, u) = 0,

Before writing our next assumptions, we would like to ﬁx the following notations

ut := ∗(t, u),

∀t ≥ 0

and u ∈ X,

J(u) :=

ψi(u),

∀u ∈ X

n(cid:88)

and

i=1

I(u) = J(u) − Φ(u),

∀u ∈ X.

Moreover of the above conditions, we also assume the following:

(F1) Φ(0) = 0 and there is u ∈ X such that Φ(u) > 0.
(F2) ψi(u) ≥ 0 for all i ∈ {1, ..., n} and u ∈ X. Moreover, J(u) = 0 ⇔ u = 0.
(F3) There exists r > 0 such that if 0 < ||u|| < r, then

i=i

λiψi(u) > λΦΦ(u).

(F4) For any sequence (uk) satisfying Φ(uk) ≥ 0 and J(uk) → 0, we have ||uk|| → 0.
Moreover, if (J(uk)) is bounded, then (uk) is also bounded.
(F5) If (uk) ⊂ X r is weakly convergent for u in X, then

Φ(uk) ≤ Φ(u).

(F6) If (uk) is weakly convergent for u in X, then

∀i ∈ {1, 2, ...., n}.
In throughout this article, we denote by P and P + the sets

ψi(u) ≤ lim inf

k→∞ ψi(uk),

and

P = {u ∈ X \ {0} : λ1ψ1(u) + ... + λnψn(u) = λΦΦ(u)}

P + =(cid:8)u ∈ X + \ {0} : λ1ψ1(u) + ... + λnψn(u) = λΦΦ(u)(cid:9) .

The set P will called of Pohozaev set and associated with it we have the operator

K(u) = λ1ψ1(u) + ... + λnψn(u) − λΦΦ(u),

which will call of Pohozaev operator. Note that K−1({0}) = P ∪ {0}.

Now, we are ready to state our main result.

The plan of the paper is as follows: In Section 2 we have proved some preliminary
results that will be used in Section 3 to show the Theorem 1.1. In Section 4 we
study the existence of solution for a large class of problem, which includes the
problem

(−∆)αu + (−∆)βu = g(u),

in RN ,

(P1)
where α, β ∈ (0, 1), (−∆)α and (−∆)β denote the fractional Laplacian of order α
and β respectively, N > 2 max{α, β} and g(s) = f (s) − s is a continuous function.
In Section 5, we consider the existence of solution for an Anisotropic problem like

(P2)
where 1 < p1 < ... < pn < N and g = f (s) − |s|p0−2s is a continuous function.
Finally, in Section 6, we establish the existence of solution for a class of discontinuous
problem of the type

2. Preliminary results

In this section, we have showed some technical lemmas that will be used in the

next section to prove Theorem 1.1.
Lemma 2.1. Let u ∈ X satisfying Φ(u) > 0. Then, there exists a unique t∗ > 0
such that ut∗ ∈ P. Hence,

and for u ∈ P,

I(ut∗ ) = max
t≥0

I(ut)

I(u) = max
t≥0

I(ut).

Proof. Let u ∈ X satisfying Φ(u) > 0. By (F1), u (cid:54)= 0. For each t ≥ 0, we ﬁx

h(t) := I(ut),

∀t ∈ [0, +∞).

By (X1) − (X2),

h(t) = tλ1 ψ1(u) + ... + tλn ψn(u) − tλΦ Φ(u).
Now, From (X3) and (F2), h(t) > 0 for t > 0 large small and

t→+∞ h(t) = −∞.

lim

These informations ensure that h possesses a maximum in some t∗ ∈ (0, +∞), that
is,

Since h(cid:48)(t∗) = 0, we derive that ut∗ ∈ P. To show the uniqueness of t∗, we ﬁrst
recall that ut ∈ P if, and only if,

I(ut∗ ) = max
t>0

I(ut).

λ1tλ1ψ1(u) + ... + λntλn ψn(u) = λΦtλΦ Φ(u).

In the sequel, without loss of generality, we assume that λ1 = max{λi}n
ut ∈ P if, and only if,

i=1. Then,

(2.7)

λit(λi−λ1)ψi(u) + λΦt(λΦ−λ1)Φ(u).

λ1ψ1(u) = − n(cid:88)
m(t) = − n(cid:88)

i=2

Combining (X3) with (F2) and the fact that Φ(u) > 0, it follows that the function

λit(λi−λ1)ψi(u) + λΦt(λΦ−λ1)Φ(u),

t ≥ 0

for

i=2

has a positive derivative in (0, +∞). Therefore, m is increasing, m(0) = 0 and
m(t) → +∞ as t → +∞. These facts guarantee the existence of a unique t > 0
(cid:3)
satisfying (2.7).
Corollary 2.2. The Pohozaev set P is not empty.
Proof. The result follows by combining the last lemma with (F1).

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.3. There exists r > 0 such that

||u|| ≥ r,

∀u ∈ P.

u0 ∈ P satisfying

I(u0) = inf

u∈P I(u).

u∈P I(u) > 0.

Moreover, inf
Proof. If u ∈ P, (F2) combined with (X3) gives
(2.8) I(u) = J(u) − Φ(u) =

and (uk) is a minimizing sequence associated with I∞, that is, (uk) ⊂ P + and

I(u)

I(uk) → I∞.

From (2.8), (J(uk)) is a bounded sequence. Hence, by (F4), the sequence (uk) is
also bounded in X. On the other hand, by conditions (X6) − (X7), we know that
(Q(uk)) ⊂ X r and

and

By Lemma 2.1, there exits t∗

I∞ ≤ I(cid:0)(Q[uk])t∗

The last inequality yields

J(Q(uk)) ≤ J(uk),
Φ(Q(uk)) ≥ Φ(uk) > 0,

∀k ∈ N.

k > 0 such that (Q[uk])t∗

Proof. For all u ∈ P,

K(u) =

n(cid:88)

i=1

λiψi(u) − λΦΦ(u) = 0.

On the other hand, by (F3), there exists r > 0 such that

K(u) =(cid:80)n

i=1 λiψi(u) − λΦΦ(u) > 0,
∀u ∈ P.

||u|| ≥ r,

∀ 0 < ||u|| < r.

Thus,

From this, without loss of generality we can assume that (uk) ⊂ X r. As X is
reﬂexive and X r is weak closed, we can suppose that for some subsequence, (uk) is
weakly convergent for some u ∈ X r. Since, uk ∈ P, we must have Φ(uk) > 0, and
so, by (F5),

k

Φ(u) ≥ 0.

We claim that Φ(u) > 0. Indeed, assume by contradiction that Φ(u) = 0. Then,

Φ(uk) → 0
Using the fact that uk ∈ P, we derive
J(uk) → 0

as k → +∞.

as k → +∞.

7

Now, applying (F4) we get

which contradicts Lemma 2.3. Thereby, Φ(u) > 0, and so, u (cid:54)= 0. Consequently,
the Lemma 2.1 guarantees the existence of t∗ > 0 verifying

||uk|| → 0,

ut∗ ∈ P.

From (X1) − (X2),

I(uk) = maxt>0 I ((uk)t)

≥ I ((uk)t∗ )

=(cid:80)n

i=1 ψi((uk)t∗ ) − Φ((uk)t∗ )
i=1(t∗)λiψi(uk) − (t∗)λΦ Φ(uk).

The last inequality combines with (F5) − (F6) to give

I∞ ≥ lim inf k→∞(cid:0)(cid:80)n

i=1(t∗)λiψi(uk) − (t∗)λΦ Φ(uk)(cid:1)

i=1(t∗)λi ψi(u) − (t∗)λΦ Φ(u)

≥(cid:80)n

= I(ut∗ ).

Recalling that ut∗ ∈ P, we deduce that

I∞ = I(ut∗ ).

u∈P I(u) > 0. In fact, by (2.8), I∞ ≥ 0. If
Now, we are going to show that I∞ = inf
I∞ = 0, we can argue as above to ﬁnd a minimizing sequence (uk) ⊂ P + satisfying
Φ(uk) ≥ 0 and J(uk) → 0. However, this information together with (F4) leads
to ||uk|| → 0, contradicting Lemma 2.3. Therefore,
u∈P I(u) > 0, ﬁnishing the
inf
(cid:3)
proof.

3. Proof of Theorem 1.1

In this section our main goal is proving the Theorem 1.1, however to do that, we

need to prove more some preliminary lemmas.
Lemma 3.1. Let u ∈ P and set γ(t) := ut. Then,
t→+∞ I(γ(t)) = −∞.

lim

Proof. First of all, note that

n(cid:88)

i=1

(3.9)

I(γ(t)) =

tλi

ψi(u) − tλΦ Φ(u),

∀t ∈ [0, +∞).

As u ∈ P, we have Φ(u) > 0. This combined with (X3) gives the desired result. (cid:3)
Lemma 3.2. Let γ : R → X be a continuous path satisfying
t→+∞ I(γ(t)) = −∞.

lim
Then, there exists t0 > 0 such that γ(t0) ∈ P.
Proof. We begin by supposing that γ(t) (cid:54)= 0 for all t > 0. Since

γ(0) = 0 and

n(cid:88)

i=1

K(u) =

λiψi(u) − λΦΦ(u),

8

C. O. ALVES, R.C. DUARTE AND M.A.S. SOUTO

by (F3), there exists r > 0 such that

K(u) > 0,

for

||u|| < r.

As γ(0) = 0 and γ, K are continuous functions, for t small enough we must have

K(γ(t)) > 0.

On the other hand, the deﬁnition of I, (X3) and (f3) lead to
(λi − λΦ)ψi(u) ≤ λΦI(u),

K(u) = λΦI(u) +

n(cid:88)

∀u ∈ X.

Hence,

i=1

K(γ(t)) ≤ λΦI(γ(t)),

∀t ∈ [0, +∞).

Then, K(γ(t)) < 0 for t large enough. From this, there is t > 0 verifying

implying that γ(t) ∈ P. For the general case, ﬁx ˜t > 0 satisfying

K(γ(t)) = 0,

˜t = sup{t ∈ [0, +∞); γ(t) = 0} .

By continuity, γ(˜t) = 0. Setting

β(t) = γ(t + ˜t) ∀t ∈ [0, +∞),
t→∞ I(β(t)) = −∞ and β(t) (cid:54)= 0, for all t > 0. By the
lim

we have that β(0) = 0,
above arguments, there exists t0 > 0 such that
β(t0) ∈ P,

showing that γ(t0 + ˜t) ∈ P.

(cid:3)

Next, we recall the deformation lemma for locally Lipschitz functional found in

Figueiredo and Pimenta [35] that will be used in the proof of Theorem 1.1.
Theorem 3.3. (Deformation Lemma) Let X be a Banach space and I : X → R be
a locally Lipschitz functional. Assume that there are c ∈ R, S ⊂ E and α, δ, 0 > 0
satisfying

β(x) := min{||z||X∗ ; z ∈ ∂I(x)} ≥ α, for all x ∈ I−1([c − 0, c + 0]) ∩ S2δ.

where S2δ is a 2δ-neighborhood of S. Then, for each 0 <  < min{ δα
exists a homeomorphism η : X → X satisfying

2 , 0} there

• η(u) = u, se u /∈ I−1([c − 0, c + 0]) ∩ S2δ;
• η(I c+ ∩ S) ⊂ I c−;
• I(η(u)) ≤ I(u) for all u ∈ X,

where I a = {u ∈ X; I(u) ≤ a} for all a ∈ R.

Now, we are ready to proof Theorem 1.1.

Proof. (Proof of Theorem 1.1 ) By Proposition 2.4, there is u ∈ P with

I(u) = I∞ = inf

w∈P I(w) > 0.

Assume by contradiction that 0 /∈ ∂I(u). Then, there is α > 0 such that
(3.10)

|x − u| < α ⇒ β(x) = min{||z||X∗ ; z ∈ ∂I(x)} > α.

Indeed, otherwise for each α = 1

|u − xk| <

and

Consequently, it would exist zk ∈ ∂I(xk) with

.

By deﬁnition and properties of I 0(u, v) (see [19]), we must have

I 0(u, v) ≥ lim sup
k→∞

I 0(xk, v) ≥ lim sup
k→∞

(cid:104)zk, v(cid:105) = (cid:104)0, v(cid:105),
showing that 0 ∈ ∂I(u), which is absurd. This proves (3.10).
we get a homeomorphism η : X → X satisfying

Applying the Deformation Lemma for c = I∞, δ = α
η(u) = u, if u /∈ I−1([c − 0, c + 0]) ∩ S2δ;
η(I c+ ∩ S) ⊂ I c−;
I(η(u)) ≤ I(u) for all u ∈ X.

(u),

Fix

β(t) := η(γ(t))

where γ(t) = ut. By (X5), the function β is continuous. Moreover, from (X4) and
I(0) < c − 0, we obtain

β(0) = η(γ(0)) = η(0) = 0.

Now, by Lemma 3.1 and (iii),

lim
t→+∞ I(β(t)) = lim

(3.11)
The above analysis permit us to apply Lemma 3.2 to ﬁnd t∗ > 0 such that β(t∗) ∈ P.
Hence,

t→+∞ I(η(γ(t))) ≤ lim

t→+∞ I(γ(t)) = −∞.

(3.12)

c ≤ I(β(t∗)) ≤ max

I(β(t)).

t>0

On the hand, as I(u) = c < c + , γ(1) = u, I and γ are continuous, we can choose
τ > 0 of such way that

∀t ∈ [1 − τ, 1 + τ ].
Thereby, if t ∈ [1 − τ, 1 + τ ], the Deformation Lemma yields

γ(t) ∈ I c+ ∩ S,

I(β(t)) = I(η(γ(t))) ≤ c − .

Now, we will analyze the case t /∈ [1 − τ, 1 + τ ]. In this case, by Lemma 2.1 and
(iii),

I(β(t)) = I(η(γ(t))) ≤ I(γ(t)) < max

I(γ(t)) = I(γ(1)) = c

t>0

In any case, we deduce that

contradicting (3.12). Therefore,

I(β(t)) < c,

ﬁnishing the proof.

The Corollary below is a version of Theorem 1.1 when the functional I is

Moreover, u is a critical point of I in X, that is, I(cid:48)(u) = 0.
Proof. Since I ∈ C 1(X, R), we have that

∂I(u) = {I(cid:48)(u)} ,

∀u ∈ X.

Therefore, o corollary is an immediate consequence of the Theorem 1.1.

The main result this section has the following statement

Theorem 4.1. Assume the conditions (f1) − (f4). Then, (P1) has a nontrivial
solution.

Proof. In the sequel, we will show that all conditions of Theorem 1.1 hold, which
ensures that functional I1 has a nontrivial critical point, and hence (P1) has a
nontrivial solution. First of all, note that
I1(u) = J(u) − Φ(u),

∀u ∈ X = H sn (RN ).

In what follows, we set ∗(t, u) := ut : RN → R by

t > 0,

It is easy to check that

ψ1, ψ2, ..., ψn, Φ ∈ C 1(H sn (RN ), R),

u ∈ X r ⇒ ut ∈ X r,

∀t ≥ 0,

Φ(ut) = tN Φ(u),

∀t ≥ 0

and ∀u ∈ H sn (RN )

and

∀t ≥ 0,

ψi(ut) = tN−2si ψi(u),
Thus, the conditions (X1)−(X4) and (F2) occur. Moreover, a simple computation
shows that for each u ∈ H sn(RN ), the application t (cid:55)−→ ut is continuous, and so,
(X5) is also proved.

and ∀u ∈ H sn (RN ).

∀i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}

The conditions (X6) − (X8) are veriﬁed by considering

Q : H sn (RN ) −→ X r

u

(cid:55)−→ (u+)∗

where (u+)∗ is the Schwartz’s symmetrization of u+ = max{u, 0}.
Now, we are going to prove the conditions (F1) and (F3) − (F6).

Claim 4.2. ( Proof of (F1) ): There exists u ∈ H sn(RN ) such that Φ(u) > 0
and Φ(0) = 0.
Proof. By deﬁnition of Φ, we have Φ(0) = 0. For each k ∈ N, take φk ∈ C∞

for all k ∈ N. If (J(uk)) is bounded, we have that (uk) is also bounded. Moreover,
if J(uk) → 0, then ||uk|| → 0.

that is, lim inf

ψi(u) ≤ lim inf

I1(u) ≥ I1(u+),

∀u ∈ H sn(RN ),

The above claims permit us to conclude that I1 veriﬁes the assumptions of
Theorem 1.1, more precisely Corollary 3.4. Hence, I1 has a nontrivial critical point,
(cid:3)
and so, problem (P1) possesses a nontrivial solution.

this subject see Nikol’skii [45] and Rakosnik [48, 49].

satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 1.1, because the critical points of I2 are weak

if

Arguing as [15, Radial Lemma A.IV ] it is possible to prove that X r is compactly

embedding Lq(RN ) for all q ∈ (p1, p∗).

From the above notations

I2(u) = J(u) − Φ(u),

∀u ∈ X = W 1,−→p (RN ).

As in the previous section, we also consider ∗(t, u) := ut : RN → R by

ut(x) =

A simple computation gives,
and ∀u ∈ W 1,−→p (RN ).
ψi(ut) = tN−piψi(u) and Φ(ut) = tN Φ(u),
Moreover, the application t (cid:55)→ ut is a continuous function in t ∈ [0, +∞) for all
u ∈ W 1,−→p (RN ) and

∀t ≥ 0

ut ∈ X r ∀t ∈ R when u ∈ X r.

In the sequel, we set Q : W 1,−→p (RN ) −→ X r by
Q(u) = (u+)∗.

By using the Lemma 5.2 and properties of radial functions, it follows that

ψi(Q(u)) ≤ ψi(u)

and Φ(u) = Φ(Q(u)),

∀u ∈ X +.

Moreover, with few modiﬁcations, we can argue as in Section 4 to show the claims
below:

• (1) There exists u ∈ W 1,−→p (RN ) such that Φ(u) > 0.
• (2) ψi(u) ≥ 0, ∀i ∈ {1, 2, ..., N} and J(u) = 0 ⇔ u = 0 .

6. An application involving discontinuous nonlinearity

In this section we consider the existence of solution for the problem

−∆u(x) ∈ ∂G(u(x)),

a.e. in RN ,

(6.15)
where N ≥ 1, G is the primitive of a function g : R → R given by g(s) = f (s) − s,
that is,

G(s) =

g(t) dt =

f (t) dt − 1

|s|2 = F (s) − 1

and ∂G(s) is the generalized gradient of G at s ∈ R, given by

(cid:90) s

(cid:90) s

∂G(s) = [g(s), g(s)]

where

g(s) = lim
r↓0

ess inf{g(t);|s − t| < r}

and g(s) = lim
r↓0

ess sup{g(t);|s − t| < r} .

When g is a continuous function, which is equivalent to say that f is continuous,

we know that G ∈ C 1(R, R) and in this case
∂G(s) = {g(s)},

∀s ∈ R.

In this section, we assume that f can have a ﬁnite number of discontinuity points

a1, a2, ...., ap ∈ R \ {0}. Moreover, f veriﬁes (f1), (f3) and the condition

(f7) There are A, B > 0 such that

|f (s)| ≤ A|s| + B|s|q,

Since we intend to ﬁnd a nonnegative solution, in what follows we assume that

f (s) = 0,

∀s < 0.

Hereafter, by a solution we understand as being a function u ∈ W

H 1(RN ) that veriﬁes (6.15), or equivalently, the problem below

Since I3 is locally Lipschitz, a function u ∈ H 1(RN ) is a critical point of I3, if
0 ∈ ∂I3(u), where ∂I3(u) denotes the generalized gradient of I3. We recall The
generalized gradient of I3 at u is the set
∂I3(u) = {µ ∈ (H 1(RN ))∗ : I 0

3 (u, v) ≥ (cid:104)µ, v(cid:105), ∀v ∈ H 1(RN )}

where I 0

The reader can ﬁnd more details about this subject in Chang [19] and Clarke [26].

The main result this section is the following

Theorem 6.1. Assume the conditions (f1) − (f3) and (f7). Then, (6.15) has a
nontrivial solution.

As in the previous section, we will show that functional I3 veriﬁes the conditions

19

of Theorem 1.1. In what follows,

X = H 1(RN ), X + = {u ∈ H 1(RN ) : u(x) ≥ 0
X r = {u ∈ H 1
if

rad(RN ) ∩ X + : 0 ≤ u(x) ≤ u(y)

J(u) = ψ(u) =

and

Φ(u) =

By using these notations,

RN

(cid:3)
rad(RN ), then

(cid:3)

I3(u) = J(u) − Φ(u),

∀u ∈ X = H 1(RN ).

A well known argument shows that Φ is locally Lipschitz, J ∈ C 1(H 1(RN ), R) and
I3 is locally Lipschitz.

Moreover, as in the previous sections, we set ∗(t, u) := ut : RN → R by

(cid:26) u(cid:0) x

(cid:1) ,

t

0,

for

ut(x) =

t (cid:54)= 0,

for
t = 0.

By deﬁnition of ψ and Φ, it follows that

Φ(ut) = tN Φ(u) and ψ(ut) = tN−2ψ(u),

∀t ≥ 0

and ∀u ∈ H 1(RN ).

From the above commentaries, we have proved (X1) − (X4) and (F2) of Theorem
1.1. Moreover, as in the previous sections, for each u ∈ H sn (RN ), the application
t (cid:55)−→ ut is continuous, and so, (X5) is also proved.

Next, as in Section 4, we will prove the other conditions of Theorem 1.1 also

occur. Setting

Q : H 1(RN ) −→ X r

u

(cid:55)−→ (u+)∗,

where (u+)∗ is the Schwartz’s symmetrization of u+, standard arguments show that
(X6) − (X8) also hold.
Claim 6.2. ( Proof of (F1)) There is u ∈ H 1(RN ) such that Φ(u) > 0 and
Φ(0) = 0.

Proof. The claim follows with the same arguments explored in Claim 4.2.

(cid:3)

Claim 6.3. ( Proof of (F3)) There exists r > 0 such that

(N − 2)ψ(u) > N Φ(u),

for

0 < ||u|| < r.

(cid:3)
Proof. See proof of Claim 4.3
Claim 6.4. ( Proof of (F4)) Let (uk) be a sequence in H 1(RN ) with Φ(uk) ≥ 0
for all k ∈ N. If (J(uk)) is bounded, we have that (uk) is also bounded. Moreover,
if J(uk) → 0, then ||uk|| → 0.
Proof. An immediate consequence of J.

Claim 6.5. ( Proof of (F5)) If (uk) is weakly convergent to u in H 1

Proof. See proof of Claim 4.5.

Φ(uk) ≤ Φ(u).

Claim 6.6. ( Proof of (F6)) Se (uk) is weakly convergent to u in H 1(RN

), then

ψ(u) ≤ lim inf

k→+∞ ψ(uk).

Proof. See proof of Claim 4.6.

Claim 6.7. The functional I3 veriﬁes the equality below

w∈P I3(w) = inf
inf
w∈P +

I3(w).

Proof. See proof of Claim 4.7

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

From the above analysis, we can deduce that the functional I3 veriﬁes the

conditions of Theorem 1.1. From this, there is u0 ∈ H 1(RN ) such that

0 ∈ ∂I3(u0)

and I3(u0) = inf

w∈P I3(w) > 0.

As J is C 1(H 1(RN ), R), we have

J(cid:48)(u0) ∈ ∂Φ(u0).

On the other hand, as

Φ(u) = Φ1(u) + Φ2(u),

∀u ∈ H 1(RN )

(cid:90)

with

it follows that

Φ1(u) =

(cid:90)

F (u) dx and Φ2(u) =

Here, we have used that Φ2 ∈ C 1(H 1(RN ), R).

J(cid:48)(u0) + Φ(cid:48)

2(u0) ∈ ∂Φ1(u0).

By using well known result found in [6], we know that

∂Φ1(u0) ⊂ [f (u0), f (u0)].

This combined with (6.17) guarantee the existence of a mensurable function ρ :
RN → R verifying

(6.18)

ρ(x) ∈ [f (u0(x)), f (u0(x))],

a.e. in RN ,

such that u0 is a weak solution of the problem

By (6.18), ρ ∈ L
