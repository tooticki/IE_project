irreducible representation (π, V ) of G there is an inequality dim V K ≤ N (G, K).

Lemma 3. [Ber, Proposition 2] Let A1 , A2 , ..., Al be a commuting family of matrices in Mn×n (C). Let F be the
algebra of matrices in Mn×n (C) generated by A1 , A2 , ..., Al and the identity. Then

Lemma 4. [Ber, Proposition 1] Let L be an algebra over C, A, Z commutative subalgebras in L, A1 , A2 , ..., Al ∈ A,
X1 , ..., Xp , Y1 , ..., Yq ∈ L. Let us assume that Z lies in the center of the algebra L, Z ⊂ A, A is the commutative
P
algebra generated by A1 , ..., Al and Z, and that any element X ∈ L can be written in the form X =
Xi Pij Yj ,
where Pij ∈ A ,(i = 1, ..., p; j = 1, ..., q). Then any irreducible finite dimensional representation of the algebra L
has dimension at most (pq)(l+1)/2 (l + 1)(l+1)/2 .
