Abstract

In this Note, we show that the notion of a basis of a ﬁnite-dimensional vector
space could be introduced by an argument much weaker than Gauss’ reduction
method. Our aim is to give a short proof of a simply formulated lemma, which in
fact is equivalent to the theorem on frame extension, using only a simple notion of
the kernel of a linear mapping, without any reference to special results, and derive
the notions of basis and dimension in a quite intuitive and logically appropriate
way, as well as obtain their basic properties, including a lucid proof of Steinitz’s
theorem.

1. Introduction

To indroduce the notion of a basis of a ﬁnite dimensional vector space the
following Proposition or its equivalent should be proved:
Given two n−frames (sequence of linearly independent vectors) (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n,(cid:107)fj(cid:107)n in
a vector space, the vector fj contained in the linear span of (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n, fj ∈ [(cid:107)ej(cid:107)n], j =
1, . . . , n, there exists a uniquely deﬁned invertible n×n-matrix of scalars A, satisfying
the equations

(cid:107)fj(cid:107)n = (cid:107)ej(cid:107)nA ⇐⇒ (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n = (cid:107)fj(cid:107)n A−1.

Existence and uniqueness of the matrix A is evident, but proving its invertibility is
always a delicate pedagogical problem for every author of an introductory text on
Linear Algebra, since it should be given right at the beginning of the exposition,
after the vector space axioms are listed.
A standard argument of proving the Proposition is based (explicitly or implicitly)
on Gauss’ reduction process of transforming a square matrix to a triangular form,
often combined with the Steinitz’s theorem on frame extension.
In this Note we suggest, instead of solving the above equations, to solve the system
of inclusions

ei ∈ [(cid:107)fj(cid:107)n], i = 1, . . . , n,

which is equivalent under given conditions to the above equations. The proof
is short and based on an argument much weaker than the reduction process -
additionally to the list of axioms we only need the notion of the kernel of a linear
mapping, without any special constructions performed on the data.

The authors thank Prof. Revaz V. Gamkrelidze for drawing our attention to the
problem and stimulating discussions during the preparation of this manuscript.

2. Preliminary remarks

The logical procedure of introducing a basis of a ﬁnite dimensional vector space is
completely equivalent to that of inverting a nondegenerate square matrix of scalars
and is reduced to proving the following proposition or its equivalent, after which
the path to the notions of a basis and dimension are almost uniquely determined
and short.

Proposition. If two n-frames of a vector space (not necessarily ﬁnite dimensional),
(cid:107)ej(cid:107)n and (cid:107)fj(cid:107)n, are given, where the vectors fj, j = 1, . . . , n, are contained in the
linear span [(cid:107)ej(cid:107)n], then there exists an invertible n × n matrix of scalars A such
that

(cid:107)fj(cid:107)n = (cid:107)ej(cid:107)nA ⇐⇒ (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n = (cid:107)fj(cid:107)nA−1.

(1)
The existence and uniqueness of A are evident since the sequences (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n, (cid:107)fj(cid:107)n are
linearly independent, but proving its invertibility is always a delicate pedagogical
problem for every author of an introductory text on Linear Algebra, since the proof
should be given right at the beginning of the exposition, after the vector space
axioms are listed, very often even before linear mappings are introduced.
A standard way of solving the problem is to apply to A (implicitly or explicitly)
Gauss’ method of reduction of a square matrix to a triangular form, often combined
with Steinitz’s theorem on a frame extension. In this respect, it is instructive to
compare expositions of the corresponding material in four texts [1], [2], [3] and [4],
the last three published after [1] with the time lag of more than 50 years.
In this note, instead of solving equations (1), we prove the system of inclusions

ei ∈ [(cid:107)fj(cid:107)n], i = 1, . . . , n,

(2)
which is equivalent to (1) since (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n,(cid:107)fj(cid:107)n are linearly independent. The proof is
much shorter and based on an argument much weaker than the reduction process.
Additionally to the list of axioms we only need the notion of the kernel of a linear
mapping, without any special constructions performed on the data.

In section 3, inclusions (2) are presented and discussed as a short and simply
formulated Basic Lemma, from which, in sections 4 - 6, the notions of a basis and
dimension of a ﬁnite dimensional vector space along with their basic properties
(including a lucid proof of the frame extension theorem) are derived in a quite
intuitive and logically proper way. Finally, in Section 7, the Basic Lemma is proved.
In the next Section 2 we list several necessary initial notions used in this note.
To conclude the section, we should remark that in most texts on introductory Linear
Algebra, linear mappings are introduced too late, contrary to a well known motto,
according to which “morphisms in a category are at least as useful as the objects
are”. We think that linear mappings and their basic properties should be exposed
in introductory texts right after the vector space axioms are listed and properly
discussed, and consider this Note as a proper example supporting our opinion.

3. A short list of necessary initial notions

Together with the standard general set-theoretic notions related to a mapping

L,

dom L = E, codom L = F, im L = L(E),

ON THE NOTION OF A BASIS OF A FINITE DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACE

it is useful to have at the disposal from the very beginning speciﬁcal linear notions
of a (linear) subspace F ⊂ E and the factor E /F, in particular, the notions of the
kernel ker L and factor E/ker L.
For an adequate deﬁnition of the basis and its appropriate discussion, we should
have a certain freedom in handling ﬁnite sequences of vectors in E. An arbitrary
sequence of length n of vectors in E is presented as an n-row matrix,
||x1, . . . , xn|| = (cid:107)xj(cid:107)n = (cid:107)xj(cid:107), xj ∈ E, j = 1, . . . , n.

Every sequence of vectors could be extended by ascribing to it new vectors from
the space. It is useful to remember that a sequence of length n of vectors in E is
not a subset of E, but rather a function to E on the ordered set of ﬁrst n naturals,
where im(cid:107)xj(cid:107) ⊂ E. If im(cid:107)xj(cid:107) is a subset of a subspace F ⊂ E we say that the
sequence (cid:107)xj(cid:107) belongs to F and write (cid:107)xj(cid:107) ≺ F.

The initial list of basic items should also contain the following notions:

linear
combination of vectors of a sequence, linearly independent and dependent sequences
of vectors of E, n - frames — linearly independent sequences of length n, or rank
n,

(cid:107)ej(cid:107) = (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n, rank (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n = n.

We also need the following notions:
the rank of an arbitrary sequence,
rank (cid:107)xj(cid:107), (cid:107)xj(cid:107) ≺ E, deﬁned as the maximal rank of frames contained (as subse-
quences) in (cid:107)xj(cid:107), the linear span [(cid:107)xj(cid:107)] ⊂ E of an arbitrary sequence of vectors
(cid:107)xj(cid:107) ≺ E, linear span of an arbitrary subset A ⊂ E — minimal subspaces in E (with
respect to the set-theoretic inclusion) containing, respectively, subsets im(cid:107)xj(cid:107) and
A.

4. The basic lemma. Formulation and a preliminary discussion

A frame (cid:107)ej(cid:107) ≺ F ⊂ E is maximal in a subspace F if the rank of an arbitrary
sequence (cid:107)xj(cid:107) ≺ F is bounded by the rank of (cid:107)ej(cid:107),

(cid:107)xj(cid:107) ≺ F =⇒ rank (cid:107)ej(cid:107) ≥ rank (cid:107)xj(cid:107).

A frame (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n ≺ F could be extended (is extendable) in F, if there exists a vector
f ∈ F such that the extended sequence e1, . . . , en, f is again a frame (of rank n + 1).
Intuitively, maximality of a frame could be considered as a “generalized version” of
the “individual property” of a frame to be non-extendable. Every maximal frame
in F is evidently not extendable. The inversion of the assertion is also true —
every non-extendable frame in F is maximal in F (Steinitz’s extension theorem),
but the proof is not trivial and in fact belongs right to the core of the problem
under discussion — of giving proper deﬁnitions of a basis and dimension of a ﬁnite
dimensional vector space.
Now we shall formulate a simple lemma, which easily clears up all interrelations
between the notions of maximality of a frame and its ability “to be extendable”,
and suggests natural intuitive deﬁnitions of a basis and dimension.
The Basic Lemma. Every frame (cid:107)ej(cid:107) ≺ E is maximal in its linear span [(cid:107)ej(cid:107)]
and extendable in every subspace F ⊃ [(cid:107)ej(cid:107)], if the inclusion is strong.
The ability of being “extendable” under the given conditions is evident — it is
achieved by ascribing to (cid:107)ej(cid:107) an arbitrary vector f ∈ F, f /∈ [(cid:107)ej(cid:107)], the maximality
of (cid:107)ej(cid:107) in the linear span [(cid:107)ej(cid:107)] is equivalent to each of the following two assertions.

1. Every frame (cid:107)fj(cid:107)n of rank n in the linear span [(cid:107)ej(cid:107)n] is not extendable there,

or, equivalently, the following system of n inclusions is valid,

(3)

ei ∈ [(cid:107)fj(cid:107)n], i = 1, . . . , n.

2. The rank of an arbitrary sequence in E consisting of linear combinations of a

ﬁxed sequence of n vectors from E does not exceed n.
A simple inductive proof of the system of inclusions (3), based on the notion of the
kernel of a linear mapping, is given (as already stated) in the ﬁnal Section 6. Before,
in next two Sections, we shall derive simple and intuitive deﬁnitions of a basis and
dimension of a ﬁnite dimensional vector space from the formulated lemma, as well
as give a lucid proof of Steinitz’s theorem on the frame extension.

5. Definition of a basis and dimension of a finite dimensional vector

space

A vector space E is ﬁnite dimensional if it contains a ﬁnite set of generators —
a ﬁnite subset G ⊂ E with the linear span coinciding with E. Since G is ﬁnite, it
contains a frame (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n ≺ G (of maximal rank in G), which spans the whole space
E = [(cid:107)ej(cid:107)n], hence, according to the lemma, the frame is maximal in E. Hence
every ﬁnite dimensional vector space contains maximal frames — the bases of the
space. Their common rank n is the dimension of the space, and every vector x ∈ E
is uniquely represented as

n(cid:88)

1

x =

λαeα,

λj ∈ Λ, j = 1, . . . , n.

Thus, every basis of a ﬁnite dimensional vector space is an irreducible system of
generators of the space.
Conversely, if a sequence (cid:107)xj(cid:107)n in a vector space E is given such that every
vector x ∈ E is uniquely represented as

n(cid:88)

x =

λαxα,

λj ∈ Λ,

then, according to the lemma, (cid:107)xj(cid:107)n is a maximal frame of rank n, or a basis in E.

6. The Steinitz’ theorem on the frame extension

In k + l-dimensional vector space Ek+l a basis B = (cid:107)ej(cid:107)k+l and an arbitrary
k-frame (cid:107)fj(cid:107)k are given. From general considerations it easily follows by induction
that B contains a subsequence ei1, . . . , eir of a certain length r ≤ k + l such that
the frame (cid:107)fj(cid:107)k extended by the subsequence is a frame of length k + r,

B(cid:48) = (cid:107)f1, . . . , fk; ei1 , . . . , eir(cid:107) ≺ Ek+l,

containing the linear span of B, which is the whole space Ek+l, hence

[B(cid:48)] = Ek+l.

According to the lemma, the obtained frame B(cid:48) is maximal in Ek+l, i. e. is a basis
of the k + l-dimensional vector space Ek+l, hence r = l, and we have extended the
initial k-frame (cid:107)fj(cid:107)k by a subsequence of length r = l of a preassigned basis B to
a new basis B(cid:48) of the space Ek+l.

7. The basic lemma. Proof

We shall prove the system of inclusions (2) by induction performed on the rank
n of the frame (cid:107)ej(cid:107)n. The assertion is evident for n = 1 since in this case the linear
span coincides with the family of vectors

[(cid:107)ej(cid:107)1] = {λe1| λ ∈ Λ} .

Assuming that the assertion is proved for all natural k ≤ n − 1, consider the case
k = n. Introduce n linear mappings

Li ∈ Hom

[(cid:107)ej(cid:107)n], [(cid:107)f1, . . . , ˆfi, . . . , fn(cid:107)]

,

i = 1, . . . , n,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

by deﬁning Li on vectors e1, . . . , en according to the equations
i, j = 1, . . . , n.

Liej = fj, i (cid:54)= j, Liei = 0,
The kernel of Li coincides with the subspace
kerLi = {λei

(cid:12)(cid:12)λ ∈ Λ},

and the image — with the linear span

im Li = [(cid:107)f1, . . . , ˆfi, . . . fn(cid:107)].

The restriction of Li on the subspace [(cid:107)fj(cid:107)n] ⊂ [(cid:107)ej(cid:107)n] has a nonzero kernel since
otherwise the n-frame (cid:107)Lifj(cid:107), j = 1, . . . , n would be embedded in the linear span of
an (n − 1)-frame (cid:107)f1, . . . , ˆfi, . . . , fn(cid:107), which contradicts the inductive assumption.
Hence,

λei ∈ kerLi

∀λ ∈ Λ, i = 1, . . . , n,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)[(cid:107)fj(cid:107)n]

or

This proves the Lemma.

ei ∈ [(cid:107)fj(cid:107)n] ∀i = 1, . . . , n.
