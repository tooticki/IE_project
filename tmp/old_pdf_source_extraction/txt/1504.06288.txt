Theorem 1.1. In the context above, namely a definable graph (V, W, R) in
a saturated structure MÌ„ , where R(x, y) is stable, and Keisler measures Âµ on
V , Î½ on W , we have the following: Given  > 0, we can partition V into
finitely many definable sets V1 , .., Vm each defined by a âˆ†-formula, and also
partition W into finitely many W1 , .., Wm each defined by a âˆ†âˆ— -formula, such
that for each Vi , Wj exactly one of the following holds:
(i) for all a âˆˆ Vi outside a set of Âµ measure â‰¤ Âµ(Vi ), for all b âˆˆ Wj outside
a set of Î½ measure â‰¤ Î½(Wj ), we have R(a, b), AND DUALLY for all b âˆˆ Wj
outside a set of Î½ measure â‰¤ Î½(Wj ), for all a âˆˆ Vi outside a set of Âµ measure
â‰¤ Âµ(Vi ), we have R(a, b) holds, or
(ii) for all a âˆˆ Vi outside a set of Âµ measure â‰¤ Âµ(Vi ), for all b âˆˆ Wj outside
a subset of Î½ measure â‰¤ Î½(Wj ), we have Â¬R(a, b), AND DUALLY for all
b âˆˆ Wj outside a subset of Î½ measure â‰¤ Î½(Wj ), for all a âˆˆ Vi outside a set
of Âµ measure â‰¤ Âµ(Vi ), Â¬R(a, b).

Remark 1.2. We obtain Î´-regularity for suitable Î´ and in a suitable sense,
of each
âˆš of the (Vi , Wj , R|(Vi Ã—Wj )) (as essentially in Claim 5.17 of [3]): Take
Î´ = 2, and suppose we are in case (i) of the conclusion of the theorem.
Suppose A âŠ† Vi is definable (not necessarily by a âˆ†-formula), and B âŠ† Wj is
definable (not necessarily by a âˆ†âˆ— -formula), with Âµ(A) â‰¥ Î´Âµ(Vi ) and Î½(B) â‰¥
Î´Î½(Wj ). Then for all a âˆˆ A outside a set of Âµ-measure â‰¤ Î´Âµ(A), for all
b âˆˆ B outside a set of Î½-measure â‰¤ Î´Î½(B) we have R(a, b).

Remark 1.3. We also recover the regularity lemma for finite stable graphs in
the sense of [3] by considering the counting measure on pseudofinite graphs.
(But without explicit bounds or equitability of the partition.)

Fact 1.4. Suppose âˆ† is a finite set of stable formulas and Âµx is a global
Keisler measure. Then there is a small model M such that Âµ|âˆ† does not fork
over M in the sense that each âˆ†-formula Ïˆ(x) of positive Âµ-measure does
not fork over M .

***
Fact 1.5. A complete âˆ†-type over a model M has a unique nonforking
extension to a global complete âˆ†-type.

Lemma 2.1. Given  > 0, we can write V as a disjoint union of âˆ†-formulas
(restricted to V ) over M , V = V1 âˆª ... âˆª Vm , such that for each i there is a
complete âˆ†-type pi over M such that Âµ(pi ) > 0, Vi âˆˆ pi (or pi âŠ† Vi ) and
Âµ(Vi \ pi ) â‰¤ Âµ(Vi ).

Lemma 2.2. For each i = 1, .., m and j = 1, .., n, we have (i) or (ii) of
Theorem 1.1
