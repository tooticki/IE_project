Theorem 4. (See Theorem 4.7 and Proposition 4.5 )
Let t = [L, v, ]G be a cuspidal support for G. There exist:

• a 2-cocycle (cid:92)t : Wt/Wt◦ × Wt/Wt◦ → C×,
• a twisted group algebra C[Wt, (cid:92)t],
• a bijection Ψ−1

Moreover the composition of the bijection with Res

qt instead of t. It gives a bijection qΨ−1

Theorem 3.1. (Lusztig)

Deﬁnition 6.1. Let T ⊂ H∨ be a torus such that the projection ZH∨(cid:111)WF (T ) →
WF is surjective. Then we call LL = ZH∨(cid:111)WF (T ) a Levi L-subgroup of LH.

***
Lemma 6.2. Let LL be a Levi L-subgroup of LH. There exists a WF -stable Levi
subgroup L∨ of H∨ such that LL is H∨-conjugate to L∨ (cid:111) WF and L := LL ∩ H∨ is
conjugate to L∨.
Conversely, every H∨-conjugate of L∨ (cid:111) WF is a Levi L-subgroup of LH.

***
Remark 6.3. Most Levi L-subgroups of LH are not quasi-Levi, and conversely. For
example, let U = U(n, E/F ) be a p-adic unitary group (E is a quadratic extension
of F ) and let LU be its dual L-group. The group WF acts on U∨ = GL(n, C) via an
outer automorphism which preserves the diagonal torus T and the standard Borel
subgroup B. Then T (cid:111) WF is a Levi L-subgroup of LU: it is the centralizer of T WF
in LU. However, it is not quasi-Levi. Namely ZLU (T ) = T (cid:111) WE, which is an index
two subgroup of T (cid:111) WF .

***
Deﬁnition 6.4. A L-parameter for LH is a continuous group homomorphism
φ : WF × SL2(C) → LH such that:

• φ(w) ∈ H∨w for all w ∈ WF ;
• φ(w) is semisimple for all w ∈ WF ;
• φ|SL2(C) : SL2(C) → H∨ is a homomorphism of complex algebraic groups.

***
Deﬁnition 6.5. Let φ : WF × SL2(C) → LH be a L-parameter. We say that φ is
bounded if φ(Frob) = (h, Frob) with h in some compact subgroup of H∨.
Suppose that LL is a Levi L-subgroup of LH and that

• LL contains the image of φ;
• there is no smaller Levi L-subgroup of LH with this property.
Then we call φ relevant for H if and only if the conjugacy class of LL is relevant for
H, that is, it corresponds to a conjugacy class of Levi subgroups of H.
In this case we also say that φ is a discrete L-parameter for LL, and for any Levi
subgroup L ⊂ H in the associated class. In particular φ is discrete for H if and only
if there is no proper Levi L-subgroup of LH containing the image of φ.

***
Deﬁnition 6.6. Let (φ, ρ) be an enhanced L-parameter for LH. We say that (φ, ρ)
or ρ is H-relevant if ζρ parametrizes the inner twist H via (??).

IrrC(cid:0)Z(H∨

Proposition 6.7. Let H be an inner twist of a quasi-split group and let ζ ∈
LH. The following are equivalent:

sc)WF(cid:1) be the associated character. Let φ be a Langlands parameter for

(1) φ is relevant for H;
(2) Z(H∨
(3) there exists a ρ ∈ IrrC(Sφ) with ζρ = ζ, that is, such that (φ, ρ) is H-relevant.

sc(φ)◦ ⊂ ker c;

sc)WF ∩ ZH∨

***
Deﬁnition 6.8. An enhanced L-parameter (φ, ρ) for LH is cuspidal if φ is discrete
(φ|WF ). Here ρ is considered as a
and (uφ, ρ) is a cuspidal pair for G = Z1H∨
representation of π0(ZG(uφ)) via (??).
We denote the set of H∨-equivalence classes of H-relevant cuspidal L-parameters by
Φcusp(H). When ζH is as in (??), we put Φcusp,ζH(H) = Φcusp(H) ∩ Φe,ζH.

sc

***

Example 6.9. Let F be a p-adic ﬁeld, D a division algebra over F such that
dimF D = d2 and H = GLm(D). Then H is an inner form of GLn(F ) with n = md.
sc = SLn(C), and Sφ = π0(ZSLn(C)(φ)). Since
Let (φ, ρ) ∈ Φcusp(H). We have H∨
(cid:77)
LH = GLn(C) × WF , we can decompose φ as
G = ZSLn(C)(φ(WF )) (cid:39)(cid:16)(cid:89)

where I is a set of irreducible representations of WF and for all π ∈ I, Sπ is a
representation of SL2(C). Let dπ denote the dimension of Sπ. We will use same
argument as in [Lus2, p. 247]. Then

(cid:17) ∩ SLn(C).

φ =

π (cid:2) Sπ,

π∈I

GLdπ (C)

π∈I

Hence, we can write uφ = (uφ,π)π∈I . Since we assume that φ is cuspidal, this
implies that for all π ∈ I, uφ,π is in the regular unipotent class, corresponding to
the partition dπ and Z(SLdπ (C)) acts on ρ by a character of order dπ. But AG(uφ)
is a cyclic group of order gcd(dπ, π ∈ I). So, since its contains a subgroup of order
dπ and its cardinality is at most dπ, we get that all dπ are equal to some integer d(cid:48)
and Sφ = Z/d(cid:48)Z. Moreover

ZSLn(C)(φ(WF )) (cid:39) (GLd(cid:48)(C))#I ∩ SLn(C).

Because we suppose that φ is discrete, I is a singleton. We obtain that φ = π (cid:2) Sd(cid:48).
In particular, the center of SLn(C) acts on SH∨
sc(φ) by a character of order d, so
that d = d(cid:48). Hence φ = π (cid:2) Sd. We recover the case when D = F and φ = π
is an irreducible representation of WF . An other case is when H = GL1(D) with
d = 2. We obtain that the supercuspidal representations of GL1(D) are of the form
χ (cid:2) S2, with χ a character of WF . (This Langlands parameter is the parameter
of χStGL2(F ) and the two representations are connected by the Jacquet–Langlands
correspondence).

***
Example 6.10. Let F be a p-adic ﬁeld, and let H be a symplectic group Sp2n(F )
or a split special orthogonal group SOm(F ). We have LH = H∨ × WF . Then [Mou,
Proposition 4.14] shows, using results of Arthur and Mœglin, that the supercuspidal
irreducible representations of H correspond, via the local Langlands correspondence,
to cuspidal enhanced L-parameters.

Example 6.11. Let F be a p-adic ﬁeld and E a quadratic extension of F . Let
H = Un(F ) be the quasi-split unitary group deﬁned over F and split over E. We
have LH = GLn(C) (cid:111) Gal(E/F ). Let φ : WF × SL2(C) −→ LH be a discrete
Langlands parameter and ﬁx σ ∈ WF such that WF /WE (cid:39) (cid:104)σ(cid:105). We use the
notions of conjugate-dual, conjugate-orthogonal and conjugate-symplectic deﬁned
in [GGP, §3]. We can decompose the restriction of φ to WE as an n-dimensional
representation:

Every term mππ in (91) can be decomposed as ⊕aπ (cid:2) Sa, where Sa denotes the a-
dimensional irreducible representation of SL2(C). Here a runs through some subset
of N – every a appears at most once because φ is discrete. For every such (π, a) we
choose an element zπ,a ∈ AGLn(C)(φ) which acts as −1 on π (cid:2) Sa and as the identity
on all other factors π(cid:48) (cid:2) Sa(cid:48).
From now on we assume that φ can be enhanced to a cuspidal L-parameter. The
above and the classiﬁcation of cuspidal pairs in [Lus2] show that uφ = (uφ,π) satisﬁes:
a=1(cid:104)zπ,2a−1(cid:105) (cid:39) (Z/2Z)dπ and ε ∈ Irr(AOmπ (C)(uφ,π)) is

for tempered Langlands
parameters (which are Arthur parameters trivial on the second copy of SL2(C)),
the description is given in term of a Jordan block and a character deﬁned by this
Jordan block. Here the Jordan block Jord(φ) of the Langlands parameter φ of a
supercuspidal representation of H is the set of pairs (π, a), where π is an irreducible
representation of WE stable under the action of the composition of inverse-transpose
and σ, and a is an integer such that π (cid:2) Sa is a subrepresentation of φ WE
The condition on the Jordan block says that it has no holes (or is without jumps).
More explicitly, for all a > 2, if (π, a) ∈ Jord(φ) then (π, a−2) ∈ Jord(φ). The shape
of φ is then as (92). Moreover, the alternated characters are exactly the cuspidal
ones. More precisely, [Moe, p.194] gives the deﬁnition zπ,a as our zπ,azπ,a−2 (or zπ,2
in the case of a = 2). But the cuspidal characters are exactly the characters which
are alternated, i.e. such that ε(zπ,azπ,a−2) = −1.

Cφ = π0

Example 6.12. Let φ be a relevant discrete L-parameter which is trivial on the
wild inertia subgroup PF of the inertia group IF , and such that the centralizer of
φ(IF ) in H∨ is a torus. The latter condition forces φ to be trivial on SL2(C). Hence
uφ = 1, and any enhancement of φ gives a cuspidal L-parameter. Let

and let ρ ∈ Irr(Cφ). It is known from [DeRe] that these enhanced L-parameters (φ, ρ)
correspond to the depth-zero generic supercuspidal irreducible representations of H,
in the case where H is a pure inner form of an unramiﬁed reductive p-adic group.
We note that the component group Cφ is a quotient of our Sφ, namely by the kernel
sc → H∨. A priori in these references only a subset of our enhancements of φ
of H∨
is considered. However, it boils down to the same, because the p-adic group H is
chosen such that ρ is relevant for it [DeRe, §2].

Example 6.13. Let (φ, ρ) be a relevant enhanced L-parameter such that φ is
discrete and trivial on P(r+1)
F for some integer r > 0, and
F ) is a maximal torus of H∨. Again any such
such that the centralizer in H∨ of φ(P(r)
(φ, ρ) is cuspidal. The same argument as in Example 6.12 shows that the result
of Reeder in [Ree2, §6] implies that these enhanced L-parameters correspond to the
depth-zero generic supercuspidal irreducible representations of H, when H is a pure
inner form of an unramiﬁed reductive p-adic group.

***

Example 6.14. Let (φ, ρ) be a cuspidal relevant enhanced L-parameter such that
φ is trivial on the inertia group IF . We have G = Z1H∨
(φ(Frob)). Lusztig has
proved in [Lus4] that these enhanced L-parameters correspond to the unipotent
irreducible representations of H in the case when H is simple of adjoint type. Under
these conditions H∨ is simply connected and Sφ coincides with the component group
considered by Lusztig.
Recall that a representation π of H is said to be unipotent (or to have unipotent
reduction) if for some parahoric subgroup P of H, and some unipotent cuspidal
representation σ of the reductive quotient of P, the space HomP(σ, π) is nonzero
(where σ is viewed as a representation of P by inﬂation).
