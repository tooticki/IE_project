Deﬁnition 2.1. A group G is called a Powers group if for any ﬁnite subset F of G \ {e} and
any integer k ≥ 1 there exists a partition G = D t E and elements g1, g2, . . . , gk in G such
that

f D ∩ D = ∅ for all f ∈ F,

giE ∩ gjE = ∅ for all distinct 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k.

Moreover, a group G is called a weak Powers group if it satisﬁes the above deﬁnition for
all ﬁnite sets F that are contained in a nontrivial conjugacy class. Finally, G is called a
weak∗ Powers group if it satisﬁes the above deﬁnition for all nontrivial one-element sets F.

***
Lemma 2.2. Assume that N is a normal subgroup of a group G. If G is a Powers group,
then N is a Powers group. If G is a weak Powers group, then N is a weak Powers group. If
G is a weak∗ Powers group, then N is a weak∗ Powers group.

***
Proposition 3.1. A nondegenerate amalgamated free product G has the unique trace property
if and only if ker G has the unique trace property.

***
Theorem 3.2. Let G = G0 ∗H G1 be a nondegenerate free product with amalgamation, and
let K0, K1 be as deﬁned above. Then the following are equivalent:

(i) K0 = K1 = {e}.
(ii) for every ﬁnite F ⊆ G \ {e}, there exists g ∈ G such that gF g−1 ∩ H = ∅.
(iii) for every ﬁnite F ⊆ H \ {e}, there exists g ∈ G such that gF g−1 ∩ H = ∅.

Moreover, any one of these equivalent conditions implies that G is a Powers group and has
the free semigroup property.

***
Remark 3.3. The above result shows that [20, Theorem 3 (i)] can be slightly improved, as
Lemma 2.2 shows that “strongly Powers” is the same as Powers. In fact, using the comment
following (??), one can replace “Ck = {e} for some k” with any of the equivalent properties of
Theorem 3.2 . Additionally, the countability assumption is no longer needed.
We will come back to the geometric interpretation of K0 and K1 in Section ??. In particular,
Proposition 5.3 below gives more properties equivalent to those in Theorem 3.2 .

***
Remark 3.4. In Section ??, we give an explicit example of a group Γ for which ker Γ = {e},
while K0 and K1 are both nontrivial. We show that the group has the unique trace property, but
is not C∗-simple. This gives a counterexample to the ﬁrst author’s statement [21, Corollary 4.7],
which the second author noticed to be incorrect.

***
Proposition 3.5. If G is countable, H is amenable, and K0 or K1 is nontrivial, then G is
not C∗-simple.

***
Example 3.6. For any triple of groups H, G0, and G1, we have

G = (G0 × H) ∗H (H × G1) ∼= (G0 ∗ G1) × H.

In this case H = ker G = K0 = K1, and G is C∗-simple if and only if H is C∗-simple. In
particular, this means that G can be C∗-simple even if ker G is nontrivial.

***
Theorem 3.7. Let G = G0 ∗H G1 be a nondegenerate free product with amalgamation, and
assume that H is ﬁnite.
Then the following are equivalent:

(i) G is icc
(ii) ker G = {e}
(iii) K0 = K1 = {e}
(iv) G is Powers
(v) G is C∗-simple
(vi) G has the unique trace property
(vii) there exists g ∈ G such that H ∩ gHg−1 = {e}
(viii) G has the free semigroup property

***
Remark 3.8. If G is an amalgam with ﬁnite H satisfying the equivalent conditions of
Theorem 3.7 , then G has stable rank one by [13, Theorem 1.6] (where the argument is based
on [12, Corollary 3.9] for trivial H). However, there also exists amalgams G with ﬁnite H
such that G has stable rank one, but G does not satisfy the conditions of Theorem 3.7 , as
explained in the paragraph following [13, Theorem 1.6].
Moreover, it follows from condition (vii) and [21, Corollary 3.6] that for G = G0 ∗H G1, the
positive cone of the K0-group of C∗

r (G) is not perforated, i.e.,

K0(C∗

r (G))+ = {γ ∈ K0(C∗

r (G)) : K0(τ)(γ) > 0} ∪ {0},

where τ is the canonical tracial state on C∗
easily seen to hold from the fact that for a ﬁnite group H, C∗
algebras and those have trivial K1-groups.

r (G). Indeed, the assumption K1(C∗

r (H)) = 0 is
r (H) is a direct sum of matrix

Lemma 4.1. For every g ∈ G0\H, there exists h ∈ H such that either g = g0h or g = h(1)g0h,
and for every g ∈ G1 \ H, there exists h ∈ H such that either g = g1h or g = h(0)g1h.
Consequently, [G0 : H] = [G1 : H] = 3, and the sets
(7)
provide representatives for the nontrivial left cosets of G0/H and G1/H, respectively.

S0 = {g0, h(1)g0} and S1 = {g1, h(0)g1}.

***
Remark 4.2. Let i, j be two sequences such that h(i) and h(j) commute. For any k, ‘ greater
than the respective lengths of i, j, we have

Let k ≥ 1 and note that g0h(1)g0 /∈ H. By using the deﬁning relations for Γ, we compute

hHk(i) ∪ H‘(j)i = Hk(i)H‘(j) = H‘(j)Hk(i).

g0Hk(0)g0 = Hk+1(1, 0)

h(1)g0Hk(0)g0h(1) = h(1)Hk+1(1, 0)h(1) = Hk+1(1, 1)

H ∩ g0H(1)g0 = H(0)H(1, 1)

H ∩ h(1)g0H(1)g0h(1) = h(1)(H ∩ g0H(1)g0)h(1) = h(1)H(0)H(1, 1)h(1) = H(0)H(1, 0),
and then

H ∩ g0Hg0 = H(0)H2(1)

H ∩ h(1)g0Hg0h(1) = h(1)(H ∩ g0Hg0)h(1) = h(1)H(0)H2(1)h(1) = H(0)H2(1).

Finally,

H ∩ g0Hk(0)H(1)g0 = g0Hk(0)g0

(cid:0)H ∩ g0H(1)g0

(cid:1) = Hk+1(1, 0)H(0)H(1, 1),

where the ﬁrst equality follows from Dedekind’s modular law for groups, and
H ∩ h(1)g0Hk(0)H(1)g0h(1) = h(1)(H ∩ g0Hk(0)H(1)g0)h(1)

= h(1)Hk+1(1, 0)H(0)H(1, 1)h(1) = Hk+1(1, 1)H(0)H(1, 0).

Similarly,

H ∩ g1Hg1 = H ∩ h(0)g1Hg1h(0) = H(1)H2(0)
H ∩ g1H(0)Hk(1)g1 = Hk+1(0, 1)H(1)H(0, 0)

H ∩ h(0)g1H(0)Hk(1)g1h(0) = Hk+1(0, 0)H(1)H(0, 1).

***
Lemma 4.3. We have K0 = H(0), K1 = H(1), and ker Γ = K0 ∩ K1 = H(0) ∩ H(1) = {e}.

***
Theorem 4.4. The group Γ deﬁned above has the unique trace property, but is not C∗-simple.

***
Proposition 4.5. Let

θ: Γ → Z/2Z × Z/2Z

θ(g0) = (1,−1),

θ(g1) = (−1, 1).

be the group homomorphism deﬁned on generators by

θ(h(0)) = (−1, 1),

θ(h(1)) = (1,−1),

Set Γ0 = ker θ. Then Γ0 is simple.

***
Remark 4.6. If G is an exact group with stable rank one and the unique trace property, then
G is C∗-simple by [2, Theorem 2.1]. Let Γ = G0 ∗H G1 be the group deﬁned above. Since H
is amenable and has ﬁnite index in G0 and G1, both these groups are amenable, and therefore
Γ is exact by [11, Corollary 3.3]. Hence, Γ does not have stable rank one by Theorem 4.4 .

***
Remark 4.7. It was pointed out to us by Adrien Le Boudec that the group Γ is isomorphic
to the group G(A3, S3)?, which is one of the examples from [5, Section 5].
Let S3 and A3 denote the symmetric and alternating group, respectively, on a three-element
set. Consider a 3-regular tree T and color the edges {1, 2, 3}, so that neighboring edges have
diﬀerent colors. Let σ(g, v) ∈ S3 be the permutation of the three colors induced in the natural
way by the element g ∈ Aut(T). Then G(A3, S3) < Aut(T) is the group of all automorphisms
g of T such that σ(g, v) ∈ A3 for all but ﬁnitely many vertices v. Then G(A3, S3)? is the
subgroup of G(A3, S3) of index two preserving the natural bipartition of vertices of T.
To see this, remark that by Bass-Serre’s theory (cf. [30, I.4 Theorem 6]) this index two
subgroup is an amalgamated product ¯G0 ∗ ¯H
¯G1, where ¯G0 and ¯G1 are the stabilizers of two
adjacent vertices (we will call them v0 and v1), and ¯H is the stabilizer of the edge between
them (we will call it e). Then, using the notation from [4, Subsection 3.1], we may write ¯Gi
as an increasing union

Kn(vi),

i = 0, 1,

G(S3)vi = [

n≥1

where Kn(vi) is the subgroup of G(A3, S3) that ﬁxes the vertex vi and has σ(g, v) ∈ A3
for all g ∈ Kn(vi) and all v that are at a distance larger than n from vi. With this
notation, the element h(0, i2, . . . , in) acts on T by swapping the two half-trees, emanating
from a vertex (we will call it v(0, i2, . . . , in)) that is at a distance n − 1 from v0 and at a
distance n from v1, and not intersecting the geodesic between v0 and v(0, i2, . . . , in). Clearly,
σ(h(0, i2, . . . , in), v(0, i2, . . . , in)) /∈ A3, because it leaves one edge (therefore one color) ﬁxed.
The matching of the other vertices of the half-trees is deﬁned so the local permutations belong
to A3. This matching is just a matter of orientation of the tree. Adding the element g1 to the
picture, we see that Kn(v0) is isomorphic to the wreath product Z2 o ··· o Z2 o S3 (n − 1 factors
of Z2), where the top elements beneath the S3 factor are h(1), h(0, 0), and h(0, 1). Likewise
Kn(v1) is isomorphic to Z2 o ··· o Z2 o S3 (n − 1 factors of Z2), where the top elements beneath
the S3 factor are h(0), h(1, 0) and h(1, 1). In this way, we see that ¯Gi is isomorphic to Gi,
i = 0, 1, and therefore Γ is isomorphic to G(A3, S3)?.
The simplicity of the group Γ0 is not covered by [4, Corollary 4.20], because A3 is not generated
by its point stabilizers.
We ﬁnally note that G(A3, S3) is isomorphic to Γ (cid:111) Z2, where Z2 acts on Γ by interchanging
the indices 0 and 1 of all generating elements of Γ.

Proposition. [new] The closure ∂T of ∂T in V ∪∂T is (V \F)∪∂T, and is compact, minimal,
and G-invariant. Moreover, ∂T is closed in V ∪ ∂T if and only if F = V , if and only if T is
locally ﬁnite, if and only if H has ﬁnite index in both G0 and G1.

Lemma. [new] Let g, s ∈ G, and suppose that s ﬁxes U(g) pointwise. Then sgH = gH.
Consequently, s ﬁxes every vertex in any ray coming from an inﬁnite word starting with g.

Lemma 5.1. We have that ker G = ker(G (cid:121) T) = ker(G (cid:121) ∂T) = ker(G (cid:121) ∂T), and that
int(G (cid:121) ∂T) equals int(G (cid:121) ∂T) and coincides with the normal closure of K0 ∪ K1.

***
Deﬁnition 5.2. The subgroup int(G (cid:121) ∂T) = h{g ∈ G : (∂T)g has nonempty interior}i of
G, or equivalently, the normal closure of K0 ∪ K1 in G, will be called the interior of G and
denoted int G.

***
Proposition 5.3. The following are equivalent:

(i) int G = {e},
(ii) G (cid:121) T is strongly faithful,
(iii) G (cid:121) ∂T is strongly faithful,
(iv) G (cid:121) ∂T is topologically free, i.e., G (cid:121) T is slender in the sense of [20].

Proposition 5.4. Let G be a nondegenerate free product with amalgamation. Then G is
C∗-simple if and only if int G is C∗-simple.

***
Proposition 5.5. Suppose that ker G is trivial. Then G is a weak∗ Powers group.

***
Example 5.6. The group Γ from Section ?? is a weak∗ Powers group that is not C∗-simple.

Lemma 5.7. Let G be a group, N a normal subgroup of G, and L a normal subgroup of N.
Suppose that g ∈ N is such that (∂F G)g 6= ∅. Then (∂F (N/L))gL 6= ∅.

Lemma 5.8. Suppose that G is a nondegenerate amalgam. Then ∂T is a G-boundary.

***
Theorem 5.9. Suppose that K0 or K1 is amenable. Then G is C∗-simple if and only if both
K0 and K1 are trivial.

***
Remark 5.10. Any amalgamated free product where K0 and K1 are nontrivial, amenable,
and K0∩K1 = {e} is not C∗-simple, but has the unique trace property. As noted in Remark 4.7
, the group Γ of Section ?? is isomorphic to one of Le Boudec’s examples from [5, Section 5].
However, if the groups G0 and G1 are nonisomorphic, then such an amalgamated product will
not be covered by [5, Section 5].

Deﬁnition 6.1. A class of groups X is called a radical class if it is closed under quotients
(i.e., closed under homomorphic images), and if for any group G we have

A class of groups X is called a residual (or coradical or semisimple) class if it is closed under
normal subgroups, and if for any group G we have

(i) ρ(G) ∈ X,
(ii) ρ(G/ρ(G)) = {e}.

(i*) G/ρ∗(G) ∈ X,
(ii*) ρ∗(ρ∗(G)) = ρ∗(G).

***
Proposition 6.2. A class of groups is radical if and only if it is closed under quotients,
extensions, and satisﬁes (i). Moreover, a class of groups is residual if and only if it is closed
under normal subgroups, extensions, and satisﬁes (i*).

***
Proposition 6.3. Let X be a class of groups closed under quotients. Then X is radical if
and only if X = (X∗)∗ if and only if X = Y∗ for some class of groups Y that is closed under
normal subgroups.
Let X be a class of groups closed under normal subgroups. Then X is residual if and only if
X = (X∗)∗ if and only if X = Y ∗ for some class of groups Y that is closed under quotients.

***
Example 6.4. Let X be the class of amenable groups, which is known to be a radical class.
Then [7, Theorem 1.3] shows that the class of groups with the unique trace property coincides
with X∗, and is therefore residual by Proposition 6.3 . Thus, a group is amenable if and only
if it does not have any nontrivial quotient with the unique trace property.

***
Example 6.5. Let X be the class of Powers (resp. weak Powers, weak∗ Powers) groups,
which is not closed under extensions, so it is not a residual class. However, X is closed under
normal subgroups by Lemma 2.2 , meaning that we can deﬁne the class X∗ of groups with no
nontrivial quotient which is a Powers (resp. weak Powers, weak∗ Powers) group. Moreover,
X∗ is a radical class, but ρX∗(G) = {e} does not imply that G ∈ X.
If X is the class of all Powers groups, then P = (X∗)∗ is the residual closure of X, that is, the
smallest residual class containing all Powers groups. In Section ?? we will see that the class of
C∗-simple groups is residual, and hence it contains P (it could possibly coincide with P).

***
Example 6.6. Some radical classes of groups are e.g. locally ﬁnite groups, elementary
amenable groups, amenable groups, and groups that do not contain any nonabelian free
subgroup. We denote the latter class by N F, which gives rise to the residual class AF = (N F)∗,
consisting of all groups for which every nontrivial normal subgroup contains a free nonabelian
subgroup, and G ∈ N F if and only if ρ∗
AF (G) = G. Since every amenable group belongs
to N F, every group in AF has the unique trace property. Moreover, (??) gives that every
amalgamated free product with trivial kernel belongs to AF.

***
Lemma 6.7. Let X be a class of groups satisfying (i). Then X is closed under normal
subgroups if and only if for any group G and normal subgroup N of G we have

ρ(N) = ρ(G) ∩ N.

In particular, this implies that ρ(N) is a normal subgroup of G.

***
Lemma 6.8. Let X be a class of groups that satisﬁes (i) and is closed under normal subgroups.
Assume that G is any group and N is a normal subgroup of G such that ρ(N) = {e}.
Then ρ(G) = ρ(ZG(N)).

***
Lemma 6.9. Let X be a class of groups that satisﬁes (i), is closed under normal subgroups,
and contains all abelian groups. Assume that G is any group and N is a normal subgroup of

***
Lemma 6.10. Let X be a residual class, and suppose that X∗ is closed under normal subgroups
and contains all abelian groups. Let G be any group and N a normal subgroup of G. Then G
belongs to X if and only if both N and ZG(N) belong to X.

Lemma 6.12. Let X be a class of groups that is closed under normal subgroups, extensions,

***
Deﬁnition 7.1. We call a group amenablish if it has no nontrivial C∗-simple quotients. The
class of all amenablish groups is radical, so every group G has a unique maximal normal
amenablish subgroup, which will be called the amenablish radical of G.

***
Proposition 7.2. Suppose that G is a group and {Nα}α∈Λ is a family of normal subgroups
of G such that G/Nα is C∗-simple for all α.

Then G/T

α∈Λ Nα is C∗-simple.

***
Corollary 7.3. The class of C∗-simple groups is a residual class.
Hence, a group G is C∗-simple if and only if its amenablish radical N is trivial, and N is the
smallest normal subgroup of G that produces a C∗-simple quotient.

***
Deﬁnition 7.4. Let G be any group. Set N0 = {e} and N1 = int(G (cid:121) ∂F G), recall (??),

Nα+1/Nα = int(G/Nα (cid:121) ∂F (G/Nα)),

and for every limit ordinal β, set Nβ =S

Lemma 7.6. Suppose that N is a normal subgroup of a group G such that G/N is C∗-simple.

Lemma 7.7. Let N be a normal subgroup of G. Then AH(N) = AH(G) ∩ N.

***
Proposition 7.8. For any group G, the amenablish radical of G coincides with AH(G).

Lemma 7.9. The class of amenablish groups is closed under normal subgroups.

***
Lemma 7.10. Let G be any group and H a subgroup of ﬁnite index. Then G is amenablish
if and only if H is amenablish.

***
Corollary 7.11. The group Γ of Section ?? is amenablish, but not amenable (and has trivial
amenable radical).

***
Remark 7.12. The class of amenablish groups is not closed under subgroups. Indeed, by
Corollary 7.11 the group Γ is amenablish, but it contains as subgroup a nonabelian free group,
which is C∗-simple, and thus not amenablish.
Moreover, AH(Γ) = Γ and N F(Γ) = {e}, while recent work by Olshanskii and Osin [26]
presents a group G with the property AH(G) = {e} and N F(G) = G. Hence, it seems to be
no relation between the class of amenablish groups and N F (except that both contain all
amenable groups).

***
Remark 7.13. Let G be a countable group, and let N be the subgroup of G generated by all
recurrent amenable subgroups in G (see [23, Deﬁnition 5.1]). Does N coincide with AH(G)?
It is mentioned in [23, Remark 5.4] that for every x ∈ ∂F G the subgroup Gx is recurrent
amenable in G, so int(G (cid:121) ∂F G) = hGx : x ∈ ∂F Gi ⊆ N. Moreover, [23, Theorem 1.1] says
that N is trivial if and only if G is C∗-simple, that is, if and only if int(G (cid:121) ∂F G) is trivial.
Note also that a recent paper [6, Section 4] introduces a unique maximal amenable uniformly
recurrent subgroup AG of G, and [6, Proposition 2.21 (ii)] states that hH : H ∈ AGi =
int(G (cid:121) ∂F G), which in general is smaller than AH(G), cf. comment after Lemma 7.5 .

***
Example 7.14. If G is a simple group, then G is either C∗-simple or amenablish. E.g.
Thompson’s group T is known to be simple, so it follows directly from [6, 16] that T is
amenablish if and only if Thompson’s group F is amenable.
