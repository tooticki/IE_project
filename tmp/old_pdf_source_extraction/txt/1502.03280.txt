 This gauge equivalence first appeared in the paper [Kad88] of T. Kadeshvili for the Koszul operad
encoding associative algebras.
 The results of Theorem 3 give a conceptual framework to state in full generality the theory of
Koszul hierarchy developed by M. Markl in [Mar15, Mar14] for the operads As and Lie. Let P
be a Koszul operad, let µ : P ! → EndA be an algebra structure over the Koszul dual operad, and
let ∆ be an degree 1 square-zero operator on A. We work here with the cohomological degree
convention and s denotes an element of degree 1. Any basis of the Koszul dual operad P ! gives
rise to a gauge group element defined by the composite
∗
µ⊗id
Φ : P¡ ∼
= P ! ⊗ EndKs → P ! ⊗ EndKs −−−→ EndA ⊗ EndKs ∼
= EndsA .

Therefore, the gauge action of Φ on the trivial P∞ -algebra structure αtr = (sA, ∆) produces a
P∞ -algebra structure (Φ−1 ? αtr ) } Φ on the suspended chain complex sA. This construction
answers the question raised in Section 2.6 of [Mar15]. For the operad P = Lie of Lie algebras,
its Koszul dual is the operad P ! = Com of commutative algebras. Using the canonical basis
of this one-dimensional S-module in any arity, one recovers the Koszul hierarchy [Kos85] of a
commutative algebra, which forms an L∞ -algebra, cf. [Mar15, Example 2.8]. In the same way,
the nonsymmetric operad As of associative algebras is Koszul auto-dual As! = As and onedimensional in each arity. Using its canonical basis, one recovers the Börjeson hierarchy [Bö13]
of an associative algebra, which forms an A∞ -algebra, cf. [Mar15, Example 2.4]. Our results also
explain why these new structures are homotopy trivial, that is they produce trivial structures on the
cohomology level H • (sA, ∆), see Theorem 4 .

Corollary 2. The Deligne groupoid is isomorphic to the groupoid

R EMARKS .
 In [DR12], V. Dolgushev and C. Rogers almost proved this result: they consider a path object type
construction of dg operads but without proving the model category property. Then, they prove that
the associated “homotopy equivalence” is equivalent to the gauge equivalence (Theorem 5.6).
 Using other methods (coming from derived algebraic geometry), S. Yalin recently and
independently proved a higher (simplicial) version of this result in [Yal14].
