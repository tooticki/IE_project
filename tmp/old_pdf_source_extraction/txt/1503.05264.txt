Theorem 1.1. [see Theorem 2.6 , Corollary 3.6 and Theorem 4.5 ] Let M be a torus
manifold. Then any irreducible subsystem of R(M ) is of type A, B or D and only type
A appears if H ∗ (M ) is generated by H 2 (M ) as a ring. Moreover, if G is a compact Lie
subgroup of Diff(M ) containing the torus acting on M , then the root system of G is a
subsystem of R(M ).

***
Theorem 1.2. [see Theorem 5.3 and Corollary 5.5 ] Let M be a torus manifold with an
invariant stable complex structure J. Then any irreducible subsystem of R(M, J) is of type
A and if G is a compact Lie subgroup of Diff(M, J) containing the torus acting on M , then
the root system of G is a subsystem of R(M, J).

Definition 2.1. Let V = {vi }m
i=1 be a finite subset of N which generates a subgroup of
full rank. We define R(V ) to be the subset of N ∗ := Hom(N, Z) consisting of all elements
α of the following either type 1 or type 2:
type 1: |hα, vi i| = 1 for some i and hα, vk i = 0 for k 6= i,
type 2: |hα, vi i| = |hα, vj i| = 1 for some i, j and hα, vk i = 0 for k 6= i, j,
where h , i denotes the natural pairing between N ∗ and N .

***
Example 2.2. Take N = Zn and let {ei }ni=1 be the standard basis of Zn and {e∗i }ni=1 be
its dual basis. If V = {ei }ni=1 , then
R(V ) = {±e∗i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ±e∗i ± e∗j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}.
∗
∗
∗
This is a root system
Pn of type Bn and ±ei are of type 1 while ±ei ± ej are of type 2. If
V = {e1 , . . . , en , − i=1 ei }, then

R(V ) = {±e∗i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ±(e∗i − e∗j ) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}.
This is a root system of type An and any element in R(V ) is of type 2.

***
Example 2.3. Let N be a free abelian group of rank 2 and V = {vi }m
i=1 (m ≥ 2) be
a subset of N . Suppose that vi and vi+1 form a basis of N for i = 1, 2, . . . , m, where
vm+1 = v1 . Then R(V ) is empty if m ≥ 5. Moreover, one can check that R(V ) is of type
B2 if m = 2, of type A2 if m = 3 (see Example 2.2 ) and of type A1 or A1 × A1 if m = 4.

***
Definition 2.4. We say that type 2 elements in R(V ) are conjugate if they are of the form
±e∗i ± e∗j for some common i 6= j and linearly independent. For instance, e∗i + e∗j and e∗i − e∗j
are conjugate.

***
Lemma 2.5. Let Φ be an irreducible subsystem of R(V ).
(1) Let α, β, γ, δ be simple roots in Φ and of type 2. If aβ,α = aγ,α = aδ,α = −1, then
there exists a conjugate pair in {β, γ, δ}.
(2) Let β and γ be conjugate simple roots of type 2 in Φ and λ be another type 2 simple
root in Φ. If aβ,λ = −1, then aγ,λ = −1.

***
Theorem 2.6. Let Φ be an irreducible subsystem of R(V ) of rank ≥ 2. Then Φ is of type
A, B or D. More precisely, we have
(1) Φ is of type B ⇐⇒ Φ contains a simple root of type 1,
(2) Φ is of type D ⇐⇒ any simple root in Φ is of type 2 and Φ contains conjugate
simple roots,
(3) Φ is of type A ⇐⇒ any simple root in Φ is of type 2 and Φ does not contain
conjugate simple roots,
where rank Φ ≥ 4 when we say Φ is of type D in (2) above.

***
Corollary 2.7. Any irreducible factor of R(V ) is of type A or B. If there is no element of
type 1 in R(V ), then any irreducible factor of R(V ) is of type A.

***
Lemma 3.1. [Lemma 1.5 in [15]] To each i ∈ [m], there is a unique element vi ∈ H2 (BT )
such that
m
X
∗
(3.1)
π (u) =
hu, vi iτi in ĤT2 (M ) for any u ∈ H 2 (BT )
i=1

where h , i denotes the natural pairing between cohomology and homology.

***
Lemma 3.2. [Lemma 1.7 in [15]] Let p be a T -fixed point of a torus manifold M and let
I(p) be the subset of [m] consisting of the subscripts of the n characteristic submanifolds
meeting at p. Then {vi }i∈I(p) is a basis of H2 (BT ). In particular, each vi is primitive and
{vi }m
i=1 spans H2 (BT ).

***
Definition 3.3. Let M be a torus manifold with an omniorientation and let vi (i =
1, . . . , m) be the elements of H2 (BT ) defined above. Then the root system R(M )(⊂
H 2 (BT )) of M is defined to be R({vi }m
i=1 ). Note that R(M ) is independent of the choice
of the omniorientation on M because so is ±vi .

***
Example 3.4. (1) Take M = S 2n (regarded as the unit sphere of Cn ⊕ R) with the T action given by (z1 , . . . , zn , y) → (g1 z1 , . . . , gn zn , y) where (g1 , . . . , gn ) ∈ (S 1 )n = T . The
characteristic submanifolds are Mi = {zi = 0} for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and the circle subgroup which
fixes Mi pointwise is {(1, . . . , 1, gi , 1 . . . , 1) ∈ T | gi ∈ S 1 } for each i, so that we may think
of {vi }ni=1 as {ei }ni=1 of Zn through an identification of H2 (BT ) = Hom(S 1 , T ) with Zn .
Hence
R(S 2n ) = {±e∗i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ±e∗i ± e∗j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}
where ±e∗i are of type 1 while ±e∗i ± e∗j are of type 2 as remarked in Example 2.2 .
(2) Take M = CP n with the T -action given by [z1 , . . . , zn , zn+1 ] → [g1 z1 , . . . , gn zn , zn+1 ].
The characteristic submanifolds are Mi = {zi = 0} for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1 and the circle
subgroup which fixes Mi pointwise is {(1, . . . , 1, gi , 1 . . . , 1) ∈ T | gi ∈ S 1 } for 1 ≤ i ≤ n
and the diagonal subgroup
T for i = n + 1, so that we may think of {vi }n+1
i=1 as vi = ei
Pof
n
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and vn+1 = i=1 ei through an identification of H2 (BT ) = Hom(S 1 , T ) with
Zn . Hence
R(CP n ) = {±e∗i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ±(e∗i − e∗j ) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}
where any element in R(CP n ) is of type 2 as remarked in Example 2.2 .

***
Lemma 3.5. Let α be an element of R(M ). If α ∈ R(M ) is of type 1, then MiT = M T
for some i, and if α ∈ R(M ) is of type 2, then MiT ∪ MjT = M T for some distinct i and j,
where X T denotes the T -fixed point set in X.

***
Corollary 3.6. If H ∗ (M ) is generated by H 2 (M ) as a ring, then any irreducible subsystem
of R(M ) is of type A.

***
Example 3.7. Suppose that a torus manifold M is 4-dimensional. Since a characteristic
submanifold is of codimension two, orientable and is assumed to have a T -fixed point,
every characteristic submanifold of our M must be a 2-sphere and have two T -fixed points.
Therefore, Lemma 3.5 tells us that R(M ) has no element of type 1 (resp. type 2) unless
|M T | is 2 (resp. 2, 3, 4), and R(M ) is empty if |M T | ≥ 5, where |M T | denotes the cardinality
of M T .

***
Remark 3.8. For some class of manifolds with nice torus actions such as flag manifolds
and toric hyperKähler manifolds (also manifolds treated in [11], [13]), one could define root
systems similarly to Definition 3.3 .

***
Lemma 3.9. If g ∈ Diff(M ) is ρ-equivariant, then g permutes the characteristic
submanifolds Mi ’s, i.e., there is a permutation σ on [m] such that g(Mi ) = Mσ(i) for
any i ∈ [m]. Moreover, ρ∗ (vi ) = i vσ(i) with some i ∈ {±1} for any i ∈ [m], where ρ∗ is
an automorphism of H2 (BT ) induced from ρ.

***
Lemma 3.10. [Lemma 2.1 in [21]] If the ρ-equivariant diffeomorphism g of a torus
manifold M is in the identity component of Diff(M ) and ρ∗ is a reflection on H 2 (BT ),
then the permutation σ in Lemma 3.9 satisfies either of the following:
(1) σ is the identity, i = −1 for some i and j = 1 for j 6= i,
(2) σ permutes two elements, say i and j, fixes the others, i = j and k = 1 for
k 6= i, j.
Moreover, if g preserves the omniorientation on M (this is the case when G preserves a
stable complex structure on M discussed in Section ??), then (1) above does not occur by
the remark after (??).

***
Definition 4.1. A root of G is a non-zero weight of the adjoint representation of T on
g ⊗ C, where g denotes the Lie algebra of G. We think of a root of G as an element of
H 2 (BT ) (through the above canonical isomorphism) and denote the set of roots of G by
∆(G).

***
Lemma 4.2. Either of the following holds for α ∈ ∆(G):
(1) There is i ∈ [m] such that α takes a non-zero value on vi and zero on the others.
(2) There are i, j ∈ [m] such that
(4.2)

hα, vi i = −α hα, vj i =
6 0 and hα, vk i = 0 for any k 6= i, j

where α = ±1.
If an element of NGα (T )\T preserves the omniorientation on M (this is the case when G
preserves a stable complex structure on M discussed in Section ??), then (1) above does
not occur and α = 1.

***
Lemma 4.3. Let α, β ∈ ∆(G). Then
(4.6)

ρ∗α (β) = β −

2(β, α)
α.
(α, α)

***
Lemma 4.4. Let α and β be roots in an irreducible factor Φ of ∆(G) and assume α 6= ±β.
Then the following holds.
(1) If both α and β are of type 1, then (α, β) = 0.
(2) If both α and β are of type 2 and (α, β) 6= 0, then Nα = Nβ and kαk = kβk.
(3) Suppose that rank
√ Φ ≥ 3. If α is of type 1 and β is of type 2 and (α, β) 6= 0, then
Nα = Nβ and 2kαk = kβk.

***
Theorem 4.5. If a connected compact Lie group G acts effectively on a torus manifold M
extending the T -action, then the root system ∆(G) of G is a subsystem of the root system
R(M ) of M .

***
Corollary 4.6. Let M be a torus manifold and let G be a compact connected Lie subgroup
of Diff(M ) containing the torus T . If ∆(G) = R(M ), then G is maximal among connected
compact Lie subgroups of Diff(M ) containing T .

***
Remark 4.7. As pointed out by Wiemeler, the equality in Corollary 4.6 cannot be
attained in general. For example, take an n-dimensional homology sphere Σ with nontrivial fundamental group and consider Σ × T , where the T -action on Σ is trivial while that
on the second factor T is the group multiplication. Take also the standard sphere S 2n with
the standard T -action. We choose a free T -orbit from Σ × T and S 2n respectively, remove
their T -invariant open tubular neighborhoods and glue them along their boundaries. The
resulting manifold M is a homology sphere and a torus manifold. The vi ’s for M are the
same as those for S 2n because vi ’s are defined as parametrization of circle subgroups which
fix the characteristic submanifolds and the characteristic submanifolds of M and S 2n are
same. Therefore R(M ) = R(S 2n ) and if there is a connected compact Lie subgroup G of
Diff(M ) with ∆(G) = R(M )(= R(S 2n )), then G is a simple Lie group of type A and the
G-action on M must be transitive. Therefore, M must be diffeomorphic to S 2n which is
a contradiction because M is non-simply connected. Therefore, there is no compact Lie
subgroup G of Diff(M ) with ∆(G) = R(M ).

***
Example 4.8. (1) Take S 2n with the T -action defined in Example 3.4 . The linear action of
SO(2n+1) on S 2n is effective, SO(2n+1) contains the torus T and ∆(SO(2n+1)) = R(S 2n ).
Therefore, SO(2n+1) is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(S 2n ) containing
T by Corollary 4.6 .
(2) Take CP n with the T -action defined in Example 3.4 . The linear action of U(n + 1) on
Cn+1 induces an effective action of PU(n + 1) containing the torus T and ∆(PU(2n + 1)) =
R(CP n ). Therefore, PU(n+1) is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(CP n )
containing T by Corollary 4.6 .

***
Proposition 5.1. Diff(M, J) is a Lie group.

***
Definition 5.2. For (M, J), we define
R(M, J) := {α ∈ H 2 (BT ) | hα, vi i = 1, hα, vj i = −1 for some i 6= j
and hα, vk i = 0 for any k 6= i, j}.

***
Theorem 5.3. Let M be a torus manifold with a T -invariant stable complex structure
J. If a connected compact Lie group G acts effectively on M extending the T -action and
preserving the stable complex structure J, then the root system ∆(G) of G is a subsystem
of R(M, J) and every irreducible factor of ∆(G) is of type A.

***
Remark 5.4. It is shown in [20, Lemma 5.8] that any irreducible factor of the G in
Theorem 5.3 is of type A.

***
Corollary 5.5. Let M be a torus manifold with a stable complex structure J and let G be a
connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(M, J) containing the torus T . If ∆(G) = R(M, J),
then G is maximal among connected compact Lie subgroups of Diff(M, J) containing T .

***
Example 5.6. (1) Take M = S 2n (⊂ Cn ⊕ R) with the standard T -action defined in
Example 3.4 . Since τ S 2n ⊕ R ∼
= Cn ⊕ R, we have
τ S 2n ⊕ R ⊕ R ∼
= Cn ⊕ R ⊕ R ∼
= Cn+1 .
Let J be a stable complex structure defined from this identification. Then one see that
{vi }ni=1 is the standard basis {ei }ni=1 through an identification of H2 (BT ) = Hom(S 1 , T )
with Zn , so that
R(S 2n , J) = {±(e∗i − e∗j ) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}.
This is a root system of type An−1 . Note that R(S 2n , J) is a proper subsystem of R(S 2n ).
The linear action of U(n) on Cn induces an action on S 2n preserving the J and U(n)
contains the torus T and ∆(U(n)) = R(S 2n , J). Therefore, U(n) is a maximal connected
compact Lie subgroup of Diff(S 2n , J) containing T by Corollary 5.5 .
(2) Take M = CP n with the T -action defined in Example 3.4 and with the standard
n+1
complex
i ≤ n and vn+1 =
Pn structure Jst . Then one sees that {vi }i=1 as vi1 = ei for 1 ≤
n
− i=1 ei through an identification of H2 (BT ) = Hom(S , T ) with Z . Hence
R(CP n , Jst ) = R(CP n ) = {±e∗i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ±(e∗i − e∗j ) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}.
Since the action of PU(n + 1) mentioned in Example 4.8 preserves Jst , PU(n + 1) is also
a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(CP n , Jst ).

***
Lemma 6.1. The action of GLα on Cm leaves Z invariant.

***
Proposition 6.2. Let (X(∆), Jst ) be a toric manifold with the standard complex structure.
Then, the G above is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(X(∆), Jst )
containing T .

***
Remark 6.3. Demazure defines roots associated to the fan ∆ in [4] (also see [18]) and
intoduces a root system which describes the reductive part of Aut(X(∆)). Proposition 6.2
follows from his result.

***
Proposition 6.4. Let (X(∆), J) be a toric manifold with the stable complex structure
J. Then, the GJ above is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(X(∆), J)
containing T .

***
Example 6.5. We take X(∆) = CP 1 . In this case, m = 2 and take q = 1. Then
G(∆)J = (GL(1, C) × GL(1, C))/ GL(1, C) is isomorphic to GL(1, C). Note that our stable
complex structure J on CP 1 is isomorphic to that in Example 5.6 (1) for S 2 . Therefore,
Diff(S 2 , J) is non-compact.
