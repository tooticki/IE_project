Theorem 1.1. [[BEM]] Suppose that (M, ϕ) is a closed oriented (2q+1)-dimensional almost
contact manifold. Then there is a contact structure on M homotopic to the given almost
(cid:3)
contact structure.

***
Theorem 1.2. For a ﬁxed dimension 2q+1 ≥ 5 there is an almost contact (2q+1)-manifold
(Mmax, ϕmax) such that for any almost contact (2q+1)-manifold (M, ϕ) we have

(M, ϕ) ≺ (Mmax, ϕmax).

***

Theorem 1.3. Suppose that a contact manifold (M, ξ) admits a weak symplectic ﬁlling
(W, ω). Then the product M × S2 admits a weakly ﬁllable contact structure.

***

Remark 1.4. Note that while all our other statements are concerned with almost contact
structures on manifolds, Theorem 1.3 is about genuine contact structures.

***
Theorem 1.5. Let M = ST ∗S2k+1 be the unit cotangent bundle of the (2k+1)-sphere. For
every odd k ≥ 5, M admits an almost contact structure ϕ such that (M, ϕ)#(−M,−ϕ)
admits a Stein ﬁllable contact structure. However, for every almost contact homotopy

(4k+1)-sphere (Σ, ϕΣ), neither (M #Σ, ϕ#ϕΣ) nor(cid:0)−(M #Σ),−(ϕ#ϕΣ)(cid:1) is Stein ﬁllable.

***

Theorem 1.6. Let (M, ϕ) = (M0#M1, ϕ0#ϕ1) be a Stein ﬁllable almost contact 5-manifold.
Assume that either c1(ϕ) = 0 or that

c1(ϕ)(π2(M0)) = c1(ϕ)(π2(M1)) = Z = π2(BU ).

Then both (M0, ϕ0) and (M1, ϕ1) are Stein ﬁllable.

***
Theorem 1.7. The exotic stable almost contact structure ζex on S8k−1 cannot be represented
by a Stein ﬁllable contact structure once k ≥ 2.

***
Theorem 1.8. A smooth closed oriented (4k−1)-connected 8k-manifold Y admits a stable
almost complex structure if and only if

(1) k ≥ 3 is odd, or
(2) k = 1 and the signature σY of Y is even, or
(3) k is even and Im(τY ∗) ⊆ F∗(π4k(BU )).

***
Corollary 1.9. Let M be a (4k−2)-connected (8k−1)-manifold and k ≥ 2. Suppose that
M admits an almost contact structure. Then M admits an almost contact structure which
cannot be represented by any Stein ﬁllable contact structure.

***

Deﬁnition 2.1. A contact manifold (M, ξ) is weakly symplectically ﬁllable if it is the
oriented boundary of a compact symplectic manifold (W, ω) and there is an almost complex
structure J that is tamed by ω so that J(T M ) ∩ T M = ξ and for a contact form λ deﬁning
ξ we have dλ(v, Jv) > 0 (for all 0 (cid:54)= v ∈ ξ).

***

Deﬁnition 2.2. A contact manifold (M, ξ) is called strongly symplectically ﬁllable if
it bounds a compact symplectic manifold (W, ω) and there is an outward pointing vector ﬁeld
V near ∂W such that the Lie derivative satisﬁes LV ω = ω and λ = ιV ω is a deﬁning 1-form
for ξ. If the symplectic form ω is also exact then we say that (M, ξ) is exactly ﬁllable.

***

Deﬁnition 2.3. A contact manifold (M, ξ) is Stein ﬁllable if it bounds a Stein domain
(W, J) such that ξ = J(T M ) ∩ T M .

***

Theorem 2.4. [Eliashberg’s h-principle, [CE, E2]] Let (W, J) be a compact (2q+2)-dimen-
sional almost complex manifold admitting a handle decomposition with handles of index q+1

or less, and suppose that q ≥ 2. Then J is homotopic to a complex structure (cid:101)J so that (W,(cid:101)J)

is a Stein ﬁlling of a contact structure ξ on M = ∂W .

***

Deﬁnition 2.5. A smooth cobordism W between contact manifolds (M0, ξ0) and (M1, ξ1) is
a Stein cobordism if

and M1 := f−1(1) are regular level sets;

• ∂W = −M0 (cid:116) M1;
• W admits a complex structure J and a map f : W → [0, 1] such that M0 := f−1(0)
• ω = −dd
C
• ξi = J(T Mi)∩ T Mi, i.e. the complex structure J induces the contact structures ξi on
the ends of the cobordism. The contact manifold (M0, ξ0) is usually called the concave
end and (M1, ξ1) the convex end of the Stein cobordism (W, J).

f is a symplectic form;

***
Theorem 2.6. Let (M 2q+1, ξ) be a contact manifold of dimension 2q+1 ≥ 5. Suppose that
k ≤ q+1 and that M(cid:48) is obtained from M via an almost complex handle attachment of index
k with trace (M × I)∪ hk. Then the almost complex structure J on the trace is homotopic to
(cid:3)
(with some contact structure ξ(cid:48) on M(cid:48)).

a complex structure (cid:101)J so that ((M × I) ∪ hk,(cid:101)J) is a Stein cobordism from (M, ξ) to (M(cid:48), ξ(cid:48))

***
Remark 2.7. By equipping the product M0 × I with the symplectic structure given by the
symplectization ωsp(ξ0) of the contact structure ξ0 and isotoping the attaching sphere of the
handle hk to an isotropic sphere, the symplectic form ωsp(ξ0) was extended by Weinstein [We]
to the trace (M0 × I)∪ hk. The existence of a Stein structure on the trace (in particular, the
construction of the appropriate function f of the deﬁnition) is due to Eliashberg [CE, E2].
When the symplectic or Stein structures are implicitly assumed in our later arguments, we
will refer to such handles and handle attachments as Stein/Weinstein handles resp. handle
attachments.

***

Deﬁnition 2.8. A stably almost contact (2q+1)-manifold (M0, ζ0) is topologically Stein
cobordant to (M1, ζ1) if there is a stably complex cobordism (W, ζ) such that

∂(W, ζ) = −(M0, ζ0) (cid:116) (M1, ζ1)

as stably complex manifolds and W is built from M0 × [0, 1] by attaching handles of index
≤ q+1. In this case we write

(M0, ζ0) ≺ (M1, ζ1),

and call (W, ζ) a topological Stein cobordism.

***

Lemma 2.9. Let (W, ω) be a weak ﬁlling of a contact manifold (M, ξ0) and suppose
that (W1, J) is a Stein cobordism from (M, ξ0) to (M1, ξ1) consisting of a single k-handle
attachment so that ω vanishes on the homology class of the attaching sphere if k = 3. Then
W (cid:48) = W ∪ W1 (equipped with a suitable symplectic structure ω(cid:48), based on ω and the Stein
structure on W1) provides a weak ﬁlling of (M1, ξ1).
Furthermore, if the attaching sphere of a 2-handle bounds a surface Σ in M then we can
assume that the ω(cid:48)([Σ ∪ D2]) = 0, where D2 denotes the core of the 2-handle.

***

Proposition 2.10. Let (M, ξ) be a contact manifold of dimension 2q+1 that admits a weak
symplectic ﬁlling (W, ω). Then M × S2 admits a weakly ﬁllable contact structure.

***

Example 2.11. [cf. [BCS2, Example 2.5]] We take the stable complex bundle (Bk
ζ ) =
(BU(cid:104)k+1(cid:105), πk+1) where the map πk+1 : BU(cid:104)k+1(cid:105) → BU is the k-fold connective covering of
BU . Recall that BU(cid:104)k+1(cid:105) is the space whose homotopy groups are trivial in degree i ≤ k−1
and such that πk+1 induces a surjection on the k-th homotopy group and isomorphisms for
all higher homotopy groups. We denote the bordism groups Ω∗(BU(cid:104)k+1(cid:105); πk+1) by ΩU(cid:104)k(cid:105)
.
When k = 3, we have that Ω∗(BU(cid:104)4(cid:105); π4) = ΩSU∗
is just special unitary bordism as consider
in [St, Chapter X].

Remark 2.13. The applicability of the obstruction class described above hinges on
computations of the bordism group Ω2q+1(Bq−1

in general. For simply connected 7-manifolds with torsion free second homotopy group
[BCS2, Theorem 1.3] shows that Ω7(B2
ζ ) = 0; implying that all such almost contact 7-
manifolds are Stein ﬁllable. For (q−1)-connected (2q+1)-manifolds further calculations of
these bordism groups will be presented in [BCS3].

Remark 2.15. Notice that [BCS2, Theorem 3.8] is a direct consequence of the above result
(by taking α = id). While [BCS2, Theorem 3.8] is symmetric for (M0, ζ0) and (M1, ζ1), in
Theorem 2.14 the direction of the map α breaks this symmetry. The above extension of our
earlier result was suggested by a question from Andy Wand in Nantes in September 2013.

***
Proposition 3.1. In every dimension 2q+1 ≥ 5 there exists an almost contact manifold
(Mmax, ϕmax) so that for any almost contact manifold (M, ϕ) we have

(M, ϕ) ≺ (Mmax, ϕmax).

Moreover, in dimensions 5 and 7 we can take certain almost contact structures on the non-
trivial sphere bundles over S2 as ﬁnal elements:

(Mmax, ϕmax) = (S5 ˜×S2, ϕmax),
where ϕmax is any almost contact structure whose ﬁrst Chern class is primitive.

(Mmax, ϕmax) = (S3 ˜×S2, ϕmax),

***

Remark 3.2. The almost contact manifold (Mmax, ϕmax) is far from being unique. Indeed,
if (Mmax, ϕmax) ≺ (M(cid:48), ϕ(cid:48)) then (M(cid:48), ϕ(cid:48)) is also maximal
for the topological Stein
cobordism relation. For example, for any Stein ﬁllable almost contact manifold (M0, ϕ0),
(Mmax#M0, ϕmax#ϕ0) is also maximal. Note also that (Mmax, ϕmax) is necessarily Stein
ﬁllable (that is, contains a Stein ﬁllable contact structure), shown by the Stein cobordism
from, say, the standard contact sphere to (Mmax, ϕmax).

***

Remark 3.3. At the level of contact structures, it seems very unlikely that the analogue of
Proposition 3.1 holds. Speciﬁcally, it seems unlikely that there is a single contact (2n+1)-
manifold (Mmax, ξmax) such that for every contact (2n+1)-manifold (M, ξ) the manifold
(Mmax, ξmax) is the out-going end of some Stein cobordism starting from (M, ξ). However by
Theorem 2.6 we have the following: For any maximal almost contact manifold (Mmax, ϕmax)
of dimension (2q+1) ≥ 5, and for any contact (2q+1)-manifold (M, ξ), (Mmax, ϕmax) admits
a contact structure ξ(M,ξ) and a Stein cobordism from (M, ξ) to (Mmax, ξ(M,ξ)).

***

Proposition 3.4. Let n = 5 or 7 and let (M, ϕ) be an almost contact n-manifold such that
c1(ϕ) = 0. Then

(M, ϕ) ≺ (Sn, ϕstd),

where ϕstd denotes the almost contact structure underlying the standard contact structure on
Sn and the Stein cobordism (W, J) can be assumed to have c1(J) = 0.

***

Remark 3.5. In contrast to the 3-dimensional case, there can be no minimal elements with
respect to the Stein cobordism relation in dimension at least 5. For example if (M0, ϕ0) ≺
(M1, ϕ1) and c1(ϕ1) = 0, then the fact that c1(ϕ1) = 0 implies that c1(ϕ0) = 0. To see
this note that a topological Stein cobordism (W, J) from M0 to M1 is obtained from M1 by
attaching high index handles, which means that c1(J) = 0. But this would imply that an
initial element (Mmin, ϕmin) must have c1(ϕmin) = 0. A similar argument shows that for
1(ϕmin) (cid:54)= 0 (cf. [BCS2, Proposition
certain choices of M1 the fact that cq
6.2]). For this note that the inclusion of M1 into W gives an isomorphism on fundamental
groups. Suppose that β ∈ H 1(Bπ1(W )) is a class such that when restricted to M1

1(ϕ1) (cid:54)= 0 implies cq

where p1 : W −→ Bπ1(W ) is the classifying map of the universal cover of W .
that the restriction of p∗
c1(ϕmin) = c1(J)|Mmin (cid:54)= 0.
In fact, these sorts of arguments show that there can be no initial elements even if one forgets
about the almost contact structures, and one simply considers Pontrjagin classes rather than
Chern classes.

It follows
1(J) (cid:54)= 0 to M0 = Mmin is also non-zero and hence that

Lemma 4.1. [cf. [MSp, Theorem 2]] There is a map f : ST ∗S2k+1 → S2k such that the
induced homomorphism f∗ : H2k(ST ∗S2k+1) → H2k(S2k) is an isomorphism if and only if
k = 0, 1 or 3.

***
Proposition 4.2. Let k ≥ 1 and let M = (ST ∗S2k+1)#Σ0 be the connected sum of ST ∗S2k+1
with some homotopy sphere Σ0. Choose some almost contact structure ϕ on M and let
W 4k+2 be the smooth manifold underlying a Stein ﬁlling of (M, ϕ). Then W decomposes as
a boundary connected sum

where H2k(Wl) = Z/lZ and WΣ is a 2k-connected ﬁlling of some homotopy sphere Σ.
Moreover we have the following possibilities for the topology of Wl:

W = Wl (cid:92)WΣ,

(1) If l > 1, then Wl has a handle decomposition with precisely one handle of index 2k

and two handles of index 2k+1;

∼= DT ∗S2k+1;

(2) If l = 1, then W1
(3) If l = 0, then we must have k = 1, 3 and W0

∼= D2k+2 × S2k.

In particular, ST ∗S2k+1 admits a subcritical ﬁlling if and only if k = 1, 3.

***

Remark 4.3. Although not the focus of this work, the topology of Stein ﬁllings, as opposed to
their boundaries, is of independent interest and may be relevent to certain computations in
contact homology. In the case that k = 1, Proposition 4.2 determines the smooth manifolds
underlying Stein ﬁllings of almost contact structures on S2 × S3. In this dimension there are
no exotic 5-spheres [KM] and by [Sm2, Theorem 6.2] the manifold WΣ is diﬀeomorphic to
#r(S3 × S3) − Int(D6). Concerning the manifolds Wl, we conjecture that they are classiﬁed
up to diﬀeomorphism by l. If this is correct, then topological Stein ﬁllings (W, J) of S2 × S3
are classiﬁed up to stably complex diﬀeomorphism by their integral homology groups H∗(W )
along with their ﬁrst Chern class c1(J) ∈ H 2(W ).

***
Lemma 4.4. If k is odd, there exist almost contact structures ϕ on ST ∗S2k+1 with non-zero
kth-Chern class, 0 (cid:54)= ck(ϕ) ∈ H 2k(ST ∗S2k+1) ∼= Z.

***
Lemma 4.5. Let ϕ be an almost contact structure on M = ST ∗S2k+1 with ck(ϕ) (cid:54)= 0 and
let (Σ, ϕΣ) be any almost contact homotopy sphere. If k (cid:54)= 1, 3, then neither (M #Σ, ϕ#ϕΣ)

nor(cid:0)−(M #Σ),−(ϕ#ϕΣ)(cid:1) is Stein ﬁllable.

***
Remark 4.6. Notice that the non-ﬁllability of (ST ∗S2k+1, ϕ) in Theorem 1.5 arises from the
choice of the almost contact structure ϕ, since ST ∗S2k+1 does admit Stein ﬁllable contact
In [BCS3] we shall prove a stronger version of Theorem 1.5 which asserts
structures.
the existence of (4k−1)-connected closed smooth (8k+1)-manifolds M , such that M (and
M #Σ for any homotopy sphere Σ) admits no Stein ﬁllable almost contact structure at all,
but M #(−M ) is Stein ﬁllable. We would like to point out that our result is on the almost
contact level: we do not claim that the Stein ﬁllable contact structure ξM #(−M ) on M #(−M )
found in the proof of Theorem 1.5 (representing the almost contact structure ϕ#(−ϕ)) can
be given as a connected sum ξ+#ξ− where ξ± is a contact structure on ±M .

***

Lemma 4.7. Let ϕ be an almost contact stucture on the connected sum of 5-manifolds M0
and M1. Then there are, up to homotopy unique, almost contact structures ϕ0 on M0 and
ϕ1 on M1, such that (M0#M1, ϕ) = (M0#M1, ϕ0#ϕ1).

***

Theorem 4.8. Let (M, ϕ) = (M0#M1, ϕ0#ϕ1) be a Stein ﬁllable almost contact 5-manifold.
Assume that either c1(ϕ) = 0 or that

c1(ϕ)(π2(M0)) = c1(ϕ)(π2(M1)) = Z = π2(BU ).

Then both (M0, ϕ0) and (M1, ϕ1) are Stein ﬁllable.

***

Remark 4.9. We point out that in dimension ﬁve the method in the proof of Theorem 4.8
does not ascend to give control over contact structures. That is, if the almost contact
manifolds (M0, ϕ0) and (M1, ϕ1) are induced from contact manifolds (M0, ξ0) and (M1, ξ1),
and even if we know that (M0#M1, ξ0#ξ1) is Stein ﬁllable, then in contrast to the situation
in dimension 3, we cannot conclude that (M0, ξ0) and (M1, ξ1) are Stein ﬁllable.

***

Remark 4.10. Note that in the proof of Theorem 4.8 involved constructing a nullbordism of
each component of the connected sum M0#M1 by ﬁrst adding a 5-handle and then capping
oﬀ two of the resulting boundary components. This bordism is thus far from having the
correct homotopy type, but applying surgery below the middle dimension as in the proof of
Theorem 2.12 has the virtue of remedying this.

***
Theorem 5.1. The exotic stable complex structure ζex on S8k−1 cannot be represented by a
Stein ﬁllable contact structure once k ≥ 2.

***

Remark 5.2. According to [G2, Proposition 6 (vi)], the hypothesis of Corollary 1.9 that the
(4k−2)-connected (8k−1)-manifold M admit an almost contact structure is equivalent to
assuming that Im(τM∗) ⊆ F∗(π4k(BU )). In Theorem 5.7 (3) below, we prove that provided
k ≥ 2, the same condition is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a (4k−1)-connected
8k-manifold to admit a stable complex structure.

***

Remark 5.3. The stable almost contact structures ζ and ζ#ζex appearing in the proof of
Corollary 1.9 diﬀer by precisely the “top-dimensional Z/2-obstruction to stable homotopy
of almost contact structures” identiﬁed by Geiges in [G2, Theorem 4 (2b)].

***

Remark 5.4. By [BEM] the stable almost contact structure found in Corollary 1.9 (as any
stable complex, or even almost contact structure) can be represented by an overtwisted
contact structure; according to Theorem 5.1 the stable almost contact structure ζex on
S8k−1 as well as the stable contact structure found by Corollary 1.9 cannot be represented
by Stein ﬁllable contact structures. It would be interesting to see if these particular stable
complex structures admit ﬁllable or tight (that is, not overtwisted) contact representatives.

cohomology class τY ∗ ∈ H 4k(Y ), which Yang denotes by ν. When k is even, F∗(π4k(BU )) ⊂
π4k(BSO) is the subgroup of index two [Bott], and so the condition Im(τY ∗) ⊆ F∗(π4k(BU ))
is equivalent to the condition that τY ∗ vanishes mod 2, which is the condition Yang uses.

Remark 5.8. The simpliﬁcation achieved in moving from Theorem 5.5 to Theorem 5.7 is
perhaps surprising and rests on Theorem A.1 , which is a non-trivial fact about the diﬀerences

k) of closed (4k−1)-connected almost complex

only on the oriented diﬀeomorphism type of W .
