Introduction

This paper addresses the following question which has attracted much attention during the
past two decades (cf. also Wang [18]): What is the largest Besov-type space in which the initial
value problem of the Navier-Stokes equations is well-posed? The purpose of this paper is to give
an answer to this question 1 .

Recall that the initial value problem of the Navier-Stokes equations reads as follows:


∂t u − ∆u + (u · ∇)u + ∇π = 0 in Rn × R+ ,



(1.1)
∇ · u = 0 in Rn × R+ ,

where n ≥ 2, u = u(x, t) = (u1 (x, t), u2 (x, t), · · · , un (x, t)) is an unknown n-vector function
in (x, t) variables, x ∈ Rn , t ≥ 0, π = π(x, t) is an unknown scalar function, u0 = u0 (x) is
a given n-vector function, ∆ is the Laplacian in the x variables, ∇ = (∂x1 , ∂x2 , · · · , ∂xn ), and
R+ = (0, ∞).

, where δij ’s are the
pseudo-differential operator in R with the matrix symbol δij − |ξ|2

Kronecker symbols. It is well-known that when only the L2uloc,x L2t -class solutions (see [13] for
this notion) are considered, which is the case in this paper, the problem (1.1) is equivalent to
the following formally simpler problem:


∂t u − ∆u + P∇ · (u ⊗ u) = 0 in Rn × R+ ,
(1.2)

u(x, t) = u0 (x) for x ∈ Rn .
Throughout this paper, for any scaler function space X we shall use the same notation X to
denote its n-vector counterpart to simplify the notation. Let X be a function space continuously
embedded in S 0 (Rn ), the space of temperate distributions on Rn endowed with the dual topology
of the Schwartz space S(Rn ). Recall that the initial value problem (1.1) is said to be locally
well-posed in X if for any u0 ∈ X with divu0 = 0 there exists corresponding T > 0 and a
continuously embedded subspace YT of C([0, T ], X) such that the problem (1.2) has a unique
solution u in YT , and the solution map u0 7→ u is continuous with respect to the norm topologies
of X and C([0, T ], X). If (1.1) is not locally well-posed in a function space X, then it is called
ill-posed in X. Also recall that (1.1) is said to be semi-globally well-posed in X for small initial
data if for any T > 0 there exists corresponding constant ε > 0 and a continuously embedded
subspace YT of C([0, T ], X) such that for any u0 ∈ X with divu0 = 0 and ku0 kX < ε the
problem (1.2) has a unique solution u in YT , and the solution map u0 7→ u is continuous with
respect to the norm topologies of X and C([0, T ], X). If there exists constant ε > 0 such that
for any u0 ∈ X with divu0 = 0 and ku0 kX < ε the problem (1.2) has a unique solution u in
some subspace of C([0, ∞), X) ∩ L∞ ((0, ∞), X), and the solution map u0 7→ u is continuous
with respect to the norm topologies of X and L∞ ((0, ∞), X), then (1.1) is said to be globally
well-posed in X for small initial data.
The topic of well-posedness of the problem (1.1) in various function spaces has been deeply
investigated during the past 50 years. In 1964 Fujita and Kato [8] obtained the first result on
this topic by proving that the problem (1.1) is locally well-posed in H s (Rn ) for s ≥ n2 − 1 and
2

n

globally well-posed in H 2 −1 (Rn ) for small initial data. These results were later extended to
various other function spaces, cf. [1, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19] and references cited
therein. Note that the literatures listed here are far from being complete; we refer the reader
to see [5] and [13] for expositions and more references. Here we particularly mention that by
s (Rn ) for
Cannone [4] and Planchon [16], the problem (1.1) is well-posed in the Besov spaces Bpq
s > −1 + np , 1 6 p < ∞, 1 6 q 6 ∞ (for q = ∞, this means that it is well-posed in the closure
s (Rn ), and in what follows, similar remark should be made in any case where
of S(Rn ) in Bp∞
the ∞ index appears), and by Koch and Tataru [12], it is well-posed in BM O−1 . Note that the
inhomogeneous version bmo−1 of BM O−1 is the largest initial value space in which the problem
(1.1) is known to be locally well-posed.
On the other hand, in 2008 Bourgain and Pavlović [3] proved that the problem (1.1) is
−1 (Rn ). Yoneda [20] further proved that (1.1) is ill-posed in the
ill-posed in the Besov space Ḃ∞∞
−1 (Rn ) and the Triebel-Lizorkin spaces Ḟ −1 (Rn ) for 2 < q 6 ∞. Recently, Wang
Besov spaces Ḃ∞q
∞q
−1 (Rn ) for 1 6 q 6 2,
[18] proved that the problem (1.1) is also ill-posed in the Besov spaces Ḃ∞q
which is a remarkable result because previously it had been commonly conjectured that (1.1) is
−1 (Rn ) for 1 6 q 6 2 due to the fact that they are smaller than BM O −1 . Note
well-posed in Ḃ∞q
that all the above-mentioned ill-posedness results also hold for the corresponding inhomogeneous
spaces, because all the arguments used in [3], [20] and [18] also work for the corresponding
inhomogeneous spaces.

(Rn ) and bmo−1 = F∞2
Recalling that BM O−1 = Ḟ∞2
are respectively the largest homogeneous and inhomogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces in which
the problem (1.1) is well-posed. Naturally, we want to know what is the largest Besov-type
space in which the problem (1.1) is well-posed. To give an answer to this question we need to
refine the classification of the Besov space and introduce the logarithmically refined Besov space

In this section we make some preliminary preparations.
Choose and fix a nonnegative non-increasing function φ ∈ C ∞ [0, ∞) such that

and set
ϕ(ξ) = φ(|ξ|),

ψ(ξ) = φ(|ξ|) − φ(2|ξ|),

ψj (ξ) = ψ(2−j ξ) (j = 0, 1, 2, · · · )

for ξ ∈ Rn .

It is easy to see that ϕ = 1 on B̄(0, 5/4) and suppϕ ⊆ B̄(0, 3/2), ψ = 1 on B̄(0, 5/4)\B(0, 3/4)
and suppψ ⊆ B̄(0, 3/2)\B(0, 5/8). Here B(a, r) and B̄(a, r) (a ∈ Rn , r > 0) respectively
represent the open and closed balls in Rn with center a and radius r. We also note that
ψj = 1

and

We denote by ˆ and F the Fourier transform, and by ˇ and F −1 the inverse Fourier transform.
The notation OM (Rn ) denotes the topological vector space of temperate smooth functions on
Rn , i.e. u ∈ OM (Rn ) if and only if u ∈ C ∞ (Rn ) and for any α ∈ Zn+ , there exists corresponding
r ∈ R such that |∂ α u(x)| . (1 + |x|)r for x ∈ Rn . Then we define S0 : S 0 (Rn ) → OM (Rn ) and
∆j : S 0 (Rn ) → OM (Rn ) (j = 0, 1, 2, · · · ) to be the following operators:
S0 (u) = F −1 (ϕû),

∆j (u) = F −1 (ψj û)

for u ∈ S 0 (Rn )

(j = 0, 1, 2, · · · ). It is well-known that for any u ∈ S 0 (Rn ) there holds the relation

in S 0 (Rn )-weak topology.
As usual for t > 0 we denote by et∆ the pseudo-differential operator on Rn with symbol
2
e−t|ξ| , i.e., et∆ is the continuous linear operator in S 0 (Rn ) defined by
2

et∆ u = F −1 (e−t|ξ| û(ξ))

for u ∈ S 0 (Rn ).

It is well-known that when restricted on shift-invariant Banach space of test functions (see [13]
for this concept), the family of operators {et∆ }t>0 forms a C0 -semigroup of contractions (i.e.
ket∆ uk 6 kuk for all t > 0), and when restricted on shift-invariant Banach space of distributions
(also see [13] for this concept), {et∆ }t>0 is a semigroup of contractions, but it is not necessarily
strongly continuous at t = 0 (it is strongly continuous for t > 0).
In the proofs of Theorems 1.3 and 1.6 we shall use the following characterization of the

space Bpq
Lemma 2.1 Let s ∈ R, σ > 0 and p, q ∈ [1, ∞]. Let u ∈ S 0 (Rn ). Let t0 > 0 be given. Let

The following very useful preliminary result is well-known (cf. Chapter 15 of [13]):
Lemma 2.2 For any u, v ∈ L1loc ((0, T ), [L∞ (Rn )]n ) such that the right-hand side makes

and by Kqσ (T ) the following function space on (0, T ): K∞σ (T ) = K˙∞σ (T ) and for 1 6 q < ∞,
Kqσ (T ) = K˙qσ (T ) ∩ K˙∞σ (T ),
with norm
kf kKqσ = kf kK˙ σ + kf kK˙ σ .

q

It is easy to prove that both K˙qσ (T ) and Kqσ (T ) (1 6 q 6 ∞) are Banach spaces. We use the
notation K∞σ 0 (T ) to denote the closure of the subspace of simple functions in [0, T ] in K∞σ (T ).
From the interpolation theory for Lp -spaces with change of measures (cf. Sections 5.4 and 5.5
of [2]) we see that the following interpolation relations hold: For 1 6 q0 , q1 < ∞,
[K˙qσ0 0 (T ), K˙qσ1 1 (T )][θ] = K˙qσ (T ),

[Kqσ0 0 (T ), Kqσ1 1 (T )][θ] = Kqσ (T ),

and for 1 6 q0 < ∞, q1 = ∞,
[K˙qσ0 0 (T ), K˙∞σ10 (T )][θ] = K˙qσ (T ),

[Kqσ0 0 (T ), K∞σ10 (T )][θ] = Kqσ (T ),

where 0 < θ < 1, σ = (1−θ)σ0 + θσ1 , 1/q = (1−θ)/q0 + θ/q1 . Besides, it is clear that
K1σ (T ) ⊆ Kqσ1 (T ) ⊆ Kqσ2 (T ) ⊆ K∞σ 0 (T )

for 1 6 q1 6 q2 < ∞,

σ > 0,

for σ1 > σ2 > 0,

1 6 q 6 ∞.

and
K˙qσ1 (T ) ⊆ K˙qσ2 (T ),

Kqσ1 (T ) ⊆ Kqσ2 (T )

The following bilinear estimate will play a fundamental role in the proof of Theorem 1.2:
Lemma 2.5 Let T > 0 be given and assume that (q, σ) satisfies one of the following two
conditions: (a) σ > 1 and 1 6 q 6 ∞; (b) 1/2 6 σ < 1 and 1/σ 6 q 6 1/(1−σ). Then the
following estimate holds:
kB(f, g)kKqσ .q,σ kf kKqσ kgkKqσ ,

∀f, g ∈ Kqσ (T ).

Proof: First we have

By using bilinear interpolation (cf. Theorem 4.4.1 of [2]), from (2.4) ∼ (2.6) we easily get the

Combining (2.7) and (2.10), we obtain (2.3) in the case 1/2 6 σ 6 1 and 1/σ 6 q 6 1/(1−σ).
Proof of (2.3) in the rest case σ > 1 and 1 6 q 6 ∞ is much easier. Indeed, since for any
1 < q 6 ∞, the condition σ > 1 implies that 2q 0 σ > 1, we see that for σ > 1 and 1 < q 6 ∞,

The proof of Theorem 1.2

In this section we give the proof of Theorems 1.2. We shall first derive some linear and
bilinear estimates, and next use these estimates to prove Theorem 1.2.
Let 1 6 q < ∞ and σ > 0. Given T > 0, we introduce a path space XT as follows:
∞
n
XT ={u ∈ L∞
loc ((0, T ], L (R )) : ∇ · u = 0, kukXT < ∞},

where

It is clear that (XT , k · kXT ) is a Banach space. We shall also consider the following path spaces:
−1,σ
n
YT = L∞ ((0, T ), B∞
q (R )) ∩ XT ,
−1,σ

YT0 = C([0, T ], B∞
q 0 (R )) ∩ XT .

If furthermore u0 ∈ B∞
q 0 (R ) then in addition to the above estimate we also have e u0 ∈ YT ,
and
lim ket∆ u0 kXT = 0.

Proof: It is easy to see that B∞
q (R ) is a shift-invariant Banach space of distributions.
−1,σ
n
t∆
Hence by Propositions 4.1 and 4.4 of [13] we see that u0 ∈ B∞
q (R ) implies that e u0 ∈
−1,σ
−1,σ
C∗ ([0, ∞), B∞, q (Rn )), i.e., for any t > 0 we have et∆ u0 ∈ B∞ q (Rn ), and the map t 7→ et∆ u0

from [0, ∞) to B∞
q (R ) is continuous for t > 0 with respect to the norm topology of B∞ q (R )

and continuous at t = 0 with respect to the ∗-weak topology of B∞
q (R ), and

sup ket∆ u0 kB∞

Moreover, from Lemma 2.1 (choosing p = ∞, s = −1, γ = 0 and t0 = T ) and the embedding

n
B∞
q (R ) ⊆ B∞∞ (R ) (for 1 6 q < ∞ and σ > 0) we see that u0 ∈ B∞ q (R ) implies that

Hence the first part of the lemma follows. The second part of the lemma follows from a standard
density argument, cf. the proof of Lemma 2.5 in [6]; we omit the details. 
Lemma 3.2 Let T > 0 be given and assume that (q, σ) satisfies one of the following two
conditions: (a) σ > 1 and 1 6 q 6 ∞; (b) 1/2 6 σ < 1 and 1/σ 6 q 6 1/(1 − σ). Then
B(u, v) ∈ XT , and

Lemma 3.3 Let T > 0 be given and assume that (q, σ) satisfies one of the following two
conditions: (a) σ > 1 and 1 6 q 6 ∞; (b) 1/2 6 σ < 1 and 1/σ 6 q 6 1/(1−σ). Then for any

This proves B(u, v) ∈ Cw ([0, T ], B∞

u, v ∈ YT , it follows that if either u ∈ YT or v ∈ YT then by a standard density argument we

see that B(u, v) ∈ C([0, T ], B∞
q0 (R )), cf. the proof of the last assertion in Lemma 2.5 of [6].
We omit the details here. 

We are now ready to give the proof of Theorem 1.2.
Proof of Theorem 1.2: Let 1 6 q < ∞ and σ > σq be given. We rewrite the problem
(1.2) into the following equivalent integral equation:
u(t) = et∆ u0 + B(u, u)(t).
−1,σ
n
Given u0 ∈ B∞
q (R ) with divu0 = 0 and T > 0, we define a map J : XT → XT as follows:
For any u ∈ XT , J (u) equals to the right-hand side of the above equation. By Lemmas 3.1

15

and 3.2, J is a self-mapping in XT and the following estimates hold:
kJ (u)kXT ≤ ket∆ u0 kXT + Ckuk2XT ,
kJ (u) − J (v)kXT ≤ C(kukXT + kvkXT )ku − vkXT .
Choose a number ε > 0 sufficiently small such that 4Cε < 1, where C is the larger constant
appearing in the above estimates. To prove the assertion (1) of Theorem 1.2, for any u0 ∈
−1,σ
n
t∆
B∞
q 0 (R ) with divu0 = 0 we choose T > 0 so small that ke u0 kXT ≤ ε. By Lemma 3.1,
such T exists. Then from Lemma 3.4 and the first inequality in the above we easily see that J
maps the closed ball B(0, 2ε) in XT0 into itself, and the second inequality ensures that J is a
contraction mapping when restricted to this ball. Hence, by the fixed point theorem of Banach,
J has a unique fixed point in this ball. Since et∆ u0 ∈ YT0 and B(u, u) ∈ YT0 for u ∈ YT0 , from
the iteration procedure we see that this fixed point lies in YT0 . Hence we have obtain a mild
solution of the problem (1.1) in the path space YT0 . This proves the assertion (1). To prove
−1,σ
n
the assertion (2), for given T > 0 we let u0 ∈ B∞
q (R ) (with divu0 = 0) be so small that
t∆
ke u0 kXT ≤ ε. Then from the first inequality in the above we easily see that J maps the
closed ball B(0, 2ε) in XT into itself, and the second inequality ensures that J is a contraction
mapping when restricted to this ball. Hence, again by the fixed point theorem of Banach, J
has a unique fixed point in this ball. Since et∆ u0 ∈ YT and B(u, u) ∈ YT for u ∈ YT , by a
similar argument as above we get a mild solution of the problem (1.1) which lies in the path
space YT . This proves the assertion (2). The proof of Theorem 1.2 is complete. 

The proof of Theorem 1.3

In this section we give the proof of Theorem 1.3. We shall mainly consider the case 2 < q 6
∞ and 1 − 2/q 6 σ < 1 − 1/q, because the rest cases 1 6 q 6 2, 0 6 σ < 1/q and 2 < q 6 ∞,
0 6 σ < 1 − 2/q are easier to treat. In the end of this section we shall explain how to modify
the arguments given below to get proofs for these two cases. Besides, we only give proof for the
case n > 3, and proof for the two-dimension case is omitted.
For a sufficiently large positive integer m, we denote
Am = {4k : k ∈ N, 4m + 1 6 k 6 5m},

Bm = {4k : k ∈ N, m + 1 6 k 6 2m}.

Clearly |Am | = |Bm | = m. Let ε be a sufficiently small positive number. For every positive
integer k, we introduce three n-dimensional vector ak , bk and ck as follows:
p
1
ak = 2k n− 2 (1, 1, · · · , 1), bk = 2k−1 (ε, 2ε, 1 − 5ε2 , 0, · · · , 0), ck = 2k (1, 0, · · · , 0).
Note that |ak | = 2|bk | = |ck | = 2k , k = 1, 2, · · · . Let φ be as in Section 2 and set ρ(ξ) = φ(8|ξ|),
ξ ∈ Rn . It is clear that ρ(ξ) = 1 for |ξ| 6 5/32 and suppρ ⊆ B̄(0, 3/16). We denote

(4.5)

Proof: First we note that for any f ∈ S 0 (Rn ), if we denote u = et∆ f then suppû(·, t) = suppfˆ
for all t > 0. Hence, if the frequency support of f satisfies certain property, then the same
property is also satisfied by u = et∆ f for all t > 0.
We shall use the following principle to prove the above result: If f ∈ C 1 (Rn ) is a real valued
function and ∇f ∈ L∞ (Rn ), then for any ν, x0 , x00 ∈ Rn with |ν| = 1, x0 6= x00 and x0 − x00 k ν,
there holds
|f (x0 ) − f (x00 )|
.
k∂ν f kL∞ (Rn ) >
|x0 − x00 |
√
In what follows, we shall use this principle to the case ν = (1/ 2)(1, −1, 0, · · · , 0) (so that
√
∂ν = (1/ 2)(∂1 − ∂2 )) and
Z t

(see (4.7) for the expression of the function U1j ).

Proof: A basic observation in getting (4.15) is that on the supports of ρ(ξ − η ∓ 2bj )ρ(η)

and ρ(ξ − η ∓ bj ∓ bj 0 )ρ(η), the symbol of the pseudo-differential operator
is bounded by

(4.5). Indeed, similarly as in (4.6) we have

We are now ready to give the proof of Theorem 1.3.
Proof of Theorem 1.3: As we mentioned in the beginning of this section, here we only
consider the case 2 < q 6 ∞, 1 − 2/q 6 σ < 1 − 1/q. Hence, in what follows we assume that
these conditions are satisfied.
Given T > 0, let X be the following function space on Rn × [0, T ]:

X = {u ∈ L∞

and let Y = X ∩ L∞ ((0, T ), bmo−1 ) with standard norm for joint space. It is well-known that
there exists T > 0 such that for u0 ∈ bmo−1 with kδu0 kbmo−1 6 T , the problem (4.1) has a
unique solution u = u(δ, t) ∈ Y , and
ku(δ, ·)kY . δku0 kbmo−1 ,

∀δ ∈ (0, δ0 ).

(4.19)

∀u, v ∈ X.

(4.20)

Moreover, there holds the following estimate:
kB(u, v)kY . kukX kvkX ,

We refer the reader to see Theorem 16.1, Lemma 16.3 and the proof of the corollary following
Theorem 16.2 of [13] for proofs of these assertions. Since u = δet∆ u0 + B(u, u), from (4.19) and
(4.20) it follows that
ku(δ, ·) − δet∆ u0 kY . ku(δ, ·)k2X . δ 2 ku0 k2bmo−1 ,

∀δ ∈ (0, δ0 ).

(4.21)

Let v(δ, t) = B(et∆ u0 , et∆ u0 ) and set
w(δ, t) = u(δ, t) − δet∆ u0 − δ 2 v(δ, t)
Z t

by (4.19) ∼ (4.21) it follows that
kw(δ, ·)kY . (ku(δ, ·)kX + δket∆ u0 kX )ku(δ, ·) − δet∆ u0 kX . δ 3 ku0 k3bmo−1 .

(4.22)

Now let u0 be the vector function given by (4.2). Since u0 ∈ S(Rn )), the above results apply to
it. By applying Lemma 4.1 we have

1 − σ − 1/q > 3/2 − 2/q − 2σ, it follows that for any given 0 < δ < δ0 and 0 < ε  1, by choosing

Remark 4.5 Note that the above proof actually works under the weaker conditions
2 < q 6 ∞ and 1/2 − 1/q 6 σ < 1 − 1/q.
Remark 4.6 To treat the case 1 6 q 6 2 and 0 6 σ < 1/q, we need to use a different class
of initial values u0 which are obtained by modifying the definition of (4.2) as follows: In the first
X
−σ− 1q
two lines of (4.2), remove the first sum
, replace m
with m−σ , and put k = 16m. The
k∈Am

arguments in the statements and proofs of Lemmas 4.1 ∼ 4.4 must be correspondingly modified:
1
−σ
The right-hand sides of (4.5), (4.11) and (4.15) need be replaced with ε2 m q , ε2 2−8m m−σ
1
−σ
and ε4 m q , respectively. We omit the details here. Note that this can also be regarded as a
modification to the argument of [18].
Remark 4.7 To treat the case 2 < q 6 ∞ and 0 6 σ < 1 − 2/q, another different class of
initial values u0 have to be employed, which are obtained by modifying the definition
X of (4.2)
in another way as follows: In the first two lines of (4.2), remove the second sum
, and put
l∈Bm

l = 4m. The corresponding modifications in the statements of Lemmas 4.2 ∼ 4.4 are as follows:
All Bm in these lemmas need be replaced with the single-point set {4m}, and the right-hand
1−σ− 2q
1−σ− 2q
−σ− 2q
sides of (4.5), (4.11) and (4.15) need be replaced with ε2 m
, ε2 2−12m m
and ε3 m
,
respectively. In this case, the estimates in (4.23) ∼ (4.26) need also be correspondingly modified:
Not only the set Bm need be replaced with the single-point set {4m}, but also the final bounds
in these estimates need be replaced with m−σ , δ 3 m−3σ , δ 3 m−2σ and
1−σ− 2q

C 0 δ 2 ε2 m

− C1 δ 3 m−2σ − C2 δ,

respectively. We omit the details here.
27

Remark 4.8 For the case 2 < q 6 ∞ and 0 6 σ < 1 − 2/q, an alternative proof is to
modify the argument of [20]. The modification is as follows: Let
v 0 = (0, 0, 1, 0, · · · , 0),

v 1 = (0, 1, 0, 0, · · · , 0),

a0k = 24(m+k) w0 ,

a1k = 24(m+k) w0 + 2m w1 ,

Then set
−σ− 1q

u0 (x) = m

w0 = (1, 0, 0, 0, · · · , 0),

m
X

w1 = (0, 0, 1, 0, · · · , 0),

k = 1, 2, · · · , m.

|a0k |[v 0 cos(a0k x) + v 1 cos(a1k x)].

k=1

Using this function as the initial value and correspondingly making necessary modifications
to the argument of [20], we obtain a different proof to ill-posedness of the problem (1.2) in
−1,σ
n
B∞
q (R ) for the case 2 < q 6 ∞ and 0 6 σ < 1 − 2/q.
Remark 4.9 Here we only treated the case n > 3. After making some modifications to
the argument given above as in Section 3 of [18], we see that Theorem 1.3 also holds for the case
n = 2.
