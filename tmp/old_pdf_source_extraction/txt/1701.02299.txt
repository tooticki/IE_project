Theorem 1.1. For any integers 1 ≤ k < n and s ∈ [0, 1] the union of any
nonempty s-Hausdorff-dimensional family of k-dimensional affine subspaces of Rn
has Hausdorff dimension s + k.

Theorem 1.2. Let 1 ≤ k < n be integers and s ∈ [0, 1]. If E is a nonempty
s-Hausdorff
dimensional family of k-dimensional affine subspaces and B is a subset
S
of P ∈E P such that B ∩ P has Hausdorff dimension k for every P ∈ E then

Notation 1.3. For any integers 1 ≤ k < n, let A(n, k) denote the space of all
k-dimensional affine subspaces of Rn . For any s ≥ 0, δ ∈ (0, ∞] and A ⊂ Rn ,
the s-dimensional Hausdorff δ-premeasure of A will be denoted by Hδs (A), the
s-dimensional Hausdorff measure by Hs (A), and the Hausdorff dimension of A by
dim A. The open ball of center x and radius r will be denoted by B(x, r) or Bρ (x, r)
if we want to indicate the metric ρ. For a set U ⊂ Rn , Uδ = ∪x∈U B(x, δ) denotes
the open δ-neighborhood of U . We will use the notation a .α b if a ≤ Cb where C
is a constant depending on α. If it is clear from the context what C should depend
on, we may write only a . b.

Theorem 2.1. Let 1 ≤ k < n be integers, let A(n, k) denote the space of all kdimensional affine subspaces of Rn and consider any natural metric on A(n, k). Let
0 < α ≤ k be any real number. Suppose that B ⊂ Rn , ∅ =
6 E ⊂ A(n, k) and for
every k-dimensional affine subspace P ∈ E, dim (P ∩ B) ≥ α. Then
(2)

dim B ≥ 2α − k + min(dim E, 1).

***
Remark 2.2. An example for such a metric on A(n, k) is defined in [11], p. 53.
Let ρ denote the given metric on A(n, k). We say that ρ is a natural metric if ρ
and the metric d defined in [11] are strongly equivalent; that is, there exist positive
constants K1 and K2 such that, for every P, P 0 ∈ A(n, k), K1 ·d(P, P 0 ) ≤ ρ(P, P 0 ) ≤
K2 · d(P, P 0 ).

***
Remark 2.3. For α = k and dim E ≤ k + 1 the estimate (2) is sharp in the sense
that for any s ∈ [0, k + 1] there exist sets E and B with the above property and
dim E = s such that we have equality in (2): it is easy to see using Theorem 1.2
that we obtain such an example by letting E to be any s-Hausdorff dimensional
collection of k-dimensional affine subspaces of a fixed k + 1-dimensional subspace
of Rn and B = ∪P ∈E P .
Clearly, (2) can be a good estimate only when α is close to k: for α < k − 1 the
right-hand side of (2) is less than α but trivially, dim B ≥ α. Since finding the best
estimate for the n = 2, k = 1, dim E = 1, α < 1 case is essentially equivalent to
finding the minimal Hausdorff dimension of a Furstenberg set, this cannot be easy
and it is unlikely that our estimate is sharp for any α < k.

Lemma 2.4. For any 1 ≤ k < n integers and ∅ =
6 E ⊂ A(n, k) we have

***
Corollary 2.5. Let 0 ≤ k < n be integers, 0 ≤ α ≤ k, ∅ 6= C ⊂ Rn , and B ⊂ Rn
such that for every x ∈ C there exists a k-dimensional affine subspace P containing
x such that P intersects B in a nonempty set of Hausdorff dimension at least α.
Then dim B ≥ 2α − k + min(dim C − k, 1).
Specially, if 1 ≤ k and a set A ⊂ Rn contains a k-dimensional punctured affine
subspace through every point of a set C with dim C ≥ k + 1, then dim A ≥ k + 1.

***
Theorem 2.6. Let 0 ≤ k < n be integers, 0 ≤ α ≤ k and 0 ≤ r be real numbers,
∅=
6 C ⊂ Rn , and B ⊂ Rn be such that for every x ∈ C there exists a k-dimensional
affine subspace P at distance r from x such that P intersects B in a nonempty set
of Hausdorff dimension at least α. Then dim B ≥ 2α − k + dim C − (n − 1).
Specially, if B contains a k-dimensional affine subspace at a fixed positive distance
from every point of Rn , or if B contains the k-skeleton of a rotated unit cube around
every point of Rn , then dim B ≥ k + 1.

***
Remark 2.7. In the special cases mentioned in Theorem 2.6 , the estimate is sharp.
It is easy to see that B = Rk+1 × Qn−k−1 contains a k-dimensional affine subspace
at every positive distance from every point of Rn and clearly dim B = k + 1. The
construction given in [1] for a set B with dim B = k + 1 containing the k-skeleton
of a rotated unit cube centered at every point of Rn is also based on this example.

***
Corollary 2.8. Let 0 ≤ k < n be integers, S ⊂ Rn with dim S = k that can be
covered by a countable union of k-dimensional affine subspaces. Let ∅ =
6 C ⊂ Rn ,
n
A ⊂ R such that for all x ∈ C there exists a rotation T ∈ SO(n) such that A
contains x + T (S). Then dim A ≥ max(k, k + dim C − (n − 1)).

***
Remark 2.9. The authors in [1] show that the estimate in Corollary 2.8 is sharp
if dim C = n and S can be covered by a countable union of k-dimensional affine
subspaces that do not contain the origin.
On the other hand, if the covering subspaces contain the origin, then the estimate is
not always sharp. Indeed, if S is a punctured line through the origin and C = Rn ,
then A is a Nikodym set, thus the conjecture is dim A = n. The lower bounds
obtained for the dimension of Besicovitch sets give lower bounds for the dimension
of Nikodym sets, thus for dim A as well. A survey of the currently best lower bounds
can be found in [12]. As an example, by [17], dim A ≥ n+2
which is better than
2
the bound 2 given by Corollary 2.8 provided n > 2.

Lemma 3.1. For X ⊂ Rn , α > 0 and c ≥ 0 let
α
Eα,c,X = {P ∈ A(n, k) : H∞
(P ∩ X) > c}.

If X ⊂ Rn is bounded Gδ , then Eα,c,X is analytic.

***
Remark 3.2. It is easy to see that if X ⊂ Rn is compact, then Eα,c,X is Fσ , thus
also analytic. Therefore, to prove Theorem 2.1 (or any of the above mentioned
results) with the extra assumption that B ⊂ Rn is compact, the following argument
could be skipped.

***
Definition. Let Y be a Hausdorff topological space. A capacity on Y is a map
γ : P(Y ) → [0, ∞] such that
(i) A ⊂ B =⇒ γ(A) ≤ γ(B),
(ii) A0 ⊂ A1 ⊂ · · · =⇒ γ(An ) → γ(∪n An ),
(iii) for any compact K ⊂ Y we have γ(K) < ∞, and if γ(K) < r, then for some
open U ⊃ K, γ(U ) < r.

Lemma 3.3. Let s = min(dim E, 1) > 0. We can make the following assumptions
in the proof of Theorem 2.1 :
(i) B is a Gδ set, that is, a countable intersection of open sets;
(ii) Hα (P ∩ B) > 0 for every P ∈ E;
(iii) B is bounded;
(iv) E ⊂ A(n, k) is compact, and Hs (E) > 0. Moreover, there is ε > 0 such that
for every P ∈ E,
α
H∞
(P ∩ B) ≥ ε.

***
Lemma 3.4. We can make the following further assumptions in Theorem 2.1 .
(I) For every P ∈ E, P ∩ Hi is a singleton and contained in S for all i =
0, 1, . . . , k;
(II) B ⊂ S 0 .

***
Remark 3.5. In the subsequent proofs, applications of Lemma 3.1 imply that
the sets we take µ-measure of are µ-measurable, since they are in the σ-algebra
generated by analytic sets.

Remark 3.9. As it happens often, it would be easier to prove the lower bound for
the box dimension of B. For that purpose, we would not need the previous steps,
it would be enough to estimate Ln (Bδ ) from below. To prove the lower bound for
the Hausdorff dimension, we sorted out a big enough part of B that can be covered
by balls of approximately the same radius.
