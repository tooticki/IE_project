Theorem 1. If F (x, y, . . . , w; t, r, . . . , q) is an irreducible polynomial with integral coeﬃcients in the variables
x, y, . . . , w and the parameters t, r, . . . , q, then it is always possible, and indeed in inﬁnitely many ways, to
substitute integers for the parameters t, r, . . . , q such that the polynomial F (x, y, . . . , w; t, r, . . . , q) becomes an
irreducible polynomial in the variables x, y, . . . , w alone.

Corollary 2. For every integer n (cid:62) 1 there exist inﬁnitely many polynomials p in Z[x] of degree n such that
p has the symmetric group Sn as its Galois group.

Theorem 3. If f (x, t) is an irreducible polynomial in the two variables x and t with integral coeﬃcients

f (x, t) = T xn + T1xn−1 + ··· + Tn,

(1)

where T, T1, . . . , Tn are integral polynomials in t, it is always possible, indeed in inﬁnitely many ways, to
substitute an integer for t in f (x, t) such that the polynomial f (x, t) becomes an irreducible polynomial of the
single variable x.

***
Theorem 4. Let f (x, y) ∈ Z[x, y] \ Z[y]. For an inﬁnite number of t1 ∈ Z, f (x, t1), as an element of Z[x],
is irreducible.

***
Theorem 5. Let f (x, y) ∈ Z[x, y] \ Z[y]. If there exists t0 such that for every integer t1 ≥ t0, f (x, t1) is
reducible in Z[x], then f (x, y) is reducible in Z[x, y].

Theorem 7. Let n ≥ 1. There exists q such that, for all primes p ≥ q, there exists x, y, z ∈ {1, . . . , p − 1}
such that xn + yn ≡ zn (mod p).

Theorem 8. For all k, c there is a number W = W (k, c) such that, for all c-colorings of {1, . . . , W}, there
exists a monochromatic arithmetic sequence of length k.

Lemma 11. For all m, c there is a number H such that, for all c-colorings of N+ and all intervals of length
H in N+, there is a monochromatic m-cube within the interval.

***
Lemma 12. Let H, c > 0 and let A be a subset of [1, . . . , H] such that |A| (cid:62) H/c. Then for some constant
C depending only on c, A contains an m-cube where m (cid:62) log log(H) − C.

Theorem 13. Let g(y, t) ∈ Z[y, t]\ Z[t]. If there exists t0 such that for all integers t1 (cid:62) t0, g(y, t1) is monic
and reducible in Z[y], then g(y, t) is reducible in Q[y, t].

***

Proposition 14. Theorem 13 implies Theorem 5 .

***

(a) If a monic polynomial in Z[y] factors in Q[y], then it factors in Z[y].

Lemma 15.
(b) A polynomial ψ(y) divides a polynomial f ∈ Z[x, y] if and only if, upon writing
f (x, y) = a0(y)xn + a1(y)xn−1 + ··· + an−1(y)x + an(y),

we have that ψ(y) is a factor of each aj(y).

(c) If ψ(y) is irreducible and divides f · g, where g ∈ Z[x, y] is written as

g(x, y) = b0(y)xn + b1(y)xn−1 + ··· + bn−1(y)x + bn(y),

then either ψ(y) is a factor of all ai(y) or it is a factor of all bi(y).

(d) If f (x, y) can be factored into the product of two polynomials in x whose coeﬃcients are rational
functions of y with integral coeﬃcients, i.e., belong to Q(y)[x], then it can be factored into the product
of two polynomials in Z[x, y].
