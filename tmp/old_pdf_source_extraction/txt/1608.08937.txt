functions f : [0, 1] → R then it is satisfied for all x, y ∈ R, x < y
and for each continuous and convex function f : [x, y] → R. To
see this it is enough to observe that expressions from (5 ) remain
unchanged if we replace f : [x, y] → R by ϕ : [0, 1] → R given by
ϕ(t) := f (x + t(y − x)) .

Lemma 1. (Ohlin [8]) Let X1 , X2 be two random variables such that
EX1 = EX2 and let F1 , F2 be their distribution functions. If F1 , F2
satisfy for some x0 the following inequalities
F1 (x) ≤ F2 (x) if x < x0 and F1 (x) ≥ F2 (x) if x > x0
then
(6)

Ef (X1 ) ≤ Ef (X2 )

for all continuous and convex functions f : R → R.

Remark 3. As it easy to see, if measures occurring in Ohlin lemma
are concentrated on the interval [x, y] then this lemma is an easy
consequence of Theorem 1 . However Theorem 1 is more general
for two reasons: it allows functions F1 , F2 to have more crossing points
than one and functions F1 , F2 do not have to be cumulative distribution
functions. Therefore we shall use this theorem even if functions F1 , F2
have exactly one crossing point.

a consequence of results contained in paper [1].
