Theorem A. Assume k is algebraically closed, trivially-valued, or is spherically complete of residue
characteristic zero. Let ϕ be a quasisubharmonic function on X = Ek (1). For any z ∈ X, there exists a
nonzero polynomial f ∈ k[T ] such that
lim kf k(1+)ϕ ≤ |f (z)|e−ϕ(z) .

→0+

If ϕ(z) = −∞, then we may find f such that lim→0+ kf k(1+)ϕ < +∞. Moreover, if k is algebraically closed
and z is a rigid point of X, then for any value a ∈ H(z)∗ = k ∗ , we may find f such that f (z) = a.

Theorem B. Assume k is algebraically closed, trivially-valued, or is spherically complete with residue
characteristic zero. If ϕ is a quasisubharmonic function on X with ϕ ≤ 0, then ϕ ≤ ϕm ≤ ϕ + AmX . In
particular, the sequence (ϕm )∞
m=1 converges pointwise to ϕ on {AX < +∞} ⊆ X.

***
Lemma 2.1. Assume k is trivially-valued or has residue characteristic zero. For any x ∈ X of type 2 or 3,
there exists x0 ∈ X rig such that x0 ≤ x and m(x0 ) = m(x).

***
Lemma 2.2. If {ϕi }i∈I is a net of ρ0 -subharmonic functions on X which is locally bounded above, then the usc
regularization ψ ∗ of ψ := supi∈I ϕi is ρ0 -subharmonic. Furthermore, ψ ∗ = ψ on X\{α = +∞}.

***
Example 2.3. For any irreducible f ∈ k{T }, the function ϕ := log |f | is ρ0 -subharmonic, where ρ0 = m(x) · δxG
and x ∈ X rig is the rigid point of X corresponding to the maximal ideal (f ) of k{T }. It is easy to check that
∆ϕ = m(x) (δx − δxG ) .
More generally, for any f ∈ k{T }, the function log |f | is quasisubharmonic and its Laplacian can be identified,
up to scaling and adding a multiple of δxG , with the divisor of zeros of f via the Poincaré–Lelong formula.
See [BR10, Example 5.20].
In fact, for any x ∈ X with m(x) < +∞, the function ϕ = −α(x ∨ ·) is m(x) · δxG -subharmonic with Laplacian
given by ∆ϕ = m(x) (δx − δxG ).

***
Theorem 3.1. Let ϕ be a quasisubharmonic function on X with ϕ(xG ) = 0, and let Z(ϕ) = {ϕ = −∞} denote
the polar locus of ϕ. For any z ∈ X, there exists a constant 0 > 0 and a nonzero polynomial f ∈ k[T ] such that
kf k(1+)ϕ :=

sup

|f (x)|e−(1+)ϕ(x)−A(x) ≤ |f (z)|e−ϕ(z) for all  ∈ [0, 0 ].

x∈X\Z(ϕ)

If ϕ(z) = −∞, then we may find f such that kf k(1+)ϕ < +∞ for all  ∈ [0, 0 ]. Moreover, if k is algebraically
closed and z ∈ X rig , then for any value a ∈ H(z)∗ = k ∗ , we may find f such that f (z) = a.

***
Corollary 3.2. For any z ∈ X, let c(z) be the smallest positive number such that for any quasisubharmonic
function ϕ on X, there exists a nonzero f ∈ k{T } satisfying
lim kf k(1+)ϕ ≤ c(z)|f (z)|e−ϕ(z) .

→0+

Then, c(z) = 1.

***
Definition 3.3. Let 0 > 0. A nonzero polynomial f ∈ k[T ] is a (ϕ, 0 )-extension at z if the inequality
kf k(1+)ϕ ≤ |f (z)|e−ϕ(z)
holds for all  ∈ [0, 0 ]. Equivalently, f is a (ϕ, 0 )-extension if for all x ∈ X\Z(ϕ) and all  ∈ [0, 0 ], we have
log |f (x)| − log |f (z)| ≤ A(x) + (1 + )ϕ(x) − ϕ(z).

Lemma 3.4. If mass(ρ0 ) < 1, there exists a constant 0 > 0 such that any nonzero constant function is a
(ϕ, 0 )-extension at z.

***
Lemma 3.5. Suppose that mass(ρ0 ) ≥ 1 and that there exists x ∈ Ends(Γϕ,n ) of type 1. Then, there exists
1 > 0 and a ρ-subharmonic function φ, with mass(ρ) ≤ mass(ρ0 ) − 1, such that a (ϕ, 0 )-extension f at z may
be constructed from a (φ, 1 )-extension f˜ at z.

***
Lemma 3.6. Suppose that mass(ρ0 ) ≥ 1 and that there exists x ∈ Ends(Γϕ,n ) of type 2 or of type 3 such that
rΓϕ,n (z) 6= x. Then, there exists 1 > 0 and a ρ-subharmonic function φ, with mass(ρ) ≤ mass(ρ0 ) − 1, such that
a (ϕ, 0 )-extension f at z may be constructed from a (φ, 1 )-extension f˜ at z.

***
Lemma 3.7. Suppose that mass(ρ0 ) ≥ 1 and that there exists x ∈ Ends(Γϕ,n ) of type 4 and x 6= z. Then, there
exists 1 > 0 and a ρ-subharmonic function φ, with mass(ρ) ≤ mass(ρ0 ) − 1, such that a (ϕ, 0 )-extension f at
z may be constructed from a (φ, 1 )-extension f˜ at z.

***
Lemma 3.8. Suppose mass(ρ0 ) ≥ 1 and Γ0ϕ,n = [z, xG ], then there exists 0 > 0 such that any nonzero constant
function is a (ϕ, 0 )-extension at z.

Lemma 4.1. The subset Hϕ is a principal ideal of k{T }, which is complete for the norm k · k+
ϕ . In particular,
Hϕ is a Banach k{T }-module.

***
Proposition 4.2. Let ϕ, φ be two quasisubharmonic functions on X with ϕ, φ ≤ 0. If there exist C1 , C2 > 0

is an isomorphism of Banach k{T }-modules. Moreover, if ϕ is bounded, then Hϕ = k{T }.

***
Proposition 4.3. If ϕ, φ are quasisubharmonic functions on X, then Hϕ+φ ⊆ Hϕ Hφ .

***
Definition 4.4. A quasisubharmonic function ϕ on X is said to have analytic singularities if there exists a cover
{Vi }i∈I of X by affinoid domains such that for each i ∈ I, there are analytic functions fi,1 , . . . , fi,ni ∈ OX (Vi ),
positive numbers αi,1 , . . . , αi,ni > 0, and a bounded function βi : Vi → R such that

Example 4.5. Let ϕ be a quasisubharmonic function on X with analytic singularities and suppose it admits a
decomposition ϕ = β +α log |f |, with f ∈ k{T } irreducible, α > 0, and β : X → R bounded. Then, Hϕ = (f bαc ).

***
Proposition 4.6. Let ϕ be a quasisubharmonic function on X and let m ≥ 1. The non-Archimedean Demailly
approximation ϕm is quasisubharmonic with analytic singularities.

***
Remark 4.7. It is not true in general that, if ϕ has analytic singularities, then ϕm = ϕ for all m ≥ 1. Rather,
ϕm is an “algebraic approximation” to ϕ, as the following example demonstrates. Let ϕ = α · log |f | for some
rig
is the rigid point
α > 0 and f ∈ k{T } irreducible. It is easy to verify that ϕm = bmαc
m log |f |. If x ∈ X
corresponding to the maximal ideal (f ) of k{T }, then ϕm has rational slope along the branch [x, xG ] of X;
however, this will not be the case for ϕ if α ∈ R\Q.

Example 4.8. The sequence (ϕm )∞
m=1 does not, in general, decrease monotonically in m. If ϕ =

In particular, ϕ2n = ϕ for all n ≥ 0, but the subsequence (ϕ2n+1 )n≥0 decreases monotonically to ϕ. It is not
clear whether or not the sequence ϕm admits a decreasing subsequence in general. For related results in the
complex case, see [Kim14].

***
Theorem 4.9. Assume k is algebraically closed, trivially-valued, or is spherically complete of residue
characteristic zero. Let ϕ be a quasisubharmonic function on X with ϕ ≤ 0, and let m ≥ 1. For any x ∈ X,

ϕ(x) ≤ ϕm (x) ≤ ϕ(x) + A(x).

In particular, ϕm converges pointwise to ϕ on {A < +∞} ⊆ X.

***
Remark 4.10. A quasisubharmonic function cannot, in general, be bounded pointwise below by a
quasisubharmonic function with analytic singularities. Indeed, a general quasisubharmonic function can have a
dense set of poles in X: for example, if {aj : j ≥ 0} forms a dense subset of k ◦ , set
ϕ :=

cj log |T − aj |,

for some cj > 0 satisfying j=0 cj = 1. However, a quasisubharmonic function with analytic singularities on
X must have a finite set of poles. This is analogous to the fact that a subharmonic function with analytic
singularities on the complex unit disc has a discrete set of poles.

***
Definition 4.11. Let ϕ be a quasisubharmonic function on X with ϕ ≤ 0. For any x ∈ X, the local multiplier
ideal of ϕ at x, denoted J (ϕ)x , consists of those germs f ∈ OX,x such that for all  > 0, there is an affinoid
neighborhood V of x on which f is defined such that
sup |f |e−(1+)ϕ−A < +∞.

Lemma 4.13. For x ∈ X rig , J (ϕ)x = Hϕ · OX,x .

***
Lemma 4.14. If ϕ, φ are quasisubharmonic functions on X and x ∈ X, then J (ϕ + φ)x ⊆ J (ϕ)x J (φ)x .

***
Remark 4.15. Given a quasisubharmonic function ϕ on X and x ∈ X,
S it is easy to see that ideals Hϕ and
J (ϕ)x satisfy an analogue of the openness conjecture. That is, Hϕ = >0 H(1+)ϕ and similarly for J (ϕ)x .
The openness conjecture, for a plurisubharmonic function defined on a neighborhood of the origin in Cn , has
been solved in [Ber13].
