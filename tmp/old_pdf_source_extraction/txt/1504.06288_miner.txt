Theoremq 1.1. In the context above, namely a deﬁnable graph (V, W, R) in
a saturated structure ¯M , where R(x, y) is stable, and Keisler measures µ on
V , ν on W , we have the following: Given  > 0, we can partition V into
ﬁnitely many deﬁnable sets V1, .., Vm each deﬁned by a ∆-formula, and also
partition W into ﬁnitely many W1, .., Wm each deﬁned by a ∆∗-formula, such
that for each Vi, Wj exactly one of the following holds:
(i) for all a ∈ Vi outside a set of µ measure ≤ µ(Vi), for all b ∈ Wj outside
a set of ν measure ≤ ν(Wj), we have R(a, b), AND DUALLY for all b ∈ Wj
outside a set of ν measure ≤ ν(Wj), for all a ∈ Vi outside a set of µ measure
≤ µ(Vi), we have R(a, b) holds, or
(ii) for all a ∈ Vi outside a set of µ measure ≤ µ(Vi), for all b ∈ Wj outside
a subset of ν measure ≤ ν(Wj), we have ¬R(a, b), AND DUALLY for all
b ∈ Wj outside a subset of ν measure ≤ ν(Wj), for all a ∈ Vi outside a set
of µ measure ≤ µ(Vi), ¬R(a, b).

Remark 1.2. We obtain δ-regularity for suitable δ and in a suitable sense,
of each of the (Vi, Wj, R|(Vi×Wj)) (as essentially in Claim 5.17 of [3]): Take
√
δ =
2, and suppose we are in case (i) of the conclusion of the theorem.
Suppose A ⊆ Vi is deﬁnable (not necessarily by a ∆-formula), and B ⊆ Wj is
deﬁnable (not necessarily by a ∆∗-formula), with µ(A) ≥ δµ(Vi) and ν(B) ≥
δν(Wj). Then for all a ∈ A outside a set of µ-measure ≤ δµ(A), for all
b ∈ B outside a set of ν-measure ≤ δν(B) we have R(a, b).

Remark 1.3. We also recover the regularity lemma for ﬁnite stable graphs in
the sense of [3] by considering the counting measure on pseudoﬁnite graphs.
(But without explicit bounds or equitability of the partition.)

Fact 1.4. Suppose ∆ is a ﬁnite set of stable formulas and µx is a global
Keisler measure. Then there is a small model M such that µ|∆ does not fork
over M in the sense that each ∆-formula ψ(x) of positive µ-measure does
not fork over M .

Fact 1.5. A complete ∆-type over a model M has a unique nonforking
extension to a global complete ∆-type.

Lemma 2.1. Given  > 0, we can write V as a disjoint union of ∆-formulas
(restricted to V ) over M , V = V1 ∪ ... ∪ Vm, such that for each i there is a
complete ∆-type pi over M such that µ(pi) > 0, Vi ∈ pi (or pi ⊆ Vi) and
µ(Vi \ pi) ≤ µ(Vi).

Lemma 2.2. For each i = 1, .., m and j = 1, .., n, we have (i) or (ii) of
Theorem 1.1
