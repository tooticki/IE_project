Proposition 1.1. In every finite partition A = C1 ∪. . .∪Cr of a piecewise syndetic
set A, one of the pieces Ci is piecewise syndetic.

Definition 2.1. F is a translation invariant filter (TIF for short) if F is a filter
with the additional property that if A ∈ F then also A − 1 ∈ F (and hence,
A − n ∈ F for all n ∈ N0 ).

***
Proposition 2.2. A set A is thick if and only if it belongs to a TIF F.

Proposition 2.3. Let B = {Bn | n ∈ N} be a countable algebra of sets.
(1) Given a family G ⊆ B with the FIP, define G0 = G; Gn+1 = Gn ∪ {Bn }
in case
S Bn ∩ A 6= ∅ for every A ∈ Gn ; and Gn+1 = Gn otherwise. Then
U := n Gn is an ultrafilter that extends G.
(2) Given a family G ⊆ B with the FIP and such that A ∈ G ⇒ A − 1 ∈ G,
define G0 = G; Gn+1 = Gn ∪ {Bn − k | k ∈ NS
0 } in case that union has the
FIP; and Gn+1 = Gn otherwise. Then M := n Gn is a maximal TIF that
extends G.

Proposition 2.4. Let U be an ultrafilter that includes a maximal TIF M. Then:
(1) Every B ∈ U is piecewise syndetic.
(2) For every B ∈ U, the set BU := {n ∈ N | B − n ∈ U} is syndetic.2

Theorem 3.1. Let A be a piecewise syndetic set. Then for every k ∈ N, the set
APk (A) := {x ∈ A | ∃y ∈ N s.t. x + iy ∈ A for i = 1, . . . , k} is piecewise syndetic.

***
Corollary 3.2. In every finite partition N = C1 ∪ . . . ∪ Cr there exists a piece
C = Ci such that, for every k ∈ N, the set APk (C) is piecewise syndetic.

Proposition 4.1. Let B = P(N) be the full algebra of all subsets of N. If F is a
TIF then C(F) is a closed left ideal of (βN, ⊕); and conversely, if L is a left ideal of
(βN, ⊕) then F(L) is a TIF. Moreover, M is a maximal TIF if and only if C(M)
is a minimal left ideal of (βN, ⊕); and L is a minimal left ideal of (βN, ⊕) if and
only if F(L) is a maximal TIF.

***
Corollary 4.2. Let B = P(N) be the full algebra of all subsets of N. An ultrafilter
U includes a maximal TIF if and only if U belongs to the smallest ideal K(βN, ⊕).

***
Remark 4.3. One can generalize the contents of this paper from the natural numbers
to arbitrary countable semigroups (S, ·). Indeed, the notion of translation invariant
filter also makes sense in that more general framework.5 Precisely, if B is an algebra
of subsets of S, one defines a TIF on B as a filter F with the additional property
that A ∈ F ⇒ s−1 A := {t ∈ S | s · t ∈ A} ∈ F for every s ∈ S. Then, by the same
arguments as used in this paper, one can prove that Theorem 3.1 holds, provided
one adopts a suitable generalization of the notion of piecewise syndetic set.6
