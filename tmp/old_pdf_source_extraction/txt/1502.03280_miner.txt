Proposition 3. Any pre-Lie algebra a, with the weight grading condition (??), satisﬁes:

erλ(a) = a (cid:125) eλ ,

for any a, λ ∈ A, with λ having trivial weight zero component and where the operator rλ(a) := a (cid:63) λ

Theorem 2. Under the pre-Lie exponential map, the gauge group is isomorphic to the group made up of
group-like elements equipped with the circle product:

Γ = (g0, BCH, 0) ∼= (G, (cid:125), 1) = G .

Proposition 5. Under the abovementioned weight grading assumption, the inﬁnitesimal Lie algebra g0
action deﬁned in Section ?? integrates to t = 1 and is equal to the following action of the gauge group on
the variety of Maurer–Cartan elements :

λ.α = eadλ(α) =(cid:0)eλ (cid:63) α(cid:1) (cid:125) e−λ .

Lemma 2. In the pre-Lie algebra aP,V the circle product of two maps f, g such that f (I) = g(I) = idV is
equal to

f (cid:125) g : P¡ ∆−→ P¡ ◦ P¡ f◦g−−→ EndV ◦ EndV

γ−→ EndV .

***
NOTATION. We will still denote by f (cid:125) g the operation in the convolution pre-Lie algebra aP,V deﬁned
by the composite γ(f ◦ g)∆, for any f, g, even when their ﬁrst component is not the identity. This
generalization of the product (cid:125) satisﬁes the same properties, like the associativity relation for instance.

Theorem 3. For any Koszul operad P and for any chain complex (V, d), the group of ∞-isotopies is
isomorphic to the gauge group under the preLie exponential map

Γ = (g0, BCH, 0) ∼= (∞-iso, (cid:125), idV ) .

The Deligne groupoid is isomorphic to the groupoid whose objects are homotopy P-algebras and whose
morphisms are ∞-isotopies

Deligne(gP,V ) = (MC(gP,V ), Γ) ∼= (P∞-Alg,∞-iso) .

(cid:5) This gauge equivalence ﬁrst appeared in the paper [Kad88] of T. Kadeshvili for the Koszul operad
encoding associative algebras.
(cid:5) The results of Theorem 3 give a conceptual framework to state in full generality the theory of
Koszul hierarchy developed by M. Markl in [Mar15, Mar14] for the operads As and Lie. Let P
be a Koszul operad, let µ : P ! → EndA be an algebra structure over the Koszul dual operad, and
let ∆ be an degree 1 square-zero operator on A. We work here with the cohomological degree
convention and s denotes an element of degree 1. Any basis of the Koszul dual operad P ! gives
rise to a gauge group element deﬁned by the composite

µ⊗id−−−→ EndA ⊗ EndKs

∼= EndsA .

***
REMARKS.

Φ : P¡ ∼= P !∗ ⊗ EndKs → P ! ⊗ EndKs

Therefore, the gauge action of Φ on the trivial P∞-algebra structure αtr = (sA, ∆) produces a
P∞-algebra structure (Φ−1 (cid:63) αtr) (cid:125) Φ on the suspended chain complex sA. This construction
answers the question raised in Section 2.6 of [Mar15]. For the operad P = Lie of Lie algebras,
its Koszul dual is the operad P ! = Com of commutative algebras. Using the canonical basis
of this one-dimensional S-module in any arity, one recovers the Koszul hierarchy [Kos85] of a
commutative algebra, which forms an L∞-algebra, cf. [Mar15, Example 2.8]. In the same way,
the nonsymmetric operad As of associative algebras is Koszul auto-dual As! = As and one-
dimensional in each arity. Using its canonical basis, one recovers the B¨orjeson hierarchy [B¨o13]
of an associative algebra, which forms an A∞-algebra, cf. [Mar15, Example 2.4]. Our results also
explain why these new structures are homotopy trivial, that is they produce trivial structures on the
cohomology level H•(sA, ∆), see Theorem 4 .

Corollary 2. The Deligne groupoid is isomorphic to the groupoid

Deligne(gP,V ) ∼= (Homdg Op(ΩP¡, EndV ),∼h) ,

whose objects are morphisms of dg operads and whose morphisms are the homotopy equivalences.

***
REMARKS.

(cid:5) In [DR12], V. Dolgushev and C. Rogers almost proved this result: they consider a path object type
construction of dg operads but without proving the model category property. Then, they prove that
the associated “homotopy equivalence” is equivalent to the gauge equivalence (Theorem 5.6).
(cid:5) Using other methods (coming from derived algebraic geometry), S. Yalin recently and

independently proved a higher (simplicial) version of this result in [Yal14].

They also coincide with what can be extracted from the recursive formulas of [Ber14].

(cid:5) These formulas for β, i∞, and p∞ are the same as the ones given explicitly in [LV12, Chapter 10].
(cid:5) The next step would be to deﬁne a degree 1 element h∞ ∈ a, which extends the homotopy h.
Following the same ideas, one can consider h∞ := h Ψ, which is easily seen to satisfy the side
conditions h∞ (cid:125) h∞ = 0, p∞ (cid:125) h∞ = 0, and h∞ (cid:125) i∞ = 0. But the homotopy relation between
h∞, i∞ (cid:125) p∞, and idV is more subtle and surely deserves more study.
