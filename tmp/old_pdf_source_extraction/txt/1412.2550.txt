Remark 2.1 The statement of the original version of this lemma in Kato
[6] is simply that T < âˆž without (2.2 ), but there is no restriction on F (0).
The first paper to put an additional assumption (2.2 ) and to get a sharp
blow-up result of solutions of semilinear wave equations for n â‰¥ 2 is Glassey
[3] in two space dimensions. See also Lemma 4 in Sideris [11] for other
dimensions.

Lemma 2.2 Assume that (2.4 ) is replaced by
F (0) > 0, F 0 (0) = 0

(2.8)

and additionally that there is a time t0 > 0 such that
F (t0 ) â‰¥ 2F (0).

(2.9)

Then, the conclusion of Lemma 2.1 is changed to that there exists a positive
constant C0 = C0 (p, a, q, B) such that
T < 22/M T2

(2.10)

T2 := max {T0 , t0 , R} â‰¥ C0 Aâˆ’(pâˆ’1)/(2M ) .

***
Remark 2.2 The statement of the original version of this lemma in Kato
[6] is simply that T < âˆž without (2.2 ), but the assumption on the data is
only F (0) 6= 0 and there is no restriction such as (2.9 ).

Theorem 3.1 Let 1 < p < p0 (n) for n â‰¥ 2. Assume that both f âˆˆ H 1 (Rn )
and g âˆˆ L2 (Rn ) are non-negative and have compact support, and that g
does not vanish identically. Suppose that the problem (??) has a solution
(u, ut ) âˆˆ C([0, T (Îµ)), H 1 (Rn ) Ã— L2 (Rn )) with
supp(u, ut ) âŠ‚ {(x, t) âˆˆ Rn Ã— [0, âˆž) : |x| â‰¤ t + R}.

(3.1)

Then, there exists a positive constant Îµ0 = Îµ0 (f, g, n, p, R) such that T (Îµ) has
to satisfy
T (Îµ) â‰¤ CÎµâˆ’2p(pâˆ’1)/Î³(p,n)
(3.2)
for 0 < Îµ â‰¤ Îµ0 , where C is a positive constant independent of Îµ.

***
Remark 3.1 In view of (??), (3.2 ) is not optimal for n = 2 and 1 < p â‰¤ 2.
In Section ?? and ??, by improving estimate (3.5 ), optimal estimates for
the upper bound for the lifespan are obtained for n = 2 and n = 1.

***
Proposition 3.1 Suppose that the assumption in Theorem 3.1 is fulfilled.
Then,
there exists a positive constant C1 = C1 (f, g, n, p, R) such that F (t) =
Z
u(x, t)dx satisfies
Rn

F 00 (t) â‰¥ C1 Îµp t(nâˆ’1)(1âˆ’p/2)

for t â‰¥ R.

(3.5)

This estimate is valid also for the case where f (x) â‰¥ 0(6â‰¡ 0) and g(x) â‰¡ 0.

***
Remark 3.2 This is a slightly modified estimate of (2.5â€™) in Yordanov and
Zhang [14] in which C1 = 0 when f (x) â‰¡ 0.

***
Theorem 3.2 Let 1 < p < p0 (n) for n â‰¥ 2. Assume that f âˆˆ H 1 (Rn )
is non-negative, does not vanish identically and g â‰¡ 0. Suppose that the
problem (??) has a solution (u, ut ) âˆˆ C([0, T (Îµ)), H 1 (Rn ) Ã— L2 (Rn )) with
(3.1 ). Then, there exists a positive constant Îµ1 = Îµ1 (f, n, p, R) such that
T (Îµ) has to satisfy
T (Îµ) â‰¤ CÎµâˆ’2p(pâˆ’1)/Î³(p,n)
(3.9)
for 0 < Îµ â‰¤ Îµ1 , where C is a positive constant independent of Îµ.

***
Remark 3.3 We have no new estimate for high dimensional case in this
theorem, but it especially covers the optimality on n = 2 and p = 2. See
(??).

Theorem 4.1 Let n = 2, 1 < p â‰¤ 2 and f â‰¡ 0. Assume that g âˆˆ C 1 (R2 ) is
non-negative, does not vanish identically, and has compact support as supp
g âŠ‚ {x âˆˆ R2 : |x| â‰¤ R}. Suppose that the integral equation associated with
the problem (??) has a solution u âˆˆ C 1 (R2 Ã— [0, T (Îµ))) with supp u(x, t) âŠ‚
{(x, t) âˆˆ R2 Ã— [0, âˆž) : |x| â‰¤ t + R}. Then, there exists a positive constant
Îµ2 = Îµ2 (g, p, R) such that T (Îµ) has to satisfy

Ca(Îµ)
when p = 2,
(4.1)
T (Îµ) â‰¤
CÎµâˆ’(pâˆ’1)/(3âˆ’p) when 1 < p < 2
for 0 < Îµ â‰¤ Îµ2 , where a(Îµ) is defined in (??) and C is a positive constant
independent of Îµ.

***
Remark 4.1 (4.1 ) is a weaker result than (??) in the sense that the
constant C is not of the optimal choice and that the assumption on the data
is stronger than Lindblad [8]. Moreover, we note that the optimality of (4.1
) for 1 < p < 2 is still open, but may true. Because
1
2p
<
3âˆ’p
Î³(p, 2)
is equivalent to 1 < p < 2. But it is out of the main purpose of this paper.
So we shall have another opportunity to study this part.

Theorem 5.1 Let p > 1 for n = 1. Assume that both f âˆˆ C 2 (R) and
g âˆˆ C 1 (R) have compact support as supp (f, g) âŠ‚ {x âˆˆ R : |x| â‰¤ R}.
Suppose that the problem (??) has a solution u âˆˆ C 2 (R Ã— [0, T (Îµ))) Then,
there exists a positive constant Îµ3 = Îµ3 (f, g, p, R) such that T (Îµ) has to satisfy
Z
âˆ’(pâˆ’1)/2
g(x)dx > 0,
T (Îµ) â‰¤ CÎµ

R
T (Îµ) â‰¤ CÎµâˆ’p(pâˆ’1)/(p+1) if f â‰¥ 0(6â‰¡ 0), g â‰¡ 0
for 0 < Îµ â‰¤ Îµ3 , where C is a positive constant independent of Îµ.

***
Remark 5.1 The assumption of this theorem is stronger than Zhou [15].
But for the sake of completeness of applications of our lemma, we shall prove
it here.
