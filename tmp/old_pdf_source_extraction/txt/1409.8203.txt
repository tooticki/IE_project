Theorem 1.1. There exists a continuous, surjective algebra homomorphism ϕ from a unital
Banach algebra A onto B(ER ), where ER denotes the above-mentioned Banach space of Read,
such that the extension
ϕ /
/ ker ϕ
/A
/ {0}
B(ER )
{0}
is singular and splits algebraically, but it is not admissible, and so it does not split strongly.

Theorem 1.2. There exist a one-dimensional Banach B(ER )-bimodule X and a linear injection from the Banach algebra B(`2 (N)) of bounded operators on the Hilbert space `2 (N)
into the second continuous Hochschild cohomology group of B(ER ) with coefficients in X.
Hence B(ER ) has homological bidimension at least two.

(ii) Suppose that (2.5) splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible). Then
(2.6) splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible) if and only if (2.4)
splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible).

Remark 2.3. There is an underlying connection between Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 . To explain
it, consider two extensions (2.4) and (2.5) of a Banach algebra C , where the former extension
is singular and admissible, but does not split strongly, while the latter splits strongly. Then, by
Proposition 2.2 , we obtain a singular, admissible extension (2.6) of the Banach algebra B, and
this extension does not split strongly. Hence a classical result of Johnson (see [6, Theorem 2.1],
or [3, Corollary I.1.11] for an exposition) implies that ker δ is a Banach B-bimodule and
H 2 (B, ker δ) is non-zero, so that B has homological bidimension at least two.
To apply this result to B = B(ER ), we take C = `2 (N)∼ and β = ψ as in the proof
of Theorem 1.1 , so that we have an extension of the form (2.5) which splits strongly by
Theorem 2.1 . Choose U ∈ B(`2 (N)) with kU k 6 1, and turn the vector space K ⊕ `2 (N) into
a Banach algebra by endowing it with the product and the norm
(λ, x)(µ, y) = (hU x, yi, 0)

and

k(λ, x)k = |λ| + kxk

(x, y ∈ `2 (N), λ, µ ∈ K).

Denote by A the unitization of this Banach algebra, and let α : A → C be the natural unital
projection. Then α is a continuous, surjective algebra homomorphism, and we have a singular,
admissible extension of the form (2.4), which can be shown to split algebraically if and only if
it splits strongly, if and only if U = 0. Thus, choosing U non-zero, we conclude that B(ER )
has homological bidimension at least two.
A similar argument shows that B(EDLW ) has homological bidimension at least two, where
EDLW denotes the Banach space of Dales, Loy, and Willis studied in [2]. To see this, take
B = B(EDLW ) and C = `∞ (Z), and apply [1, Theorem 3.11(i)] to obtain a singular, admissible
extension of `∞ (Z) which does not split strongly.
