(1.1) Theorem. Let Q be the power series algebra in three variables over a field.
For every r ≥ 3 there is quotient ring of Q that is of class G(r) and not Gorenstein.

(2.1) . [Classification] Let Q be as above, and let a ⊆ n2 be an ideal such that
R = Q/a has projective dimension 3 as a Q-module. The possible multiplicative
structures on the graded-commutative k-algebra A = H(K R ) ∼
= TorQ
∗ (R, k) were
identified in [3]. By assumption one has A≥4 = 0, and the possible structures are
described by the invariants
δ

p = rankk (A1 · A1 ) , q = rankk (A1 · A2 ) , and r = rankk (A2 −→ Homk (A1 , A3 )) .
From [1, thm. 3.1] one extracts the following description of all the possible classes
of rings that are not Gorenstein.

(2.2) Proposition. Let (Q, n) be a regular local ring and let a ⊆ n2 be a perfect
ideal of grade 3 that is minimally generated by 5 elements and not Gorenstein. If,
with the notation above, the ring Q/a has p = 0, then it has r ≤ 1.

(2.3) Lemma. Let (Q, n) be a regular local ring and consider an n-primary ideal
g ⊆ n2 , minimally generated by elements g0 , . . . , gk . Let s1 , . . . , st be elements of Q
whose classes in Q/g form a basis for the socle. The ideal a = ng0 + (g1 , . . . , gk ) is
n-primary, and if nsi ⊆ a holds for all i = 1, . . . , t, then the classes of g0 , s1 , . . . , st
in Q/a form a basis for the socle; in particular one has type(Q/a) = type(Q/g) + 1.

(2.4) Theorem. Let (Q, n) be a regular local ring of dimension 3 and let g ⊆ n2 be
an n-primary Gorenstein ideal minimally generated by elements g0 , . . . , g2m . The
ideal a = ng0 + (g1 , . . . , g2m ) is n-primary, one has type(Q/a) = 2 and:
(a) If m = 1, then µ(a) = 5 and Q/a is of class B.
(b) If m = 2, then one of the following holds:
• µ(a) = 4 and Q/a is of class H(3, 2).
• µ(a) = 5 and Q/a is of class B.
• µ(a) ∈ {6, 7} and Q/a is of class G(r) with µ(a) − 2 ≥ r ≥ µ(a) − 3.
(c) If m ≥ 3, then Q/a is of class G(r) with µ(a) − 2 ≥ r ≥ µ(a) − 3.

The sub-maximal Pfaffians of Vm are determined (up to a sign) by minors,

(3.4) Adopt the notation from (3.1 ). By Proposition (3.3 ) one has
g2 = (x2 , xz, xy − z 2 , yz, y 2 ) .
Trimming the generators xz and yz one gets the following ideals of Q,
(x, y, z)xz + (x2 , xy − z 2 , yz, y 2 ) = (x2 , xy − z 2 , yz, y 2 )

and

(x, y, z)yz + (x , xz, xy − z , y ) = (x , xz, xy − z , y ) .
They are both minimally generated by 4 elements, so they define quotient rings of
class H(3, 2); see Theorem (2.4 )(b). Moreover, one has
(x, y, z)x2 + (xz, xy − z 2 , yz, y 2 ) = (x3 , xz, xy − z 2 , yz, y 2 ) ,
(x, y, z)y 2 + (x2 , xz, xy − z 2 , yz) = (x2 , xz, xy − z 2 , yz, y 3 ) ,

(x, y, z)(xy − z ) + (x , xz, yz, y ) = (x , xz, z , yz, y ) ,
so by Theorem (2.4 )(b) these ideals define rings of class B.

(3.5) Proposition. Adopt the notation from (3.1 ) and let n denote the maximal
ideal of Q. Let g be one of the generators of gm listed in (3.3 ), let b be the ideal
generated by the remaining 2m generators of gm , and set a = ng + b. For m ≥ 3
the ring R = Q/a has the following properties.
(a) R is an artinian local ring of type 2 with socle generated by the classes of the
elements g and xm−1 y m−1 .
(b) If g is xm−i di or y m−i di for some i ∈ {1, . . . , m − 1}, then a is minimally
generated by 2m elements and R is of class G(2m − 3).
(c) If g is xm , y m , or dm , then a is minimally generated by 2m + 1 elements and
R is of class G(2m − 2).
