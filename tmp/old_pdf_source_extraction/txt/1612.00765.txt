Theorem 1. Let k > 4 be even, p a prime, and ε ∈ {±1}. Let ` be a prime with ` > k + 1,

`(pk/2 + ε)(pk/2−1 + ε) and ` (pk/2 + ε).
k
If ` - (pk/2 + ε), assume also that ` - Bn Bk−n (pn−1 − 1) for some even n, 0 < n < k. Then
there exists a prime ideal I of residue characteristic `, in the ring of integers generated by

Theorem 2. Let k > 4 be even, let N = M p with p prime, p - M , and ε ∈ {±1}. Let
g ∈ Sk (M ) be a newform with eigenvalue λp under Tp . Assume there is a prime ` > k + 1,
` - N , and a prime ideal I above it in the field generated by the eigenvalues of all Hecke
(ε)
eigenforms in Sk (N ) such that
λp ≡ −εpk/2−1 (p + 1)

(mod I).

Assume also that either
(1.6)

` - (pk/2−1 + ε) · Den P + (g),

or k > 6 and ` - (pk/2−2 + ε) · Den P − (g).

Then there exists a Hecke eigenform f ∈ Sk (N ) which is new at p such that
f ≡ gp(ε)

(mod I).

Theorem 3. Let w > 0 be even, and let N = pM with p prime, p - M . Assume that

Ww (N )p−new

Conjecture. Assume N = M N 0 square-free and k > 4, and let g ∈ Mk (M ) be a newform
of level M , with Hecke eigenvalues λp for p|N 0 . Let ε : D(N 0 ) → {±1} be a system of
Atkin-Lehner eigenvalues as above, and assume that for all p|N 0 we have
λp ≡ −ε(p)pk/2−1 (p + 1)

(mod I) ,

for I a prime ideal of residue characteristic ` in the field generated by the Hecke eigenvalues
(ε)
of all newforms in Sk (N ), such that ` > k − 2, ` - 6N . If M = 1 and g = Ek also assume
(ε)
that ` divides the numerator of (??). Then there exists a newform f ∈ Sk (N ) such that
(ε)

f ≡ gN 0

(mod I).

Remark 2.1. The space Ww (N )/R is isomorphic to the space SymbΓ0 (N ) Vw (R) of modular
symbols introduced by Ash and Stevens in [2], and by [2, Prop. 4.2] we have a Heckeequivariant isomorphism
(2.1)

Ww (N )/R ' Hc1 (Γ0 (N ), Vw (R)).

The compactly supported cohomology group is that of the local system associated to Vw (R)
on the modular surface Γ\H, with H the upper half-plane.
The module Vw (N )/R is simply the induced module IndΓΓ1 Vw (R), so, via Shapiro’s lemma,
another way to interpret the isomorphism (2.1) is:
Ww (N )/R ' Hc1 (Γ1 , Vw (N )/R ).
Since Γ1 has only one cusp fixed by T = U S , the latter cohomology group can be identified
with the set of Γ1 -cocycles which are 0 on T as in [15], and the isomorphism takes a
polynomial P to the cocyle ϕ with ϕ(T ) = 0, ϕ(T ) = P . See also [27, Sec. 2] and [28, Sec.
2.2].
We will use the isomorphism (2.1) in Section ??. We conclude that the combinatorial
description of Ww (N )/R that we use throughout Section ?? gives us a way of studying
“Eisenstein classes” in the compactly supported cohomology of the modular surface.

Lemma 2.2. (i) We have a bijection Γ\Γ1 → Γ1 \Γ1 σN Γ1 , given for A ∈ Γ\Γ1 by
A 7→ KA := Γ1 σN A.
(ii) We have KA = Γ1 ΘN A.

Lemma 2.3. Let P ∈ Vw (N ) and TeN ∈ RN . Then
(KA )

P |Θ TeN (A) = P |Θ TeN

for A ∈ Γ\Γ1 , where KA ∈ Γ1 \MN is the coset defined in Lemma 2.2 .

Example 2.4. For the identity coset I, we have KI = Γ1 σN and we can take

TeN I = ( N0 01 ) .

Proposition 2.5. Let w > 2 be even, and let P0 = 1|(1 − S) ∈ Ww (N ). For every TeN
satisfying (??) we have
P0 |Θ TeN (A) = Nzw − Ntw X w
where A = Γ ( z∗ ∗t ) and for a ∈ Z we let Na = N/(N, a).

***
Remark 2.8. For w = 0 and N square-free the map ρb− is still an isomorphism, but ρb+ is
not unless N is prime [27, Prop. 8.4]. This is one of the reasons the weight 2 case is more
delicate, and we avoid it in this paper.

Remark 3.1. We found numerically that the extra assumption ` - Bn Bk−n (pn−1 − 1) in
Theorem 1 is not needed for weights k 6 6 · 104 , by considering n = 2 and n = 4.
More precisely, assume ` - pk/2 +ε. It follows from (1.4) that `|pk/2−1 +ε, `|Bk , and ` - p−1,
so the assumption is satisfied for n = 2, unless `|Bk−2 . For k 6 6 · 104 there are only two
pairs (k, `) with k even and ` > k − 2 prime, such that ` divides the numerator of both Bk
and Bk−2 , namely (92, 587) and (338, 491).4 Note that in both cases 3 - ` − 1, and since
`|p`−1 − 1 it follows that ` - p3 − 1 (otherwise we would have `|p − 1, contradicting the
assumption). It follows that ` - B4 Bk−4 (p3 − 1) for those two values of k, so the assumption
is satisfied for n = 4.
Note that the same assumption, without the factor pn−1 − 1, appears in Haberland’s proof
of the Ramanujan congruence (??) [15, Sec. 5.2]. There the assumption guarantees the
nonvanishing of the reduction mod ` of an Eisenstein cocycle in H 1 (Γ1 , Vw (R)) associated
to ρb− (Ek ).

Lemma 4.1. Assume that the Γ1 -module V is defined over a field F of characteristic
char(F ) 6= 2, 3. We have
dim H 1 (Γ1 , V ) = dim V − dim H 0 (G2 , V ) − dim H 0 (G3 , V ) + dim H 0 (Γ1 , V ).

***
Proposition 4.2. Let w > 0 be even. If the residue field F has characteristic ` > w,
` 6= 2, 3, then the reduction map Ww (N )/R → Ww (N )/F is surjective.

***
Proposition 4.3. Let R be a discrete valuation ring with residue field F of characteristic `.
Let w > 0 be even, let N = M p with p prime, p - M , and assume that ` > w, ` - 6. The
following are equivalent:
(i) The reduction map Ww (N )p−new
→ Ww (N )p−new
is surjective.

/F

(ii) The map β : Ww (N )/F → Ww (M )/F is surjective.
(iii) The map α given by (??) is injective.

***
Lemma 4.4. Let w > 0, and consider the SL2 (Z)-module Vw (F ), with F a field of
characteristic ` > w + 1. Let u = ( 10 a1 ) ∈ SL2 (Z) with ` - a. We have:
(i) Im(1 − u) = Vw−1 (F ) (setting V−1 (F ) = {0}), and Ker(1 − u) = V0 (F );
(ii) Ker(N ) = Vw (F ), where N := 1 + u + . . . + u`−1 ∈ Z[SL2 (Z)] acts by linearity on Vw (F ).

***
Remark 4.5. For ` = w + 1, part (ii) in the lemma is no longer true (from the proof we see
that Ker(N ) = Vw−1 (F ), Im(N ) = V0 (F ) in this case). For this reason, the case ` = w + 1
is not included in the next proposition and in Theorem 3 .

***
Proposition 4.6. Let w > 0 be even, let p - M be prime and let V = Vw (F ) with F a field
of characteristic ` > w + 3. Assume ` - pM , and if w = 0 assume also that ` - ϕ(M ). Then
the restriction map
α : H 1 (Γ0 (M ), V ) ⊕ H 1 (Γ0 (M )0 , V ) → H 1 (Γ0 (M p), V )
is injective (if ` = w + 3 > 3, its kernel is one-dimensional).

***
Proposition 4.7. Let w > 0 be even, and let F be a field of characteristic ` > w, ` > 3.
Then the cohomology group H 1 (SL2 (F` ), Vw (F )) vanishes, unless ` = w + 3 when it is onedimensional.

***
Example 5.1. We expect Theorem 1 to hold for ` = k + 1 as well, and we verified the
congruence in many such cases. For example, let p = 19, k = 6, ` = k + 1 = 7. Although
` = k + 1 divides once the denominator of Bk (which always holds when k + 1 is prime
by the von Staudt-Clausen Theorem), we have `3 |pk/2 + 1, so ` divides the numerator of
(+1)
(+1)
Bk
k/2
+ 1). We find a congruence modulo ` between Ek,p and the newform f ∈ Sk (p)
2k (p
with q-expansion:
f = q − 2q 2 − q 3 − 28q 4 − 24q 5 + 2q 6 − 167q 7 + . . . − 361q 19 + . . . .
Note that in order to prove this congruence, and the ones below, it is enough to check that
it holds for coefficients of prime index up to the Sturm bound k(p + 1)/12.

***
Example 5.2. One may ask whether the congruence in Theorem 1 comes from a congruence
(ε)
between the period polynomials P + (f ) and P + (Ek,p ) of the forms in the theorem (both
normalized to have constant term 1 at the identity coset). Such a congruence would imply
the congruence of Hecke eigenvalues, and for level 1 it was shown to hold by Manin [24] in
the cases when Sk (1) is one dimensional. In higher level, this congruence often holds (see
the next example), but the following example shows that it can also fail. For p = 5, k = 40,
(ε)
` = 71, ε = −1, we have `|pk/2 + ε and the congruence (1.5) holds for some f ∈ Sk (p), but

(ε)
P + (f )(I) 6≡ P + Ek,p (I) (mod I). This illustrates the fact that the Deligne-Serre lifting
lemma guarantees the lift of systems of eigenvalues, but not of eigenvectors.

***
Example 5.3. Let M = 7, k = 6, and let g ∈ Sk (M ) be the newform
g = q − 10q 2 − 14q 3 + 68q 4 − 56q 5 + 140q 6 − 49q 7 + . . . + 1824q 23 + . . . .
The cosets A = Γ0 (M ) ( x∗ y∗ ) can be identified with points (x : y) ∈ P1 (Z/M Z), and setting
P = P + (g), we can use the relations P |δ = P , P |S = −P to express all 8 components of P
in terms of
129 2

X − 86X + 6,

Since 43 divides all the coefficients except for those of X and X , this illustrates the
(+1) 
previous comment, namely we have P + (g) ≡ P + Ek,M (mod 43). This implies directly
(+1)

that g ≡ Ek,M (mod 43), and indeed we have 43|73 + 1, so the congruence follows from
Theorem 1 .
To apply Theorem 2 , we note that Den P + (g) = 2 in (1.6), so this condition poses no
restriction. Taking p = 2, we find 11|λp − pk/2−1 (p + 1), and since 11 - pk/2−1 − 1 = 3 we
(−1)
deduce from Theorem 2 that there exists a congruence between gp
and a Hecke eigenform
f ∈ S6 (14) which is 2-new and has eigenvalue −1 for W2 . In fact, we find a newform f of
level 14 (as predicted by the conjecture in the introduction) with q-expansion
f = q + 4q 2 + 8q 3 + 16q 4 + 10q 5 + 32q 6 − 49q 7 + . . . + 2000q 23 + . . . .
