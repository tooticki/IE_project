Deﬁnition 1.1. A smooth Fano variety X is k-Fano if the sth Chern character chs(X) is
positive (see Deﬁnition 2.3 ) for 1 ≤ s ≤ k, and weak k-Fano for k > 1 if X is (k−1)-Fano
and chk(X) is nef.

***
Conjecture 1.2. If X is k-Fano, then Eﬀ k(X) is a polyhedral cone.

***
Theorem 1.3. Let X be a n-dimensional 2-Fano variety with iX ≥ n− 2. Then Eﬀ 2(X)
is polyhedral. Also, Eﬀ 3(X) is polyhedral with the possible exception of the complete
intersection of type (2, 2) in P8.
In particular, Conjecture 1.2 is true for any n-dimensional k-Fano variety with iX ≥ n−2
and k = 2, 3.

***
Theorem 1.4. Let Y = G(2, 5) or G(2, 6), let X be a smooth complete intersection of
type (1, 1) in Y under the Plücker embedding. Then X is not weak 2-Fano.

– Zk(X) is the group of k-cycles with integer coeﬃcients.
– Ratk(X) is the group of k-cycles rationally equivalent to zero.
– Ak(X) is the Chow group of k-cycles on X, that is Ak(X) = Zk(X)/Ratk(X).

Notation.
– X is a variety of dimension n ≥ 4.
– k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.
– Hi(X, G) and H i(X, G) are the singular homology and cohomology groups of X for
1 ≤ i ≤ 2n and coeﬃcients in a group G.
– bi(X) is the ith Betti number of X for 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n, that is the rank of Hi(X, Z) or of
H i(X, Z).

– Algk(X) is the group of k-cycles algebraically equivalent to zero.
– Homk(X) is the group of k-cycles homologically equivalent to zero, that is the kernel

of the cycle map cl : Zk(X) → H2k(X, Z).
– Numk(X) is the group of cycles numerically equivalent to zero, that is the group of
cycles α ∈ Zk(X) such that P · cl(α) = 0 for all polynomials P in Chern classes of
vector bundles on X.

– Nk(X) is the quotient group Zk(X)/Numk(X), and Nk(X)R := Nk(X) ⊗ R.
– Eﬀ k(X) ⊆ Nk(X)R is the cone generated by numerical classes of eﬀective k-cycles.
– Let s ≥ 1 be an integer. The sth Chern character of X, chs(X), is the homogeneous
part of degree s of the total Chern character of X. For example, if ci(X) are the
1(X) − 2c2(X)), ch3(X) =
Chern classes of X, then ch1(X) = c1(X), ch2(X) = 1

Remark 2.1. There is a chain of inclusions [Ful84, p.374]

Remark 2.2. By linearity of the intersection product, Nk(X) is torsion free. When X is
smooth, the intersection product gives a perfect pairing [Ful84, Deﬁnition 19.1]

Nk(X)R ⊗ Nn−k(X)R → R.

***
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let X be a smooth variety. A class α ∈ Nk(X)R is positive if α · β > 0
for every β ∈ Eﬀ n−k(X)\{0}, and it is nef if α · β ≥ 0 for every β ∈ Eﬀ n−k(X). The
cone generated by nef classes of k-cycles is Nef k(X).

***
Lemma 2.4. Let X be a projective variety. Then

(1) If either rkAk(X) = 1 or b2k(X) = 1, then Eﬀ k(X) is a half-line.
(2) If either rkAk(X) = 2 or b2k(X) = 2, then Eﬀ k(X) is either a half-line or it is

spanned by two extremal rays.

***
Remark 2.5. In a general, a variety X with chk(X) positive may not be k-Fano. For
example, in [Mum79] Mumford found a smooth surface S of general type with ch2(S) = 3
2.

***
Proposition 3.1. Let X be a n-dimensional smooth complete intersection in a weighted
projective space. If k (cid:54)= n

2 then b2k(X) = 1. In particular Eﬀ k(X) is polyhedral.

***
Theorem 3.2. Let X be a n-dimensional weak k-Fano complete intersection in a
projective space. If 1 ≤ s ≤ k, then b2s(X) ≤ 2. In particular Eﬀ s(X) is polyhedral.

***
Proposition 3.3. Let X be a smooth n-dimensional variety and let G be an aﬃne group
which acts transitively on X. Suppose that, for every k = 1, ..., n− 1, there exists a ﬁnite
family of subvarieties {Ωa}a∈Ik

of dimension k such that

(1) (cid:104){[Ωa] /a ∈ Ik}(cid:105) = H2k(X, Z) or Ak(X), and
(2) ∀a ∈ Ik,∃b ∈ In−k such that Ωc · Ωb = δa,c ∀c ∈ Ik.

Then Nef k(X) = Eﬀ k(X) = Eﬀ k(X) is polyhedral and simplicial.

***
Proposition 3.4. Let X be a rational homogeneous variety. Then Nef k(X) = Eﬀ k(X) =
Eﬀ k(X) is polyhedral.

***
Deﬁnition 3.5. Let r, s be two integers such that 2 ≤ r ≤ s
2. The Grassmann variety
of r-planes G(r, s) is the scheme of r-dimensional subspaces of Cs. Let ω be a non-
degenerate symmetric bilinear form on Cs. The orthogonal Grassmannian of isotropic
r-planes OG(r, s) is the scheme of r-dimensional subspaces of Cs isotropic with respect
to ω. The scheme OG(r, 2m) has two isomorphic connected components if r = m or
m − 1.
In these two cases, we will denote by OG+(r, 2m) a connected component of
OG(r, 2m). Let σ be a non-degenerate symplectic bilinear form on Cs. The symplectic
Grassmannian of isotropic r-planes SG(r, s) is the scheme of r-dimensional subspaces of
Cs isotropic with respect to σ.

***
Remark 3.6. Let S be the universal subbundle of G(r, s). The Plücker embedding is
the embedding given by the very ample line bundle ∧rS∨. The varieties OG(r, s) and
SG(r, s) can be embedded in G(r, s) as zero sections of, respectively, Sym2S∨ and ∧2S∨.

***
Remark 3.7. In [AC13, Proposition 34], it is stated that the smooth complete intersection
of OG+(k, 2k) of type (2, 2) under the Plücker embedding is a weak 2-Fano variety. This
should be read as (2).

***
Remark 3.8. We introduce the following notation: the group H 4(G(r, s), Z) is generated
by {σ2, σ1,1}, while H r(s−r)−4(G(r, s), Z) is generated by a basis {σ∨
1,1} dual to
{σ2, σ1,1}.

Remark 3.9. Let X be a smooth complete intersection of G(2, 5) of type (1, 1) under the
Plücker embedding, let Z be the variety of lines through a general point of X.
[AC13,
Example 30] says that Z has homology class equal to σ∨
1,1. This should be read as

Remark 3.10. By Serre duality χ(Ωp
have χ(ΩG(2,5)(−m)) = χ(Ω5

χ(Ω4
p.p. 165,169]. It can easily be seen that χ(ΩG(2,5)) = −1 and χ(Ω2

G(2,5)(m)) = 0, because ∀p ≥ 0 H p(G(2, 5), Ω4

G(2,5)(−m)) = χ(Ω6−p

171(3)].

G(2,5)(m)) = 0 because all the groups H p(G(2, 5), Ω5

G(2,5)(m)), and for m = 1, 2, 3 we
G(2,5)(m))
G(2,5)(−m)) =
G(2,5)(m)) = 0 by [Sno86, Theorem

If m = 1, 2 we have χ(Ω2

G(2,5)) = 2.

Lemma 3.11. Let X be a smooth complete intersection of type (1, 1) in a Grassmann
variety G(2, 5) under the Plücker embedding. Then b4(X) = 2.

***
Proposition 3.12. Let X be a n-dimensional weak 2-Fano complete intersection in a
Grassmann variety G(r, s) under the Plücker embedding. Then, b4(X) ≤ 2. In particular
Eﬀ 2(X) is polyhedral.

***
Remark 3.13. By [Laz04b, Theorem 7.1.1] we have H 5(Xt, Z) = 0. By [Hat02, Corollary
3.3] H4(Xt, Z) is torsion free, then also H 8(Xt, Z) is torsion free by Poincaré duality.

complete intersection in a connected component of the orthogonal Grassmann variety
