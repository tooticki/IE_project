Theorem 1.2. Let f : S → B be a semistable complete fibration of genus g(F ) ≥ 2 and M ⊂ U be
a unitary flat subbundle generated by a maximal dimensional Massey-trivial subspace. Then there is
an injection of monodromy group GM of M inside the group of bijection on a set K of morphisms
kg : F → Σ from the general fiber F to a smooth compact curve Σ of genus g(Σ) ≥ 2. Moreover, after
a finite étale base change uM : BM → B trivializing the monodromy, the pullback bundle of M becomes
P
the trivial bundle V ⊗ OBM of fibre V = g∈GM kg∗ H 0 (ωΣ ) ⊂ H 0 (ωF ).

Definition 2.1. Let B be a smooth irreducible curve, π1 (B, b) be the fundamental group of B with
base point b.
(LS) A Local system of C-vector spaces over B is a sheaf V of C-vector spaces which is locally
isomorphic to the constant sheaf of stalk a C-vector space V .
(FB) A flat vector bundle over B of fibre a C-vector space V is a pair (V, ∇) given by a locally free
sheaf V of OB -modules such that Vb ⊗OB,b OB,b /mb ' V and a flat connection ∇ : V → V ⊗ Ω1B
(i.e. such that the curvature Θ = ∇2 is identically zero).
(MS) A Monodromy representation of B over a C-vector space V is a representation of the
fundamental group π1 (B, b), that is a homomorphism
ρV : π1 (B, b) → Aut(V ),
and the image Im ρV is called the monodromy group.
