Theorem 1.1. [Ando–Matsuzawa, unpublished] Let G be a unitarily representable Polish SIN
group, and assume that ϕ ∈ P(G) generates the topology of G. Then the following statements
hold:

(i) Oϕ is relatively compact in the compact open topology.
(ii) If Oϕ satisﬁes one of the following conditions, then G is of ﬁnite type.

(iia) The closure of Oϕ with respect to the topology of pointwise convergence is norm-
(iib) Oϕ is relatively weakly compact.

separable.

Theorem 1.2. [Main Theorem] Let Γ be a countable discrete group, and let π : Γ → GL(H)
be a group homomorphism from Γ to the group of bounded invertible operators on H. Let
G = H (cid:111)π Γ be the semidirect product.

(a) G is a unitarily representable Polish group. Moreover, the following two conditions

are equivalent.
(i) G is a SIN group.
(ii) π is uniformly bounded. That is, (cid:107)π(cid:107) := sups∈Γ (cid:107)π(s)(cid:107) < ∞ holds.

(b) Assume that π is uniformly bounded. Then the following three conditions are

equivalent.
(i) G is of ﬁnite type.
(ii) There exists a character f : H → C that generates a neighborhood basis of 0 ∈ H,
(iii) π is unitarizable. That is, there exists V ∈ GL(H) such that V −1π(s)V is unitary

such that f (π(s)ξ) = f (ξ) for all ξ ∈ H and s ∈ Γ.
for all s ∈ Γ.

***
Theorem 1.3. [Corollary 3.16 ] Let H be a separable real Hilbert space, and let f ∈ P(H).
Then there exist

(i) a compact metrizable space X and a Borel probability measure m on X,
(ii) a bounded linear operator T : H → L2(X, m; R), and
(iii) a positive measurable function ϕ ∈ L0(X, m),

such that

(iv) If f generates a neighborhood basis of 0, then T can be chosen to be a real-linear
homeomorphism onto its range.
(v) We may arrange T and ϕ such that if G is a uniformly bounded subgroup of the group
{u ∈ GL(H); f (uξ) = f (ξ) (ξ ∈ H)} of invertible operators on H ﬁxing f pointwise,
then there exists a continuous homomorphism β from G to the group Aut(X, m) of all
m-preserving automorphisms of X with the weak topology, such that

[T (uξ)](x) = β(u)[T (ξ)](x), ϕ(β(u)x) = ϕ(x),

u ∈ G, ξ ∈ H, m-a.e. x ∈ X.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let G, G(cid:48) be topological groups.

(i) We say that G is embeddable into G(cid:48), if there exists a topological group isomorphism
π from G onto a closed subgroup of G(cid:48). Such π is called an embedding.
(ii) We denote by P(G) the set of all normalized continuous positive deﬁnite functions
on G, and by P(G)inv the set of all f ∈ P(G) which is conjugation-invariant, i.e.,
f (g−1xg) = f (x) holds for all x, g ∈ G. An element of P(G)inv is called a character
on G.

***

Deﬁnition 2.2. [[Po07]] A Polish group G is of ﬁnite type if G is embeddable into the unitary
group U(M ) of some ﬁnite von Neumann algebra M equipped with strong operator topology.
The class of ﬁnite type Polish groups is denoted by Uﬁn.

***

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let G be a topological group.

(i) G is called unitarily representable if G is embeddable into U((cid:96)2(N)) equipped with

strong operator topology.
(ii) G is called SIN (small invariant neighborhood) if for any neighborhood V of G at the
identity e, there exists a neighborhood U ⊂ V of e which is conjugation invariant, i.e.,
g−1U g = U, ∀g ∈ G. Such U is called an invariant neighborhood of G.

If G is metrizable, then G is SIN if and only if G admits a bi-invariant metric d which is
compatible with its topology.

Theorem 2.4. [[AM12-2]] For a Polish group G, the following conditions are equivalent.

(i) G is of ﬁnite type.
(ii) There exists a family F ⊂ P(G)inv which generates a neighborhood basis of the

Theorem 2.5. Let N, K be SIN-groups. Let α : K → Aut(N ) be a continuous action of K
on N . Then the following two conditions are necessary and suﬃcient for N (cid:111)α K to be a
SIN-group.

(SIN. 1) For any U ∈ N (N ), there exist V ∈ N (N ) with V ⊂ U such that

αk(V ) = V,

k ∈ K.

(SIN. 2) The action α is bounded. That is, for any V ∈ N (N ), there exists W ∈
N (K) such that

n−1αk(n) ∈ V,

n ∈ N, k ∈ W.

***
Remark 2.6. A semidirect product G (cid:111)α Γ of a SIN group G by a discrete group Γ always
satisﬁes (SIN. 2) (take W = {eK}).

***

Theorem 2.7. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → GL(H) be an invertible representation of Γ. Then the semidirect product group
G := H (cid:111)π Γ is unitarily representable. Moreover, the following conditions are equivalent.

(1) G is SIN.
(2) π is uniformly bounded, i.e., (cid:107)π(cid:107) := sups∈Γ (cid:107)π(s)(cid:107) < ∞.

***

Theorem 2.8. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation of Γ. Then H (cid:111)π Γ is of ﬁnite type if
and only if there exists f ∈ P(H) such that
∀s ∈ Γ, ξ ∈ H,
(F.1) f (π(s)ξ) = f (ξ),
(F.2) f generates a neighborhood basis of 0 ∈ H.

***

Corollary 2.9. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation of Γ. If π is unitarizable, then H (cid:111)π Γ
is of ﬁnite type.

***

Corollary 2.10. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation of Γ. Assume that Γ is amenable. Then
H (cid:111)π Γ is of ﬁnite type.

***
Remark 2.11. We remark that if Γ is amenable, then so is H (cid:111)π Γ, so that the conclusion of
Corollary 2.10 also follows from the fact [AM12-2, Theorem 2.2] that an amenable unitarily
representable SIN group is of ﬁnite type.

***
Theorem 3.1. If G = H (cid:111)π Γ is of ﬁnite type, then π is unitarizable.

***
Lemma 3.2. [Dixmier] Let π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation. Then π is
unitarizable if and only if there exists an inner product (cid:104)·,·(cid:105)(cid:48) on H that generates the same
Hilbert space topology and which is π-invariant, i.e., (cid:104)π(s)ξ, π(s)η(cid:105)(cid:48) = (cid:104)ξ, η(cid:105)(cid:48) (ξ, η ∈ H, s ∈ Γ)
holds.

***

Proposition 3.3. The map T : H → (cid:102)Msa is a real-linear homeomorphism onto its range (with

respect to the τ -measure topology or the SRT). Moreover, the following covariance property
holds.

(6)

T (π(s)ξ) = α(s)T (ξ)α(s)∗,

s ∈ Γ, ξ ∈ H.

***
Deﬁnition 3.4. We denote by L0(X, m) the space of all m-measurable C-valued functions
on X, and L0(X, m)+ its positive cone. We also deﬁne the Γ-action on L0(X, m) by βs =
Ad(α(s))|L0(X,m) (s ∈ Γ) (we use the same symbol βs as the Γ-action on L∞(X, m), but there
would be no danger of confusion).

***
Theorem 3.5. [Equivariant Maurey-Nikishin Factorization] The map T : H → L0(X, m)
factors Γ-equivariantly through a Hilbert space. More precisely, there exists a Γ-invariant
function ϕ ∈ L0(X, m) which is m-a.e. positive and

Lemma 3.7. Let S : H → L0(X, m) be a linear operator. Then the following conditions are
equivalent.

(i) S is continuous.
(ii) There exists a non-increasing map C : (0,∞) → [0, 1] such that limλ→∞ C(λ) = 0 and

(9)

m({x ∈ X;|Sξ(x)| ≥ λ(cid:107)ξ(cid:107)}) ≤ C(λ)
(iii) For every t > 0, there exists K(t) > 0 such that

(Sξ)(cid:63)(t) ≤ K(t)(cid:107)ξ(cid:107)

Lemma 3.8. Let ϕ ∈ L0(X, m). Then for every δ > 0, m({x ∈ X;|ϕ(x)| > ϕ(cid:63)(δ)}) ≤ δ

Proposition 3.9. Let A be a convex subset of L0(X, m)+ which is globally Γ-invariant. Then

Lemma 3.10. [Minimax Lemma] Let X, Y be topological vector spaces, and let A (resp. B)
be a convex subset of X (resp. Y ). Assume that B is compact. If the function Φ : A × B →

(i) Φ(·, b) is a concave function on A for each b ∈ B,

Lemma 3.13. Let S : H → (cid:102)M be an R-linear homeomorphism onto its range. If S(ξ) ∈

L2(M ) for every ξ ∈ H, then regarded as S : H → L2(M ), S is an R-linear homeomorphism
onto its range, where L2(M ) is equipped with the L2-topology (instead of the τ -measure
topology).

***

Remark 3.14. In the above lemma, we did not claim that in L2(M ), SRT and the L2-
topology are the same. In fact the two topologies are diﬀerent (but they agree on the image
of S, i.e., S deﬁnes a strong embedding in the sense of [AK06, Deﬁnition 6.4.4]). To see
this in the commutative case, let (Ω, µ) be a diﬀuse probability space, and choose a sequence
(Bn)∞

n=1 of measurable subsets of Ω such that 0 < µ(Bn) n→∞→ 0. Deﬁne fn ∈ L2(Ω, µ) by

Then (cid:107)fn(cid:107)2

Question 3.15. Is there a connected, unitarily representable SIN Polish group which is not

***
Corollary 3.16. Let H be a separable real Hilbert space, and let f ∈ P(H). Then there exist

(i) a compact metrizable space X and a Borel probability measure m on X,
(ii) a bounded operator T : H → L2(X, m; R), and
(iii) a positive measurable function ϕ ∈ L0(X, m),

such that

Moreover:

f (ξ) =

ξ ∈ H.

(iv) If f generates a neighborhood basis of 0, then T can be chosen to be a real-linear
homeomorphism onto its range.
(v) We may arrange T and ϕ such that if G is a uniformly bounded subgroup of the group
{u ∈ GL(H); f (uξ) = f (ξ) (ξ ∈ H)} of invertible operators on H ﬁxing f pointwise,
then there exists a continuous homomorphism β from G to the group Aut(X, m) of all
m-preserving automorphisms of X with the weak topology, such that

[T (uξ)](x) = β(u)[T (ξ)](x), ϕ(β(u)x) = ϕ(x),

u ∈ G, ξ ∈ H, m-a.e. x ∈ X.

***

Remark 3.17. A typical example of the above corollary is the positive deﬁnite function
f (ξ) = e−(cid:107)ξ(cid:107)2/4. To see this, let us ﬁx an orthogonal basis {ξi} for H. In this case, we can
N
choose X = ( ˙R)
the product of an inﬁnite number of copies of the one-point compactiﬁcation
of R, m = the inﬁnite dimensional Gaussian measure, T (ξi) : X (cid:51) x (cid:55)→ xi ∈ ˙R and ϕ = 1.
The triple (X, m, T ) is called a Gaussian random process indexed by H. For more detatils,
see [Si74].

***

Remark 3.18. It is clear from the proof that it applies whenever H is a Banach space of
Rademacher type 2 (see [AK06, §6] for deﬁnitions). Thus we have shown as a corollary that a
Banach space B is isomorphic (as a Banach space) to a Hilbert space if and only if a positive
deﬁnite function generates the topology of B and is of type 2. Moreover, the isomorphism can
be made equivariant with respect to a group of symmetries that preserve the positive deﬁnite
function. One may compare this result with Kwapie´n’s Theorem [Kw72] that B is isomorphic
to a Hilbert space if and only if B is of type 2 and cotype 2. Note that the Kwapie´n Theorem
does not produce an equivariant isomorphism but requires less in the sense that any Banach
space isomorphic to a subspace of L0(X, m) is of cotype 2, but not all cotype 2 Banach spaces
can be isomorphic to a subspace of L0(X, m) (see the remark after [BL00, Corollary 8.17] and
[Pi78]).

***

Proposition 3.19. Let A be a commutative von Neumann algebra with separable predual, and
let τ be a normal faithful tracial state on A. Let G be a Polish group, and let β : G → Aut(A)
be a continuous τ -preserving action. Then there exists a separable compact metrizable space
X, a Borel probability measure m on X, an m-preserving continuous action G× X (cid:51) (g, x) (cid:55)→
gx ∈ X and a ∗-isomorphism Φ : A → L∞(X, m) such that

Moreover, the G-action is continuous as a map G → Aut(X, m), where the group Aut(X, m)

Lemma 3.20. Let M, N be von Neumann algebras, and let ψ, ϕ be normal faithful states on
M, N , respectively. Let M0 (resp. N0) be a ∗-strongly dense subalgebra of M (resp. N ). If
α : M0 → N0 is a ∗-isomorphism such that ϕ(α(x)) = ψ(x) for every x ∈ M0, then α can be
extended to a ∗-isomorphism from M onto N such that ϕ(α(x)) = ψ(x) (x ∈ M ).
