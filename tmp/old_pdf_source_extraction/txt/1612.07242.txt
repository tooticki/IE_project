Theorem 1. Let m > n ≥ 2 be integers such that either
(a) both m and n are odd, or
(b) both m and n are even, or
(c) m is odd, n is even and n ≤ m+1
2 .
Then (??) is true.

***
Corollary. Let m > n ≥ 2 be integers such that either (a), (b) or (c) in
Theorem 1 holds. Then Bombieri’s conjecture for this pair of integers is false.

***
Conjecture. If m > n ≥ 2 are integers such that m is odd, n is even and
n < 4m+2
then (??) is true.

Lemma 2. [Dieudonné’s criterion] The polynomial p(z) = z + a2 z 2 + . . . + an z n
is univalent in D if and only if its associated polynomials
sin(2t)
sin(nt) n−1
q(z; t) = 1 + a2
z + . . . + an
z
sin t
sin t
have no zeros in D for any choice of the parameter t ∈ [0, π].

Lemma 3. For all t ∈ R and n ≥ 2, we have
An (t) ≥ 0

and

An (2π − t) = An (t).

Also, An vanishes only for t = 2`π, ` ∈ Z, when n is even and only for t = `π,
` ∈ Z, when n is odd.

Lemma 4. For all integers n ≥ 2 and for all t ∈ (0, π) it holds that
An (t)
An+2 (t)
