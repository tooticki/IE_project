Remark 2.2. As can be seen from the proof of Theorem 2.1 , the assumption on the cocycle
being class injective is not necessary for this convergence result. But we dispense with this
additional generality in order to make sure that the values h∗
P (α) accurately reﬂect entropy
theoretic information regarding the action of Γ on X.

Theorem 2.6. Assume that Γ (cid:121) (X, λ) is an ergodic essentially free p.m.p. action. Then,

Examples 7.1.

(1) Let Γ be an irreducible lattice in a connected semisimple Lie group with
ﬁnite center and without compact factors. Then the action of Γ on the maximal boundary
(G/P, m), where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup and m is the Lebesgue measure class,
is amenable and has stable type III1, see [BN13b].

(2) Let Γ be a discrete non-elementary subgroup of isometries of real hyperbolic space. By
[Su78] [Su82], the type of the action of Γ on the boundary of hyperbolic space with respect
to the Lebesgue measure class is III1. In [Sp87] this result was proved for the action of
fundamental groups of compact connected negatively curved manifolds acting on the visual
boundary with the manifold measure class.

(3) Let Γ be a ﬁnitely generated free group. By [RR07], the action of Γ has non-trivial type
with respect to harmonic measures, namely stationary measures of suitable random walks.
For Γ being a word hyperbolic group, it was proved in [INO08] that the action of Γ on the
Poisson boundary associated with a generating measure of ﬁnite support has non-trivial
type.

(4) In [Bo14] it was proved that for word hyperbolic groups (with an additional technical
condition) the action on the Gromov boundary with respect to a quasi-conformal measure
(and in particular the Patterson-Sullivan measure) measure has non-trivial stable type.
