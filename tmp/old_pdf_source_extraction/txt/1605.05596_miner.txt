Deﬁnition 2.1. A Borel measure is τ -smooth if for every collection {Uα : α ∈ Λ} of open
sets, µ(∪αUα) = sup µ(∪n
i=1Uαi), where the supremum is taken over all ﬁnite subcollections
of {Uα : α ∈ Λ}. We say that (X, d, µ) is a metric measure space if µ is a Borel measure on
the metric space (X, d), such that for all balls B(x, r), µ(B(x, r)) < ∞, and furthermore, µ
is τ -smooth.

***

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let (X, d, µ) be a metric measure space and let g be a locally integrable
function on X. For each x ∈ X, the centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator Mµ is
given by

(1)

Mµg(x) :=

sup

{r:0<µ(B(x,r))}

µ(B(x, r))

B(x,r)

|g|dµ.

Deﬁnition 2.3. A Borel measure µ on (X, d) is doubling if there exists a C > 0 such that
for all r > 0 and all x ∈ X, µ(B(x, 2r)) ≤ Cµ(B(x, r)) < ∞.

***

Deﬁnition 2.4. A metric space is D-geometrically doubling if there exists a positive integer
D such that every ball of radius r can be covered with no more than D balls of radius r/2.

***
Deﬁnition 2.5. ([NaTa, p. 735] Let 0 < t < 1 and let K ≥ 1. Then µ is said to be
t-microdoubling with constant K if for all x ∈ X and all r > 0, we have

µB (x, (1 + t) r) ≤ KµB(x, r).

***

Deﬁnition 2.6. A measure µ satisﬁes a local comparability condition if there exists a constant
C ∈ [1,∞) such that for all pairs of points x, y ∈ X, and all r > 0, whenever d(x, y) < r, we
have

µ(B(x, r)) ≤ Cµ(B(y, r)).

We denote the smallest such C by C(µ) or Cµ.

***

Remark 2.7. If µ is doubling with constant K1 then it is microdoubling and satisﬁes a
local comparability condition with the same constant K1, while if it is t-microdoubling with
constant K2 and 2 ≤ (1 + t)M , then µ is doubling and satisﬁes a local comparability condition
with constant K M
2 . Thus, the diﬀerence between doubling and microdoubling lies in the size of
the constants, it is quantitative, not qualitative: The microdoubling condition adds something
new only when K2 < K1, in which case it entails a greater regularity in the growth of the
measure of balls, as the radii increase. Likewise, bounds of the form µB(x, T r) ≤ KµB(x, r)
for T > 2, allow a greater irregularity in the growth of balls than standard doubling (T = 2)
or than microdoubling.
We mention that while local comparability is implied by doubling, it is a uniformity condition,
not a growth condition. Thus, it is compatible with the failure of doubling, and even for
doubling measures, it is compatible with any rate of growth for the volume of balls. Consider,
for instance, the case of d-dimensional Lebesgue measure λd: A doubling constant is 2d, a
1/d-microdoubling constant is e, and the smallest local comparability constant is C(λd) = 1.

***
Deﬁnition 2.8. ([NaTa, p. 737] Let 0 < t < 1 and let K ≥ 1. Then µ is said to be strong
t-microdoubling with constant K if for all x ∈ X, all r > 0, and all y ∈ B(x, r),

µB (y, (1 + t) r) ≤ KµB(x, r).

Deﬁnition 2.9. Given a set S we deﬁne its s-blossom as the enlarged set

Bl(S, s) := ∪x∈SB(x, s),

***

(3)

(4)

and its uncentered s-blossom as the set

Blu(S, s) := ∪x∈S ∪ {B(y, s) : x ∈ B(y, s)}.

When S = B(x, r), we simplify the notation and write Bl(x, r, s), instead of Bl(B(x, r), s),
and likewise for uncentered blossoms. We say that µ blossoms boundedly if there exists a
K ≥ 1 such that for all r > 0 and all x ∈ X, µ(Blu(x, r, r)) ≤ Kµ(B(x, r)) < ∞.

***

Deﬁnition 2.10. A metric space has the approximate midpoint property if for every ε > 0
and every pair of points x, y, there exists a point z such that d(x, z), d(z, y) < ε + d(x, y)/2.

***
Deﬁnition 2.11. A metric space X is quasiconvex if there exists a constant C ≥ 1 such that
for every pair of points x, y, there exists a curve with x and y as endpoints, such that its
length is bounded above by Cd(x, y). If for every ε > 0 we can take C = 1 + ε, then we say
that X is a length space.

***

Example 2.12. The s-blossom of an r-ball may fail to contain a strictly larger ball, even in
quasiconvex spaces.
For instance, let X ⊂ R2 be the set {0}× [0, 1]∪ [0, 1]×{0} with metric deﬁned by restriction
of the (cid:96)∞ norm; then we can take C = 2. Now B((1, 0), 1) = (0, 1] × {0}, while for every
r > 1, B((1, 0), r) = X, which is not contained in Blu((1, 0), 1, 1/6). Furthermore, neither
Blu((1, 0), 1, 1/6) nor Bl((1, 0), 1, 1/6) are balls, i.e., given any x ∈ X and any r > 0, we
have that B(x, r) (cid:54)= Blu((1, 0), 1, 1/6) and B(x, r) (cid:54)= Bl((1, 0), 1, 1/6).
On the other hand, if a metric space X has the approximate midpoint property, then blossoms
and balls coincide (as we show next) so in this case considering blossoms gives nothing new.

***

Theorem 2.13. Let (X, d) be a metric space. The following are equivalent:
a) X has the approximate midpoint property.
b) For all x ∈ X, and all r, s > 0, Bl(x, r, s) = B(x, r + s).
c) For all x ∈ X, and all r > 0, Bl(x, r, r) = B(x, 2r).

***

Example 2.14. Let X be the unit sphere (unit circumference) in the plane, with the chordal
metric, that is, with the restriction to X of the euclidean metric in the plane. While this space
does not have the approximate midpoint property, blossoms are nevertheless geodesic balls.
However, the equality Bl(x, r, s) = B(x, r + s) no loger holds. For instance, Bl((1, 0), 1, 1) (cid:54)=
Bl((1, 0),

2) = B((1, 0), 2) = X \ {(−1, 0)}.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let 0 < t < 1 and let K ≥ 1. Then µ is said to t-microblossom boundedly
with constant K, if for all x ∈ X and all r > 0, we have
(5)

µ(Blu (x, r, tr)) ≤ KµB(x, r).

***

Example 3.2. Microblossoming (even together with doubling) is more general than
microdoubling, in a quantitative sense. Consider (Zd, (cid:96)∞, µ), where µ is the counting measure.
Then µ is doubling, and “microdoubling in the large”, since for large radii (r > d), µ can
be regarded as a discrete approximation to Lebesgue measure. However, µB(0, 1) = 1, and
for every t > 0, µB(0, 1 + t) ≥ 3d, no matter how small t is. Thus, the measure µ is not
(t, K)-microdoubling, for any K < 3d, 0 < t << 1. However, µ is 1/d-microblossoming, since
for r > d, µ behaves as a microdoubling measure, and for r ≤ d, Blu(x, r, r/d) = B(x, r).
A less natural but stronger example is furnished by the measure µ given by [A2, Theorem 5.9].
Since µ satisﬁes a local comparability condition, and is deﬁned in a geometrically doubling
space, it blossoms boundedly, so it microblossoms boundedly (at least with the blossoming
constant). But µ is not doubling, and hence it is not microdoubling.

***
Example 3.3. While (t, K1)-microdoubling entails (2, K2)-doubling for some K2 ≥ K1, the
analogous statement is not true for microblossoming. The following example shows that
(1/2, 1)-microblossoming does not entail local comparability. Let X = {0, 1, 3} with the
inherited metric from R, and let µ = δ3. Then B(0, 3) ∩ B(3, 3) = {1}, but µB(0, 3) = 0
while µB(3, 3) = 1, so local comparability fails. Since bounded blossoming implies local
comparability, all we have to do is to check that µ is (1/2, 1)-microblossoming. For t ≤ 3,
B(0, t) ⊂ Blu(0, t, t/2) ⊂ {0, 1}, so µB(0, t) = µBlu(0, t, t/2) = 0, and for t > 3, B(0, t) =
Blu(0, t, t/2) = X. Likewise, for t ≤ 2, B(1, t) = Blu(1, t, t/2) ⊂ {0, 1}, so µB(1, t) =
µBlu(1, t, t/2) = 0, and for t > 2, B(1, t) = Blu(1, t, t/2) = X.

***

Deﬁnition 3.4. Given a metric measure space (X, d, µ), and denoting the support of µ by
supp(µ), the relative increment function of µ, riµ : supp(µ) × (0,∞) × [1,∞), is deﬁned as

(6)

riµ(x, r, t) :=

µB(x, tr)
µB(x, r)

,

and the maximal relative increment function, as

(7)

mriµ(r, t) := sup

x∈supp(µ)

µB(x, tr)
µB(x, r)

.

When µ is understood we will simply write ri and mri.

Example 3.5. The interest of considering values of t > 2 in the preceding deﬁnition comes
from the fact that, under the additional assumption of microblossoming, it will allow a much
more irregular growth of balls than microdoubling or plain doubling, without a comparable
worsening of the estimates for the weak type (1,1) bounds.
To ﬁx ideas, consider the right hand side C(µ) K1K
of formula (10 ) below. This
bound is related to the centered maximal operator when the supremum is restricted to radii R
between r and T r, T > 1. The constant K2 depends on T , as it must satisfy mriµ(r, T ) ≤ K2.
For Lebesgue measure on Rd with the (cid:96)∞-norm, C(λd) = 1. If we set T = 2, then we can
take K2 = 2d, while K2 = dd for T = d, a choice which yields bounds of order O(d log d). A
1/d-microdoubling constant is K1 = e (Rd has the approximate midpoint property, and in
fact it is a geodesic space, so microdoubling is the same as microblossoming in this case) and
K := max{K1, e} = e.
Returning to Example 3.2 , by a rescaling argument it is clear that the situation for (Zd, (cid:96)∞, µ)
cannot be much worse than for (Rd, (cid:96)∞, λd), and in fact it is easy to see that the same
argument of Stein and Str¨omberg (which will be presented in greater generality below) yields
the O(d log d) bounds. Now suppose we modify the measure so that at one single point it is
much smaller. Clearly, this will have little impact in the weak type (1,1) bounds, since for
d >> 1, x ∈ Zd, and r > 1, the measure of B(x, r) will be changed by little or not at all, while
for r ≤ 1, balls with distinct centers do not intersect. For deﬁniteness, set ν = µ on Zd \ {0},
and ν{0} = d−d. Then the doubling constant, and the (t, K)-microdoubling constant, for any
t > 0, is at least dd(3d − 1) ≤ K = K2, much larger than the corresponding constants for
µ. However, the local comparability constant is still very close to 1, since intersecting balls
of the same radius must contain at least 3d points each, and a 1/d-microblossoming constant
can be taken to be very close to e. Setting T = d, we get K2 ≤ dd(2d + 1)d, so log K2 in this
case is comparable to the constant obtained when T = 2.

***

Remark 3.6. One might deﬁne (T, K)-macroblossoming, with T > 1, by analogy with
Deﬁnition 3.1 . However, since B(x, T r) ⊂ Blu(x, r, T r), assuming directly that mriµ(r, T ) ≤
K is not stronger than (T, K)-macroblossoming,
