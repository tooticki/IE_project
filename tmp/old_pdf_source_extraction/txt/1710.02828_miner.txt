Deﬁnition 2.1. Let B be a smooth irreducible curve, π1(B, b) be the fundamental group of B with
base point b.

(LS) A Local system of C-vector spaces over B is a sheaf V of C-vector spaces which is locally

isomorphic to the constant sheaf of stalk a C-vector space V .

(FB) A ﬂat vector bundle over B of ﬁbre a C-vector space V is a pair (V,∇) given by a locally free
sheaf V of OB-modules such that Vb ⊗OB,b OB,b/mb (cid:39) V and a ﬂat connection ∇ : V → V ⊗ Ω1
(i.e. such that the curvature Θ = ∇2 is identically zero).

(MS) A Monodromy representation of B over a C-vector space V is a representation of the

B

fundamental group π1(B, b), that is a homomorphism
ρV : π1(B, b) → Aut(V ),

and the image Im ρV is called the monodromy group.

Proposition 2.3. Let u : B(cid:48) → B be a morphism of curves and V be a local system over B. Then
u−1V is a local system over B(cid:48). Moreover, the associated monodromy representation factors through

Proposition 2.4. Let V1 and V2 be two local subsystems of the local system V. If they both have ﬁnite
monodromy, then the local subsystem V1 + V2 of V has ﬁnite monodromy.

Remark 2.5. There is a natural isomorphism Γ(A, V) → V over any contractible subset A of B since
V is trivial over A.

Proposition 2.8. Let W1 and W2 be two subspaces of Γ(A, V) such that W1 ⊂ W2. If the local system
