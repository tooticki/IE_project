Deﬁnition 1.1. ([12]) A diﬀeological space is a pair (X,DX ) where X is a set and DX is a speciﬁed
collection, also called the diﬀeology of X, of maps U → X (called plots) for each open set U in Rn and
for each n ∈ N, such that for all open subsets U ⊆ Rn and V ⊆ Rm the following three conditions are
satisﬁed:

1. (The covering condition) Every constant map U → X is a plot;
2. (The smooth compatibility condition) If U → X is a plot and V → U is a smooth map (in the usual

sense) then the composition V → U → X is also a plot;

3. (The sheaf condition) If U = ∪iUi is an open cover and U → X is a set map such that each

restriction Ui → X is a plot then the entire map U → X is a plot as well.

Deﬁnition 5.1. Let π : V → X be a diﬀeological vector pseudo-bundle with ﬁnite-dimensional ﬁbres.
A pseudo-metric on this pseudo-bundle is a smooth section g : X → V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ of the pseudo-bundle
V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ such that for every x ∈ X the bilinear form g(x) is symmetric, positive semi-deﬁnite, and of
rank equal to dim((π−1(x))∗) ( i.e., g(x) is a pseudo-metric on the diﬀeological vector space π−1(x)).

***
Example 5.2. Take X to be the standard R, and endow V = R3 with the pseudo-bundle diﬀeology, relative
to its projection onto the ﬁrst coordinate, and generated by the plot p : R2 (cid:51) (u, v) (cid:55)→ (u, 0,|v|) ∈ R3 = V .
Thus, the diﬀeology of V , as well as its structure as the total space of this pseudo-bundle, corresponds to
its presentation as the direct product R × R2; this product diﬀeology comes from the standard diﬀeology
on R = X and the vector space diﬀeology on R2 generated by the plot v (cid:55)→ (0,|v|). The pseudo-bundle
map π is just the projection onto the ﬁrst factor.
Since the diﬀeology on V is a product diﬀeology, the pseudo-bundle in question is trivial (diﬀeologically),
so ﬁnding a pseudo-metric is easy; we can choose one on the ﬁbre and set it to be the chosen one on
any other ﬁbre. Thus, the question reduces itself to one regarding pseudo-metrics, in the sense of vector
spaces, on R2 (we write it in the (y, z)-coordinates coming from the ambient R3 = V ) with diﬀeology
generated by v (cid:55)→ (0,|v|). This we have seen already, in the sense that each smooth linear map f on this
space is given by (y, z) (cid:55)→ ay for some constant a; by abuse of notation we can then write f as f = ae2
(making an implicit reference to the canonical dual basis of the ambient R3 and the same direct product
decomposition of its dual space). It follows then that any pseudo-metric g(x) on a given ﬁbre π−1(x) has
form g(x) = a(x)e2 ⊗ e2, where a : R → R is a smooth everywhere positive function.

***
Example 5.3. Let V = R2 and X = R; let π : V → X be the projection on the x-axis, π(x, y) = x.
Endow X with the standard diﬀeology, and endow V with the pseudo-bundle diﬀeology generated by the
plot p : R2 → V deﬁned by p(u, v) = (u, u|v|).

***
Lemma 5.4. If π : V → X is the pseudo-bundle of Example 5.3 , it does not admit a pseudo-metric.

Deﬁnition 6.2. Let X1 and X2 be two diﬀeological spaces, and let f : X1 ⊃ Y → X2 be a map that is a

1 : X1 (cid:44)→ (X1 (cid:116) X2) → X1 ∪f X2,
coincides with the composition X1 (cid:44)→ (X2 (cid:116) X1) → X2 ∪f−1 X1, while (ϕX1↔X2 ) ◦ i2 coincides with the
compositionX2 (cid:44)→ (X2 (cid:116) X1) → X2 ∪f−1 X1.

Theorem 6.4. Let π1 : V1 → X1 and π2 : V2 → X2 be two ﬁnite-dimensional diﬀeological vector pseudo-

its smooth ﬁbrewise linear lift ˜f . Suppose that (π−1
1 (Y ))∗ are ﬁbrewise diﬀeomorphic.
Finally, assume that for i = 1, 2 there exists a pseudo-metric gi on Xi such that g1 and g2 are (f, ˜f )-
compatible. Then the map

2 (f (Y ))∗ and (π−1

V2 compatible with respect to the gluing. Deﬁne ˜g : X1 ∪f X2 → (V1 ∪ ˜f V2)∗ ⊗ (V1 ∪ ˜f V2)∗ as

Theorem 6.6. Let πi : Vi → Xi for i = 1, 2 be two diﬀeological vector pseudo-bundles, and let ( ˜f , f ) be

V ∗
assume that g1 and g2 are (f, ˜f )-compatible. Then the commutative and the noncommutative versions of

Theorem 7.2. For any two (f, ˜f )-compatible pseudo-metrics g1 and g2 on the pseudo-bundles π1 : V1 →

Lemma 8.1. Let π : V → X be a ﬁnite-dimensional diﬀeological vector pseudo-bundle that admits a
pseudo-metric, and let g : X → V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ be a pseudo-metric on V . Then Φ is smooth as a map V → V ∗.

***
Remark 8.2. Notice that the same conclusion holds for any smooth bilinear map g : X → V ∗ ⊗ V ∗,
not necessarily a pseudo-metric: whether it has, or not, the maximal rank possible for a given ﬁbre, is
inessential for smoothness of Φ.

Theorem 8.3. Let π : V → X be a ﬁnite-dimensional diﬀeological vector pseudo-bundle that is locally
trivial and admits a pseudo-metric g. Then there is a natural induced pseudo-metric g∗ on its dual

***

Remark 8.4. We are not able to say whether the assumption of local triviality is truly necessary for the
existence of a smooth g∗, which is somewhat disappointing.
