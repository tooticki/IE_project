Remark 4.4. Similar problems are investigated in [47]. In particular, Theorem
2.12 in the quoted paper is a weaker variant of our Theorem 2.2 . However, the
proof given in [47] contains a gap. The authors confuse a projection on a one-
dimensional space with a coordinate functional. Therefore, it is not clear why the
family of operators (Tn,m) deﬁned on p. 25 should be uniformly bounded. The
correct estimate is (cid:107)Tn,m(cid:107) ≤ 2Kn(cid:107)T(cid:107) which is not a uniform bound. The same
type of a gap is in Remark 2.18.1 and in the proof of Theorem 2.19. These results
can be repaired and improved using our Lemma 4.3 .
