Theorem A. Let G be a ﬁnite non-simple group. Then Γ(G) is not connected if and
only if for some prime numbers p and q one of the following holds.

1. G ∼= Zp × Zp, or G ∼= Zp × Zq.
2. G ∼= N (cid:111) A where N ∼= Zp × ··· × Zp, A ∼= Zq, NG(A) = A, and N is a minimal

normal subgroup of G.

Theorem B. Let G be a ﬁnite solvable group. Then κ(G) < 2 if and only if for some
prime numbers p and q one of the following holds.

1. |G| = pα with 0 ≤ α ≤ 2.
2. |G| = p3 and neither G ∼= Q8 nor G ∼= Zp × Zp × Zp.
3. |G| = p2q with a Sylow p-subgroup P such that either

(a) P ∼= Zp2, or
(b) P ∼= Zp × Zp, P / G, and there exists a non-normal subgroup of G of order

p.

4. G = P Q is a group of order pαq (α ≥ 3) with P being the normal Sylow p-subgroup

of G such that either
(a) P is elementary abelian, Q acts on P irreducibly, and the order of NG(Q)

(b) N := Φ(P) is elementary abelian, Q acts on both N and P/N irreducibly,

is at most pq, or
and either NG(Q) = Q or NG(Q) = N Q ∼= Zp × Zq.

In particular, any solvable group whose order is divisible by at least three distinct primes
is 2-connected.

Proposition 1. For a ﬁnite group G with |V (G)| > k the following statements are
equivalent:

(i) Γ(G) is k-connected.
(ii) There is no upward closed separating set S of Γ(G) with |S| < k.
(iii) There are at least k independent paths in Γ(G) between any pair of minimal

subgroups.

Lemma 2. Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group. Then there exists a cut-vertex of Γ(G) if
and only if G is isomorphic to one of the following groups
Zp2 × Zq

Zp2 × Zp,

Zp3,
for some prime numbers p and q.

***

Proposition 3. Let G be a ﬁnite group and N be a normal subgroup of G. If G/N is
k-connected, then G is (k + x − 1)-connected where x is the length of the series

1 < N1 < N2 < ··· < Nx = N

such that Ni / G for each 1 ≤ i ≤ x. In particular, κ(G/N) ≤ κ(G).

***
Corollary 4. Let G be a supersolvable group with ‘ := ‘(G). Then κ(G) ≥ ‘ − 3. In
particular, all p-groups of order > pα are (α − 2)-connected.

***
Lemma 5. Let G be a ﬁnite solvable group. Then κ(G) ≥ 2 if and only if G satisﬁes
the 2-valency condition.

***

Lemma 6. Let G be a ﬁnite p-group. Then κ(G) < 2 if and only if

1. |G| = pα, 0 ≤ α ≤ 2,
2. |G| = p3 except G ∼= Q8 or G ∼= Zp × Zp × Zp

In particular, all p-groups of order > p3 are 2-connected.

***
Lemma 7. Let G be a group of order p2q with a Sylow p-subgroup P. Then κ(G) < 2
if and only if one of the following holds.

1. P ∼= Zp2.
2. P ∼= Zp × Zp, P / G, and there exists a non-normal subgroup of G of order p.

***
Lemma 8. Let G be a group of order p2q. Then G is 3-connected if and only if

G ∼= ha, b, c | ap = bp = cq = 1, ab = ba, cac−1 = aλ, cbc−1 = bλi

where q(cid:12)(cid:12) p − 1 and λ > 1 is any integer such that λq ≡ 1 (mod p).

***
Remark. The “smallest” non-solvable group is the alternating group A5 on ﬁve letters
and its order is divisible by three distinct primes. However, it does not satisfy the
2-valency condition. To be more precise, if H is a subgroup of order 5, then there is
exactly one proper subgroup, say K, of A5 containing H. To see this, ﬁrst observe
that any maximal subgroup M of A5 has index ≥ 5, as otherwise, there would be a
homomorphism φ: A5 → SG/M with a non-trivial kernel which is impossible. Hence
the only possibility for the order of K is 10. Since H is not a normal subgroup of A5
and since H is normalized by the maximal subgroup K, we see that K is the unique
subgroup containing H.

Lemma 9. Let G be a ﬁnite supersolvable group. Then κ(G) ≥ 3 if and only if G
satisﬁes the 3-valency condition.

***

Corollary 10. Let G be a ﬁnite supersolvable group with κ(G) < 3. Then the number
of prime divisors of |G| is at most three. Moreover, if there are exactly three distinct
prime divisors, then |G| is square-free.

***

Lemma 11. Let G be a ﬁnite supersolvable group with κ(G) < 3. Then the order of G
must be equal to one of the following
pα (0 ≤ α ≤ 4),

p2q2,

p3q,

p2q,

pqr,

pq

where p, q, and r are distinct prime numbers. Moreover, if G is nilpotent, then |G| 6=
p2q2; and if G is nilpotent and of order p3q, then G is cyclic.

***

Lemma 12. Let G be a ﬁnite p-group. Then κ(G) < 3 if and only if one of the following
holds.

1. |G| = pα (0 ≤ α ≤ 3) and neither G ∼= Q8 nor G ∼= Zp × Zp × Zp.
2. G is a group of order p4 such that

(a) G ∼= Zp4, or
(b) Φ(G) ∼= Zp2 except G ∼= Q16, or
(c) Φ(G) ∼= Zp × Zp and Z(G) < Φ(G) except

i. G ∼= ha, b, c | a9 = b3 = 1, ab = ba, a3 = c3, bcb−1 = c4, aca−1 = cb−1i,
ii. G ∼= ha, b, c | ap2 = bp = cp = 1, bc = cb, bab−1 = ap+1, cac−1 = abi for

and

p > 3.

In particular, all p-groups of order > p4 are 3-connected.
