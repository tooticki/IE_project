Example 2.1. For a small category C, we deﬁne a partition S by S = {{f}}f∈mor(C);
that is, all morphisms have pairwise diﬀerent colors. Then we see that K(C) :=
(C, S) is a schemoid. It is called a discrete schemoid. Observe that the Bose-Mesner
algebra is the category algebra of the underlying category C.

Example 2.2. For an association scheme (X, S), we deﬁne a quasi-schemoid (X, S)
by the pair (C, V ) for which ob(C) = X, HomC(y, x) = {(x, y)} ⊂ X×X and V = S,
where the composite of morphisms (z, x) and (x, y) is deﬁned by (z, x) ◦ (x, y) =
(z, y). It follows that the Bose-Mesner algebra is nothing but the original adjacency
algebra of the association scheme; see [11, Example 2.6 (i)].

***
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let F, G : (C, S) → (D, S(cid:48)) be morphisms between the schemoids
(C, S) and (D, S(cid:48)) in qASmd. We write H : F ⇒ G if H is a morphism from (C, S)×I
to (D, S(cid:48)) in qASmd with H ◦ ε0 = F and H ◦ ε1 = G. Here (C, S) × I denotes
the product of the quasi-schemoids and εi : (C, S) → (C, S) × I is the morphism of
quasi-schemoids deﬁned by εi(a) = (a, i) for an object a in C and εi(f ) = (f, 1i) for
a morphism f in C. We call the morphism H above a homotopy from F to G. A
morphism F is equivalent to G, denoted F ∼ G, if there exists a homotopy from F
to G or that from G to F .

***
Theorem 2.4. (See Theorem 3.5 for a more precise version.) Let (C, S) be a tame
schemoid. Then the functor category T (C,S) is equivalent to the module category
R(C, S)-Mod if the set {idx}x∈obC/ ∼S is ﬁnite and every structure constant is less
than or equal to 1.

***
Deﬁnition 2.5. Schemoids (C, SC) and (C(cid:48), SC(cid:48)) are Morita equivalent if the functor
categories T (C,SC) and T (C(cid:48),SC(cid:48) ) are equivalent as abelian categories.

***
Theorem 2.6. Let (D, S(cid:48)) be a tame schemoid and u : (C, S) → (D, S(cid:48)) a morphism
of schemoids. Then the functor u∗ : T (D,S(cid:48)) → T (C,S) induced by u has a left adjoint
Lanu : T (C,S) → T (D,S(cid:48)) and a right adjoint Ranu : T (C,S) → T (D,S(cid:48)).

***
Deﬁnition 2.7. Let (D, S(cid:48)) be a tame schemoid with the set {idx}x∈obD/ ∼S(cid:48)
ﬁnite. For a morphism u : (C, S) → (D, S(cid:48)) of schemoids and a functor M ∈ T (C,S),
(relative) schemoid cohomology of u with coeﬃcients in M is deﬁned by

H∗((C, S) u→ (D, S(cid:48)); M ) = H∗(u; M ) := Ext∗

T (D,S)(R, RanuM ).

***
Theorem 2.8. With the above notation, suppose further that ob([D]) is ﬁnite.
Then there is a coﬁbrantly generated model category structure on Ch(T (C,S)) in
which the weak equivalences are the maps that Ranu takes into weak equivalences
in Ch(T (D,S(cid:48))) ∼= Ch(T [D]) (cid:39) Ch(R[D]-Mod). Moreover, (u∗, Ranu) is a Quillen

pair with respect to this model category structure.

***
Remark 2.9. Let A be the category of (unbounded) chain complexes of left R-
modules, where R is a ring. When we consider the projective model structure on
Ch(A); see [9, Section 2.3], the Ext group Ext∗
A(X, Y ) for R-modules X and Y is
the usual one.

***
Corollary 2.10. With the model category structure on Ch(T (C,S)) deﬁned in
Theorem 2.8 , one has a natural isomorphism

H∗((C, S) u→ (D, S(cid:48)); M ) := Ext∗

for every object M in T (C,S), where Lu∗ denotes the total derived functor of the
restriction u∗.

T (D,S(cid:48) ) (R, RanuM ) ∼= Ext∗

T (C,S)((Lu∗)R, M )

Corollary 2.11. (i) For a group G and a RG-module M , the schemoid cohomology
H∗(S(G) id→ S(G); M ) is isomorphic to the group cohomology H∗(G, M ).
(ii) Let C be a small category with the set of morphism mor(C) ﬁnite. Then one has
an isomorphism H∗(K(C) id→ K(C); M ) ∼= H∗(C, M ) for any RC-module M , where
H∗(C, M ) denotes the cohomology of C with coeﬃcients in M ; see [2] for example.

Remark 3.1. It follows from the proof of [11, Lemma 4.2] that the condition T(ii)
necessarily holds for a unital schemoid. We recall the argument for the reader.
Suppose that f, g ∈ σ, s(f ) ∈ τ1 and s(g) ∈ τ(cid:48)
τ1σ ≥ 1 because f is indeed
τ1σ(f ). Then there exists u ∈ τ1 and h ∈ σ such that u ◦ h = g. If (C, S) is
in π−1
unital, we see that u = ids(g) and hence τ(cid:48)
1 = τ1. The same argument as in above
yields that there is an element τ2 such that idt(f ), idt(g) ∈ τ2.

Remark 3.2. Let (C, S) and (C(cid:48), S(cid:48)) be tame schemoids. It is readily seen that the

Theorem 3.5. Let (C, S) be a tame schemoid. The category T (C,S) is embedded
into the module category R[C]-Mod. Moreover, T (C,S) is equivalent to the module
category R(C, S)-Mod if ob[C] is ﬁnite and the structure constant pµ
τ σ is less than
or equal to 1 for any τ, σ, µ ∈ S.

Proposition 3.6. Let G be a groupoid. Then the associated schemoid (cid:101)S(G) is tame

and the structure constants are less than or equal to 1. In particular S(G) is tame
for any group G.

***

Remark 3.7. The result [11, Lemma 4.4] implies that a semi-thin schemoid is tame;
see [11, Deﬁnition 4.1] for the deﬁnition of a semi-thin schemoid. Moreover, for
coincides with the category [C] mentioned above. By virtue of the result [11,

a semi-thin schemoid (C, S), the groupoid (cid:101)R(C, S) constructed in [11, Section 4]
Theorem 4.11], we see that [(cid:101)S(G)] ∼= G as a category for a groupoid G.

***
Proposition 3.8. Let u : (C, SC) → (C(cid:48), SC(cid:48)) be a morphisms of schemoids.
(i) The restriction functor u∗ : T C(cid:48) → T C induced by u gives rise to a functor
u∗ : T (C(cid:48),SC(cid:48) ) → T (C,SC).
(ii) Suppose that u is an equivalence; that is, there exist a morphism w : (C(cid:48), SC(cid:48)) →
(C, SC) and natural isomorphisms uw ⇒ 1 and wu ⇒ 1 which preserve the
partition of identities and so do the inverses. Then (C, SC) and (C(cid:48), SC(cid:48)) are Morita
equivalent.

***
Remark 3.9. Let (C, S) be a schemoid with mor(C) ﬁnite. Suppose that the
schemoid (C, S) satisﬁes the condition T(i) and hence T(ii). For example, a
schemoid arising from an association schemes is such one. We deﬁne a small R-
linear category R-[C] by ob(R-[C]) = ob([C]) and

HomR-[C]([x], [y]) := R(cid:104)Hom[C]([x], [y])(cid:105),

µ pµ

namely the free R-module generated by the set Hom[C]([x], [y]). For morphisms
σ ∈ Hom[C]([y], [z]) and τ ∈ Hom[C]([x], [y]), the composite σ ◦ τ of the morphisms
στ µ. Let T R-[C] be the functor category of additive functors
from R-[C] to T . We deﬁne a pair (θ, η) of functors

is deﬁned to be(cid:80)
which is so-called Mitchell’s correspondence, by θ(F ) = (cid:76)

[x]∈ob([C]) F ([x]) and
η(M )([x]) = [idx]M . It is readily seen that θ is an embedding with left inverse η.
Moreover, we see that θ is an equivalence with inverse η if ob([C]) is ﬁnite. Observe
that T R-[C] is not functorial with respect to morphisms in qASmd in general; see
[11, Section 6] and [6, Section 6].

Proposition 3.10. Let (D, S(cid:48)) be a tame schemoid and u(cid:48) : (C(cid:48), SC(cid:48)) → (D, S(cid:48)) a
morphism of schemoids. Let K : (C, SC) → (C(cid:48), SC(cid:48)) be a morphism of schemoids
whose underlying functor K : C → C(cid:48) gives an equivalence of categories. Suppose
that the inverse to the functor K is a morphism of schemoids. Then for any module
M in T (C(cid:48),SC(cid:48) ), one has an isomorphism

H∗((C, SC) u(cid:48)K→ (D, S(cid:48)); K∗M ) ∼= H∗((C(cid:48), SC(cid:48)) u(cid:48)→ (D, S(cid:48)); M ).

***
Lemma 3.11. Let (D, S(cid:48)) be a tame schemoid and u : (C, S) → (D, S(cid:48)) a morphism
of schemoids. Suppose that one of modules N and M in T (C,S) is in the image of
the functor u∗ : T (D,S(cid:48)) → T (C,S). Then the Hom-set T (C,S)(M, N ) coincides with
T C(M, N ).

***
Remark 3.12. Let v : (D, S(cid:48)) → (C, S) be a morphism of schemoids. The same
argument as in the proof of Theorem 2.6 does not work well in showing the existence
of the left/right adjoint of the restriction functor v∗ : T (C,S) → T (D,S(cid:48)) in general
even if (D, S(cid:48)) is tame. Indeed, suppose that idc ∼S id(cid:48)
c. We claim that LanvN (c) =
LanvN (c(cid:48)) for any N in T (D,S(cid:48)). Recall the left adjoint Lanv : T D → T C is deﬁned
by

(cid:90) d∈D

LanvN (c) =

C(v(d), c) · N (d)

for N in T D and c ∈ C; see [12, X]. There is no relation between the hom-sets
C(v(d), c) and C(v(d), c(cid:48)) in general.

Example 4.1. Let G be a group and H a subgroup. Let G/H denote the group-
case association scheme whose underlying set is the homogeneous one G/H. By
considering a normal subgroup N containing H, we have a natural map u : G/H →
G/N . Then G/N is a group and hence a tame schemoid. Therefore, for a functor
M ∈ T (G/H), schemoid cohomology H∗(G/H u→ G/N ; M ) is isomorphic to group
cohomology of the form H∗(G/N ; RanuM ).

***
Example 4.2. Let L be a simplicial complex and N is a category whose objects
are non-negative integers and which has the one arrow i → j if and only if i ≤ j.
The length of the arrow i → j is deﬁned to be the diﬀerence j − i. In the category
N , lengths of arrows give a partition len of the set of morphisms (arrows). Then
we see that (N , len) is a tame schemoid whose structure constants are less than or
equal to 1. Moreover, the Bose-Mesner algebra of this schemoid is isomorphic to
the polynomial algebra R[σ1].
We have a morphism u : (P (L), S) → (N , len) of schemoids by ”collapsing” the
Hasse diagram of the face poset of L, where (P (L), S) is the schemoid associated
with L; see Remark 6.2 . Thus the schemoid cohomolgoly of the morphism u is
considered by using the Koszul resolution of the constant functor R as a R[σ1]-
module. In fact, we have

H∗(P (L) u→ (N , len); M ) ∼= Ext∗

R[σ1](R, RanuM )

∼= H(Hom(∧(s−1σ1), ΨRanπ◦uM ); δ)

for any M ∈ T (P (L),S); see Remark 2.9 . It follows that the diﬀerential δ is deﬁned
by δ(f )(s−1σ1) = σ1f (1).
Let n be the number of vertices of a simplicial complex L. Then we deﬁne a
morphism v : (P (L), S) → (N , len)×n of schemoids by v(φ) = (0, ...., 0) and v(xi) =
(0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0), where 1 appears in the ith entry. Then the morphism v also
deﬁnes schemoid cohomology H∗(v; M ).

Proposition 4.3. Let H(n, 2) be the Hamming scheme of binary codes with length
n. More precisely, H(n, 2) = ({0, 1}×n,{T0, T1, ..., Tn}), where Ti denotes the set

of the pair of words with the Hamming metric i. Then schemoids (cid:101)S(Z/2) and
(H(n, 2)) are Morita equivalent; see Section ?? for the functor (cid:101)S( ).

***

Remark 4.4. In the observation above, we see that the morphism v of schemoids is
an equivalence on the underlying categories with u its inverse. In fact, for example,
a natural isomorphism η : uv ⇒ 1 on (H(n, 2)) is determined uniquely with the
condition that η11 : 00 = uv(11) → 11 and η00 : 00 = uv(00) → 00 because
an association scheme is regarded as a complete graph. However, since η00 ∈ T0,
η11 ∈ T2 and id00 ∼S id11, it follows that η does not preserve the partition. Thus
Proposition 3.8 is not applicable to this case.
Observe that an association scheme has an initial object if we consider it a category
with the functor  : AS → qASmd and the forgetful functor U : qASmd → Cat
described in Section ??. Therefore, each association scheme is equivalent to the
trivial category as a category.

the same as that of (H(2, 2)). However, Theorem 3.5

enables us to deduce

The third equivalence follows from Theorem 3.5 . The algebra R((H(2, 2))) is
commutative and a free R-module of rank 3. On the other hand, the group ring
R(Z/2) is of rank 2 and commutative. Then the 0th Hochschild homology groups
of the two algebras are diﬀerent from each other, which is a contradiction.

(ii) The underlying categories of the schemoids (cid:101)S(Z/4) and KU ((H(2, 2))) are
that the category T (cid:101)S(Z/4) is equivalent to the module category R(Z/4)-Mod. The
category T KU ((H(2,2))) is equivalent to T .
In fact, T KU ((H(2,2))) is isomorphic
the small category U ((H(2, 2))) is a groupoid with initial object. Then (cid:101)S(Z/4),

(H(2, 2)) and KU ((H(2, 2))) are not Morita equivalent one another.

Lemma 5.1. Let (C1, S1) and (C2, S2) be schemoids and U an object in the functor

(D, S(cid:48)) is tame. If u induces an equivalence between T (C2,S2) and T (C1,S1); that
is, (C1, S2) and (C2, S2) are Morita equivalence, then so are T (Dop×C1,S(cid:48)×S1) and
T (Dop×C2,S(cid:48)×S2). In consequence, for any object h in T (Dop×D,S(cid:48)×S(cid:48)), one has an

Remark 5.4. In Theorem 5.3 , suppose further that ob[D] is ﬁnite. Then Theorem
3.5 allows us to deduce that T (Dop×D,S(cid:48)×S(cid:48)) is equivalent to the module category
R[D]op ⊗ R[D]-Mod. Therefore, if (C1, S1) = (D, S(cid:48)), w is identity and h is the
functor corresponding to the bimodule R[D], then the Ext group in Theorem 5.3
is isomorphic to the Hochschild cohomology HH∗(R[D]).
Let w : (C1, S1) → (D, S(cid:48)) be a morphism of schemoids, which induces a Morita

equivalence between the schemoids. We deﬁne a functor(cid:101)h : (Dop × C1, S(cid:48) × S1) →
T by (cid:101)h(a, b) = (id[a,w(b)])∗R[D] for any object (a, b) and (cid:101)h(f, g) : (cid:101)h(a, b) =

(a, b) → (c, d) in Dop × C1. Then it follows that (1 × w)∗h = (cid:101)h and hence

Remark 6.11. The functor category T (OpenX ,SX ) is an abelian subcategory of the
category T OpenX of presheaves of R-modules over X. We see that there is no
essential intersection between T (OpenX ,SX ) and sheaves. In fact, suppose that F
is a sheaf in T (OpenX ,SX ). Then F (∅) = 0. For any open set U , idU : U → U
and ∅ → ∅ are contained in a common σ ∈ SX . This enables us to conclude that
F (id∅) = F (idU ) : F (U ) = F (∅) → F (∅) = F (U ). We have F (U ) = 0. Therefore,
F is nothing but the constant sheaf 0.
