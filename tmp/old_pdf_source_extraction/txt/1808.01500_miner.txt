Proposition 1.1. In every ﬁnite partition A = C1∪. . .∪Cr of a piecewise syndetic
set A, one of the pieces Ci is piecewise syndetic.

Deﬁnition 2.1. F is a translation invariant ﬁlter (TIF for short) if F is a ﬁlter
with the additional property that if A ∈ F then also A − 1 ∈ F (and hence,
A − n ∈ F for all n ∈ N0).

***
Proposition 2.2. A set A is thick if and only if it belongs to a TIF F.

Proposition 2.3. Let B = {Bn | n ∈ N} be a countable algebra of sets.

n Gn is an ultraﬁlter that extends G.

U :=(cid:83)
FIP; and Gn+1 = Gn otherwise. Then M :=(cid:83)

(1) Given a family G ⊆ B with the FIP, deﬁne G0 = G; Gn+1 = Gn ∪ {Bn}
in case Bn ∩ A (cid:54)= ∅ for every A ∈ Gn; and Gn+1 = Gn otherwise. Then
(2) Given a family G ⊆ B with the FIP and such that A ∈ G ⇒ A − 1 ∈ G,
deﬁne G0 = G; Gn+1 = Gn ∪ {Bn − k | k ∈ N0} in case that union has the
n Gn is a maximal TIF that
extends G.

Proposition 2.4. Let U be an ultraﬁlter that includes a maximal TIF M. Then:

(1) Every B ∈ U is piecewise syndetic.
(2) For every B ∈ U, the set BU := {n ∈ N | B − n ∈ U} is syndetic.2

Theorem 3.1. Let A be a piecewise syndetic set. Then for every k ∈ N, the set
APk(A) := {x ∈ A | ∃y ∈ N s.t. x + iy ∈ A for i = 1, . . . , k} is piecewise syndetic.

***
Corollary 3.2. In every ﬁnite partition N = C1 ∪ . . . ∪ Cr there exists a piece
C = Ci such that, for every k ∈ N, the set APk(C) is piecewise syndetic.

***
Proposition 4.1. Let B = P(N) be the full algebra of all subsets of N. If F is a
TIF then C(F) is a closed left ideal of (βN,⊕); and conversely, if L is a left ideal of
(βN,⊕) then F(L) is a TIF. Moreover, M is a maximal TIF if and only if C(M)
is a minimal left ideal of (βN,⊕); and L is a minimal left ideal of (βN,⊕) if and
only if F(L) is a maximal TIF.

***
Corollary 4.2. Let B = P(N) be the full algebra of all subsets of N. An ultraﬁlter
U includes a maximal TIF if and only if U belongs to the smallest ideal K(βN,⊕).

Remark 4.3. One can generalize the contents of this paper from the natural numbers
to arbitrary countable semigroups (S,·). Indeed, the notion of translation invariant
ﬁlter also makes sense in that more general framework.5 Precisely, if B is an algebra
of subsets of S, one deﬁnes a TIF on B as a ﬁlter F with the additional property
that A ∈ F ⇒ s−1A := {t ∈ S | s · t ∈ A} ∈ F for every s ∈ S. Then, by the same
arguments as used in this paper, one can prove that Theorem 3.1 holds, provided
one adopts a suitable generalization of the notion of piecewise syndetic set.6
