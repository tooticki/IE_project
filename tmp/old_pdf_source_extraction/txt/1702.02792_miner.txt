Theorem 1.1. Let Γ be a countably inﬁnite group. If Y (cid:40) {0, 1}Γ is a closed invariant proper
subset, then there exists a closed invariant subset X ⊆ {0, 1}Γ \ Y such that the action of Γ on X
is free and admits an invariant probability measure.

Theorem 2.1. [A corollary of the Lov´asz Local Lemma; Erd˝os–Lov´asz] Let A be a countable
set and let B be a correct instance over A. Then Sol(B) (cid:54)= ∅.

Proposition 2.2. Let B be an invariant instance over Γ and let α : Γ (cid:121) (X, µ) be a measure-
preserving action of Γ on a standard probability space (X, µ). Suppose that B admits a measurable
solution over α. Then the action of Γ on Sol(B) admits an invariant probability measure.

Theorem 2.3. [[4, Lemma 5.17]] Let λ denote the Lebesgue probability measure on [0; 1]. If B
is a correct invariant instance over Γ, then B admits a measurable solution over the shift action
Γ (cid:121) ([0; 1]Γ, λΓ).

Corollary 2.4. If B is a correct invariant instance over Γ, then the action of Γ on Sol(B) admits
