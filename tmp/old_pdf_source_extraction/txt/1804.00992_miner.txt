DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BINARY NECKLACES AND A

COMBINATORIAL METHOD FOR THEIR ENUMERATIONS

ROMEO MEˇSTROVI ´C

Abstract. In this paper we investigate enumeration of some classes of n-
character strings and binary necklaces. Recall that binary necklaces are necklaces
in two colors with length n. We prove three results (Theorems 1, 1’ and 2)
concerning the numbers of three classes of j-character strings (closely related
to some classes of binary necklaces or Lyndon words). Using these results,
we deduce Moreau’s necklace-counting function for binary aperiodic necklaces
of length k [12] (Theorem 3), and we prove the binary case of MacMahon’s
formula from 1892 [9] (also called Witt’s formula) for the number of necklaces
(Theorem 4). Notice that we give proofs of Theorems 3 and 4 without use of
Burnside’s lemma and P´olya enumeration theorem. Namely, the methods used
in our proofs of auxiliary and main results presented in Sections 3 and 4 are
combinatorial in spirit and they are based on counting method and some facts
from elementary number theory.

1. Introduction

George P´olya (1887–1985) discovered a powerful general method for enumerating
the number of orbits of a group on particular conﬁgurations. This method became
known as the P´olya Enumeration Theorem, or PET, whose proof follows directly
from Burnside’s lemma. P´olya’s theorem can be used to enumerate several
objectst under permutation groups. In particular, it can be used for enumeration
of diﬀerent classes of necklaces and bracelets.

In combinatorics, a k-ary necklace of length n is an equivalence class of n-
character string over an alphabet of size k, taking all rotations are equivalent.
It represents a structure with n circularty connected beads of up to k diﬀerent
colors. A necklace of length n is primitive if its period is not a proper divisor of
n.

Technically, one may classify as an orbit of the action of the cyclic group of
n-character strings, and a bracelet as an orbit of the dihedral grooup’s action.

Namely, an (n, k) - bracelet is an equivalence classs of words of length n under
rotation and reﬂection. This enables appplication of P´olya enumeration theorem
of necklaces and bracelets. An (n, k) - necklace is an equivalence class of words of
length n over an alphabet of size k under rotation. For example, if k = 2 and the
alphabet is {0, 1}, then the following sets are examples of three binary necklaces
(i.e., those with k = 2):

{0101, 1010},

{011011, 110110, 1011101},

and

{0110101, 1101010, 1010101, 0101011, 1010110, 0101101, 1011010},

The basic enumeration problem is then (Necklace Enumeration): For a given n
and k, how many (n, k)-necklaces are there? Equivalently, we are asking how
many orbits the cyclic group Cn has on the set of all words of length n over an
alphabet of size k. We will denote this value by a(n, k). Notice that in a group G
of symmetry transformations such that only translations (ai → ai+s) are allowed,
G is a cyclic group Cn. This case appears in [14] in connection with counting
necklaces made from n beads of k diﬀerent kinds (translations merely rotate the
necklace). It also arises in problems of coding and genetics [6]. The special case
n = 12, k = 2 occurs in ﬁnding the number of distinct musical chords (of 0, 1,
··· , or 12 notes) when inversions and transpositions to other keys are equivalences
(for related calculations see [4, Section 6]).

An aperiodic necklace of length n is an equivalence class of size n, i.e., no
distinct rotations of a necklace from such class are equal. According to Moreau’s
necklace-counting function (see [3, p. 503]; also see [14]), there are

(cid:88)

diﬀerent k-ary aperiodic necklaces of length n, where µ is the M¨obius function,
where µ(1) = 1, µ(n) = (−1)r if n is a product of r distinct primes, and µ(n) = 0
otherwise (see the sequence A001037 in [16] concerning the sequence {M2(n)}∞
n=1
which presents the number of binary Lyndon words). The formula (1) is called
MacMahon’s formula in the book by Graham et al.
[5, the formula (4.63), p.
141]. Notice that this formula may be derived by a simple direct argument given
in [6].

Each aperiodic necklace contains a single Lyndon word so that Lyndon words
form representatives of aperiodic necklaces. Recall that in mathematics, in the
areas of combinatorics and computer science, a Lyndon word is a nonempty
string that is strictly smaller than lexicographic order than all of its rotations.
More precisely, a k-ary Lyndon word of length n > 0 is an n-character string
over an alphabet of size k, and which is the unique minimum element in the
lexicographical ordering of all its rotations. Being the singularly smallest rotation

implies that a Lyndon word diﬀers from any of its non-trivial rotations, and is
therefore aperiodic (see [1]). For example (see [1]), the list of Lyndon words of
length 6 on the alphabet {0, 1} reads

000001, 000011, 000101, 000111, 001011, 001111, 001111, 010111, 011111.

Of course, the number of Lyndon words of length n on k symbols is equal to
Mk(n), where Mk(n) is given by (1).

Notice that the authors of the paper [1] investigate the historical roots of the
ﬁeld of combinatorics of words. They comprise applications and interpretations
in algebra, geometry, and combinatorial enumeration. Combinatorics of words is
a comparatively new area of discrete mathematics. It is pointed out in [1] that the
collective volumes written under the pseudonym of Lothaire give an account of it
(Lothaire’s ﬁrst volume [7] appeared in 1983 and was reprinted with corrections
in 1997 [8]).

It is also well known (see, e.g., [14, p. 162]) that the number of (n, k) - necklaces

is given by

The formula (2) is called MacMahon’s formula in the book by Graham et al. [5,
the formula (4.63), p. 141], while in Lucas’ book [3, p. 503], it is credited to
M. le colonel Moreau (see the sequence A001031 in [16] concerning the sequence
{N2(n)}∞
n=1) which presents the number of binary necklaces). A proof of (2) given
in [5, pp. 14-141] is based on a lemma presented by P´olya [13] (see also Lemma
in [14, p. 659]).
Let G be a ﬁnite group that acts on a set X. For each g ∈ G let X g denote the
set of elements in X that are ﬁxed by g. Burnside’s lemma asserts the following
formula for the number of orbits, denoted |X/G|:
|X g|.

|X/G| =

(3)

(cid:88)

g∈G

1
|G|

Two elements of X belong to the same “orbit” when one can be reached from the
other by through the action of an element of G. For example, if X is the set of
colorings of a cube, and G is the set of rotations of the cube, then two elements
of X belong to the same orbit precisely when one is a rotation of the other.

In this paper we focus our attention to the investigation of enumerations of
some classes of n-character strings and binary necklaces, i.e., for new deductions
of expressions for numbers of some binary type necklaces. As noticed above,
binary necklaces are necklaces in two colors with length n. Observe that the
authors of the paper [2] exhibit a correspondence between the binary cycles on
length n and the lexicographic composition of the integer n. Furthermore, in [2]
the authors give an algorithm for generating all necklaces of a speciﬁc density.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the main results
and related notions necessary for their formulations and proofs. Section 3 is
devoted to the auxiliary results and related notions and notations. In Section
4 we prove Theorems 1, 1’ and 2 concerning the numbers of three classes of j-
character strings (closely related to some classes of binary necklaces of Lyndon
words). Furthermore, by using these results, we give proofs (of Theorems 3 and
4) of the well known formulae for two classes of binary necklaces without use
of Burnside’s lemma and P´olya enumeration theorem (Burnside’s lemma is also
called Burnside’s counting theorem, the Cauchy-Frobenius lemma or the orbit-
counting theorem).

Notice that the formula (15) of Theorem 3 is a special (binary) case of formula
(1) with k = 2. Similarly, the formula (16) of Theorem 4 is a special (binary)
case of formula (2) with k = 2. As applications, we obtain some interesting
congruences involving the sums of certain binomial coeﬃcients and the function
µ(n) or ϕ(n) (Corollaries 1 and 2).
In particular, we obtain two Lucas’ type
congruences (Corollaries 3 and 4; see, e.g., [10] and [11]). The all our main
results and their consequences are given in Section 2.

Methods used in all our proofs of auxiliary results presented in Section 3
are very combinatorial in spirit and they involve the applications of elementary
number theory. By using these auxiliary results, in Section 4 we give proofs of
our results (Theorems 1-4 and Corollaries 3 and 4).

2. The main results

Throughout this paper we suppose that k ≥ 2 and r ≥ 1 are ﬁxed k ≥ 2 is
an arbitrary ﬁxed integer and r ≥ 1 is an integer such that r ≤ k. Here, as
always in the sequel, we will denote by (n, m) the greatest common divisor of
positive integers n and m, and by |S| the cardinality of a ﬁnite set S. Usualy,
denote by µ(n) and ϕ(n) the M¨obius function and the Euler totient function,
respectively. For any positive integers j ≥ 1 and i ≥ 1 with j ≤ i, denote by
A(j, i) the collection of all subsets of Ri := {0, 1, . . . , i− 1} that contain exactly j
elements. For given set Aj = {a1, a2, . . . , aj} ∈ A(j, i), denote by l = fi(Aj) > 0
the smallest positive integer for which the set Aj is equal to the set Aj + l modulo
i, where Aj + l = {a1 + l, a2 + l, . . . , aj + l}. Since Aj is equal to Aj + i modulo
i, fi(Aj) exists and fi(Aj) ≤ i.
For an arbitrary positive integer s with 1 ≤ s ≤ i, denote by As(j, i) the
subset of A(j, i) consisting of those sets Aj ∈ A(j, i) for which fi(Aj) = s.
Notice that the set As(j, i) may be considered as a class of binary necklaces with
length j whose properties are described above, i.e., for which fi(Aj) = s. Then
R2 = {0, 1}, A(2, 3) = {{0, 1},{0, 2},{1, 2}}}. Then assuming A2 = {0, 2}, we
have A2 +1 = {1, 0} modulo 3, A2 +2 = {2, 1} modulo 3 and A2 +3 = {0, 2} = A2
If for example, i = j = 3 and
modulo 3, whence it follows that f3(A2) = 3.

DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BINARY NECKLACES. . .

A3 = {0, 2, 4}, then since A3 + 1 = {1, 0, 2} and A3 + 2 = {2, 4, 0} = A3 modulo
3, we ﬁnd that f3(A3) = 2.

Our investigations are motivated by the following question:
Under what conditions on integers k, n, r, a1, a2, . . . , ar, the set Ar = {a1, a2, . . . , ar}
equals the set Ar + n = {a1 + n, a2 + n, . . . , ar + n} modulo k?

The answer to this question is given by Proposition 2 in Section 2. Namely, if
n = fk(Ar), then by Proposition 1, n necessarily divides k, that is, k = nd, and
by Proposition 2, d divides r, i.e., r = md for a positive integer m. When this is
the case, by Proposition 2, the set Ar contains exactly m distinct representatives
modulo n. Further, assuming that a(cid:48)
m are these representatives modulo
n, then Ar has the form

2, . . . , a(cid:48)

1, a(cid:48)

Ar = {a(cid:48)

j + sn : 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 0 ≤ s ≤ d − 1}.

(4)

For given common divisor d of k and r, with k = nd and r = md, by Proposition
3, we have |An(m, n)| = |An(r, k)|. This result is the basic tool for determining
the cardinality |An(r, k)| (proof of Theorem 1 in Section 3).

Now we present our basic result whose proof will be given in Section 4.
THEOREM 1. Let Ar = {a1, a2, . . . , ar} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1} be a set for which
n = fk(Ar). Then n divides k and d = k/n is a positive integer that divides r,
that is, k = nd and r = md for a positive integer m. Furthermore, the class of
r-character strings An(r, k) consists of
|An(r, k)| =

(cid:88)

elements, and the sum is taken over all positive divisors s of the greatest common
divisor (n, m) of n and m.

In particular, we have

|Ak(r, k)| =

REMARK 1. Notice that the numbers |An(r, k)| are closely related to the
sequence (triangular array read by rows) A185158 in [16], Namely, T (n, m) =
|An(r, k)| for all n, k = 1, 2, . . . (with k = nd and r = md), where by Comments
in [16], T (n, m) is the number of binary Lyndon words of length n containing m
ones (cf. the sequence/triangular array A051168 in [16]).

REMARK 2. It follows from Theorem 1 and Example 1 at the end of Section 3
that the collection An(r, k) is a nonempty set if and only if d = k/n is an integer
that divides r.

For a ﬁxed positive integer n that divides k such that the integer d = k/n
divides r, the r-character strings that belong to An(r, k) can be separated into

6

ROMEO MEˇSTROVI ´C

disjoint classes as follows. We say that the r-character strings A and A(cid:48) in An(r, k)
are k-equivalent, writting A ∼k A(cid:48), if there exists j ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k− 1} such that
A + j is equal to A(cid:48) modulo k. It is easy to see that ∼k is an equivalence relation,
and that every coset (with respect to this relation) has exactly n elements. More
precisely, the coset A represented by a set A ∈ An(r, k) is equal to {A + j : j =
0, 1, . . . , n − 1} modulo k. Denote by Pn(r, k) the set of all these cosets. We say
that each element of Pn(r, k) is a (r, k)-period with length n. Thus by (5) and (6)
of Theorem 1, with k = nd and r = md, we obtain the following result.

THEOREM 1’. Suppose that k = nd and r = md for some positive integers n,

m and d. Then we have

REMARK 3. It is known (see, e.g., the sequence L2(n, d) in [17]) that the number
S(r, k) given by (11) in Theorem 2 is the number of binary Lyndon words of length
k containing r ones.

Notice that the numbers |An(r, k)| are closely related to the sequence (triangular
array read by rows) A185158 in [16], Namely, T (n, m) = |An(r, k)| for all n, k =

the number of binary Lyndon words of length n containing mk ones (cf.

As the immediate consequences of (8) and (11) we get the following two

congruences, respectively.

(18)

3. The Collections As(j, i) and Auxiliary Results

Let i be a ﬁxed integer greater than 1, and consider an alphabet consisting of
the numbers 0, 1, . . . , i − 1. With this alphabet form all possible k-letter words
(a1, a2, . . . , ak), where k is also ﬁxed. There are evidently ik such words in all.
For our purposes, notice that the set Ri := {0, 1, . . . , i − 1} is a complete residue
system modulo i. For a ﬁnite subset A of N0 := {0, 1, 2, . . .}, denote by A(i) the
(unique) subset of Ri consisting of all l ∈ Ri for which there is a al ∈ A such that
al ≡ l (mod i). In other words, A(i) is a set of representatives modulo i (chosen
from the set Ri) of all elements which belong to A. For given two ﬁnite subsets
A and B of N0 we say that A equals B modulo i if A(i) = B(i). In this case, we
shall often write A = B modulo i.
For any positive integers i ≥ 1 and j ≥ 1 with j ≤ i, denote by A(j, i) the
collection of all subsets of {0, 1, . . . , i− 1} that contain exactly j elements. Given
set Aj = {a1, a2, . . . , aj} ∈ A(j, i), and any positive integer t, put Aj + t =
{a1 + t, . . . , aj + t}. Denote by l = fi(Aj) > 0 the smallest positive integer for
which Aj = Aj + l modulo i. Clearly, Aj = Aj + i modulo i, whence we see that
fi(Aj) exists and fi(Aj) ≤ i.
For an arbitrary positive integer s with 1 ≤ s ≤ i, denote by As(j, i) a subset of
A(j, i) consisting of those sets Aj in A(j, i) for which fi(Aj) = s. It is of interest
here to consider the collections An(r, k) and An(m, n).
Recall that k ≥ 2 is any ﬁxed integer and r ≥ 1 is an integer such that r ≤ k.
In this section we give necessary conditions on integers k, r, n, a1, a2, . . . , ar, to be
satisﬁed fk(Ar) = n for given set Ar = {a1, a2, . . . , ar} ∈ A(r, k). To solve this
problem, we start with the following proposition.

PROPOSITION 1. For any set Ar = {a1, a2, . . . , ar} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1}, the

integer n = fk(Ar) divides k.

DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BINARY NECKLACES. . .

9

Proof. As noticed above, n = fk(Ar) ≤ k.

If we suppose that the integer
fk(Ar) = n does not divide k, then k = q1n + r1 with positive integers q1 and
r1such that 0 < r1 ≤ n − 1, and hence

Ar = Ar + k = Ar + (q1n + r1) = (Ar + q1n) + r1 = Ar + r1 modulo k.

It follows that n = fk(Ar) ≤ r1 < n. This contradiction shows that fk(Ar) divides
(cid:3)
n.
Let d be any divisor of k, and k = nd for an integer n ≥ 1. For a ﬁxed integer

i such that 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, consider the set Ci deﬁned as

Ci = {i, i + n, i + 2n, . . . , i + (d − 1)n}.

(19)

Then we have the following lemma.
LEMMA 1. Every set C i(k) (0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1) has exactly d elements. Moreover,
C i(k) = C j(k) if and only if i ≡ j (mod n). In the case when i (cid:54)≡ j (mod n),
C i(k) and C j(k) are disjoint sets.

Proof. First observe that the set C i(k) has d elements. Namely, if i + d1n ≡
i + d2n (mod k) for some d1 and d2 with 0 ≤ d1 < d2 ≤ d− 1, then (d2− d1)n ≡ 0
(mod dn). Thus (d2 − d1) ≡ 0 (mod d), and hence it must be d1 = d2.
Suppose that C i(k) and C j(k) have at least one common element. In other
words, assume that i + d1n ≡ j + d2n (mod k) for some d1 and d2 with 0 ≤
d1, d2 ≤ d − 1, or equivalently, i − j + (d1 − d2)n ≡ 0 (mod dn). Therefore, we
obtain i ≡ j (mod n), whence it follows easily that C i(k) = C j(k).
(cid:3)
Given set Ar = {a1, a2, . . . , ar} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1}, put n = fk(Ar). Then
by Proposition 1, the number d = k/n is an integer. Assume that the set Ar
contains m distinct representatives modulo n. Choose a maximal subset Bm =
m} of Ar such that a(cid:48)
{a(cid:48)

r := {a(cid:48)
A(cid:48)

i + jn : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1} ⊆ Ar.

On the other hand, for any ai ∈ Ar, there exists a(cid:48)

j. Hence, in view of the fact that 0 ≤ ai − a(cid:48)

n divides ai − a(cid:48)
s with 0 ≤ s ≤ d − 1 such that ai − a(cid:48)
Ar ⊆ A(cid:48)
and we have

r, and hence, it must be Ar = A(cid:48)

(23)
j with 1 ≤ j ≤ m, such that
j ≤ k − 1, there is an
r. Therefore,
r| = md,

j + sn ∈ A(cid:48)

j = sn, i.e., ai = a(cid:48)
r. It follows that r = |Ar| = |A(cid:48)

Ar = {a(cid:48)

i + jn : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}.

(24)

The above arguments together with Proposition 1 imply the following result.

PROPOSITION 2. For given set Ar = {a1, a2, . . . , ar} ⊆ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1}
put n = fk(Ar). Then d = k/n is an integer that divides r, that is, r =
md for a positive integer m. Moreover, the set Ar contains exactly m distinct
representatives modulo n. If we assume that a(cid:48)
m are these representatives
modulo n, then Ar has the form

2, . . . , a(cid:48)

1, a(cid:48)

Ar = {a(cid:48)

i + jn : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}.

(25)

REMARK 4. Clearly, Ar = Ar + n modulo k for every set Ar given by (25).
However, the converse of Proposition 2 is not true in the sense that generally,
given positive integers k, r, n, m and d such that k = nd and r = md, there are
sets Ar of the form (25) for which fk(Ar) < n. To show this fact, put n = k = 4,
d = 1, m = r = 2, and consider the set A2 = {0, 2} ⊂ {0, 1, 2, 3}. Then
A2 + 2 = A2 modulo 4, and hence f4(A2) = 2 < 4.

It follows that |Ak(r, k)| = |A(r, k)| =(cid:0)k

REMARK 5. If the integers k and r are relatively prime, using the same notations
as in Proposition 2, this proposition implies that d divides (k, r) = 1. Hence, it
must be d = 1 and k = n = fk(Ar) for any set Ar = {a1, a2, . . . , ar} ∈ A(r, k).
means that each set Ar ∈ A(r, k) belongs to certain (r, k)-period with maximal
length k.

The following result has an important role in the proof of Theorem 1.
PROPOSITION 3. For an arbitrary common divisor d ≥ 1 of k and r, take k = nd
and r = md. Then the collections An(m, n) and An(r, k) have same cardinality,
and one bijection h between these collections is given as

Bm = {a1, a2, . . . , am} (cid:55)→ Ar = {ai + jn : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1},

(26)

where Bm is in An(m, n) and Ar is in An(r, k).

Proof. For a given set Bm = {a1, a2, . . . , am} ∈ An(m, n), it is easy to check
that all elements of its associated set Ar = {ai + jn : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}
are distinct modulo k. Therefore, |Ar| = md = r modulo k, and hence the above

DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BINARY NECKLACES. . .

11

map Bm (cid:55)→ Ar, denoted here as h, is a map into A(r, k). Furthermore, it is
routine to verify that the map h is injective.
It remains to show that the map h is onto An(r, k). Let Ar ∈ An(r, k) be
arbitrary. This means that n = fk(Ar) > 0 is the smallest positive integer for
which Ar + n equals Ar modulo k. It follows from Proposition 2 that the set Ar
contains m distinct representatives modulo n; assume ai1, ai2, . . . , aim. Hence, by
(25) we get

Ar = {ail + jn : 1 ≤ l ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}.

(27)
Obviously, it is suﬃcient to show that there exists a set Bm ∈ An(m, n) such that
h(Bm) = Ar. Deﬁne Bm = {ai1, ai2, . . . , aim}. Clearly, Bm is in A(m, n), and
hence it suﬃces to show that fn(Bm) = n. Suppose that fn(Bm) = n1 < n. Then
as in the proof of Proposition 1, we infer that n1 divides n, i.e., n = n1d1 with
an integer d1 > 1. Since the set Bm + n1 equals Bm modulo n, by Proposition 2,
with n1, m, n, d1 and Bm instead of n, r k, d and Ar, respectively, we conclude
that d1 divides m, i.e., m = m1d1 with m1 ∈ N. Furthermore, by Proposition
2, the set Bm contains exactly m1 distinct representatives modulo n1, assume for
example, ai1, ai2, . . . , aim1

. Then by (25) of Proposition 2, Bm has the form

Bm = {ais + tn1 : 1 ≤ s ≤ m1, 0 ≤ t ≤ d1 − 1},

(28)

which by (27) implies that

Ar = {(ais + tn1) + jn : 1 ≤ s ≤ m1, 0 ≤ t ≤ d1 − 1, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1},

(29)

whence by putting n = n1d1, we obtain

Ar = {ais + (t + jd1)n1 : 1 ≤ s ≤ m1, 0 ≤ t ≤ d1 − 1, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}.

(30)

Because of k = nd = n1d1d, it is easy by (30) to verify that the set Ar +n1 is equal
to the set Ar modulo k. This implies that fk(Ar) ≤ n1 < n. This contradiction
with our assumption that fk(Ar) = n shows that fn(Bm) = n. This means that
Bm is in An(m, n), and since by (26), (27) and the deﬁnition of Bm, h(Bm) = Ar,
(cid:3)
we conclude that h is a surjective map. This completes the proof.
EXAMPLE 1. We will show that An(r, k) is a nonempty set for each positive
integer n satisfying conditions of Proposition 2. More precisely, for any integers
n ≥ 1 and d ≥ 1, such that k = nd and r = md, we will construct some elements
of An(r, k). Since by (26) of Proposition 3 it is given an one-to-one correspondence
h between the families An(m, n) and An(r, k) = An(md, nd), it is suﬃcient to
consider the corresponding problem for the families An(m, n) with m ≤ n.
and m, respectively), we have An(m, n) = A(m, n).

Am = {a1, a2, . . . , am} ∈ A(m, n) is in An(m, n), and hence |An(m, n)| =(cid:0) n

If (n, m) = 1, then according to Remark 5 (by replacing k and r with n
In other words, each set

(cid:1).

Now we suppose that (n, m) > 1. First we observe that if the set Am is in
An(m, n), then it is easily seen that the set An−m = {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} \ Am is in

m

12

ROMEO MEˇSTROVI ´C

An(n − m, n). Indeed, since Am + n is equal to Am modulo n, then

An−m + n = ({0, 1, . . . , n − 1} \ Am) + n = {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} \ (Am + n)

= {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} \ Am = An−m modulo n.

(31)

Hence, fn(An−m) ≤ n. If we suppose that fn(An−m) = s < n, then as above
we obtain that Am + s is equal to Am modulo n. This contradiction with the fact
that Am is in An(m, n) implies that An−m is in An(n − m, n).
In view of the above natural correspondence between the families An(m, n) and
An(n − m, n), and the fact that (n, m) > 1, we may suppose that 2 ≤ m ≤ (cid:98) n
2(cid:99).
For such a m deﬁne

V = {v ∈ N : v ≤ 2m − 2, (v, n) > 1}.

, s2 ≤ n, (s2, n) = 1}.

n
u

(32)
Since v = m ≤ 2m − 2 and by the assumption, (n, m) > 1, it follows that V is a
nonempty set. Let u = max{v| v ∈ V } and
S = {s1s2 : s1 ∈ N, s2 ∈ N, s1 <

(33)
We will prove that Bs = {s, 2s, . . . , ms} ∈ An(m, n) for each s ∈ S. In particular,
we have {1, 2, . . . , m} ∈ An(m, n). First show that Bs has exactly m diﬀerent
elements modulo n. Assume that for a ﬁxed s ∈ S, the integers l1s and l2s are
in Bs with 1 ≤ l1 − l2 ≤ m − 1 such that n | (l1 − l2)s. We write s = s1s2
with integers s1 and s2 as described by (33). Then since (s2, n) = 1, it must be
n | (l1 − l2)s1. Now, since 1 ≤ s1 < n
u < n, it follows that l1 − l2 = l3s3 such that
(s3, n) = 1 and (l3, n) > 1. So n | l3s1, and because of l3 ≤ m − 1 and (l3, n) > 1,
we have l3 ≤ u with u deﬁned above. Thus 1 ≤ l3s1 < u · n
u = n, and therefore,
l3s1 (cid:54)≡ 0(mod n). This contradiction shows that |S| = m modulo n.
It remains to show that Bs is not equal to Bs + t modulo n for any integer t
with 1 ≤ t ≤ n−1. Indeed, if Bs = Bs +t modulo n for some t with 1 ≤ t ≤ n−1,
then there is an integer p with 1 ≤ p ≤ m−1 such that s+t = (p+1)s. Therefore,
Bs + t = {(p + 1)s, (p + 2)s, . . . , (p + m)s} modulo n, and hence we have
{s, 2s, . . . , ms} = {(p + 1)s, (p + 2)s, . . . , (p + m)s} modulo n.

(34)
Thus there is an integer q with p + 1 ≤ q ≤ p + m ≤ 2m − 1 such that n | qs − s.
It follows that n | (q − 1)s1s2, whence since (s2, n) = 1, we have n | (q − 1)s1.
Since s1 ≤ n − 1, it follows that (q − 1, n) > 1, i.e., q − 1 = q1q2 for integers q1
and q2 with 1 ≤ q1 ≤ q − 1 ≤ 2m − 2 such that (q1, n) > 1 and (q2, n) = 1. This
yields that q1 ≤ u, and n | q1s1, which is impossible since 1 ≤ q1s1 < u · n
u = n.
This contradiction implies that Bs is in An(m, n) for each s ∈ S.

4. Proofs of Theorems 1–4 and Corollaries 3 and 4

We give here a combinatorial proof of Theorem 1 which is based on auxiliary
results obtained in Section 3 and on property of function τ (a, t) deﬁned as follows.

DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BINARY NECKLACES. . .

13

DEFINITION 1. For any integers a > 1 and t ≥ 1, denote by τ (a, t) the number
of t-tuples (a1, a2, . . . , at) of integers such that aj ≥ 2 for all j = 1, 2, . . . , t, and
a = a1a2 ··· at. Obviously, τ (a, t) = 0 for all t ≥ a.

In the proof of Theorem 1, we use the following property of the function τ (a, t).

LEMMA 2. For each integer a > 1, we have

a−1(cid:88)

(−1)tτ (a, t) = µ(a),

t=1

(35)

where µ(a) is the M¨obius function.

Proof. We derive the proof by induction on a ≥ 2. Since −τ (2, 1) = −1 = µ(2),
we see that (35) is true for a = 2. Suppose that a > 2 and that (35) is satisﬁed
for all integers less than a.
Obviously, there holds τ (a, 1) = 1 for all a > 1. Letting that the ﬁrst coordinate
q = a1 of t-tuples (a1, a2, . . . , at) of integers satisfying aj ≥ 2 for all j = 1, 2, . . . , t,
and a = a1a2 ··· at, is taken over all divisors of a, by Deﬁnition 1 of τ (a, t), we

Using the notations introduced in Section 3, if k = nd and r = md for an

|An(md, nd)| = |An(m, n)|.

If integers k and r are relatively prime, then it must be d = 1, r = m, and thus
n = k = fk(Ar) for any set Ar = {a1, a2, . . . , ar} ⊂ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k− 1}. Therefore,

|An(r, k)| = |A(r, k)| =

(mod np) yields (17). This completes the induction proof.

Proof of Corollary 4. We deduce the proof by induction on σ = n + m ≥ 2.
If σ = 2, that is n = m = 1, (18) is obvious. Suppose that σ > 2 and that the
congruence (18) is satisﬁed for any n and m such that n + m < σ.
Assume that n(cid:48) and m(cid:48) be positive integers such that n(cid:48) + m(cid:48) = σ. If n(cid:48) and
m(cid:48) are relatively prime, then (18) is in fact (17) of Corollary 1 with n = n(cid:48)p,
m = m(cid:48)p and α = 1. Now suppose that (n(cid:48), m(cid:48)) = d > 1. If d = pα with α ≥ 1,
i.e., n(cid:48) = n(cid:48)(cid:48)pα and m(cid:48) = m(cid:48)(cid:48)pα with (n(cid:48)(cid:48), m(cid:48)(cid:48)) = 1, then (12) implies that

If there exists a prime q (cid:54)= p that divides (n(cid:48), m(cid:48)) = d, then applying the induction
hypothesis on integers n(cid:48)(cid:48) = n(cid:48)/q and m(cid:48)(cid:48) = m(cid:48)/q, for any divisor s of (n(cid:48)(cid:48)/q, m(cid:48)(cid:48)/q),
we get

Since µ(s(cid:48)p) = 0 if p | s(cid:48), and each divisor s(cid:48) of (n(cid:48), m(cid:48)) with s(cid:48) (cid:54)≡ 0(mod p) can
be uniquely associated to the divisor s(cid:48)p of (n(cid:48)p, m(cid:48)p) with µ(s(cid:48)p) = −µ(s(cid:48)), the
