Deﬁnition 1.1. A function f : [N]2 → N is addition-like if

(1) f is computable,
(2) there is a computable function g such that if y > g(x, n) then f ({x, y}) > n,
(3) there is a b such that for all x (cid:54)= y, there are at most b many z’s for which

and
f ({x, z}) = f ({x, y}).

Question 1.2. What further uses do the Lov´asz Local Lemma and other
probabilistic results have in the reverse-mathematical and computability-theoretic
analysis of combinatorial principles?

***

Asymmetric Lov´asz Local Lemma, Inﬁnite Version. Suppose the above
hypotheses hold and there exist r0, r1, . . . ∈ (0, 1) such that

Pr[Aj] (cid:54) rj · (cid:89)

(1 − rt)

At∈N (Aj )

t(cid:54)=j

for all j. Then there is an assignment of x0, x1, . . . that avoids every Aj.

Theorem 2.1. [Rumyantsev and Shen [16, 17]] Suppose the above hypotheses hold
and there are q ∈ Q ∩ (0, 1) and a computable sequence r0, r1, . . . ∈ Q ∩ (0, 1) such
that

Pr[Aj] (cid:54) qrj · (cid:89)

At∈N (Aj )

t(cid:54)=j

Corollary 2.2. [Rumyantsev and Shen [17]] For each q ∈ (0, 1) there is an M such
that the following holds. Let σ0, σ1, . . . be a computable sequence of ﬁnite partial
functions N → 2, each of size at least M . Suppose that for each m (cid:62) M and
n, there are at most 2qm many j such that σj has size m and n ∈ dom(σj), and
that we can computably determine the set of all such j given m and n. Then there
is a computable c : N → 2 such that for each j there is an n ∈ dom(σj) with
c(n) = σj(n).

Corollary 2.3. For each q ∈ (0, 1) there is an M such that the following holds. Let
F0, F1, . . . be a computable sequence of ﬁnite sets, each of size at least M . Suppose
that for each m (cid:62) M and n, there are at most 2qm many j such that |Fj| = m and
n ∈ Fj, and that we can computably determine a canonical index for the set of all
such j given m and n. Then there is a computable c : N → 2 such that for each j
the set Fj is not homogeneous for c.
