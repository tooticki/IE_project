Definition 1.1. The pseudo-sum of two filters F and G is defined by letting for
every set A ⊆ N:
A ∈ F ⊕ G ⇐⇒ {n | A − n ∈ G } ∈ F
where A − n = {m ∈ N | m + n ∈ A} is the rightward shift of A by n.

Definition 1.2. An idempotent ultrafilter is an ultrafilter U which is idempotent
with respect to the pseudo-sum operation, i.e., U = U ⊕ U .

***
Definition 1.3. For filters F , G and ultrafilter V , let
F (V , G ) = {B ⊆ N | B ⊇ F ∩ AV for some F ∈ F and some A ∈ G }.

***
Proposition 1.4. [ZF] Let F be a filter, and let V be an ultrafilter. Then for
every filter G ⊇ F ⊕ V , the family F (V , G ) is a filter such that F ⊆ F (V , G )
and G ⊆ F (V , G ) ⊕ V .

***
Corollary 1.5. [ZF] Let F be a filter, and let V , W be ultrafilters where W ⊇
F ⊕ V . Then for every ultrafilter U we have:
(1) If U ⊇ F (V , W ) then U ⊕ V = W ;
(2) If U ⊕ V = W and F ⊆ U then F (V , W ) ⊆ U .

***
Corollary 1.6. [ZF+UT(N)] Let F be a filter and let V , W be ultrafilters. Then
W ⊇ F ⊕ V if and only if W = U ⊕ V for some ultrafilter U ⊇ F .

***
Definition 2.1. A filter F is additive if for every ultrafilter V ⊇ F , the pseudosum F ⊕ V ⊇ F ; that is, AV ∈ F for every A ∈ F .

***
Remark 2.2. In 1989, T. Papazyan [16] considered the almost translation invariant
filters F such that F ⊆ F ⊕ F , and showed that every maximal filter in that
class is necessarily an ultrafilter, and hence an idempotent ultrafilter. We remark
that almost translation invariance is a stronger notion with respect to addivity;
indeed, it is straightforwardly seen that any almost translation invariant filter is
additive, but not conversely. (For the latter assertion, see Example 3.9 in the next
section.) That same class of filters, named idempotent filters, has been thoroughly
investigated by P. Krautzberger in [15].

***
Example 2.3. Given an infinite set X = {x1 < x2 < . . .}, denote by
FS X = {A ⊆ N | A ⊇ FS(X \ F ) for some finite F ⊂ X} .
Clearly, FS X is a filter that contains FS(X). It just takes a quick check to verify
that FS X ⊆ FS X ⊕ F S X , and hence FS X is additive.

***
Proposition 2.4. [ZF+UT(N)] A filter F is additive if and only if F ⊆ U ⊕ V
for every pair of ultrafilters U , V ⊇ F .

***
Remark 2.5. If C is a nonempty closed sub-semigroup of (βN, ⊕) then
\
U
Fil(C) =
U ∈C

is an additive filter. To show this, notice first that if V ⊇ Fil(C) is an ultrafilter,
then V ∈ C = C. So, for all ultrafilters V , V 0 ⊇ Fil(C) one has that V ⊕ V 0 ∈ C
by the property of sub-semigroup, and hence V ⊕ V 0 ⊇ Fil(C). Conversely, if F is
an additive filter, then UT(N) implies that
Cl(F ) = {U ∈ βN | U ⊇ F }
is a nonempty closed sub-semigroup. Moreover, the two operations are one the
inverse of the other, since Cl(Fil(C)) = C and Fil(Cl(F )) = F for every nonempty
closed sub-semigroup C and for every additive filter F .

Proposition 2.7. [ZF] Let F be an additive filter. Then for every ultrafilter V

Theorem 2.8. [ZF+UT(N)] If a filter is maximal among the additive filters then
it is an idempotent ultrafilter.

***
Theorem 2.9. [ZFC] Every additive filter can be extended to an idempotent
ultrafilter.

***
Remark 2.10. As already pointed out in the introduction, with the only exception
of [16], the only known proof of existence of idempotent ultrafilters is grounded on
Ellis-Numakura’s Lemma, a general result in semigroup theory that establishes the
existence of idempotent elements in every compact right-topological semigroups.
An alternate argument to prove the above Theorem 2.9 can be obtained by
same pattern. Indeed, given an additive filter F , by Remark 2.5 we know that
C = Cl(F ) is a closed nonempty sub-semigroup of the compact right-topological
semigroup (βN, ⊕). In consequence, (C, ⊕) is itself a compact right-topological
semigroup, so Ellis-Numakura’s Lemma applies, and one gets the existence of an
idempotent element U ∈ C; clearly, U ⊇ F .

Proposition 3.1. [ZF] Assume there exists a choice function Φ that associates
to every additive filter F an ultrafilter Φ(F ) ⊇ F . Then there exists a choice
function Ψ that associates to every additive filter F an ultrafilter Ψ(F ) ⊇ F such
that Ψ(F ) ⊇ F ⊕ Ψ(F ).

***
Theorem 3.2. [ZF] Assume there exists a choice function Φ that associates to every
additive filter F an ultrafilter Φ(F ) ⊇ F . Then there exists a choice function Θ
that associates to every additive filter F an idempotent ultrafilter Θ(F ) ⊇ F .

***
Corollary 3.3. [ZF] Assume there exists a choice function Φ that associates to
every additive filter F an ultrafilter Φ(F ) ⊇ F . Then for every additively large
set A there exists an idempotent ultrafilter U where A ∈ U .

***
Proposition 3.4. [ZF+UT(R)] There exists a choice function Φ that associates to
every filter F on N an ultrafilter Φ(F ) ⊇ F .

***
Remark 3.5. In ZF, the property that “there exists a choice function Φ that
associates to every filter F on N an ultrafilter Φ(F ) ⊇ F ” is equivalent to the
property that “βN is compact and Loeb” (see [8, Proposition 1(ii)]). We remark
that the latter statement is strictly weaker than UT(R) in ZF (see [14, Theorem
10]).

***
Theorem 3.6. [ZF+UT(R)] Every additive filter can be extended to an idempotent
ultrafilter.

***
Remark 3.7. Since every idempotent filter F ⊆ F ⊕ F is readily seen to be
additive, as a straight corollary we obtain Paparyan’s result [16] that every maximal
idempotent filter is an idempotent ultrafilter.

***
Remark 3.8. The above Theorem 3.6 cannot be proved by ZF alone. Indeed,
since the Fréchet filter {A ⊆ N | N \ A is finite} is additive, one would obtain the
existence of a non-principal ultrafilter on N in ZF, against the well-known fact that
there exist models of ZF with no non-principal ultrafilters on N (see [13]).

Example 3.9. (ZF).
idempotent:

The following family is an additive filter which is not

F = {A ⊆ N | Ac is not FAL}.
First of all, the dual family F is a filter because the family of FAL sets is partition
regular. Recall that the latter property is a consequence of Folkman’s Theorem in
its finite version: “For every n and for every r there exists N such that for every
r-coloring {1, . . . , N } = C1 ∪ . . . ∪ Cr there exists a set S of cardinality n with
FS(S) monochromatic.” (For a ZF-proof of Folkman’s Theorem, see [6, Theorem
11, Lemma 12], pp. 81–82.)
In order to show that F is additive, fix any ultrafilter V ⊇ F ; we want to see
that F ⊆ F ⊕ V . Notice that every B ∈ V is FAL, as otherwise B c ∈ F ⊆ V
and we would have ∅ = B ∩ B c ∈ V . By the definitions, if A ∈
/ F ⊕ V then
AV = {n | A − n ∈ V } 6∈ F , i.e., (AV )c = {n | Ac − n ∈ V } is FAL. Then for
every n there exist x1 < . . . < xn T
such that Ac − s ∈ V for every s ∈ FS({xi }ni=1 ).
Since the finite intersection B = {Ac − s | s ∈ FS({xi }ni=1 )} also belongs to V ,
we can pick y1 < . . . < yn where y1 > x1 + . . . + xn such that FS({yi }ni=1 ) ⊆ B. It
is readily verified that x1 + y1 < . . . < xn + yn and that FS({xi + yi }ni=1 ) ⊆ Ac .
This shows that Ac is FAL, and hence A 6∈ F .
Let us now check that the filter F is not idempotent. To this end, we need some
preliminary work. Denote
P by N0 = N ∪ {0}, and let ψ : Fin(N0 ) → N0 be the
bijection where ψ(F ) = i∈F 2i for F 6= ∅ and ψ(∅) = 0. Notice that ψ(F ) +
ψ(G) = ψ(F 4G)+2·ψ(F ∩G), and also observe that for every H one has 2·ψ(H) =
ψ(1 + H) where 1 + H = {1 + h | h ∈ H}. In consequence, if E is the set of even
natural numbers, the following property is easily checked:
(?) Let F, G ∈ Fin(E). Then ψ(F ) + ψ(G) = ψ(H) for some H ∈ Fin(E) if
and only if F ∩ G = ∅ and F ∪ G = H.
S
Now fix a partition E = n∈N0 An of the even natural numbers into infinitely many
infinite sets, and define

	
X = ψ(F ∪ G) | ∅ 6= F ∈ Fin(A0 ) & ∅ =
6 G ∈ Fin(Aψ(F ) ) .
We will see that X c ∈ F and X c ∈
/ F ⊕ F , thus showing that F 6⊆ F ⊕ F .
The first property follows from the fact that there are no triples a, b, a + b ∈ X, and
hence X is not FAL. To see this, assume by contradiction that ψ(F1 ∪ G1 ) + ψ(F2 ∪
G2 ) = ψ(F3 ∪G3 ) for suitable nonempty F1 , F2 , F3 ∈ Fin(A0 ) and Gi ∈ Fin(Aψ(Fi ) ).
By the above property (?), it follows that (F1 ∪ G1 ) ∩ (F2 ∪ G2 ) = ∅, and hence
F1 ∩ F2 = ∅; moreover, (F1 ∪ G1 ) ∪ (F2 ∪ G2 ) = F3 ∪ G3 , and hence F1 ∪ F2 = F3 and
G1 ∪ G2 = G3 . This is not possible because F1 ∩ F2 = ∅ implies that F1 , F2 6= F3 ,
and so (G1 ∪ G2 ) ∩ G3 = ∅.
By the definitions, X c 6∈ F ⊕ F if and only if Ξ = {n | X c − n ∈ F } 6∈ F
if and only if Ξc = {n | X − n is FAL} is FAL, and this last property is true.
Indeed, for every nonempty F ∈ Fin(A0 ) and for every nonempty G ∈ Fin(Aψ(F ) ),
we have that F ∩ G = ∅ and so ψ(F ∪ G) = ψ(F ) + ψ(G). In consequence, the
set X − ψ(F ) ⊇ {ψ(G) | ∅ 6= G ∈ Fin(Aψ(F ) )} = FS(Aψ(F ) ) is additively large,
and hence FAL. But then also Ξc ⊇ {ψ(F ) | ∅ =
6 F ∈ Fin(A0 )} = FS(A0 ) is FAL
because it is additively large, as desired.

***
Remark 3.10. The above example is fairly related to Example 2.8 found in P.
Krautzberger’s thesis [15]; however there are relevant differences. Most notably,
besides the fact that different semigroups are considered, our example is carried
within ZF, whereas the proof in [15] requires certain weak forms of the axiom of
choice. Let us see in more detail.
In [15] one first considers a partial semigroup (F, ·) on the family F of finite subsets
of N where the partial operation is defined by means of disjoint unions, and then the
corresponding semigroup of ultrafilters (δF, ·) where δF is a suitable closed subspace
of βF. (See [15, Definition 1.4] for details.) By Graham-Rothschild parameter-sets
Theorem [5], the family of sets that contain arbitrarily large finite union sets10 is
partition regular, and so the following closed set is nonempty:
H = {U ∈ δF | (∀A ∈ U )(∀n ∈ N)(∃x1 < . . . < xn ) FU({xi }ni=1 ) ⊆ A}.
(Notice that UT(N) suffices to prove H 6= ∅; indeed, any ultrafilter on F extending
the filter {A ⊆ F | Ac does not contain arbitrarily large union sets} is in H.) It is
then shown that H is a sub-semigroup and that the filter
\
H = Fil(H) = {U | U ∈ H}
is not idempotent. This last property is proved by showing the existence of an
injective sequence of ultrafilters hUn | n ∈ Ni in H whose limit U -limn (n+Un ) ∈
/H
for a suitable U ∈ H; notice that here countably many choices are made.11
It is well-known that partition regularity results about finite unions can be (almost)
directly translated into partition regularity results about finite sums, and conversely
(see, e.g., [6, Theorem 13] and [12, pp.113-114]). Along these lines, our Example
3.9 can be seen as a translation of the above example to (βN, ⊕). We remark
that, besides some non-trivial adjustments, we paid attention not to use any form
of choice; to this end, we directly considered the dual filter
F = {A ⊆ N | Ac is not FAL}.
instead of the corresponding closed sub-semigroup {U
U )(A is FAL)}.

Remark 4.4. A detailed investigation of the strength of Ellis-Numakura’s Lemma
in the hierarchy of weak choice principles is found in [17]. In particular, in that
paper it is shown that either one of the Axiom of Multiple Choice MC or the
Ultrafilter Theorem UT (in its equivalent formulation given by the Boolean Prime
Ideal Theorem BPI) suffices to prove Ellis-Numakura’s Lemma.12 (The key point of
the proof is the fact that both MC and UT imply the existence of a choice function
for the family of nonempty closed sub-semigroups of any compact right topological
semigroup.) Recall that, as pointed out in Remark 2.5 , under the assumption of
UT(N) (or of MC, since MC ⇒ UT(N)), nonempty closed sub-semigroups of (βN, ⊕)
exactly correspond to additive filters, and so one obtains that either one of MC or
UT implies that every additive filter on N is extended to an idempotent ultrafilter.
