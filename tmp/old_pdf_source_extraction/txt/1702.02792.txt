Theorem 1.1. Let Γ be a countably infinite group. If Y ( {0, 1}Γ is a closed invariant proper
subset, then there exists a closed invariant subset X ⊆ {0, 1}Γ \ Y such that the action of Γ on X
is free and admits an invariant probability measure.

Theorem 2.1. [A corollary of the Lovász Local Lemma; Erdős–Lovász] Let A be a countable
set and let B be a correct instance over A. Then Sol(B) 6= ∅.

Proposition 2.2. Let B be an invariant instance over Γ and let α : Γ y (X, µ) be a measurepreserving action of Γ on a standard probability space (X, µ). Suppose that B admits a measurable
solution over α. Then the action of Γ on Sol(B) admits an invariant probability measure.

Theorem 2.3. [[4, Lemma 5.17]] Let λ denote the Lebesgue probability measure on [0; 1]. If B
is a correct invariant instance over Γ, then B admits a measurable solution over the shift action
Γ y ([0; 1]Γ , λΓ ).

Corollary 2.4. If B is a correct invariant instance over Γ, then the action of Γ on Sol(B) admits
