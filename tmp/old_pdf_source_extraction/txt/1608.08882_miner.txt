ON THE DIRECT SUMMAND CONJECTURE AND ITS DERIVED VARIANT

BHARGAV BHATT

ABSTRACT. Andr´e recently gave a beautiful proof of Hochster’s direct summand conjecture in commutative algebra using
perfectoid spaces; his two main results are a generalization of the almost purity theorem (the perfectoid Abhyankar lemma)
and a construction of certain faithfully ﬂat extensions of perfectoid algebras where “discriminants” acquire all p-power roots.
In this paper, we explain a quicker proof of Hochster’s conjecture that circumvents the perfectoid Abhyankar lemma;
instead, we prove and use a quantitative form of Scholze’s Hebbarkeitssatz (the Riemann extension theorem) for perfectoid
spaces. The same idea also leads to a proof of a derived variant of the direct summand conjecture put forth by de Jong.

1. INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst goal of this paper is to give a simpler proof of the following recent result of Andr´e, settling the direct

summand conjecture:
Theorem 1.1 (Andr´e). Let i : A0 (cid:44)→ B0 be a ﬁnite extension of noetherian rings. Assume that A0 is regular. Then
the inclusion i is split as an A0-module map.

When A0 has characteristic 0, Theorem 1.1 is easy to prove using the trace map. When dim(A0) ≤ 2, one can
prove Theorem 1.1 using the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula. Hochster conjectured the general case in 1969, and
proved it when A0 has characteristic p in [Ho1]. The ﬁrst general result in mixed characteristic was Heitmann’s [He],
settling the case of dimension 3. More on the history of this conjecture and its centrality amongst the ‘homological
conjectures’ in commutative algebra can be found in [Ho3]. The result above is proven by Andr´e [An2] using [An1].
In this paper, we give a proof of Theorem 1.1 that avoids [An1] (and is independent of [An2] in terms of exposition).
Our approach also adapts to yield the following derived variant, which was conjectured by Johan de Jong in the course
of the author’s thesis work [Bh1, Bh3] as a path towards understanding the direct summand conjecture:
Theorem 1.2. Let A0 be a regular noetherian ring. Let f0 : X0 → Spec(A0) be a proper surjective map. Then the
map A0 → RΓ(X0, OX0) splits in the derived category D(A0).

When A0 has characteristic 0, this result is due to Kov´acs [Ko], and is deduced from the fact that Spec(A0) has
rational singularities; see also [Bh1, Theorem 2.12]. The characteristic p case follows from [Bh1, Theorem 1.4 &
Example 2.3]. To the best of our knowledge, in mixed characteristic, Theorem 1.2 is new even when dim(A0) = 2.

Remark 1.3. Again, Theorem 1.1 was proven by Andr´e. Although it is explained in more detail and with more context
in the body of the paper, the main contributions of this paper (as we see it) are:

(1) To clearly explain why Andr´e’s relatively simple ﬂatness lemma from [An2, §2.5] (reproduced in a slightly
cleaned up form in Theorem 2.3) is the essential new ingredient in the solution of the direct summand
conjecture. Indeed, using this lemma, we reprove the conjecture using only the quantitative Hebbarkeitssatz
(which is a simple linear statement about a ﬁxed and explicit system of modules over a perfectoid ring, see
Theorem 4.2 and its proof); in contrast, the approach in [An2] relies on the perfectoid Abhyankar lemma from
[An1] (which is a deep non-linear assertion describing an entire class of algebras over a perfectoid ring).

(2) To use these techniques to establish derived version of the direct summand conjecture (i.e., Theorem 1.2).
Note that Theorem 1.2 has a range of geometric implications that are inaccessible from Theorem 1.1. For
example, it implies that passage to alterations of a regular afﬁne scheme can often be lossless for coherent
cohomological purposes. In fact, even the special case of Theorem 1.2 where f0 is birational is a slightly
nontrivial assertion about blowups (related to the work in [CR]), and completely orthogonal to Theorem 1.1.

Assumption 1.4. In the rest of the introduction, primarily for notational ease, we assume that A0 := (cid:92)W [x1, .., xd]
is the p-adic completion of a polynomial ring over an unramiﬁed dvr W of mixed characterisitic (0, p); there is a
standard reduction of Theorem 1.1 to mild variants of such an A0, so not much generality is lost.
1.1. The strategy of Andr´e’s proof. Andr´e’s proof of Theorem 1.1 uses perfectoid spaces [Sc1]. To see why this
p ] → B0[ 1
is natural, we ﬁrst informally outline the main idea, adapted from [Bh2], in the special case where A0[ 1
p ]
is ´etale. The crucial input is Faltings’ almost purity theorem [Fa4]1, which asserts: if A∞,0 is the p-adic completion
p ] is almost ﬁnite
of A0[x
p∞ ) ⊂ A∞,0. Concretely, the algebraic obstructions to A∞,0 → B∞
´etale over A∞,0 with respect to the ideal (p
being ﬁnite ´etale — such as the cokernel of the trace map B∞ → A∞,0 or the Ext1-class measuring the failure of
A∞,0 → B∞ to split — are killed by p
pk for all k ≥ 0, and are thus quite ‘small’. The faithful ﬂatness of A0 → A∞,0
and the noetherianness of A0 then let one conclude that A0 → B0 must actually split. Summarizing, the key ideas are:

(1) The construction of the faithfully ﬂat extension A0 → A∞,0.
(2) The almost splitting after base change to A∞,0 coming from the almost purity theorem.

It is now easy to see why perfectoid spaces provide a natural conceptual home for this proof: the ring A∞,0 in (1) is
(integral) perfectoid2, and the almost purity theorem invoked in (2) is a general fact valid for ﬁnite extensions of any
perfectoid algebra that are ´etale after inverting p (due to Kedlaya-Liu [KL] and Scholze [Sc1]).

Andr´e’s proof of Theorem 1.1 follows a similar outline to the one sketched above. The ﬁrst major difference is that

A∞,0 is replaced by a larger perfectoid extension A∞ of A∞,0 coming from the following remarkable construction:
Theorem 1.5 (Andr´e). Fix g ∈ A0. Then there exists a map A∞,0 → A∞ of integral perfectoid algebras that is
almost faithfully ﬂat modulo p such that the element g ∈ A0 admits a compatible system of p-power roots g
pk in A∞.
Andr´e’s proof of Theorem 1.5 relies crucially on perfectoid geometry, and is explained in §2. For the application to
g ] is ﬁnite ´etale. The

Theorem 1.1, one chooses g ∈ A0 to be a discriminant, i.e., an element g such that A0[ 1
ﬂatness assertions in Theorem 1.5 then reduce us almost splitting the base change A∞ → B0 ⊗A0 A∞.

g ] → B0[ 1

To construct an almost splitting over A∞, Andr´e proves a much stronger result, which forms the subject of [An1]:
he generalizes the almost purity theorem to describe extensions of A∞ that are ´etale after inverting g (almost purity
corresponds to g = p). The output is roughly that the integral closure B∞ of B0 ⊗A0 A∞ in B0 ⊗A0 A∞[ 1
g ] is almost
p∞ ) ⊂ A∞; the precise statement
ﬁnite ´etale over A∞, where ‘almost mathematics’ is measured with respect to ((pg)
is more subtle, and we do not formulate it here as we do not need it.
1.2. The strategy of our proof. Our proof uses Theorem 1.5. Thus, the task is to (almost) split A0 → B0 after base
change to the ring A∞ arising from Theorem 1.5. For this, we again use perfectoid geometry. More precisely, for each
n ≥ 1, the general theory gives us the perfectoid ring A∞(cid:104) pn

g (cid:105) of bounded functions on the rational subset

Un := {x ∈ X | |pn| ≤ |g(x)|}

of the perfectoid space X associated to A∞. These rings naturally form a projective system as n varies (since Un ⊂
Un+1), and can be almost described very explicitly: to get A∞(cid:104) pn
g and its p-power roots to
g (cid:105), so A0 → B0 becomes ﬁnite ´etale after base change to
A. Their main utility to us3 is that g divides pn in A∞(cid:104) pn

g (cid:105), one formally adjoins pn

1Faltings’ theory of almost mathematics, in one incarnation, describes commutative algebra over a ring V equipped with a nonzerodivisor
f ∈ V that admits arbitrary p-power roots. More precisely, one works in the quotient of the abelian category of V -modules by the Serre category
p∞ )-torsion modules. The study of such ‘almost modules’ was inspired by Tate’s [Ta], and led Faltings to prove fundamental results in
of all (f
p-adic Hodge theory [Fa1, Fa2, Fa3, Fa4]. Following Faltings’ work, a systematic investigation of almost mathematics was carried by Gabber and
Ramero [GR, GR2]. The relevance of almost mathematics to the direct summand conjecture seems to be ﬁrst suggested by Roberts [Ro], [GR, §0].
2A precise deﬁnition is given in §1.4. The crucial consequence of a ring R being perfectoid is that the Frobenius R/p → R/p is surjective, and
has a large but controlled kernel. Under suitable completeness and torsionfreeness hypotheses, this leads to the existence of lots of elements that
admit arbitrary p-power roots, such as the elements p and xi in R = A∞,0.

3The idea of using this tower of rings to study A∞ also comes from [An1].

p ] for any n ≥ 0; the almost purity theorem then kicks in to show that for each n ≥ 0, the base change of
g (cid:105) is almost split. To descend the splitting to A∞, we prove the following

A∞(cid:104) pn
A0 → B0 to the perfectoid algebra A∞(cid:104) pn
quantitative form of Scholze’s Riemann extension theorem [Sc2, Proposition II.3.2].

is an almost-pro-isomorphism with respect to (pg)
pro-isomorphic to a pro-system of (pg)
g (cid:105),
Remark 1.7. On taking limits over n and m in Theorem 1.6, one obtains an almost isomorphism A∞ a(cid:39) lim A∞(cid:104) pn
i.e., the following statement from [Sc2, Proposition II.3.2]: any bounded function on the Zariski open set {x ∈
X| g(x) (cid:54)= 0} = ∪nUn ⊂ X almost extends to X. In other words, this gives a perfectoid analog of the Riemann
extension theorem in complex geometry. A similar result in rigid geometry was proven by Bartenwerfer [Ba].
Remark 1.8. Theorem 1.6 roughly says that the limiting isomorphism A∞ a(cid:39) lim A∞(cid:104) pn
g (cid:105) from Remark 1.7 holds true
A∞(N,−)
for ‘diagrammatic’ reasons. Consequently, it remains true after applying A∞-linear functors, such as Exti
for any A∞-module N, to both sides of (1) and then taking limits. The case i = 0 recovers Scholze’s theorem, the
case i = 1 is essential to Theorem 1.1, and Theorem 1.2 relies on the statement for all i ≥ 0.

Using Theorem 1.6, the proof of Theorem 1.1 proceeds along the lines sketched above, and can thus be summarized
as follows: pass from A0 to A∞ using Theorem 1.5 to ensure this passage is lossless, pass from A∞ to A∞(cid:104) pn
g (cid:105) to
push all the ramiﬁciation into characteristic p, construct an almost splitting over A∞(cid:104) pn
g (cid:105) using almost purity, and
ﬁnally take a limit over n to get an almost splitting over A∞ thanks to Theorem 1.6. In particular, it is exactly the last
step (relying on the relatively simple module-theoretic statement in Theorem 1.6) where our approach to Theorem 1.1
diverges from that of [An2] (which relies on the sophisticated perfectoid Abhyankar lemma [An1]).

To prove Theorem 1.2, we proceed analogously. First, assume that f0 ramiﬁes only in characteristic p, i.e., f0[ 1

p ] is
ﬁnite ´etale. Again, it sufﬁces to construct the splitting after going up to a faithfully ﬂat integral perfectoid extension
of A0 (such as the ring A∞,0 above). After such a base change, the almost purity theorem and a general vanishing
theorem of Scholze settle the question. In general, one ﬁrst reduces to f0 being generically ﬁnite, and ﬁnite ´etale after
inverting some g ∈ A0. This case is then deduced from preceding special case using Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.6,
exactly as was explained above for Theorem 1.1.
1.3. Layout. We begin in §2 by recalling Andr´e’s proof of Theorem 1.5 (in a slightly more general setup). Theorem 1.6
is proven in §4; this depends on the notion of almost mathematics of pro-systems, which is brieﬂy developed in §3.
With these ingredients in place, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are proven in §5 and §6 respectively.
1.4. Notation. We freely use the language of perfectoid spaces and almost mathematics. Occasionally, we use almost
mathematics with respect to different ideals in the same ring; thus we always specify the relevant ideal, sometimes at
the beginning of each section. The letter K denotes a perfectoid ﬁeld4, and K◦ ⊂ K is the ring of integers. We ﬁx an
element t ∈ K◦ which admits arbitrary p-power roots t
pk , and such that |t| = |p| if K has characteristic 0. A K◦-
algebra A is called integral perfectoid if it is ﬂat, t-adically complete, satisﬁes5 A = A∗, and satisﬁes the following:
p (cid:39) A/t. The category of such algebras is equivalent to usual category of

The main goal of this section is to construct an almost faithfully ﬂat extension A → A∞ of perfectoid algebras
p∞ (cid:105). More precisely, to

such that g acquires arbitrary p-power roots in A∞. For this, we essentially set T = g in A(cid:104)T

Deﬁnition 2.2. Set A∞ to be the integral perfectoid6 ring of functions on the Zariski closed subset of Y deﬁned by
the ideal (T − g), in the sense of [Sc2, §II.2]. Explicitly, we have

A∞ = (cid:91)colim

Note that T = g in A∞ as (T − g) is divisible by t(cid:96) in B(cid:96), and thus in A∞, for all (cid:96). Thus, g has a distinguished

Remark 2.4. Theorem 2.3 is proven in [An2] under a more restrictive setup (but with a stronger conclusion). I am
grateful to Scholze for pointing out that the same proof goes through in the above generality.

Remark 2.5. One might worry that the presentations from [Sc1, Lemma 6.4] used above are only valid in the non-
derived sense, and thus do not play well with reduction modulo t or t-adic completion. More precisely, one may ask if
(2) is also true if one imposes the corresponding relations in the derived sense (i.e., one works with the corresponding
Koszul complexes). While answering this question is not necessary for our purposes, the answer is indeed ‘yes’, and
we record it here for psychological comfort, especially since such presentations are also important later.
Lemma 2.6. Let A be an integral perfectoid K◦-algebra. Choose f1, ..., fn, g ∈ A(cid:91), and set B to be the direct limit
p∞
of the Koszul complexes Kos(A[T

In particular, all operations in the proof of Theorem 2.3 can be interpreted in the derived sense.

Remark 2.7. One may upgrade the above techniques to show the following (see [Bh4, Corollary 9.4.7]): for any
integral perfectoid K◦-algebra A, there exists a functorial map A → B(A) of integral perfectoid K◦-algebras that
is almost faithfully ﬂat modulo t such that B(A) is absolutely integrally closed, i.e., each monic polynomial has a
solution. In particular, any b ∈ B(A) admits a compatible system {b

pn }n≥1 of p-power roots.

We introduce the relevant notion of almost mathematics in the pro-category necessary for Theorem 1.6.

There is an intrinsic notion of almost mathematics of pro-A-modules: one might simply work with pro-objects in
the almost category. For example, a projective system {Mn}n≥1 of A-modules is ‘almost-zero’ as a pro-object if for
any n ≥ 1, there exists some m = m(n) ≥ n such that the map Mm → Mn has image annihilated by t
pk for all k.
This intrinsic notion is too strong for our purposes, and we use the following weakening, where m depends on k:

1

5

Deﬁnition 3.2. A pro-A-module {Mn}n≥1 is said to be almost-pro-zero if for any k ≥ 0 and any n ≥ 1, there
exists some m = m(n, k) ≥ n such that im(Mm → Mn) is killed by t
pk ; equivalently, for each k ≥ 0, the map
pk ]}n≥1 → {Mn}n≥1 is a pro-isomorphism in the usual sense. A map of pro-objects in Db(A) is said to be an
{Mn[t
almost-pro-isomorphism if the cohomology groups of cones form an almost-pro-zero system.

1

We begin with an example illustrating the novel features of this notion:

Example 3.3. Consider the system {Mn} where Mn = A/(t
by 1 (cid:55)→ t
corresponding pro-object of the almost category is not zero.

pn+1 . Then {Mn} is almost-pro-zero (in fact, each Mm is killed by t

pn ), and Mn+1 → Mn is the injective map deﬁned
pk for m ≥ k), even though the

The next few lemmas record the stability properties of this notion:

Lemma 3.4. If {Mn}n≥1 is an almost-pro-zero pro-A-module, then the complex R lim({Mn}n≥1) is almost zero,
i.e., it has almost zero cohomology groups.
Proof. Fix k ≥ 0. Then the inclusion {Mn[t
R lim. In particular, the cohomology groups of R lim({Mn}n≥1) are killed by t
Lemma 3.5. If {Nn}n≥1 → {Mn}n≥1 is an almost-pro-isomorphism in Db(A), then R lim({Nn}n≥1) → R lim({Mn}n≥1)
is an almost isomorphism.

pk ]}n≥1 → {Mn}n≥1 is a pro-isomorphism, so both sides have the same
(cid:3)

pk .

(cid:3)
Proof. This follows by applying Lemma 3.4 to the cone.
Lemma 3.6. If {Mn}n≥1 is an almost-pro-zero pro-A-module, and F : ModA → ModA is an A-linear functor, then
{F (Mn)}n≥1 is also almost-pro-zero.
Proof. Fix k ≥ 0, n ≥ 1. Then Mm → Mn factors over Mn[t
F (Mn) factors over F (Mn[t

pk ] ⊂ Mn for some m ≥ n. But then F (Mm) →
(cid:3)

pk ]) → F (Mn), and hence over F (Mn)[t

pk ] (cid:44)→ F (Mn), by the A-linearity of F .

More precisely, we show the following quantitative form of Scholze’s Hebbarkeitssatz [Sc2, Proposition II.3.2]:

(1) Each ker(fn) is almost zero.
(2) The pro-system {coker(fn)}n≥1 is uniformly almost-pro-zero with respect to g

exists some c ≥ 0 such that for any n ≥ 0, the image of the c-fold transition map coker(fn+c) → coker(fn)

5. THE DIRECT SUMMAND CONJECTURE

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.1. We begin by collecting some preliminaries that shall be useful in the proof.
The following proposition is borrowed from [BMS, Lemma 4.30 and Remark 4.31], and is presumably well-known:
Proposition 5.1. Let A → B be a map of commutative rings with A is noetherian. Assume that there exists some
π ∈ A such that both A and B are π-torsionfree and π-adically complete, and A/π → B/π is (faithfully) ﬂat. Then
A → B is (faithfully) ﬂat.
Proof. For ﬂatness: we must check that M ⊗L
A B lies in D≥0 for any ﬁnitely generated A-module M. As A is
noetherian, we can choose a resolution P • → M with each P i being ﬁnite free. The complex M ⊗L
A B is then
computed by P •⊗A B. As B is π-adically complete, we have P •⊗A B (cid:39) limn P •⊗A B/πn at the level of complexes.
The transition maps in the system on the right are termwise surjective, so we can write this more intrinsically as

M ⊗L

A B (cid:39) R lim

(M ⊗L

A B/πn) (cid:39) R lim

((M ⊗L

A A/πn) ⊗L

A/πn B/πn).

n

n

As M is ﬁnitely generated, the pro-A-complex {M ⊗L
pro-system {M [πn]}, which is pro-zero as the π∞-torsion of M is bounded by ﬁnite generation. Thus, we obtain

A A/πn} is pro-isomorphic to {M/πn}: the obstruction is the

M ⊗L

A B (cid:39) R lim

(M/πn ⊗L

A/πn B/πn).

n

As A/π → B/π is ﬂat, the same holds true for A/πn → B/πn as π is a nonzerodivisor on both A and B. In
particular, the terms showing up inside the limit lie in D≥0, so the same holds true for the limit, as wanted.

For faithful ﬂatness, we must check that Spec(B) → Spec(A) is surjective if A → B is ﬂat and A/π → B/π is
faithfully ﬂat. As the image is stable under generalizations by ﬂatness, it sufﬁces to check that all closed points lie
in the image; equivalently, we must show that A/m ⊗A B (cid:54)= 0 for any maximal ideal m in A. But π ∈ m as A is
π-adically complete, so A/m ⊗A B (cid:39) A/m ⊗A/π B/π, which is nonzero by faithful ﬂatness of A/π → B/π.
(cid:3)

Next, we explain why regular local rings admit faithfully ﬂat covers by perfectoids.

Proposition 5.2. Let A0 be a p-torsionfree noetherian regular local ring whose residue characteristic is p. Then there
exists a map A0 → A such that

(cid:92)

1

p∞ ).

(1) The ring A admits the structure of an integral perfectoid K-algebra for K =
(2) The map A0 → A is “almost faithfully ﬂat” in the following sense: for any A0-module M, we have

Qp(p

(a) TorA0
i (M, A) is almost zero for i > 0.
(b) If M ⊗A0 A is almost zero, then M = 0.

In the unramiﬁed case, we can also arrange for A0 → A to be faithfully ﬂat. The proof below shows that it is
possible to achieve the same in general provided we make either one of the following modiﬁcations: (a) relax (1) above
to only requiring either that A is an integral perfectoid ring in a generalized sense (i.e., one that does not necessarily
contain a perfectoid ﬁeld, as elaborated in the proof below), or (b) only require A to be a p-adically complete and
p-torsionfree K◦-algebra that is almost isomorphic to an integral perfectoid K◦-algebra. Related constructions occur
in [Sh, Proposition 4.9] or [An1, Example 3.4.6 (3)].

Proof. We are free to replace A0 by noetherian regular local rings that are faithfully ﬂat over it. Thus, we may assume
that A0 is complete for the topology deﬁned by powers of the maximal ideal, and has an algebraically closed residue
ﬁeld k. Let W = W (k) be the Witt vectors of k, and write m ⊂ A0 for the maximal ideal. Write d = dim(A0).
Assume p /∈ m2 (which is the so-called unramiﬁed case). Then p is part of a basis of m/m2, and thus A0 is
]. In
this case, the map A0 → A is faithfully ﬂat by Proposition 5.1 (and thus also almost faithfully ﬂat by the argument
given at the end of this proof for the ramiﬁed case). Note that this case sufﬁces Theorem 1.1 by [Ho2, Theorem 6.1].
Assume p ∈ m2 (which is the so-called ramiﬁed case). By choosing d generators for m, we obtain a surjection

isomorphic to W(cid:74)x2, ..., xd(cid:75). In this case, we may simply take A to be the p-adic completion of A0[p
ψ : P0 := W(cid:74)x1, ..., xd(cid:75) → A0. Using the regularity of A0 and the assumption p ∈ m2, it is easy to see that ker(ψ) is

generated by an element of the form p − f where f = f (xi) ∈ (p, x1, ..., xd)2 is a power series. Moreover, as A0 is
p-torsionfree and p-adically complete, we may also conclude that p (cid:45) f and f has no constant term. Now write Pm =
], and consider the ring A(cid:48) obtained as the p-adic completion of (colimm Pm) ⊗P0 A0 (cid:39) colimm Pm/(p −
P0[x
f ). As P0 → Pm is faithfully ﬂat, it is easy to see that A0 → A(cid:48) is also faithfully ﬂat. Moreover, the element
i ) ∈ P1 satisﬁes gp = f + ph for some h ∈ P1; here σ is the (unique) lift of the Frobenius
g = σ−1(f )(x
automorphism of k to W , and σ−1(f ) is the power series obtained by applying σ−1 to the coefﬁcients of f. As f
and g have no constant terms, nor does h. In A(cid:48), this gives gp = p + ph = p(1 + h) = pu for some unit u ∈ A(cid:48).
In particular, the ring A(cid:48) equipped with the p-adic topology is integral perfectoid in a generalized sense, i.e., the
topological ring A(cid:48)[ 1
p ] (topologized by making pnA(cid:48) a neighbourhood basis of 0) is a perfectoid Tate ring in the sense
of [SW, Deﬁnition 6.1.1], and A(cid:48) is a ring of integral elements in A(cid:48)[ 1
p ]. The proof of [SW, see Lemma 6.2.2] gives an
element π ∈ A(cid:48) admitting a compatible system of p-power roots such that πp = pv for some unit v ∈ A(cid:48). Henceforth,
almost mathematics over A(cid:48) is measured with respect to (π
independent of the choice of π or its roots.

p∞ ); this also coincides with the ideal(cid:112)(p), and is thus

p ] → A(cid:48)[ 1

Now the theory of perfectoid spaces extends to the generalized setting, see [SW, §6], [GR2, §16], and [KL, §3].
Consider the ind-(ﬁnite ´etale) extension A(cid:48)[ 1
p∞ ] obtained by formally extracting p-power roots of v from
p ]. By the almost purity theorem [Sc1, Theorem 7.9 (iii)], the π-adic completion A of the integral closure of A(cid:48) in
A(cid:48)[ 1
this extension of A(cid:48)[ 1
p ] is the π-adic completion of an ind-(almost ﬁnite ´etale) extension of A(cid:48). In particular, A is an
integral perfectoid ring in the generalized sense, there is no π-torsion in A, and the map A(cid:48) → A is almost faithfully
ﬂat modulo π. By construction, the element p = πpv−1 ∈ A(cid:48) admits a compatible system of p-power roots, so A(cid:48) can
also be viewed as an integral perfectoid algebra over K◦ for K =
p∞ ) in the sense used elsewhere in this article
(at least after application of (−)∗, which is harmless for for our purposes). Note that ideals (p
p∞ ) in A

are identical (and both coincide with(cid:112)(p)), so there is a natural notion of almost mathematics over A.

It remains to check that the composite map A0 → A satisﬁes (2). This map factorizes as

a−→ A(cid:48) b−→ A!!

c−→ A

A0

where (−)!! is deﬁned as in [GR, Deﬁnition 2.2.23]. By construction, the map a is faithfully ﬂat and the map c is an
injective almost isomorphism. In particular, A!! is p-adically complete and p-torsionfree as A is so. As the formation of
(−)!! commutes with reduction modulo pm (see [GR, Remark 2.2.28 (ii)]), it follows from the almost faithful ﬂatness
modulo pm of A(cid:48) → A and [GR, Remark 3.1.3 (ii)] that b is faithfully ﬂat modulo pm for any m ≥ 0. The composite
b ◦ a is then faithfully ﬂat by Proposition 5.1. As c is an almost isomorphism, this veriﬁes (a) in (2).
For (b) in (2), say M is an A0-module with M ⊗A0 A almost zero. As c is an almost isomorphism, this is equivalent
to asking M ⊗A0 A!! is almost zero. We want to show M = 0. As A0 → A!! is faithfully ﬂat, we may ﬁlter M to
reduce to the case where M = A0/I for some ideal I ⊂ A0. The hypothesis M ⊗A0 A!! being almost zero then
A!! for all n ≥ 0. By faithful ﬂatness of
pn ∈ IA!! for all n ≥ 0. But this implies p = πpv−1 ∈ I pn
translates to π
A0 → A!!, we must have p ∈ I pn for all n ≥ 0. But Krull’s intersection theorem implies ∩nI pn
= 0 if I is non-trivial.
As p (cid:54)= 0 on A0, we must therefore have I = A0, and thus M = 0 as wanted.
(cid:3)

Finally, we recall a slightly non-standard consequence of the Artin-Rees lemma.

Lemma 5.3. Let R be a noetherian ring equipped with an ideal I. For any pair M, N of ﬁnitely generated R-modules,
the pro-R-modules {HomR(M, N )/I n}n≥1 and {HomR(M, N/I nN )}n≥1 are pro-isomorphic via the natural map.
In particular, lim1 HomR(M, N/I nN ) = 0.
Proof. We shall use the Artin-Rees lemma in the following form: the functor P (cid:55)→ {P/I n} is an exact functor from
ﬁnitely generated R-modules P to pro-R-modules. To apply this, pick a presentation

1

9

with Fi being ﬁnite free. Applying HomR(−, N ) gives an exact sequence

0 → HomR(M, N ) → HomR(F0, N ) → HomR(F1, N ).

F1 → F0 → M → 0

The previously mentioned form of the Artin-Rees lemma then yields an exact sequence of pro-R-modules of the form

0 → {HomR(M, N )/I n}n≥1 → {HomR(F0, N )/I n}n≥1 → {HomR(F1, N )/I n}n≥1.

Repeating this analysis using the functor HomR(−, N/I nN ) instead gives an exact sequence of pro-R-modules

0 → {HomR(M, N/I nN )}n≥1 → {HomR(F0, N/I nN )}n≥1 → {HomR(F1, N/I nN )}n≥1.

Comparing the sequences yields the lemma as HomR(Fi, N/I nN ) (cid:39) HomR(Fi, N )/I n since Fi is ﬁnite free.

(cid:3)

We can now prove the promised theorem.

Theorem 5.4. Let A0 be a regular ring. The map A0 → B0 of A0-modules is split.
Proof. We may assume that A0 is a noetherian regular local ring of mixed characteristic (0, p). Choose g ∈ A0
coprime to p such that A0 → B0 is ﬁnite ´etale after inverting pg. Let A0 → A∞,0 be the extension provided by
Proposition 5.2, and let A∞,0 → A∞ be the extension resulting from applying Theorem 2.3 to the integral perfectoid
ring A∞,0 equipped with the element g.
Consider the canonical exact triangle

A0 → B0 → Q0

of A0-modules. The boundary map α0 ∈ HomA0(Q0, A0[1]) is the obstruction to this sequence being split. We would
like this show this obstruction vanishes. We change subscript to denote derived base change to either A∞,0 or A∞;
for example, Q∞,0 := Q0 ⊗L

A∞,0, α∞ := α0 ⊗L

First, it sufﬁces to show that α0/pm ∈ HomA0(Q0, A0/pm[1]) vanishes for all m (cid:29) 0. Indeed, we have

A∞, etc.

all m, so we are done. Otherwise, by Krull’s theorem, there exists k ≥ 0 such that p2g /∈(cid:0)AnnA0/pm (α0/pm)(cid:1)pk

Choose m ≥ 3 such that α0/pm (cid:54)= 0, so AnnA0/pm(α0/pm) (cid:54)= A0/pm; if no such m exists, then α0/pm = 0 for

here we use that m ≥ 3 and that 0 (cid:54)= g ∈ A0/p. As both A0/pm → A∞,0/pm and A∞,0/pm → A∞/pm are almost

faithfully ﬂat with respect to p
It is thus enough (via contradiction) to show that

Remark 5.5. The proof given above goes through for any noetherian ring A0 that admits a faithfully ﬂat extension
which is integral perfectoid. Thus, one may ask: does this condition characterize regularity? In other words, is there a
p-adic analog of Kunz’s theorem characterizing regularity in characteristic p as the ﬂatness of Frobenius? A positive
answer to this question will appear in forthcoming work of the author with Iyengar and Ma.

6. THE DERIVED DIRECT SUMMAND CONJECTURE

The goal of this section is to prove Theorem 1.2

Theorem 6.1. Let A0 be a regular noetherian ring, and let f0 : X0 → Spec(A0) be a proper surjective map. Then
the map A0 → RΓ(X0, OX0 ) splits in D(A0).
Proof. We may assume A0 is a regular local ring. By taking the closure of a suitable generically deﬁned multisection,
we may assume that X0 is integral and f0 is generically ﬁnite. Then we can choose g ∈ A0 coprime to p such that
f0 is ﬁnite ´etale after inverting pg. Construct A∞,0 and A∞ as Theorem 5.4. Repeating the argument in the proof of
Theorem 5.4, we must show that for ﬁxed m, n ≥ 1, the map

g (cid:105)) is proper
is almost split with respect to p
and ﬁnite ´etale after inverting p (as g divides pn on the base), Proposition 6.2 and a diagram chase ﬁnish the proof. (cid:3)

The following special case of Theorem 6.1 is the crucial one:

Proposition 6.2. Let A be an integral perfectoid K◦-algebra, and set S = Spec(A). Let f : Y → S be a proper
morphism such that f [ 1

p ] is ﬁnite ´etale. Then A → RΓ(Y, OY ) is almost split.

Proof. Let B = H 0(Y, OY ), so B is an integral extension of A which is ﬁnite ´etale after inverting p, and Y is naturally
a B-scheme. Almost purity [Sc1, Theorem 7.9 (iii)] gives a map B → C which is an isomorphism after inverting p
such that the induced map A → C is an almost ﬁnite ´etale cover. In particular, C is integral perfectoid, and A → C
is almost split. Thus, on replacing A with C and Y with Y ⊗B C, we may assume that f [ 1
p ] is an isomorphism. But

then the p-adic completion (cid:98)f of f can be dominated by an admissible blowup of S. Set Sη = Spa(A[ 1

associated afﬁnoid perfectoid space, so the natural map (Sη, O+

Taking cohomology of the structure sheaf gives

Now a ◦ b is an almost isomorphism by Scholze’s vanishing theorem [Sc1, Proposition 6.14], so b is almost split. (cid:3)
