Proposition 2.1. [Theorem 4.1 in [4], Theorem 2.1 in [18]] Given two probability measures
Âµ1 and Âµ2 on R, there exist unique analytic functions, Ï‰1 , Ï‰2 : C+ â†’ C+ , such that,
(i) for all z âˆˆ C+ , Im Ï‰1 (z), Im Ï‰2 (z) â‰¥ Im z, and

FÂµ2 (Ï‰1 (z)) âˆ’ Ï‰1 (z) âˆ’ Ï‰2 (z) + z = 0 .

***
Proposition 2.2. [Theorem 2.3 in [5], Theorem 3.3 in [6]] Let Âµ1 and Âµ2 be compactly
supported probability measures on R, none of them being a single point mass. Then the
functions FÂµ1 Âµ2 , Ï‰1 , Ï‰2 : C+ â†’ C+ extend continuously to R.

***
Proposition 2.3. [Theorem 3.3 in [6]] Let Âµ1 and Âµ2 be as above and fix any x âˆˆ UÂµ1 Âµ2 .
Then FÂµ1 Âµ2 , Ï‰1 , Ï‰2 : C+ â†’ C+ extend analytically around x. In particular, the density
function fÂµ1 Âµ2 is real analytic in UÂµ1 Âµ2 wherever positive.

***
Definition 2.4. The regular bulk of the measure Âµ1  Âµ2 is defined as the set

	
BÂµ1 Âµ2 := UÂµ1 Âµ2 \ x âˆˆ UÂµ1 Âµ2 : fÂµ1 Âµ2 (x) = 0 .

(2.9)

***
Theorem 2.5. Let Âµ1 and Âµ2 be compactly supported probability measures on R, and assume
that neither is supported at a single point and that at least one of them is supported at more
than two points. Let I âŠ‚ BÂµ1 Âµ2 be a compact non-empty interval and fix some 0 < Î·M < âˆž.
Then there are two constants k > 0 and S < âˆž, both depending on the measures Âµ1 and Âµ2 ,
on the interval I as well as on the constant Î·M , such that following statements hold.
(i) The imaginary parts Im Ï‰1 and Im Ï‰2 of the subordination functions associated
with Âµ1 and Âµ2 satisfy
min
zâˆˆSI (0,Î·M )

Im Ï‰1 (z) â‰¥ 2k ,

min
zâˆˆSI (0,Î·M )

Im Ï‰2 (z) â‰¥ 2k .

(2.14)

(ii) The system Î¦Âµ1 ,Âµ2 (Ï‰1 , Ï‰2 , z) = 0 is linearly S-stable at (Ï‰1 (z), Ï‰2 (z)) uniformly in
SI (0, Î·M ), i.e.,
max
zâˆˆSI (0,Î·M )

Î“Âµ1 ,Âµ2 (Ï‰1 (z), Ï‰2 (z)) â‰¤ S .

(2.15)

***
Remark 2.1. The assumption that neither of Âµ1 , Âµ2 is a point mass guarantees that the
free additive convolution is not a simple translate. The case when both, Âµ1 and Âµ2 are
combinations of two point masses is special and its discussion is postponed to Section ??.

***
Corollary 2.6. Let Âµ1 , Âµ2 and SI (0, Î·M ) be as in Theorem 2.5 . Fix z0 âˆˆ C+ . Assume
that the functions Ï‰
e1 , Ï‰
e2 , re1 , re2 : C+ â†’ C satisfy Im Ï‰
e1 (z0 ) > 0, Im Ï‰
e2 (z0 ) > 0 and
Î¦Âµ1 ,Âµ2 (e
Ï‰1 (z0 ), Ï‰
e2 (z0 ), z0 ) = re(z0 ) ,

(2.16)

with re(z) := (e
r1 (z), re2 (z))> . Let Ï‰1 , Ï‰2 be the subordination functions solving the system
Î¦Âµ1 ,Âµ2 (Ï‰1 (z), Ï‰2 (z), z) = 0, z âˆˆ C+ .
Then there exists a (small) constant Î´0 > 0 such that whenever we have
|e
Ï‰1 (z0 ) âˆ’ Ï‰1 (z0 )| â‰¤ Î´0 ,

|e
Ï‰1 (z0 ) âˆ’ Ï‰1 (z0 )| â‰¤ Î´0 ,

(2.17)

|e
Ï‰2 (z0 ) âˆ’ Ï‰2 (z0 )| â‰¤ 2Ske
r(z0 )k .

(2.18)

we also have
|e
Ï‰1 (z0 ) âˆ’ Ï‰1 (z0 )| â‰¤ 2Ske
r(z0 )k ,

The constant Î´0 > 0 depends on Âµ1 and Âµ2 , on the interval I as well as on Î·M .

***
Theorem 2.7. Let ÂµÎ± and ÂµÎ² be compactly supported probability measures on R, and assume
that neither is supported at a single point and that at least one of them is supported at more
than two points. Let I âŠ‚ BÂµÎ± ÂµÎ² be a compact non-empty interval and fix some 0 < Î·M < âˆž.
Let ÂµA and ÂµB be two arbitrary probability measures on R.
Then there are constants b > 0 and Z < âˆž, both depending on the measures ÂµÎ± and ÂµÎ² , on
the interval I as well as on the constant Î·M , such that whenever
dL (ÂµA , ÂµÎ± ) + dL (ÂµB , ÂµÎ² ) â‰¤ b

(2.21)

holds, then
max
zâˆˆSI (0,Î·M )

holds, too.

***
Remark 2.2. The estimate (2.22) was recently given by Kargin [30] under the assumption
that (2.14) and (2.15) hold for all z âˆˆ SI (0, Î·M ), i.e., under the assumption that the
conclusions of our Theorem 2.5 hold. It is quite surprising that one can directly set Im z = 0
in (2.22). As first noted by Kargin, this is due to the regularizing effect of Ï‰Î± , Ï‰Î² and to
the global uniqueness of solutions to (2.5) for arbitrary probability measures.

***
Theorem 2.8. Let ÂµÎ± and ÂµÎ² be two compactly supported probability measures on R, and
assume that neither is only supported at one point and that at least one of them is supported
at more than two points. Let I âŠ‚ BÂµÎ± ÂµÎ² be a compact non-empty interval and fix some
0 < Î·M < âˆž. Assume that the sequences of matrices A and B in (??) are such that their
empirical eigenvalue distributions ÂµA and ÂµB satisfy (??). Fix any small Î³ > 0 and set
Î·m := N âˆ’2/3+Î³ .
Then we have the following uniform estimate: For any (small)  > 0 and any (large) D,

Corollary 2.9. Let I âŠ‚ BÂµÎ± ÂµÎ² be a compact non-empty interval. Then, for any E1 < E2
in I, we have the following estimate. For any (small)  > 0 and any (large) D we have

***
Remark 2.3. Our results in Theorem 2.8 and Corollary 2.9 are stated for U Haar distributed
on the unitary group U (N ). However, they also hold true (with the same proofs) when U
is Haar distributed on the orthogonal group O(N ).

Remark 2.4. In [3], we derive, with a different approach, the estimate (with the notation
of (2.28))

estimates for individual matrix elements of the resolvent GH as well. Comparing with (2.28),
we see âˆšthat we can choose Î· in (2.31) almost as small as N âˆ’1 at the price of losing a
factor N . The stability and perturbation analysis in [3] rely on the optimal results in
Theorem 2.5 and Theorem 2.7 as well as in Sections ??-?? of the present paper.

Lemma 3.1. Let Âµ1 , Âµ2 be two probability measures on R neither of them being supported
at a single point. Then there is, for any compact set K âŠ‚ C+ , a strictly positive constant
0 < Ïƒ(Âµ1 , K) < 1 such that the reciprocal Stieltjes transform FÂµ1 (see (??)) satisfies
Im z â‰¤ (1 âˆ’ Ïƒ(Âµ1 , K)) Im FÂµ1 (z) ,

âˆ€z âˆˆ K .

(3.1)

Similarly, there is 0 < Ïƒ(Âµ2 , K) < 1 such that (3.1) holds with Âµ2 and FÂµ2 , respectively.
Assume in addition that Âµ1 is supported at more than two points. Then there is, for any
compact set K âŠ‚ C+ , a strictly positive constant 0 < Ïƒ
e(Âµ1 , K) < 1 such that
|FÂµ0 1 (z) âˆ’ 1| â‰¤ (1 âˆ’ Ïƒ

Lemma 3.2. Let Âµ1 , Âµ2 be two compactly supported probability measures on R
satisfying (??), for some L < âˆž, and assume that both are supported at more than one
point. Let I âŠ‚ BÂµ1 Âµ2 be a compact non-empty interval. Then there is a constant K < âˆž

The constant K depends on the constant Î·M and on the interval I as well as on the measures
Âµ1 , Âµ2 through the constants Îº0 in (??) and the constant L in (??).

***
Lemma 3.3. Let Âµ1 , Âµ2 be two probability measures on R satisfying (??), for some L < âˆž,
and assume that neither of them is only supported at a single point. Let I âŠ‚ BÂµ1 Âµ2 be a
compact non-empty interval. Then there is a strictly positive constant k > 0 such that

(3.13)

***
Remark 3.1. The constant k in (3.13) depends on the interval I through the constants Îº0
in (??) and M in (??). It further depends on Î·M , as well as on Ïƒ(Âµ1 , K2 ) and Ïƒ(Âµ2 , K1 )
in (3.1), with
Ki = {u âˆˆ C+ : u = Ï‰i (z) , z âˆˆ SI (0, Î·M )} ,

i = 1, 2 .

(3.14)

***
Lemma 3.4. Let Âµ1 , Âµ2 be two probability measures on R satisfying (??) for some L < âˆž.
Assume that neither of them is a single point mass and that at least one of them is supported
at more than two points. Let I âŠ‚ BÂµ1 Âµ2 be a compact non-empty interval.
Then, there is a finite constant S such that
max
zâˆˆSI (0,Î·M )

Î“Âµ1 ,Âµ2 (Ï‰1 (z), Ï‰2 (z)) â‰¤ S ,

(3.19)

and

zâˆˆSI (0,Î·M )

|Ï‰10 (z)| â‰¤ 2S ,

max
zâˆˆSI (0,Î·M )

|Ï‰20 (z)| â‰¤ 2S ,

where Ï‰1 (z), Ï‰2 (z) are the solutions to Î¦Âµ1 ,Âµ2 (Ï‰1 , Ï‰2 , z) = 0.

(3.20)

***
Remark 3.2. Lemma 3.4 is the first instance where we use that at least one of Âµ1 and Âµ2
is supported at more than two points. For definiteness, we assume that Âµ1 is supported
at more than two points. The constant S in (3.19) depends on the interval I through the
constant Îº0 in (??), on the constants Î·M , L in (??), Ïƒ(Âµ1 , K2 ) and Ïƒ(Âµ2 , K2 ), as well as on
Ïƒ
e(Âµ1 , K2 ) of (3.2) with K2 defined in (3.14).

***
Remark 3.3. The crucial estimate in the proof above is (??). An alternative proof of (??)
under the assumptions that both Âµ1 and Âµ2 are supported at more than two points was
pointed out by an anonymous referee. From (2.5) we observe that the subordination
function Ï‰1 (z) appears, for fixed z âˆˆ C+ , as the fixed point of the map Fz : C+ â†’ C+ ,
u 7â†’ Fz (u) := FÂµ1 (FÂµ2 (u) âˆ’ u + z) âˆ’ FÂµ2 (u) âˆ’ u + z .
+

(3.29)

Indeed, assuming that Ï‰1 âˆˆ C and that Âµ1 , Âµ2 are supported at least at three points
(so that FÂµ1 (z) âˆ’ z and FÂµ2 (z) âˆ’ z are not MoÌˆbius transformations), the fixed point Ï‰1 (z)
is attracting as was shown in [4]. Thus, for any fixed k > 0, the Schwarzâ€“Pick Theorem
b of {z âˆˆ C+ âˆª R : Im Ï‰1 (z), Im Ï‰2 (z) â‰¥ 2k}

where Ï‰1 (z), Ï‰2 (z) solve the unperturbed system Î¦Âµ1 ,Âµ2 (Ï‰1 , Ï‰2 , z) = 0. Assume that there
is a constant S such that Î¦ is linearly S-stable at (Ï‰1 (z0 ), Ï‰2 (z0 )), and assume in addition
that there are strictly positive constants K and k with k > Î´ and with k 2 > Î´KS such that

Lemma 5.1. Let ÂµA , ÂµB and ÂµÎ± , ÂµÎ² be the probability measures from (??) and (??)
satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 2.7 . Let Ï‰A , Ï‰B and Ï‰Î± , Ï‰Î² denote the associated

Remark 5.1. Armed with the conclusions of Theorem 2.5 , our proof follows closely
the arguments of [30]. We further remark that the main argument in the proof of
Lemma 5.1 is different from the ones given in Section ??: it crucially relies on the global
uniqueness of solutions on the upper half plane for both systems, Î¦ÂµÎ± ,ÂµÎ² (Ï‰Î± , Ï‰Î² , z) = 0 and

Proposition 7.2. Let ÂµÎ± and ÂµÎ² be as in (??). Let I âŠ‚ BÂµÎ± ÂµÎ² be a compact non-empty
interval. Fix 0 < Î·M < âˆž. Then, there are constants k > 0, K < âˆž and S < âˆž, depending
on the constants Î¾, Î¶, Î¸, Î·M and on the interval I, such that the subordination functions
possess the following bounds:

Remark 7.1. As an immediate consequence of Proposition 7.2 and (??), we obtain for
ÂµÎ± 6= ÂµÎ² the bounds maxzâˆˆSI (0,Î·M ) |Ï‰Î±0 (z)| â‰¤ 2S, maxzâˆˆSI (0,Î·M ) |Ï‰Î²0 (z)| â‰¤ 2S with I as

Remark 7.2. In the case ÂµÎ± = ÂµÎ² , we note from Lemma 7.1 (c.f., (??)) that the point
E = 1 is in the regular bulk BÂµÎ± ÂµÎ± . However, mÂµÎ± ÂµÎ² (1 + i0) is unstable under small
perturbations. For instance, let
ÂµA = ÂµÎ± = Î¾Î´1 + (1 âˆ’ Î¾)Î´0 ,

ÂµB = (Î¾ âˆ’ Îµ)Î´1 + (1 âˆ’ Î¾ + Îµ)Î´0 ,

for some small Îµ > 0. Then, according to Theorem 7.4 of [11], ÂµA  ÂµB has a point mass ÎµÎ´1 .
Hence, even though (??) (i.e., dL (ÂµB , ÂµÎ² ) â†’ 0, as Îµ â†’ 0) is satisfied, mÂµA ÂµB (z) contains
Îµ
a singular part (1âˆ’z)
, which blows up as |z âˆ’ 1| = o(Îµ). This explains, on a heuristic level,
the bound in (7.11) and shows why the ÂµÎ± = ÂµÎ² case at energy E = 1 is special even though
the density fÂµÎ± ÂµÎ± is real analytic in a neighborhood of E = 1.

Remark 7.3. Consider a more general setup with ÂµÎ± = Î¾Î´a + Âµ
eÎ± and ÂµÎ² = (1 âˆ’ Î¾)Î´b + Âµ
eÎ² , for
some constants Î¾ âˆˆ (0, 1), a, b âˆˆ R and for some Borel measures Âµ
eÎ± and Âµ
eÎ² with Âµ
eÎ± (R) = 1âˆ’Î¾
and Âµ
eÎ² (R) = Î¾. Analogously to the discussion in Remark 7.2 , we note that mÂµÎ± ÂµÎ² (a+b+i0)
is unstable under small perturbations. However, from Lemma 3.4 , we know that the system
Î¦ÂµÎ± ,ÂµÎ² (Ï‰Î± , Ï‰Î² , z) = 0 is linearly S-stable in the regular bulk under the assumptions of
Theorem 2.5 . That means, if neither ÂµÎ± nor ÂµÎ² is supported at a single point and at least
one of them is supported at more than two points, then the point E = a + b cannot lie in the
regular bulk BÂµÎ± ÂµÎ² . Thus, only in the special case ÂµÎ± = ÂµÎ² with ÂµÎ± as in (??), there is an
unstable point, up to scaling and shifting given by E = 1, inside the regular bulk BÂµÎ± ÂµÎ± .

Proposition 7.3. Let ÂµÎ± , ÂµÎ² be as in (??). Let I âŠ‚ BÂµÎ± ÂµÎ² be a compact non-empty
interval. Let ÂµA , ÂµB be two probability measures on R. Fix 0 < Î·M < âˆž. Then there are
constants b > 0 and Z < âˆž such that the condition
