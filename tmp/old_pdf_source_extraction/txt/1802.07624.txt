Lemma 2.1. The inner integral over T1 in (??) converges when Re(s) > 0 and admits
meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane which at holomorphic at 0. Its
value at 0 is well defined as a locally constant and compactly supported function on
GL(V )/T .

Theorem 2.2. [Existence of Transfers] For any f ∈ Cc∞ (gl(V ) × V × V ∗ ), there exists
a transfer {f0 , f1 }. Conversely, for any pair {f0 , f1 }, there exists a transfer f .

Theorem 2.3. [Fourier Transform]
Let n = dimV = dimW . There exists a constant c independent of the matching functions,
such that if f and {f0 , f1 } are transfers, then cF1 (f ) and {F1 (f0 ), (−1)n−1 F1 (f1 )} are
transfers.

Conjecture 2.4. [Fundamental Lemma] When p is odd, 1k and {1k0 , 0} are transfers.

***
Remark. The conjecture is known when p is large enough. This is proved in [11] by Z.
Yun in the positive characteristic case, extended to characteristic zero by J. Gordon in
the appendix to [11]. It is not known for small p.

Definition 3.1. An endoscopic triple of G is a triple (H, s, η). Here H is a quasi-split
b and η is an embedding of the
group over F, s is a regular semisimple element in G,
b ,→ G.
b The triple has to satisfy the following conditions:
complex algebraic groups: H
b is the identity component of the centralizer of s in G.
b
• η(H)
• The conjugacy class of η is Galois equivariant.
b
• η −1 (s) is fixed by the Galois action on H.

***
Remark. It is easy to see that the matching between embeddings to maximal F-tori and
regular semisimple elements is a matching between stable conjugacy classes in G and H.
Let G∗ be the quasi split inner form of G. Every embedding T ,→ H has a matching
T ,→ G∗ . This is not true for G. An element xH ∈ h(F )r.s. is G∗ -regular semisimple if
it matches a regular semisimple element x∗ in g∗ (F ).

***
Definition 3.2. Let f H ∈ Cc∞ (h(F )) and f ∈ Cc∞ (g(F )). Then f H and f match if the

Theorem 3.3. [Tate-Nakayama Isomorphism [12]] Let F be a non-archimedean local
field and T a F-torus. Then the Galois cohomology group H 1 (F, T ) is canonically
isomorphic to the quotient of
{x ∈ X∗ (T )|tr(x) = 0}
by its subgroup generated by
{σx − x|σ ∈ Gal(F /F ), x ∈ X∗ (T )}.

Theorem 3.5. [Fourier Transform] There exists a constant c independent of the

Remark. The constant c are given explicitly in [2]. It equals the quotient of the Weil
indexes of h and g. We will come back to this in section ??.

PropositionQ
3.6. The centralizer Tδ of δ in U(W ) equals U(1)(E[δ]× /F [δ]× ). We have

H (F, Tδ ) = S1 Z/2Z. And the conjugacy class in the stable conjugacy class of δ is
canonically a torsor of

Proposition 3.7. Let m = 1. When F1 ⊇ E, then dimW is even and S is a single

Proposition 3.8. There is a natural isomorphism S → S1 Z/2Z. It defines S as a
torsor over H 1 (F, T ) which extends the classical torsor structure over ker(H 1 (F, T ) →
H 1 (F, U (W )).

Proposition 3.10. The character κ of H 1 (F, Tδ ) is defined as follows: on each copy of
Z/2Z corresponding to S1 (δ1 ), κ is the trivial map. On each copy of Z/2Z corresponding
to S1 (δ2 ), κ is the unique nontrivial map.

Fourier transform defined by ψ. There exists a constant γq (ψ), called Weil index, such
that for all f ∈ Cc∞ (V ), the following identity is true:
F(fq ) = γq (ψ)f−q .

Theorem 6.1. [Main Theorem] Let W be a Hermitian space of dimension n for E/F .
Let n = a + b. Define G = U(W ) and it has endoscopic group H = U(Wa,0 ) × U(Wb,0 ).
(1) For each f ∈ Cc∞ (g), there exists a transfer f H ∈ Cc∞ (h).
(2) If f and f H are matching functions, then for the Fourier transfrom F and F H
(defined by tr(XY )), F(f ) and F H (f H ) are also matching functions.

***
Theorem 6.2. For any odd prime p and consider the fundamental lemmas on the
Lie algebras. Then the fundamental lemma in the Jacquet-Rallis case (conjecture 2.4
) implies the fundamental lemma in the endoscopic case.

***
Remark. In [9], Kazhdan and Varshavsky have shown that the fundamental lemma in
the endoscopic case is implied by theorem 3.5 (at least when p is large). In the unitary
case, theorem 6.1 give a direct proof of theorem 3.5. Hence, we also give a genuinely
different proof of the endoscopic fundamental lemma.
