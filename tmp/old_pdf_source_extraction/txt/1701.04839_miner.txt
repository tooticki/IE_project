Lemma 2.1. Assume k is trivially-valued or has residue characteristic zero. For any x ∈ X of type 2 or 3,
there exists x(cid:48) ∈ X rig such that x(cid:48) ≤ x and m(x(cid:48)) = m(x).

Lemma 2.2. If {ϕi}i∈I is a net of ρ0-subharmonic functions on X which is locally bounded above, then the usc
regularization ψ∗ of ψ := supi∈I ϕi is ρ0-subharmonic. Furthermore, ψ∗ = ψ on X\{α = +∞}.

***
Example 2.3. For any irreducible f ∈ k{T}, the function ϕ := log |f| is ρ0-subharmonic, where ρ0 = m(x)· δxG
and x ∈ X rig is the rigid point of X corresponding to the maximal ideal (f ) of k{T}. It is easy to check that

∆ϕ = m(x) (δx − δxG ) .

More generally, for any f ∈ k{T}, the function log |f| is quasisubharmonic and its Laplacian can be identiﬁed,
up to scaling and adding a multiple of δxG , with the divisor of zeros of f via the Poincar´e–Lelong formula.
See [BR10, Example 5.20].
In fact, for any x ∈ X with m(x) < +∞, the function ϕ = −α(x ∨ ·) is m(x) · δxG -subharmonic with Laplacian
given by ∆ϕ = m(x) (δx − δxG ).

***
Theorem 3.1. Let ϕ be a quasisubharmonic function on X with ϕ(xG) = 0, and let Z(ϕ) = {ϕ = −∞} denote
the polar locus of ϕ. For any z ∈ X, there exists a constant 0 > 0 and a nonzero polynomial f ∈ k[T ] such that

(cid:107)f(cid:107)(1+)ϕ := sup

|f (x)|e−(1+)ϕ(x)−A(x) ≤ |f (z)|e−ϕ(z) for all  ∈ [0, 0].

If ϕ(z) = −∞, then we may ﬁnd f such that (cid:107)f(cid:107)(1+)ϕ < +∞ for all  ∈ [0, 0]. Moreover, if k is algebraically
closed and z ∈ X rig, then for any value a ∈ H(z)∗ = k∗, we may ﬁnd f such that f (z) = a.

Corollary 3.2. For any z ∈ X, let c(z) be the smallest positive number such that for any quasisubharmonic
function ϕ on X, there exists a nonzero f ∈ k{T} satisfying

Then, c(z) = 1.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let 0 > 0. A nonzero polynomial f ∈ k[T ] is a (ϕ, 0)-extension at z if the inequality

log |f (x)| − log |f (z)| ≤ A(x) + (1 + )ϕ(x) − ϕ(z).

(3.1)

holds for all  ∈ [0, 0]. Equivalently, f is a (ϕ, 0)-extension if for all x ∈ X\Z(ϕ) and all  ∈ [0, 0], we have

(cid:107)f(cid:107)(1+)ϕ ≤ |f (z)|e−ϕ(z)

Lemma 3.5. Suppose that mass(ρ0) ≥ 1 and that there exists x ∈ Ends(Γϕ,n) of type 1. Then, there exists
1 > 0 and a ρ-subharmonic function φ, with mass(ρ) ≤ mass(ρ0) − 1, such that a (ϕ, 0)-extension f at z may

Deﬁnition 4.4. A quasisubharmonic function ϕ on X is said to have analytic singularities if there exists a cover
{Vi}i∈I of X by aﬃnoid domains such that for each i ∈ I, there are analytic functions fi,1, . . . , fi,ni ∈ OX (Vi),
positive numbers αi,1, . . . , αi,ni > 0, and a bounded function βi : Vi → R such that

Example 4.5. Let ϕ be a quasisubharmonic function on X with analytic singularities and suppose it admits a
decomposition ϕ = β +α log |f|, with f ∈ k{T} irreducible, α > 0, and β : X → R bounded. Then, Hϕ = (f(cid:98)α(cid:99)).

Proposition 4.6. Let ϕ be a quasisubharmonic function on X and let m ≥ 1. The non-Archimedean Demailly
approximation ϕm is quasisubharmonic with analytic singularities.

***
Remark 4.7. It is not true in general that, if ϕ has analytic singularities, then ϕm = ϕ for all m ≥ 1. Rather,
ϕm is an “algebraic approximation” to ϕ, as the following example demonstrates. Let ϕ = α · log |f| for some
(cid:98)mα(cid:99)
m log |f|. If x ∈ X rig is the rigid point
α > 0 and f ∈ k{T} irreducible. It is easy to verify that ϕm =
corresponding to the maximal ideal (f ) of k{T}, then ϕm has rational slope along the branch [x, xG] of X;
however, this will not be the case for ϕ if α ∈ R\Q.

In particular, ϕ2n = ϕ for all n ≥ 0, but the subsequence (ϕ2n+1)n≥0 decreases monotonically to ϕ. It is not
clear whether or not the sequence ϕm admits a decreasing subsequence in general. For related results in the
complex case, see [Kim14].

Remark 4.10. A quasisubharmonic function cannot,
in general, be bounded pointwise below by a
quasisubharmonic function with analytic singularities. Indeed, a general quasisubharmonic function can have a
dense set of poles in X: for example, if {aj : j ≥ 0} forms a dense subset of k◦, set

ϕ :=

cj log |T − aj|,

for some cj > 0 satisfying (cid:80)∞

X must have a ﬁnite set of poles. This is analogous to the fact that a subharmonic function with analytic
singularities on the complex unit disc has a discrete set of poles.

Deﬁnition 4.11. Let ϕ be a quasisubharmonic function on X with ϕ ≤ 0. For any x ∈ X, the local multiplier
ideal of ϕ at x, denoted J (ϕ)x, consists of those germs f ∈ OX,x such that for all  > 0, there is an aﬃnoid
neighborhood V of x on which f is deﬁned such that

Lemma 4.14. If ϕ, φ are quasisubharmonic functions on X and x ∈ X, then J (ϕ + φ)x ⊆ J (ϕ)xJ (φ)x.
