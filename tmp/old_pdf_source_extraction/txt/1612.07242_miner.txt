Theorem 1. Let m > n ≥ 2 be integers such that either
(a) both m and n are odd, or
(b) both m and n are even, or
(c) m is odd, n is even and n ≤ m+1
2 .
Then (??) is true.

***
Corollary. Let m > n ≥ 2 be integers such that either (a), (b) or (c) in
Theorem 1 holds. Then Bombieri’s conjecture for this pair of integers is false.

***
Conjecture. If m > n ≥ 2 are integers such that m is odd, n is even and
n < 4m+2

then (??) is true.

Lemma 2. [Dieudonn´e’s criterion] The polynomial p(z) = z + a2z2 + . . . + anzn
is univalent in D if and only if its associated polynomials
sin(nt)

sin(2t)

q(z; t) = 1 + a2

z + . . . + an

sin t

have no zeros in D for any choice of the parameter t ∈ [0, π].

Lemma 3. For all t ∈ R and n ≥ 2, we have

An(t) ≥ 0

and

Also, An vanishes only for t = 2(cid:96)π, (cid:96) ∈ Z, when n is even and only for t = (cid:96)π,
(cid:96) ∈ Z, when n is odd.

An(2π − t) = An(t).
