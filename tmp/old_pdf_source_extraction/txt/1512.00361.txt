Theorem A. Let G be a finite non-simple group. Then Γ(G) is not connected if and
only if for some prime numbers p and q one of the following holds.
∼ Zp × Zp , or G ∼
1. G =
= Zp × Zq .
2. G ∼
= N o A where N ∼
= Zp × · · · × Zp , A ∼
= Zq , NG (A) = A, and N is a minimal
normal subgroup of G.

Theorem B. Let G be a finite solvable group. Then κ(G) < 2 if and only if for some
prime numbers p and q one of the following holds.
1. |G| = pα with 0 ≤ α ≤ 2.
2. |G| = p3 and neither G ∼
= Q8 nor G ∼
= Zp × Zp × Zp .
3. |G| = p2 q with a Sylow p-subgroup P such that either
(a) P ∼
= Zp2 , or
(b) P ∼
= Zp × Zp , P / G, and there exists a non-normal subgroup of G of order
p.
4. G = P Q is a group of order pα q (α ≥ 3) with P being the normal Sylow p-subgroup
of G such that either
(a) P is elementary abelian, Q acts on P irreducibly, and the order of NG (Q)
is at most pq, or
(b) N := Φ(P ) is elementary abelian, Q acts on both N and P/N irreducibly,
and either NG (Q) = Q or NG (Q) = N Q ∼
= Zp × Zq .
In particular, any solvable group whose order is divisible by at least three distinct primes
is 2-connected.

Proposition 1. For a finite group G with |V (G)| > k the following statements are
equivalent:
(i) Γ(G) is k-connected.
(ii) There is no upward closed separating set S of Γ(G) with |S| < k.
(iii) There are at least k independent paths in Γ(G) between any pair of minimal
subgroups.

and only if G is isomorphic to one of the following groups
Zp3 ,
for some prime numbers p and q.

Zp2 × Zp ,

Zp2 × Zq

Proposition 3. Let G be a finite group and N be a normal subgroup of G. If G/N is
k-connected, then G is (k + x − 1)-connected where x is the length of the series
1 < N1 < N2 < · · · < Nx = N
such that Ni / G for each 1 ≤ i ≤ x. In particular, κ(G/N ) ≤ κ(G).

***
Corollary 4. Let G be a supersolvable group with ` := `(G). Then κ(G) ≥ ` − 3. In
particular, all p-groups of order > pα are (α − 2)-connected.

***
Lemma 5. Let G be a finite solvable group. Then κ(G) ≥ 2 if and only if G satisfies
the 2-valency condition.

***

1. |G| = pα , 0 ≤ α ≤ 2,
2. |G| = p3 except G ∼
= Q8 or G ∼
= Zp × Zp × Zp
In particular, all p-groups of order > p3 are 2-connected.

***
Lemma 7. Let G be a group of order p2 q with a Sylow p-subgroup P . Then κ(G) < 2
if and only if one of the following holds.

= Zp2 .
2. P ∼
= Zp × Zp , P / G, and there exists a non-normal subgroup of G of order p.

***
Lemma 8. Let G be a group of order p2 q. Then G is 3-connected if and only if
G∼
= ha, b, c | ap = bp = cq = 1, ab = ba, cac−1 = aλ , cbc−1 = bλ i
where q  p − 1 and λ > 1 is any integer such that λq ≡ 1 (mod p).

Remark. The “smallest” non-solvable group is the alternating group A5 on five letters
and its order is divisible by three distinct primes. However, it does not satisfy the
2-valency condition. To be more precise, if H is a subgroup of order 5, then there is
exactly one proper subgroup, say K, of A5 containing H. To see this, first observe
that any maximal subgroup M of A5 has index ≥ 5, as otherwise, there would be a
homomorphism φ : A5 → SG/M with a non-trivial kernel which is impossible. Hence
the only possibility for the order of K is 10. Since H is not a normal subgroup of A5
and since H is normalized by the maximal subgroup K, we see that K is the unique
subgroup containing H.

Lemma 9. Let G be a finite supersolvable group. Then κ(G) ≥ 3 if and only if G
satisfies the 3-valency condition.

***
Corollary 10. Let G be a finite supersolvable group with κ(G) < 3. Then the number
of prime divisors of |G| is at most three. Moreover, if there are exactly three distinct
prime divisors, then |G| is square-free.

***
Lemma 11. Let G be a finite supersolvable group with κ(G) < 3. Then the order of G
must be equal to one of the following
pα (0 ≤ α ≤ 4),

p3 q,

p2 q 2 ,

p2 q,

pqr,

pq

where p, q, and r are distinct prime numbers. Moreover, if G is nilpotent, then |G| 6=
p2 q 2 ; and if G is nilpotent and of order p3 q, then G is cyclic.

***
Lemma 12. Let G be a finite p-group. Then κ(G) < 3 if and only if one of the following
holds.
1. |G| = pα (0 ≤ α ≤ 3) and neither G ∼
= Q8 nor G ∼
= Zp × Zp × Zp .
2. G is a group of order p4 such that
(a) G ∼
= Zp4 , or
(b) Φ(G) ∼
= Zp2 except G ∼
= Q16 , or
∼
(c) Φ(G) = Zp × Zp and Z(G) < Φ(G) except
i. G ∼
= ha, b, c | a9 = b3 = 1, ab = ba, a3 = c3 , bcb−1 = c4 , aca−1 = cb−1 i,
and
2
ii. G ∼
= ha, b, c | ap = bp = cp = 1, bc = cb, bab−1 = ap+1 , cac−1 = abi for
p > 3.
In particular, all p-groups of order > p4 are 3-connected.
