Corollary 4.9. [[12]] If (M, g, α, ω) is a compact, Einstein, almost cokähler

Remark 5.2. Even though this example is not compact, the value of τ −τ
is

consistent with the inequalities of Theorem 4.7 . In fact, it is the smallest
value compatible with (2).

***
Remark 5.3. We note that a result in [15] asserts that no solvable
unimodular Lie group admits a left invariant metric of strictly negative Ricci
curvature. In fact, it is easy to verify that the Lie group G of Proposition 5.1
is not unimodular; in particular, it does not have a uniform discrete subgroup,
i.e. a discrete subgroup Γ such that Γ\G is compact.
