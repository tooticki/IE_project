Question. [Popa] Let G be a unitarily representable SIN Polish group. Is G necessarily of
finite type?

***
Theorem 1.1. [Ando–Matsuzawa, unpublished] Let G be a unitarily representable Polish SIN
group, and assume that ϕ ∈ P(G) generates the topology of G. Then the following statements
hold:
(i) Oϕ is relatively compact in the compact open topology.
(ii) If Oϕ satisfies one of the following conditions, then G is of finite type.
(iia) The closure of Oϕ with respect to the topology of pointwise convergence is normseparable.
(iib) Oϕ is relatively weakly compact.

Theorem 1.2. [Main Theorem] Let Γ be a countable discrete group, and let π : Γ → GL(H)
be a group homomorphism from Γ to the group of bounded invertible operators on H. Let
G = H oπ Γ be the semidirect product.
(a) G is a unitarily representable Polish group. Moreover, the following two conditions
are equivalent.
(i) G is a SIN group.
(ii) π is uniformly bounded. That is, kπk := sups∈Γ kπ(s)k < ∞ holds.
(b) Assume that π is uniformly bounded. Then the following three conditions are
equivalent.
(i) G is of finite type.
(ii) There exists a character f : H → C that generates a neighborhood basis of 0 ∈ H,
such that f (π(s)ξ) = f (ξ) for all ξ ∈ H and s ∈ Γ.
(iii) π is unitarizable. That is, there exists V ∈ GL(H) such that V −1 π(s)V is unitary
for all s ∈ Γ.

***
Theorem 1.3. [Corollary 3.16 ] Let H be a separable real Hilbert space, and let f ∈ P(H).
Then there exist
(i) a compact metrizable space X and a Borel probability measure m on X,
(ii) a bounded linear operator T : H → L2 (X, m; R), and
(iii) a positive measurable function ϕ ∈ L0 (X, m),
such that

f (ξ) =
eiϕ(x)[T ξ](x) dm(x),
ξ ∈ H.
X

Moreover:
(iv) If f generates a neighborhood basis of 0, then T can be chosen to be a real-linear
homeomorphism onto its range.
(v) We may arrange T and ϕ such that if G is a uniformly bounded subgroup of the group
{u ∈ GL(H); f (uξ) = f (ξ) (ξ ∈ H)} of invertible operators on H fixing f pointwise,
then there exists a continuous homomorphism β from G to the group Aut(X, m) of all
m-preserving automorphisms of X with the weak topology, such that
[T (uξ)](x) = β(u)[T (ξ)](x),

ϕ(β(u)x) = ϕ(x),

u ∈ G, ξ ∈ H, m-a.e. x ∈ X.

***
Definition 2.1. Let G, G0 be topological groups.
(i) We say that G is embeddable into G0 , if there exists a topological group isomorphism
π from G onto a closed subgroup of G0 . Such π is called an embedding.
(ii) We denote by P(G) the set of all normalized continuous positive definite functions
on G, and by P(G)inv the set of all f ∈ P(G) which is conjugation-invariant, i.e.,
f (g −1 xg) = f (x) holds for all x, g ∈ G. An element of P(G)inv is called a character
on G.

***
Definition 2.2. [[Po07]] A Polish group G is of finite type if G is embeddable into the unitary
group U(M ) of some finite von Neumann algebra M equipped with strong operator topology.
The class of finite type Polish groups is denoted by Ufin .

***
Definition 2.3. Let G be a topological group.
(i) G is called unitarily representable if G is embeddable into U(`2 (N)) equipped with
strong operator topology.
(ii) G is called SIN (small invariant neighborhood) if for any neighborhood V of G at the
identity e, there exists a neighborhood U ⊂ V of e which is conjugation invariant, i.e.,
g −1 U g = U, ∀g ∈ G. Such U is called an invariant neighborhood of G.
If G is metrizable, then G is SIN if and only if G admits a bi-invariant metric d which is
compatible with its topology.

***
Theorem 2.4. [[AM12-2]] For a Polish group G, the following conditions are equivalent.
(i) G is of finite type.
(ii) There exists a family F ⊂ P(G)inv which generates a neighborhood basis of the
identity eG of G. That is, for each neighborhood V at the identity, there are functions
f1 , . . . , fn ∈ F and open sets O1 , . . . , On in C such that

eG ∈

(iii) There exists f ∈ P(G)inv that generates a neighborhood basis of the identity of G.
(iv) There exists a family F ⊂ P(G)inv which separates the identity of G and closed subsets
A with A 63 eG . That is, for each closed subset A with A 63 eG , there exists f ∈ F
such that
sup |f (x)| < |f (eG )|.
x∈A

(v) There exists f ∈ P(G)inv which separates the identity of G and closed subsets A with
A 63 eG .

***
Theorem 2.5. Let N, K be SIN-groups. Let α : K → Aut(N ) be a continuous action of K
on N . Then the following two conditions are necessary and sufficient for N oα K to be a
SIN-group.
(SIN. 1) For any U ∈ N (N ), there exist V ∈ N (N ) with V ⊂ U such that
αk (V ) = V,

k ∈ K.

(SIN. 2) The action α is bounded. That is, for any V ∈ N (N ), there exists W ∈
N (K) such that
n−1 αk (n) ∈ V,
n ∈ N, k ∈ W.

***
Remark 2.6. A semidirect product G oα Γ of a SIN group G by a discrete group Γ always
satisfies (SIN. 2) (take W = {eK }).

***
Theorem 2.7. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → GL(H) be an invertible representation of Γ. Then the semidirect product group
G := H oπ Γ is unitarily representable. Moreover, the following conditions are equivalent.
(1) G is SIN.
(2) π is uniformly bounded, i.e., kπk := sups∈Γ kπ(s)k < ∞.

***
Theorem 2.8. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation of Γ. Then H oπ Γ is of finite type if
and only if there exists f ∈ P(H) such that
(F.1) f (π(s)ξ) = f (ξ),
∀s ∈ Γ, ξ ∈ H,
(F.2) f generates a neighborhood basis of 0 ∈ H.

***
Corollary 2.9. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation of Γ. If π is unitarizable, then H oπ Γ
is of finite type.

***
Corollary 2.10. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation of Γ. Assume that Γ is amenable. Then
H oπ Γ is of finite type.

***
Remark 2.11. We remark that if Γ is amenable, then so is H oπ Γ, so that the conclusion of
Corollary 2.10 also follows from the fact [AM12-2, Theorem 2.2] that an amenable unitarily
representable SIN group is of finite type.

***
Theorem 3.1. If G = H oπ Γ is of finite type, then π is unitarizable.

***
Lemma 3.2. [Dixmier] Let π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation. Then π is
unitarizable if and only if there exists an inner product h·, ·i0 on H that generates the same
Hilbert space topology and which is π-invariant, i.e., hπ(s)ξ, π(s)ηi0 = hξ, ηi0 (ξ, η ∈ H, s ∈ Γ)
holds.

***
fsa is a real-linear homeomorphism onto its range (with
Proposition 3.3. The map T : H → M
respect to the τ -measure topology or the SRT). Moreover, the following covariance property
holds.
(6)

T (π(s)ξ) = α(s)T (ξ)α(s)∗ ,

s ∈ Γ, ξ ∈ H.

***
Definition 3.4. We denote by L0 (X, m) the space of all m-measurable C-valued functions
on X, and L0 (X, m)+ its positive cone. We also define the Γ-action on L0 (X, m) by βs =
Ad(α(s))|L0 (X,m) (s ∈ Γ) (we use the same symbol βs as the Γ-action on L∞ (X, m), but there
would be no danger of confusion).

***
Theorem 3.5. [Equivariant Maurey-Nikishin Factorization] The map T : H → L0 (X, m)
factors Γ-equivariantly through a Hilbert space. More precisely, there exists a Γ-invariant
function ϕ ∈ L0 (X, m) which is m-a.e. positive and

Then clearly (cϕ) (t) = cϕ (t) (c > 0, t ≥ 0) holds.

Lemma 3.7. Let S : H → L0 (X, m) be a linear operator. Then the following conditions are
equivalent.
(i) S is continuous.
(ii) There exists a non-increasing map C : (0, ∞) → [0, 1] such that limλ→∞ C(λ) = 0 and
(9)

m({x ∈ X; |Sξ(x)| ≥ λkξk}) ≤ C(λ)

(λ > 0, ξ ∈ H).

(iii) For every t > 0, there exists K(t) > 0 such that
(10)

(Sξ)? (t) ≤ K(t)kξk

(ξ ∈ H).

***
Lemma 3.8. Let ϕ ∈ L0 (X, m). Then for every δ > 0, m({x ∈ X; |ϕ(x)| > ϕ? (δ)}) ≤ δ
holds.

***
Proposition 3.9. Let A be a convex subset of L0 (X, m)+ which is globally Γ-invariant. Then
for every ε > 0, there is a Γ-invariant measurable subset S(ε) ⊂ X with m(X \ S(ε)) ≤ ε and

Lemma 3.10. [Minimax Lemma] Let X, Y be topological vector spaces, and let A (resp. B)
be a convex subset of X (resp. Y ). Assume that B is compact. If the function Φ : A × B →
R ∪ {+∞} satisfies :
(i) Φ(·, b) is a concave function on A for each b ∈ B,
(ii) Φ(a, ·) is a convex function on B for each a ∈ A,
(iii) Φ(a, ·) is lower-semicontinuous on B for each a ∈ A,
then the following identity holds:

f be an R-linear homeomorphism onto its range. If S(ξ) ∈
Lemma 3.13. Let S : H → M
2
L (M ) for every ξ ∈ H, then regarded as S : H → L2 (M ), S is an R-linear homeomorphism
onto its range, where L2 (M ) is equipped with the L2 -topology (instead of the τ -measure
topology).

***
Remark 3.14. In the above lemma, we did not claim that in L2 (M ), SRT and the L2 topology are the same. In fact the two topologies are different (but they agree on the image
of S, i.e., S defines a strong embedding in the sense of [AK06, Definition 6.4.4]). To see
this in the commutative case, let (Ω, µ) be a diffuse probability space, and choose a sequence
n→∞

(Bn )∞
n=1 of measurable subsets of Ω such that 0 < µ(Bn ) → 0. Define fn ∈ L (Ω, µ) by

Then kfn k22 = 1 for n ∈ N. On the other hand,

Question 3.15. Is there a connected, unitarily representable SIN Polish group which is not
of finite type?

***
Corollary 3.16. Let H be a separable real Hilbert space, and let f ∈ P(H). Then there exist
(i) a compact metrizable space X and a Borel probability measure m on X,
(ii) a bounded operator T : H → L2 (X, m; R), and
(iii) a positive measurable function ϕ ∈ L0 (X, m),
such that
Z
f (ξ) =
eiϕ(x)[T ξ](x) dm(x),
ξ ∈ H.
X

Moreover:
(iv) If f generates a neighborhood basis of 0, then T can be chosen to be a real-linear
homeomorphism onto its range.
(v) We may arrange T and ϕ such that if G is a uniformly bounded subgroup of the group
{u ∈ GL(H); f (uξ) = f (ξ) (ξ ∈ H)} of invertible operators on H fixing f pointwise,
then there exists a continuous homomorphism β from G to the group Aut(X, m) of all
m-preserving automorphisms of X with the weak topology, such that
[T (uξ)](x) = β(u)[T (ξ)](x),

ϕ(β(u)x) = ϕ(x),

u ∈ G, ξ ∈ H, m-a.e. x ∈ X.

***
Remark 3.17. A typical example of the above corollary is the positive definite function
2
f (ξ) = e−kξk /4 . To see this, let us fix an orthogonal basis {ξi } for H. In this case, we can
choose X = (Ṙ)N the product of an infinite number of copies of the one-point compactification
of R, m = the infinite dimensional Gaussian measure, T (ξi ) : X 3 x 7→ xi ∈ Ṙ and ϕ = 1.
The triple (X, m, T ) is called a Gaussian random process indexed by H. For more detatils,
see [Si74].

***
Remark 3.18. It is clear from the proof that it applies whenever H is a Banach space of
Rademacher type 2 (see [AK06, §6] for definitions). Thus we have shown as a corollary that a
Banach space B is isomorphic (as a Banach space) to a Hilbert space if and only if a positive
definite function generates the topology of B and is of type 2. Moreover, the isomorphism can
be made equivariant with respect to a group of symmetries that preserve the positive definite
function. One may compare this result with Kwapień’s Theorem [Kw72] that B is isomorphic
to a Hilbert space if and only if B is of type 2 and cotype 2. Note that the Kwapień Theorem
does not produce an equivariant isomorphism but requires less in the sense that any Banach
space isomorphic to a subspace of L0 (X, m) is of cotype 2, but not all cotype 2 Banach spaces
can be isomorphic to a subspace of L0 (X, m) (see the remark after [BL00, Corollary 8.17] and
[Pi78]).

***
Proposition 3.19. Let A be a commutative von Neumann algebra with separable predual, and
let τ be a normal faithful tracial state on A. Let G be a Polish group, and let β : G → Aut(A)
be a continuous τ -preserving action. Then there exists a separable compact metrizable space
X, a Borel probability measure m on X, an m-preserving continuous action G × X 3 (g, x) 7→
gx ∈ X and a ∗-isomorphism Φ : A → L∞ (X, m) such that
Z
(16)
Φ(a)(x) dm(x),
a ∈ A,
τ (a) =
X

(17)

Φ(βg (a))(x) = Φ(a)(g −1 x),

g ∈ G, µ−a.e. a ∈ A.

Moreover, the G-action is continuous as a map G → Aut(X, m), where the group Aut(X, m)
of all m-preserving automorphism of X is equipped with the weak topology.

***
Lemma 3.20. Let M, N be von Neumann algebras, and let ψ, ϕ be normal faithful states on
M, N , respectively. Let M0 (resp. N0 ) be a ∗-strongly dense subalgebra of M (resp. N ). If
α : M0 → N0 is a ∗-isomorphism such that ϕ(α(x)) = ψ(x) for every x ∈ M0 , then α can be
extended to a ∗-isomorphism from M onto N such that ϕ(α(x)) = ψ(x) (x ∈ M ).
