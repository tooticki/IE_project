Question 1. For a given inﬁnite set E ⊂ Z, how much structure does
possess the set (E − E) · (E − E)?

Theorem 1.1. Let (X, µ, T ) and (Y, ν, S) be measure-preserving systems,
and let A ⊂ X, B ⊂ Y be measurable sets with µ(A) > 0, and ν(B) > 0.
Then there exist k0 depending only on µ(A) and ν(B)), and k ≤ k0 such that
k Z ⊂ R(A) · R(B).

***
Corollary 1.1. Let E1, E2 ⊂ Z be sets of positive upper Banach density.
Then there exist k0 which depends only on the densities of E1 and E2 and
k ≤ k0 such that

k Z ⊂ (E1 − E1) · (E2 − E2).

***
Corollary 1.2. For any α, β > 0 there exist N0 and d0, depending only
on α and β, such that for every N ≥ N0 and E1, E2 ⊂ ZN with |E1| ≥
αN,|E2| ≥ βN there exists d ≤ d0 which is a divisor of N and d ZN ⊂
(E1 − E1) · (E2 − E2).

Lemma 2.1. For every L ≥ 1 and every b ∈ Z \ {0} there exists m ≤
(cid:98)
µ(A)L(cid:99) + 1 such that

1

{mb, 2mb, . . . , Lmb} ⊂ R(A).

Problem 1. Is it true that given E1, E2 ⊂ Z of positive density there exist
k0, which depends only on d∗(E1) and d∗(E2), and k ≤ k0 such that k Z ⊂
(E1 − E1)2 − (E2 − E2)2? If yes, can we show that for any set E ⊂ Z2 of
positive density there exist k0, which depends only on d∗(E), and k ≤ k0 such
that k Z ⊂ {x2 − y2 | (x, y) ∈ E − E}?

***
d(Z) = {(aij) ∈ Zd×d | tr(aij) = 0} be a set of
Theorem 4.1. Let E ⊂ M at0
positive density. Then there exists k ≥ 1 (which a priori depends on the set
E and not only on its density) such that for any matrix A ∈ k · M at0
d(Z)
there exists B ∈ E−E such that the characteristic polynomial of B coincides
with the characteristic polynomial of A.

***
Problem 2. Is it true that given E ⊂ Z2 of positive upper Banach density,
there exist k0 that depends only on d∗(E) and k ≤ k0 such that

k Z ⊂ {xy | (x, y) ∈ E − E}?

***
Problem 3. Is it true that the parameter k in Theorem 4.1 depends only
on the density of the set E ⊂ M at0

d(Z)?

***
Conjecture 1. Let α > 0. Then there exist N and k depending only on α
such that for any ﬁnite commutative ring R with |R| ≥ N and any set E ⊂ R
satisfying |E| ≥ α|R| the set (E − E) · (E − E) contains a subring R0 such
that |R|/|R0| ≤ k.
