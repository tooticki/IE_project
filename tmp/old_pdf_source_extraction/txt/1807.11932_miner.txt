Theorem 4.3.

(1) Let V be a complete L∞-algebra. Two Maurer–Cartan elements ξ, η ∈ V are left

homotopic if and only if their representing cdga maps ξ, η : SΣ−1V ∗ → k satisfy

η = ξ ◦ e[˜x,d],

homotopic if and only if their representing dga maps ξ, η : T Σ−1V ∗ → k satisfy

Example 4.4. Take V to be a dg vector space, so that it has a linear diﬀerential and a
decomposition V = H(V ) ⊕ ΣB ⊕ B, and take A = SΣ−1V ∗. Let ξ be the identity map, and
η be the map induced by the projection of V onto its homology H(V ). Then ξ and η are left
homotopic, but η is not an automorphism, so cannot be of the form id ◦ e[˜x,d]. Indeed, if ˜x is
the constant derivation corresponding to the homotopy, then the exponential e[˜x,d] diverges.
