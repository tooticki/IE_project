Theorem 1.1. Let X be a smooth variety of dimension d ≥ 1 over a finite field F and Z ⊂ X be a
π
closed subvariety. Let p ∈ Z be a point. Let AdF −
→ Ad−1
denote the projection onto the first d − 1
F
coordinates. Then there exists
(i) an open neighbourhood U ⊂ X of p,
(ii) a map Φ : U → AdF ,
d−1
(iii) an open neighbourhood V ⊂ Ad−1
of Ψ(p) where Ψ : U → AF

such that
(1) Φ is étale.
(2) Ψ|ZV : ZV → V is finite where ZV := Z ∩ Ψ−1 (V ).
(3) Φ|ZV : ZV → A1V = π −1 (V ) is a closed immersion.

***
Remark 1.2. Without loss of generality, we may (and will) assume henceforth that X is affine.
Moreover, by [1, 3.2], we may also assume that Z is a principal divisor defined by f ∈ O(X) and p is
a closed point.

***
Remark 1.3. If one finds U, Φ, V, Ψ satisfying conditions (1),(2),(3) of (1.1), one can also arrange,
by shrinking U if necessary, the following additional condition
(4) ZV = Φ−1 Φ(ZV ).
e is étale, and it
To see this, let Ze denote the image of ZV in A1V . The morphism Φ−1 Φ(ZV ) → Z
−1
e
admits a section as ZV maps isomorphically onto Z. Thus Φ Φ(ZV ) is a disjoint union of ZV and
a closed subset T of Ψ−1 (V ). Replacing U by U \T , one sees that the additional condition (4) is
satisfied.

***
Notation 2.1. Throughout this paper we work over a fixed finite field F . We further fix the following
notation.
(1) Let Y be a subset of a scheme X/F . We let Y≤r := {x ∈ Y | deg(x) ≤ r} and similarly
Y<r := {x ∈ Y | deg(x) < r} and Y=r := {x ∈ Y | deg(x) = r}.
(2) For f1 , ..., fi ∈ F [X1 , ..., Xn ] we let Z(f1 , ..., fi ) denote the closed subscheme of AnF defined by
the ideal (f1 , ..., fi ).

Lemma 2.2. [5, page 2] Let k be any field and n ≥ 1 be any integer. Let Z/k be a finitely generated
affine scheme of dimension at most n − 1. Let

Remark 2.3. We claim that finiteness of Z −−−−−−→ Ank implies that of Z −−−−−−→ Ank . This is
because the later map is a composition of the following two finite maps
(φ1 ,...,φn )

(Y1 ,...,Q(Yn ))

Z −−−−−−→ Ank −−−−−−−−−→ Ank .
One can thus easily reduce the proof of the above general case to the case where Q(T ) = T . Unless
explicitly mentioned, we will usually assume Q(T ) = T while applying the lemma. As in the proof of
Noether normalization, the above lemma is usually applied repeatedly until one gets a map from Z
dim(Z)
to Ak
.

Lemma 2.4. Let p ∈ Z ⊂ X be as in Theorem 1.1 . Further, assume that X is affine, Z is a principal
divisor and p is a closed point (see Remark 1.2 ). Then there exists a map ϕ : X → AdF and an open
neighbourhood W of ϕ(p) such that
(1) ϕ−1 (W ) → W is étale.
(2) ZW := Z ∩ ϕ−1 (W ) → W is a closed immersion.
(3) The first d − 1 coordinates of ϕ(p) are 0.
In particular, it suffices to prove Theorem 1.1 where X is an open subset of AdF and the first d − 1
coordinates of p are zero.

Lemma 3.1. Let n ≥ 2 be any integer, k be any field and Z/k be an affine variety of dimension n − 1.
Let
(φ1 ,...,φn )
Z −−−−−−→ Ank

Qn−1 := Q.
Qi := φi+1 − Q`i+1

∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2.

***
Notation 3.2. Let d ≥ 2 be an integer and f, g ∈ F [X1 , ..., Xd ] be nonzero polynomials with no
common irreducible factors (see Remark 3.5 ). Let X := AdF \Z(g) and Z := Z(f ) ∩ X. Let p ∈ Z be
a closed point (see Remark 1.2 ) whose first d − 1 coordinates are 0.

Φ is étale at S := Ψ−1 Ψ(p) ∩ Z.
Φ is radicial at S.

***
Lemma 3.4. Let X, Z, p be as above. Assume there exists {φ1 , ..., φd } which presents (X, Z(f ), p) and
d−1
Φ, Ψ be as in Definition 3.3 . Then there exist open neighborhoods V ⊂ AF
of Ψ(p) and U ⊂ X of p,
such that Φ|U , Ψ|U , U, V satisfy conditions (1),(2),(3) of Theorem 1.1 . Moreover, Ψ−1 (V )∩Z(f ) ⊂ U .

***
Remark 3.5. Since our main goal is to prove Theorem 1.1 for (X, Z, p), we may change Z(f ) as
long as it does not change Z. If f and g have common irreducible factors, dividing f by the g.c.d. of
f and g does not change Z(f )\Z(g). This justifies our assumption in Definition 3.2 that f, g have no
common irreducible factors.

Lemma 3.7. Let d ≥ 3, and f, g ∈ F [X1 , ..., Xd ] be two non-zero polynomials with no common
factors. Let p be a closed point of AdF such that Xi (p) = 0 for all i ≤ d − 1. Then there exists a
coordinate change of F [X1 , ..., Xd ], i.e. elements Yi ∈ F [X1 , ..., Xd ] with
F [X1 , ..., Xd ] = F [Y1 , ..., Yd ]
such that f (0, Y2 , ..., Yd ) and g(0, Y2 , ..., Yd ) are nonzero polynomials with no common irreducible
factors and Yi (p) = 0 for all i ≤ d − 1.

***
Lemma 3.8. [Reduction to d = 2] Assume that for d = 2 and every f, g, X, Z, p as in Notation 3.2 ,
there exists φ1 , φ2 ∈ F [X1 , X2 ] which presents (X, Z(f ), p). Then the same holds for every d ≥ 2.

***
Lemma 4.1. Let F be a finite field as before, and C ⊂ A2F be a closed curve such that the projection
onto the Y -coordinate Y|C : C → A1F is finite. Let C (1) denote the set of closed points of C. Then the
following set of points is dense in C

	
x ∈ C (1) | degF (Y (x)) = degF (x) .

***
Notation 4.2. Let
(1) A = F [X, Y ] and for d ≥ 0 let A≤d = {h ∈ A | deg(h) ≤ d}. Here deg(h) denotes the total
degree.
(2) f, g ∈ A be two non-constant polynomials, with no common irreducible factors. By performing
a change of coordinates if necessary, we will assume that f is monic in X of degree m.
(3) W := A2F \Z(g). In this section, we call our variety W instead of X, since the later will denote
a coordinate function on A2F .
(4) Z := Z(f ) ∩ W . Note that Z(f )\Z is finite as f, g have no common irreducible components.
(5) p ∈ Z be a closed point such that its X-coordinate is 0. We also choose a set of closed points
{p1 , ..., pt } in Z such that the set T := {p, p1 , ..., pt } satisfies
(a) T contains at least one point from each irreducible component of Z.
(b) No two points in T have same degrees and for all pi ∈ T , deg(Y (pi )) = deg(pi ). This
can be ensured by Lemma 4.1 . Note that since X-coordinate of p is 0, we also have
deg(Y (p)) = deg(p).
(6) Let D = {q1 , . . . , qs } be a finite set of closed points in Z(f ) satisfying:
(a) D contains all points in Z(f )\Z.
(b) D contains at least one point from each irreducible component of Z(f ).
(c) D does not contain any point of {p, p1 , ..., pt }.
Moreover, for a point x in Z(f ), the notation Ox (resp. mx ) will denote OA2F ,x (resp. mA2F ,x ) i.e. the
local ring (resp. maximal ideal) of x as a point of A2F .

***
Theorem 4.3. There exists (φ1 , φ2 ) ∈ F [X, Y ] which presents (W, Z(f ), p).

***
Lemma 4.4. Let the notation be as in 4.2 . There exists c ∈ N, such that for every d >> 0, there
exists a φ ∈ A≤d satisfying
(1) φ(p) = φ(pi ) = 0 for all i = 1, ..., t and φ(qi ) 6= 0 for all i = 1, . . . , s.
(2) (φ, Y ) is étale at all x ∈ S where S := Z(φ) ∩ Z.
(3) The projection Y : A2F → A1F is radicial at S≤(d−c)/3 .

***
Remark 4.5. The above lemma is motivated by writing down conditions for φ such that (φ, Y )
presents (W, Z(f ), p), and then keeping only those which we can prove. Indeed, if φ|Z(f ) is a finite map
and Y is radicial at whole of S (as opposed to S(d−c)/3 above), then (φ, Y ) would present (W, Z, p)
thereby proving (4.3).

***
Remark 4.6. The set S = Z(φ) ∩ Z appearing in the statement of the above Lemma is necessarily
finite. This is because, in each irreducible component of Z, there is at least one qi (see (4.2)(6)(b))
on which φ does not vanish. Since T intersects each irreducible component of Z(f ) (see (4.2)(5)(a)),
we know that any open neighbourhood of S is dense in Z(f ).

***
Remark 4.7. The main motivation for introducing the above conditions, are the following
straightforward implications between them and the conditions of 4.4
- φ satisfies (4.4)(1) if φ satisfies (a).
- φ satisfies (4.4)(2) iff φ satisfies (br ) for all r ≥ 1.
- φ satisfies (4.4)(3) iff φ satisfies (cr ) and (dr ) for all r ≤ (d − c)/3.

Lemma 4.8. There exists integers r0 , c ∈ N, with

Lemma 4.10. Let c ∈ N be as in Lemma 4.4 . Let d >> 0 be an integer such that for every

# (A1F )=i > dm.
Let φ ∈ A≤d be as given by (4.4) and S := Z(φ) ∩ Z . Then, there exists h ∈ F [X, Y ] such that
(1) h|S : S → A1 is radicial, i.e. injective and preserves the degree.

(2) The map A2F −−−→ A2F is étale at all x ∈ S.
(3) h|Z(f ) : Z(f ) → A1F is a finite map.
