Deﬁnition 1. A is said to have the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP), if for any k ∈
N and for any ﬁxed general linear form L ∈ U∗ the multiplication map µL : Ak −→
Ak+1 has maximal rank.

***

Deﬁnition 2. We say that A fails the WLP because of surjectivity in degree
k > 0 if one has dim Ak ≥ dim Ak+1 but the multiplication µL : Ak → Ak+1 is not
surjective for any linear form L. In analogous way one deﬁnes the failure of WLP
because of injectivity. In general we say that A has the WLP in degree k > 0 if for
a general linear form L the multiplication map µL : Ak → Ak+1 has maximal rank.

***

Proposition 1. The following facts hold.

(1) If µL : Ak → Ak+1 is injective, then µL : Aj → Aj+1 is injective for any

j ≤ k.

(2) A is self-dual as it is Gorenstein. As a consequence it is enough to check

the WLP in the case of injectivity (resp. in the case of surjectivity).
(3) If A is a c.i. algebra of type (d, . . . , d) then socle(A) = A(m+1)(d−1)

∼= C

and WLP holds for A if for a general linear form L the multiplication map
µL : As → As+1 is injective, with s = (cid:100)(m + 1)(d − 1)/2(cid:101) − 1.

Proposition 2. The ideal I = (f0, . . . , fm) ⊂ C[x0, . . . , xm], with fi
independent and of degree d, is a c.i.

Remark 1. Observe that the non-zero homogeneous polynomials q ∈ S•U deﬁne
hypersurfaces V (q) ⊂ P(U∗). To any L ∈ U∗ we associate a derivative ∂L(q) = L(q),
deﬁned by the action of S•U∗ on S•U , and therefore L(q) = 0 means that the
hypersurface V (q) is a cone with a vertex point in [L] ∈ P(U∗).

***
Remark 2. The inverse system I−1 in association to the study of the WLP of the
algebra A = S•U∗/I has been already considered in the literature, for example it
is a main theme of the article [4].

***

Proposition 3. If I = (q0, . . . , qm) is a a c.i. ideal generated by forms of degree
d ≥ 2, then P(Id) ∩ νd(P(U∗)) is a ﬁnite set and dim P(Id) ∩ S ≤ 1. More generally
one has dim P(Id) ∩ Secr−1(S) ≤ min(2r − 1, m).

Corollary 4. [Injectivity Lemma] Let A = C[x0, . . . , xm]/I an artinian algebra,
with I generated by a regular sequence of forms of degree d. Then for general
z ∈ A1 the multiplication map µz : Ad−1 −→ Ad is injective.

***

Remark 3. In [5] it was observed that, as a consequence of the result above in the
case d = 2, the WLP holds for d = 2 and 2 ≤ m ≤ 3. Indeed in those cases one has
s = (cid:100)(m + 1)(d − 1)(cid:101) − 1 = 1.

***

Remark 4. Proposition ?? actually gives more precise information than Corollary
4 on the dimension so-called non Lefschetz locus, that is the locus of [z] ∈ P(A1)
such that the moltiplication map µz : Ad−1 → Ad is not injective, by showing that
this locus has dimension at most 1. We refer the reader to the recent article [1] for
many other deep results in this context.

***
Proposition 5. Set Rr = {[Q] ∈ P(S2U∗) | rk(Q) ≤ r} for any 1 ≤ r ≤ m,
that is, Rr is the projectivized set of quadrics of rank at most r. Let I a c.i. ideal
generated by m + 1 quadrics. Then dim P(I2) ∩ Rr ≤ r − 1.

***

Remark 5. The results of this section, although very simple, strongly depend
on the complete intersection hypothesis. They cannot in general be extended to
the case of Gorenstein algebras A, even when these algebras are presented by
quadrics.
Indeed inﬁnite series of counterexamples to the result in Corollary 4
in the Gorenstein case have been provided in [2], see for example their Corollary
3.8.

Lemma 6. Under the notations above, one has dim(cid:104)z1, . . . , zN(cid:105) = N − ε = m and
dim(cid:104)Q1, . . . , QN(cid:105) = N − δ. In particular one has (cid:104)z, z1, . . . , zN(cid:105) = U∗. Moreover,
the following relations hold, for any i, j = 0, . . . , N .

Lemma 7. Let A be a c.i. artinian algebra as above, with m ≥ 4. Then the
following properties hold.
(1) For any two distinct points [z], [w] ∈ P(U ) one has dim(cid:104)z, w(cid:105)A1 ≥ 2m − 1.
(2) Denoting Υ the subvariety of Gr(m− 2, P(U )) whose points are the (m− 2)-
planes Π = V (z, w) ∈ Gr(m − 2, P(U )) such that dim(cid:104)z, w(cid:105)A1 = 2m − 1,
then dim Υ ≤ 3.

Lemma 8. dim coker(µQ) = dimZ(Q) = δ + 1.

***

Lemma 9. For arbitrary m one has

dim(cid:104)Q, Q1, . . . , QN(cid:105) = m + 1 + ε − δ.

In particular for m = 4 we have

dim(cid:104)Q, Q1, . . . , QN(cid:105) = 5 + ε − δ.

***
Lemma 10. If m = 4 one has δ ≤ 1, that is dimZ(Q) ≤ 2.

Lemma 11. One has Z(Q)A1 + (cid:104)Q, Q1, . . . , QN(cid:105) ⊆ ker µQ.

Theorem 1. The WLP holds for m = 4 and d = 2.
