Theorem 1. Let F be a finite family of convex sets in Rd . If every d + 1 or fewer
elements of F intersects, then all the sets in the family F intersect.

Problem 1. Let A be a finite family of linear operators Kd → Kd , where K is an
arbitrary field and d > 2. Find minimal k = HE(Kd ) such that if any k or fewer
elements of A have a common eigenvector then there is a common eigenvector for
all operators in the family A.

Theorem 2. HE(Kd ) = b3d/2c for an arbitrary field K.

Problem 2. Let A be a finite family of linear operators Kd → Kd , where K is an
arbitrary field and d > 2. Find minimal l = HI(Kd ) such that if any l or fewer
elements of A have a common non-trivial invariant subspace then there is a common
non-trivial invariant subspace for all operators in the family A.

Conjecture 1. HI(Kd ) = O(d).

Theorem 3. Suppose that A is a finite family of linear operators such that A0 ∈ A
have d eigenvectors in Kd with different eigenvalues and any 2d−1 or fewer elements
of A have a common non-trivial invariant subspace then there is a common nontrivial invariant subspace for all elements of A.

Fact 1. Hi := span({vj : j ∈ Xi }) is a common eigenspace for operators Am ,
m ∈ [n] \ (Xi ∪ {i}).

Fact 2. Suppose that l ∈ Xi for i ∈ [k]. Then vectors vj , j ∈ {i} ∪ [k + 1, n] \ {l},
are linearly independent.
