*** The following are equivalent.
1. The real structure σ is admissible.
2. The subspace Vσ is stable by c.
3. The subspace V is stable by σ.
4. The real structure σ restricts to a Q-orthogonal symmetry of V .
5. The subspaces V+ := V ∩ Vσ and V− := V ∩ iVσ form a Q-orthogonal
decomposition of V .

*** It is immediate that (1 )⇒(3 ), and for the converse it suffices to observe
that σ ◦ c and c ◦ σ are two algebra automorphisms of Cl(V ) which coincide on
V . The equivalence between (1 ) and (2 ) is obtained by symmetry.
Of course (4 )⇒(3 ) is trivial, and to see that (3 )⇒(4 ) we observe that
Q(σ(v)) = σ(v)2 = σ(v 2 ) = σ(Q(v)) = Q(v), hence σ restricts to a Q-orthogonal
transformation of V which is moreover involutive.
Finally we see that V+ is the +1-eigenspace and V− is the −1-eigenspace of the
R-linear operator σ|V , hence (5 ) and (4 ) are equivalent.

***
1. The real structures are of the form σ = Adb ◦ c with b ∈ ΓC such that
bc(b) = λ ∈ R. We also have bT = αb, α = ±1, b× = αc(b).
2. The real structure σ = Adb ◦c with b ∈ ΓC is admissible iff c(b) = eiθ b, with
θ ∈ R. In this case we can choose b to satisfy c(b) = b and b2 = λ = ±1, in
which case we say that it is real and normalized. Then b× = αb, b belongs
to P in(Q), and is unique up to a sign.

*** It is obvious that σ is an antilinear automorphism which preserves V C
when it is of the form Adb ◦ c with b in the Clifford group. If bc(b) = λ ∈ R it
is moreover an involution since σ 2 (a) = bc(b)ac(b)−1 b−1 = a for all a ∈ Cl(V ).
Conversely, if σ is a real structure, then σ ◦ c is an automorphism of the Clifford
algebra which preserves V C , and it is then of the form Adb with b ∈ ΓC . Hence
σ = Adb ◦ c. Since σ is an involution we have bc(b) = λ ∈ C by the calculation
above. Since c(b) is then equal to b−1 up to a constant, it commutes with b,
from which we obtain that λ is real.
The other properties follow from the ones just proved: since b ∈ ΓC , bb× is a
constant, hence c(b)bT is a constant, and from c(b)b = λ ∈ R we get that b
is proportional to bT . The involutory property of T forces the proportionality
constant to be a sign α. Then b× = c(bT ) = αc(b).
Now it is easy to check that σ commtutes with c iff c(b) = eiθ b for some θ ∈ R.

b is normalized and real and one has Adb = Adb0 . If b00 is another
Then b0 = √

normalized and real element such that Adb00 = Adb then b00 = µb0 with µ ∈ C.
From reality one has µ ∈ R, and from normalization one has µ2 = 1.
Since b0 satisfies b0 (b0 )× = ±1 and is real it is in the Pin group.

*** The projection τn does not depend on the chosen pseudo-orthonormal basis.
It is the unique linear form τn : Cl(V ) → R such that τn (ab) = τn (ba) for all
a, b ∈ Cl(V ) and τn (1) = 1. It also satisfies τn (aT ) = τn (a).

*** The σ-product is a non-degenerate hermitian form on Cl(V ). The
associated quadratic form restricts to Qσ on V and to Q on Vσ . It satisfies
(w1 . . . wk , w1 . . . wk )σ = Q(w1 ) . . . Q(wk )

(2)

for any vectors w1 , . . . , wk ∈ Vσ . Moreover if (ei )1≤i≤n is a pseudo-orthonormal
basis of Vσ for Q then (eI )I⊂{1;...;n} is a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Cl(V ) for
the σ-product.

*** It is obvious that (., .)σ is sesquilinear. Moreover we have (b, a)σ =
τn (σ(bT )a) = τn (σ(b)T a) = τn (aT σ(b)) = τn (σ(aT )b) = (a, b)σ .
If v ∈ V , then (v, v)σ = τn (σ(v)v) = 21 τn (σ(v)v + vσ(v)) = Qσ (v).
Let us prove (2 ). We have :

Let (ei )1≤i≤n be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Vσ . Then (eI , eI )σ = ±1 by
property (2 ). Moreover if I 6= J, (eI , eJ )σ = τn (eTI eJ ) = ±τn (eI∆J ) = 0.
Hence (eI )I⊂{1;...;n} is a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Cl(V ), which shows that
(., .)σ is not degenerate.

equipped with nondegenerate bilinear forms. Let c, c0 be the canonical real
structures on Cl(V, B) and Cl(V 0 , B 0 ) respectively. Then the isomorphism φ̃ :
Cl(V, B) → Cl(V 0 , B 0 ) which canonically extends φ transforms (., .)c into (., .)c0 .

τn (c(aT )b) = (a, b)c

where the last step follows from the uniqueness of the normalized trace.

*** Let φ : (V, B) → (V, B) be an isometry. Then φ̃(V k ) = V k for all k.

*** Clearly φ̃(V k ) = V k for k = 0, 1. Let us suppose that φ̃(V j ) = V j for
j ≤ k. The sum V 0 ⊕ . . . ⊕ V k ⊕ V k+1 is orthogonal for the c-product, hence by
the lemma the sum φ̃(V 0 ) ⊕ . . . ⊕ φ̃(V k ) ⊕ φ̃(V k+1 ) = V0 ⊕ . . . ⊕ V k ⊕ φ̃(V k+1 )
also is. Since we obviously have φ̃(V k+1 ) ⊂ V 0 ⊕ . . . ⊕ V k+1 we obtain that
φ̃(V k+1 ) = V k+1 .

*** Let (K, (., .)) be a finite dimensional space equipped with a non-degenerate
hermitian form. If there exists U ∈ End(K) such that U × U = −IdK , then (., .)
is neutral.

*** We have (U ψ, U η) = (ψ, U × U η) = −(ψ, η) for all ψ, η ∈ K. Thus if
K = K+ ⊕ K− is an orthogonal decomposition of K into subspaces where
(., .) is positive definite and negative definite respectively, we see that K =
U K+ ⊕ U K− is an orthogonal decomposition where the signs are swapped.
Since dim(U K± ) = dim K± we conclude by Sylvester’s law of inertia.

*** (Garling’s alternative) The σ-product on Cl(V ) is positive definite whenever
Qσ is. It is neutral in every other case.

*** Let (ei )1≤i≤n be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Vσ . Using property (2 ) of
proposition ?? on the basis (eI ) we see that (., .)σ is positive definite if Q|Vσ is,

The following properties are

1. The couple (V+ , V− ) of Q-orthogonal supplementary subspaces of V is
such that Q is positive definite on V+ and negative definite on V− .
2. The quadratic form Qσ on V is positive definite.
3. The restriction of the quadratic form Q to Vσ is positive definite.
4. The σ-product (., .)σ is positive definite.

*** There exists a non-degenerate hermitian form (., .)K
σ on K such that ρ is
σ-compatible, and when ρ is irreducible it is unique up to multiplication by a
non-zero real number.

*** Let (K, (., .)) be a space equipped with a non-degenerate hermitian form,
and let (., .)0 be a hermitian form such that for all ψ, φ ∈ K, and for all A ∈
B(K), one has (Aψ, φ)0 = (ψ, A× φ)0 , where A× is the adjoint of A for (., .).
Then there exists λ ∈ R such that (., .)0 = λ(., .).

*** (Robinson’s alternative) Let K be an irreducible spinor module and (., .)K
be a σ-compatible Krein spinor product.
If Qσ is positive definite, then (., .)K is definite, if Qσ is not positive definite,
then (., .)K is neutral.

*** Let us call ρ : Cl(V ) → End(K) the representation homomorphism.
If Qσ is not positive definite, let ei ∈ Vσ be such that e2i = −1, set U = ρ(ei )
and use lemma 2.3 .
If Qσ is positive definite, then let U : K → Se , where Se is a minimal left
ideal in Cl(V ), be a Clifford-module isomorphism, which we know exists by
irreducibility of K. By Garling’s alternative, (., .)σ is positive definite, hence
its restriction to Se also is. We now transport (., .)σ to K thanks to U by the
formula (ψ, η)U := (U ψ, U η)σ , for all ψ, η ∈ K. Let us check that (., .)U is
σ-compatible:
∀a ∈ Cl(V ), (ρ(a)ψ, η)U

= (U ρ(a)ψ, U η)σ
= (La U ψ, U η)σ by the intertwining property of U
= (U ψ, La×σ U η)σ
= (U ψ, U ρ(a×σ )η)σ
= (ψ, ρ(a×σ )η)U

Now (ψ, ψ)U = 0 ⇒ (U ψ, U ψ)σ = 0 ⇒ U ψ = 0 ⇒ ψ = 0, hence (., .)U is
definite, therefore (., .)K is by lemma 2.4 .

*** If the form Qσ is positive definite then there exists a σ-compatible scalar
product on every irreducible spinor module. If there exists at least one σcompatible scalar product on at least one irreducible spinor module then Qσ is
positive definite.

*** Let ρ be a c-compatible representation of Cl(V ) on a Krein space (K, (., .)).
Let σ = Adb ◦ c be an admissible real structure. Let x ∈ Cl(V ) and let (., .)x =
(., ρ(x).). Then (., .)x is a σ-compatible Krein product on K iff x = x× and x is
proportional to b−1 .

*** The two properties are easily seen to be sufficient. Let us prove that they
are necessary. First we note that since Cl(V ) is simple and ρ 6= 0, then ρ is
injective. For (., .)x to be sesquilinear x must satisfy ρ(x) = ρ(x)× which is
equivalent to x = x× since ρ is injective and c-compatible. Now we note that
a×σ = σ(aT ) = σ ◦ c ◦ c(aT ) = Adb (a× ) = ba× b−1 .
We must have ρ(a×σ ) = ρ(a)×σ = ρ(x)−1 ρ(a)× ρ(x) and we obtain that xb is a
scalar by the injectivity of ρ.

*** Let ρ be a c-compatible representation of Cl(V ) on a Krein space (K, (., .)).
Let σ = Adb ◦ c be an admissible real structure with b real.
1. If b× = b, (., .)b := (., ρ(b)−1 .) is a σ-compatible Krein product on K.
2. If b× = −b, (., .)b := (., iρ(b)−1 .) is a σ-compatible Krein product on K.

*** Let L be a line in V . Then
• The unique admissible real structure which restricts to sL is σv := Adv ◦ c,
where v ∈ L is a non-zero vector.
• The unique admissible real structure which restricts to −sL is σωv :=
Adωv ◦ c, where v ∈ L is a non-zero vector.

*** Let V be a finite dimensional real vector space of even dimension with nondegenerate quadratic form Q. Let ρ be a c-compatible irreducible representation
on the Krein space (K, (., .)). Then:
1. The signature of Q is anti-Lorentzian iff there exists v ∈ V such that
(., .)v := (., ρ(v)−1 .) is definite.
2. If n = 2 or n = 6 modulo 8, then the signature of Q is Lorentzian iff there
exists v ∈ V such that (., .)v := (., ρ(ωv)−1 .) is definite.
3. If n = 0 or n = 4 modulo 8, then the signature is Lorentzian iff there
exists v ∈ V such that (., .)v := (., iρ(ωv)−1 .) is definite.
In every case, (., .)v is definite ⇔ v ∈ C, and there exists λ = ±1 such that
λ(., .)v positive definite ⇔ v ∈ C+ and λ(., .)v negative definite ⇔ v ∈ C− .

***
1. We know that Q has anti-Lorentz signature iff there exists a line L such
that B(sL (.), .) is positive definite. Observe that B(sL (.), .) = Qσ , where
σ = Adv ◦ c, for any non-zero v ∈ L. We also know that (., .)v is a σcompatible Krein product on K by proposition 2.4 , and we conclude by
Robinson’s alternative.
2. Case 2 and 3 are similar to case 1 with the extra complication that b = ωv
satisfies b× = b for n = 2, 6 mod 8 and b× = −b for n = 0, 4 mod 8.
It is obvious that a line L is such that B(sL (.), .) is positive definite iff L\{0} lies
inside the light cone. Moreover multiplication by −1 exchanges C+ with C− and
(., .)v with −(., .)v , so that it only remains to show that (ψ, ψ)v keeps a constant
sign for a fixed non-zero ψ and v varying continuously in one component of C,
which is immediate by continuity of ρ.

*** Let w be a spacelike non-zero element of V and let (ψ, ψ)w := (ψ, wψ).
Then KL and KR are orhogonal to each other for (., .)w . If n > 2, the form
(., .)w is neutral on each half-spinor module KL and KR .

*** First, since multiplication by w changes chirality, it is obvious that KL
and KR are orthogonal to each other for (., .)w since they are self-orthogonal
for (., .). If n > 2 we can find a spacelike vector e such that e2 = −1 and
B(e, w) = 0. Let Ue : KL → KR be the map ψ 7→ eψ. Since (eψ, eψ)w =
(eψ, weψ) = −(eψ, ewψ) = (ψ, ψ)w , Ue is an isometry for (., .)w . Thus (., .)w ,
which is globally neutral, must have the same signature on KR and KL , hence
the result.

*** Let u, v ∈ V . If n > 2, u + χv is Krein positive iff u + v and u − v are both
timelike and future-directed.

*** First, using the fact that KL and KR are self-orthogonal we have
(ψ, (u + χv)ψ) = (ψL , (u − v)ψL ) + (ψR , (u + v)ψR )
with ψ = ψL + ψR , ψL/R ∈ KL/R . If u ± v are timelike and future-directed then
(., (u ± v).) are both scalar products, hence the two summands are positive.
Conversely, if u + v is timelike and past-directed, we can take ψL = 0 and
ψR 6= 0 to obtain a negative result. Similarly u − v cannot be past-directed. If
u + v is spacelike we can use lemma 2.6 to see that there exists a ψR such that
(ψR , (u + v)ψR ) < 0. A similar conclusion holds if u − v is spacelike.

*** If u + χv + r is Krein-positive, then u is timelike and future-directed.

*** Let ρ : Cl(V ) → End(K) be an irreducible c-compatible representation.
Then there exists an antilinear operator C : K → K implementing c, i.e. such
that
ρ(c(a)) = Cρ(a)C −1
for all a ∈ Cl(V ). This operator can be chosen to satisfy C 2 = ˜ and C × C = κ̃,
with ˜ and κ̃ some signs, and in that case is unique up to multiplication by eiθ ,
θ ∈ R.
Let σ = Adb ◦ c be an admissible real structure, with b in the Clifford group
such that b2 = λ = ±1, b× = λ0 b, λ0 = ±1, and c(b) = b. Let B = ρ(b). Then σ
is implemented on K by Cσ = BC = CB.
We have Cσ2 = λ˜
, Cσ× Cσ = λλ0 κ̃, and if (., .)σ is a σ-compatible Krein product
×σ
on K, then (Cσ ) = λCσ× and (Cσ )×σ Cσ = λ0 C × C.

*** Fix any basis of K and denote by c.c. : ψ 7→ ψ̄ the complex conjugation
of coordinates with respect to this basis. We also denote by c.c. : A 7→ Ā
the antilinear involution on operators induced by complex conjugation of
coordinates, that is : Āψ = Aψ̄. Let us write c̃ = ρ ◦ c ◦ ρ−1 . Since c̃ is an
antilinear involution of End(K), c̃ ◦ c.c. is a linear (involutive) automorphism
and is thus of the form AdC for some C ∈ End(K). We let C = C ◦ c.c. and we
obtain that ρ(c(a)) = Cρ(a)C −1 .
The fact that c is an involution translates as C 2 = ˜, with ˜ a constant. Let
ψ ∈ K be such that Cψ 6= 0. Then C 3 ψ = ˜Cψ = C(˜
ψ), which shows that ˜ is
real. From the fact that ρ is c-compatible we obtain that ρ(c(a))× = ρ(c(a)× ) =
ρ(c(a× )) and it boils down to CC × = κ̃, with κ̃ a constant,pwhich must be real.
Calculating C 2 (C × )2 we find that κ̃2 = ˜2 . Dividing C by |κ̃| we can suppose
that κ̃ = ±1 and ˜ = ±1. It is now easy to prove the uniqueness up to a phase.
The second part is an obvious consequence of proposition 2.2 . We have Cσ× Cσ =
C × B × BC = λλ0 C × C = λλ0 κ̃. If λ = 1 then (Cσ )×σ = B −1 Cσ× B = Cσ× (see
proposition 2.4 ), and if λ = −1, then (Cσ )×σ = (iB)−1 Cσ× (iB) = −Cσ× .
Hence we have (Cσ )×σ Cσ = λCσ× Cσ = λC × B × BC = λλ0 C × B 2 C = λ0 C × C.

*** The following claims are equivalent.
1. There exists a p-form ω such that Ker(ωx ) is a timelike q-dimensional
subspace of Tx M for all x ∈ M .
2. There exists a p-form ω such that for every linearly independent family
(v1 , . . . , vp ) of spacelike tangent vectors at x, ωx (v1 , . . . , vp ) 6= 0.
3. Given any decomposition T M = Es ⊕ Et of the tangent bundle into the
sum of a spacelike and timelike subbundle, there exists a non-vanishing
top form ω s of Es .

*** To see that (1 ) entails (2 ) consider any family F = (v1 , . . . , vp ) of spacelike
tangent vectors at x and let Sx ⊂ Tx M be the linear subspace they span. Since
Kerωx is timelike and q-dimensional, one has Kerωx ⊕ Sx = Tx M . Call πx
the projection onto Sx defined by this decomposition. It is immediate that
ωx (u1 , . . . , up ) = λ detF (πx (u1 ), . . . , πx (up )) for any vectors u1 , . . . , up , where
detF is the determinant in the basis F of Sx and λ ∈ R. Clearly λ 6= 0 since ωx
does not vanish identically. Hence ωx (v1 , . . . , vp ) 6= 0.
The proof that (2 ) entails (3 ) is immediate. To obtain (1 ) from (3 ), consider
the projection π on Es defined by T M = Es ⊕ Et , and extend ω s by the formula
ωx (u1 , . . . , up ) := ωxs (π(u1 ), . . . , π(up ))
Then ω is a p-form on T M and its kernel at x is clearly (Et )x .

*** There exists a c-compatible spinor metric iff (M, g) is time orientable when
p, q are even, and iff (M, g) is space orientable when p, q are odd.

*** We deal with the odd case only, the even case being completely similar.
Let us suppose that there exists a c-compatible spinor metric H. Consider a
covering of M by open sets (Uα )α∈A such that T M and S are trivial over Uα ,
and a subordinate partition of unity (fα )α∈A . For each x ∈ M we let Ix be the
finite set of indices α such that fα (x) 6= 0. On each Uα let us choose a section ψα
n/2
of the spinor bundle which is constant in some trivialization S|Uα ' Uα × C2
and non-vanishing.
Let us define the p-form

Let (e1 , . . . , ep , ep+1 , . . . , en ) be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Tx M such that
e1 , . . . , ep are spacelike. Then we know that Hx (., ir (e1 . . . ep )−1 .) is definite.
Since (e1 . . . ep )−1 = ep . . . e1 = (−1)r e1 . . . ep , we have either:
∀α ∈ Ix , Hx (ψα , ir e1 . . . ep ψα ) > 0
or
∀α ∈ Ix , Hx (ψα , ir e1 . . . ep ψα ) < 0
In both cases we have ωx (e1 , . . . , ep ) 6= 0. Now, since ω is multilinear alternate,
we have for any vectors u1 . . . , up ∈ Span(e1 , . . . , ep ):
ωx (u1 , . . . , up ) = det(uji )1≤i,j≤p ωx (e1 , . . . , ep )

(10)

where uji is the j-th component of ui in the basis (e1 , . . . , ep ). Since (e1 , . . . , ep ) is
any orthonormal family of spatial vectors, this shows that ωx (u1 , . . . , up ) 6= 0 for
any linearly independent family of spatial vectors. Thus ω is a space orientation.
Conversely, since M is space-orientable, there exists a Euclidean real structure
σ = Adb ◦ c where b is a smooth section of the Clifford group bundle. On the
Riemannian manifold (M, gσ ) it is well-known that there exists a σ-compatible
spinor metric. Let us call H̃ such a spinor metric. Then H(., .) = H̃(., ir b.)
defines a c-compatible spinor metric for M .

2. If X · (Ψ, Ψ0 )H = (∇X Ψ, Ψ0 )H + (Ψ, ∇X Ψ0 )H , for all X, Ψ, Ψ0 as above, ∇
is said to be metric.
3. If in addition M is a spin manifold and J is a spin structure on it, then
∇ is said to preserves spin if ∇X J = J∇X for all vector field X.
4. If M is a spin manifold and is space and time oriented, J is a spin structure
on it, and H is a c-compatible metric on S, then ∇ is said to be a spin

*** Let (M, g) be a semi-Riemannian space and time orientable spin manifold

*** Suppose ee×σ = 0. Then for all a, b ∈ Cl(V ), (ae, be)σ = τn (e×σ a×σ be) =
τn (a×σ bee×σ ) = 0.
Now suppose ee×σ 6= 0. Let (., .)a be a σ-compatible Krein spinor product on
Se , which exists by proposition (2.4 ).
Since e is a primitive idempotent, p := Le ∈ End(Se ) is a rank one projection.
Note that p(e) = e2 = e, hence e ∈ Im(p), so that Im(p) = Ce. Observe
also that (Kerp)⊥ = Im(p× ) (the orthogonal and adjoint are relative to (, )a ) is
one-dimensional8 . Let us call v a non-zero vector in this space.
If v were isotropic, then for all ψ, η ∈ Se one would have (p× (ψ), p× (η))a =
(ψ, pp× (η))a = 0. By the non-degeneracy of (., .)a this would imply pp× = 0
which is excluded since ee×σ 6= 0.
Then we can suppose that (v, v) =  = ±1. Let us call q ∈ Se the orthogonal
projection on Cv = (Kerp)⊥ . Explicitly one has q(ψ) = (v, ψ)v, and it is easy
to check that q 2 = q = q × . Moreover, Kerq = v ⊥ = Kerp. Since v is not
isotropic, v ∈
/ Ker(q), hence Se = Ker(q) ⊕ Cv. If ψ ∈ Ker(q), then ψ ∈ Kerp,
hence pq(ψ) = p(ψ) = 0. Moreover pq(v) = p(v). Thus p = pq. Similarly it is
easy to check that qp = q using Se = Kerp ⊕ Ce.
Let us call f = L−1 (q) ∈ Cl(V ). Using L one sees that f 2 = f , f ×σ = f ,
e = ef , f = f e. This shows a). The uniqueness is easy to prove.
Let us show b). Since we know that (aψ, φ)σ = (ψ, a×σ φ)σ for all a ∈ Cl(V )
and φ, ψ ∈ Se by (??), then by lemma 2.4 there exists λ ∈ R such that
(., .)σ = λ(., .)a on Se . There thus suffices to show that λ 6= 0.
Let us consider f as an element of Se . Then (f, f )σ = τn (f ×σ f ) = τn (f ). Now
f being a non zero projection, its normalized trace is not zero. On the other
hand we have (f, f )σ = λ(f, f )a . This shows that λ 6= 0, and that (., .)σ is
σ-compatible.

*** The Dirac operator and spin structure commute if and only if {J, X} =
[J, ∇X ] = 0 for all X ∈ Γ(T M ).

*** The fact that {J, X} = [J, ∇X ] = 0 are sufficient conditions is a
straightforward calculation.
Let us prove that they are necessary. Let f be a smooth real-valued function.
Since [J, D] = [J, f ] = 0, we deduce that J commutes with [D, f ] = −iγ(df ).
We infer easily that J anti-commutes with any real vector field or differential
form. Next we consider the differential operator ∇0 = J −1 ∇J. This operator is
a Clifford connection. Indeed, for any X, Y ∈ Γ(T M ), ψ ∈ Γ(S):
∇0X (Y · ψ)

J −1 ∇X J(Y · ψ)
−J −1 ∇X (Y · Jψ)
−J −1 (∇LC
X Y ) · Jψ + Y · ∇X (Jψ)
0

X Y ) · ψ + Y · ∇X ψ

There thus exists a complex-valued one-form ω such that: ∇0X − ∇X = ω(X).
This can also be written: ω(X) = J −1 [∇X , J]. We have:

This implies that ω = 0, and thus that [∇X , J] = 0.

*** The Dirac operator is essentially self-adjoint if and only if X × = X for all
X ∈ Γ(T M ), and the Clifford connection ∇ is metric for H.

*** Let us assume that the Dirac operator is self-adjoint. Let f be a real-valued
smooth function. Then f is self-adjoint. This implies that [D, f ] = −iγ(df ) is
anti-self-adjoint. We easily conclude from this that all real vector fields and all
real-valued 1-forms are self-adjoint. In particular, the γ(dxµ ) are self-adjoint.
Let ψ, φ be spinor fields with compact support. We have:

for all ψ, φ ∈ Γc (S). Now, the expression between brackets can be proven to be
C ∞ (M, C)-linear in φ (and anti-linear in ψ as well). Indeed, H(∇µ ψ, γ(dxµ )φ) is
clearly linear in φ. let f ∈ C ∞ (M, C). We replace φ by f φ in the two remaining
terms:
H(ψ, ∇µ (γ(dxµ )f φ)) − ∂µ H(ψ, γ(dxµ )f φ)

H(ψ, ∇µ [f (γ(dxµ )φ)]) − ∂µ [f H

at every x. Now suppose that ∇0 is a local spin connection defined around x.
We know that ∇ = ∇0 + A where A is a scalar 1-form, and that ∇ is metric if
and only if A has pure imaginary values. Using (23 ) we find that

for all spinor fields ψ, φ with small enough compact support containing x.
Since H is non-degenerate the orthogonal of {γ(dx2 )φ, . . . , γ(dxn )φ} for H is
n
a subbundle of dimension 2 2 − n + 1 ≥ 1 of the spinor bundle. Since the
orthogonal of {γ(dx1 )φ, . . . , γ(dxn )φ} has codimension 1 in it, we can, at least
locally, consider a spinor field ψ such that H(ψ, γ(dxµ )φ) = 0 for µ = 2, . . . , n
and H(ψ, γ(dx1 )φ) 6= 0. Hence A1 + Ā1 = 0, and of course the same can be
done for the other indices. The Clifford connection ∇ is thus metric.
The converse can be proven easily following the same steps. It is in fact a
standard result of spin geometry. See for example [L-M 89].
