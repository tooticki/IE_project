Definition 1.1. ([12]) A diffeological space is a pair (X, DX ) where X is a set and DX is a specified
collection, also called the diffeology of X, of maps U → X (called plots) for each open set U in Rn and
for each n ∈ N, such that for all open subsets U ⊆ Rn and V ⊆ Rm the following three conditions are
satisfied:
1. (The covering condition) Every constant map U → X is a plot;
2. (The smooth compatibility condition) If U → X is a plot and V → U is a smooth map (in the usual
sense) then the composition V → U → X is also a plot;
3. (The sheaf condition) If U = ∪i Ui is an open cover and U → X is a set map such that each
restriction Ui → X is a plot then the entire map U → X is a plot as well.

y ∈ Y one of the following two cases occurs: either f˜(π1−1 (y) ∩ W1 ) 6 π2−1 (y) ∩ W2 or f˜(π1−1 (y) ∩ W1 ) >
π2−1 (y) ∩ W2 (the reverse inclusion).

Theorem 2.3. Let π1 : V1 → X1 and π10 : V10 → X1 , and π2 : V2 → X2 and π20 : V20 → X2 be two
pairs of finite-dimensional diffeological vector pseudo-bundles. Let f : X1 ⊃ Y → f (Y ) ⊂ X2 be a
smooth map that is a diffeomorphism with its image, and let f˜ : V1 ⊃ π1−1 (Y ) → π2−1 (f (Y )) ⊂ V2 and
f˜0 : V10 ⊃ (π10 )−1 (Y ) → (π20 )−1 (f (Y )) ⊂ V20 be two smooth lifts of it that are linear on all fibres in their
respective domains of definition. Then there exists a diffeomorphism
Ψ : (V1 ∪f˜ V2 ) ⊗ (V10 ∪f˜0 V20 ) → (V1 ⊗ V10 ) ∪f˜⊗f˜0 (V2 ⊗ V20 )
such that

(π1 ∪(f˜,f ) π2 ) ⊗ (π10 ∪(f˜0 ,f ) π20 ) = (π1 ⊗ π10 ) ∪f˜⊗f˜0 (π2 ⊗ π20 ) ◦ Ψ.

Lemma 2.5. Both A and M, considered with their standard diffeologies, are self-dual as diffeological
vector (pseudo-)bundles.

Lemma 3.2. Let π : E → M be a smooth vector bundle of rank k that admits an atlas of local
trivializations consisting of two charts only, i.e., M = U1 ∪ U2 with ϕi : Ui → Rn a diffeomorphism for
each i = 1, 2, and E = π −1 (U1 ) ∪ π −1 (U2 ) with ψi : π −1 (Ui ) → Ui × Rk being a fibrewise diffeomorphism
for i = 1, 2. Let g12 : U1 ∩ U2 → GLk (R) be the corresponding transition function. Let πi : Rn+k → Rn
be the projection of Rn+k = Rn × Rk onto its first factor Rn given by
πi = ϕi ◦ π ◦ ψi−1 ◦ (ϕi−1 × IdRk )
and considered as a diffeological vector pseudo-bundle with respect to the standard diffeology. Let Y =
ϕ1 (U1 ∩ U2 ), and let f : Y → Rn be given by f = ϕ2 ◦ (ϕ1 |U1 ∩U2 )−1 . Finally, let f˜ : π1−1 (Y ) → π2−1 (f (Y ))
n+k
act by f˜(y, v) = (f (y), g12 (ϕ−1
∪f˜ Rn+k → Rn ∪f Rn is diffeomorphic as
1 (y))v). Then π1 ∪(f˜,f ) π2 : R
a diffeological vector pseudo-bundle to the bundle π : E → M .

***
Theorem 3.3. Let π : E → M be a smooth vector bundle of rank k over an n-dimensional manifold M
that admits a finite atlas of m local trivializations. Then π is the result of gluing of m diffeological vector
pseudo-bundles πi : Rn+k → Rn , where
πi = ϕi ◦ π ◦ ψi−1 ◦ (ϕ−1
i × IdRk ) for i = 1, . . . , m,
and the gluing (f˜ij , fij ) between πi and πj is given by the maps
fij = ϕj ◦ (ϕi |Ui ∩Uj )−1 , and

Theorem 3.5. Let π : E → M be a smooth vector bundle over a smooth finite-dimensional manifold M ,
that admits a finite atlas of local trivializations. Then the diffeological dual pseudo-bundle of π : E → M
endowed with the standard diffeological structure is diffeomorphic to its usual dual bundle, via the identity
on M .

Lemma 4.1. Let X1 and X2 be two diffeological spaces, and let f : X1 ⊃ Y → X2 be a smooth map.
Then:
1) the obvious inclusions i1 : X1 \ Y ,→ X1 ∪f X2 , where X1 \ Y is considered with the subset diffeology
relative to the diffeology of X1 , and i2 : X2 ,→ X1 ∪f X2 are inductions;3
2) every plot p : U → X1 ∪f X2 locally has the following characterization: either there exists a plot
p2 : U ⊃ U 0 → X2 of X2 such that p|U 0 = i2 ◦ p2 , or there exists a plot p1 : U ⊃ U 0 → X1 of X1 such that

Proposition 4.2. The map ϕ1 ∪f ϕ2 is smooth for the gluing diffeology on X1 ∪f X2 and the given
diffeology of Z.

***
Theorem 4.3. The map FZ : C ∞ (X1 , Z) ×comp C ∞ (X2 , Z) → C ∞ (X1 ∪f X2 , Z) is smooth.

***
Proposition 4.4. The map ψ1 ∪(f,g) ψ2 is smooth for the gluing diffeologies on X1 ∪f X2 and Z1 ∪g Z2 .

***
Remark 4.5. The proposition just proven will mostly be applied in the case when ψ1 and ψ2 are two
sections of, respectively, pseudo-bundles π1 : V1 → X1 and π2 : V2 → X2 (so Zi = Vi and g is f˜) and,
especially, in the case of sections of the corresponding pseudo-bundles πi∗ ⊗ πi∗ : Vi∗ ⊗ Vi∗ → Xi , which in
what follows we call pseudo-metrics on pseudo-bundles πi .

***
Theorem 4.6. The map FZ1 ,Z2 is smooth.

***
Proposition 4.7. Let s1 ∈ C ∞ (X1 , V1 ) and s2 ∈ C ∞ (X2 , V2 ) be (f, f˜)-compatible, and let h1 ∈
C ∞ (X1 , R) and h2 ∈ C ∞ (X2 , R) be f -compatible functions, that is, such that h1 (y) = h2 (f (y)) for
all y ∈ Y . Then
(h1 ∪f h2 )(s1 ∪(f,f˜) s2 ) = (h1 s1 ) ∪(f,f˜) (h2 s2 ).

***
Proposition 4.8. Let si ∈ C ∞ (Xi , Vi ) and s0i ∈ C ∞ (Xi , Vi0 ) be such that s1 , s2 and s01 , s02 are two pairs
of (f, f˜)-compatible sections. Let f˜0 be a lift of f to pseudo-bundles V10 , V20 . Then
(s1 ∪(f,f˜) s2 ) ⊗ (s01 ∪(f,f˜0 ) s02 ) = (s1 ⊗ s01 ) ∪(f,f˜⊗f˜0 ) (s2 ⊗ s02 ).

***
Definition 5.1. Let π : V → X be a diffeological vector pseudo-bundle with finite-dimensional fibres.
A pseudo-metric on this pseudo-bundle is a smooth section g : X → V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ of the pseudo-bundle
V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ such that for every x ∈ X the bilinear form g(x) is symmetric, positive semi-definite, and of
rank equal to dim((π −1 (x))∗ ) ( i.e., g(x) is a pseudo-metric on the diffeological vector space π −1 (x)).

***
Example 5.2. Take X to be the standard R, and endow V = R3 with the pseudo-bundle diffeology, relative
to its projection onto the first coordinate, and generated by the plot p : R2 3 (u, v) 7→ (u, 0, |v|) ∈ R3 = V .
Thus, the diffeology of V , as well as its structure as the total space of this pseudo-bundle, corresponds to
its presentation as the direct product R × R2 ; this product diffeology comes from the standard diffeology
on R = X and the vector space diffeology on R2 generated by the plot v 7→ (0, |v|). The pseudo-bundle
map π is just the projection onto the first factor.
Since the diffeology on V is a product diffeology, the pseudo-bundle in question is trivial (diffeologically),
so finding a pseudo-metric is easy; we can choose one on the fibre and set it to be the chosen one on
any other fibre. Thus, the question reduces itself to one regarding pseudo-metrics, in the sense of vector
spaces, on R2 (we write it in the (y, z)-coordinates coming from the ambient R3 = V ) with diffeology
generated by v 7→ (0, |v|). This we have seen already, in the sense that each smooth linear map f on this
space is given by (y, z) 7→ ay for some constant a; by abuse of notation we can then write f as f = ae2
(making an implicit reference to the canonical dual basis of the ambient R3 and the same direct product
decomposition of its dual space). It follows then that any pseudo-metric g(x) on a given fibre π −1 (x) has
form g(x) = a(x)e2 ⊗ e2 , where a : R → R is a smooth everywhere positive function.

***
Example 5.3. Let V = R2 and X = R; let π : V → X be the projection on the x-axis, π(x, y) = x.
Endow X with the standard diffeology, and endow V with the pseudo-bundle diffeology generated by the
plot p : R2 → V defined by p(u, v) = (u, u|v|).

***
Lemma 5.4. If π : V → X is the pseudo-bundle of Example 5.3 , it does not admit a pseudo-metric.

***
Lemma 6.1. Suppose that f is invertible. Then the pseudo-metrics g1 and g2 are compatible if and only
if they are (f −1 , f˜∗ ⊗ f˜∗ )-compatible.

***
Definition 6.2. Let X1 and X2 be two diffeological spaces, and let f : X1 ⊃ Y → X2 be a map that is a
diffeomorphism with its image. The switch map
ϕX1 ↔X2 : X1 ∪f X2 → X2 ∪f −1 X1
is the map satisfying the following conditions: (ϕX1 ↔X2 ) ◦ i01 , where i01 : X1 ,→ (X1 t X2 ) → X1 ∪f X2 ,
coincides with the composition X1 ,→ (X2 t X1 ) → X2 ∪f −1 X1 , while (ϕX1 ↔X2 ) ◦ i2 coincides with the
compositionX2 ,→ (X2 t X1 ) → X2 ∪f −1 X1 .

***
Lemma 6.3. The switch map ϕX1 ↔X2 is uniquely defined and is a diffeomorphism.

***
Theorem 6.4. Let π1 : V1 → X1 and π2 : V2 → X2 be two finite-dimensional diffeological vector pseudobundles, and let (f˜, f ) be a gluing between them given by a smooth invertible f : X1 ⊃ Y → X2 and
its smooth fibrewise linear lift f˜. Suppose that (π2−1 (f (Y ))∗ and (π1−1 (Y ))∗ are fibrewise diffeomorphic.
Finally, assume that for i = 1, 2 there exists a pseudo-metric gi on Xi such that g1 and g2 are (f, f˜)compatible. Then the map
g̃ = Ψ∪,∗ ◦ (g2 ∪(f −1 ,f˜∗ ⊗f˜∗ ) g1 ) ◦ ϕX1 ↔X2 ,
is a pseudo-metric on the pseudo-bundle π1 ∪(f˜,f ) π2 : V1 ∪f˜ V2 → X1 ∪f X2 .

***
Theorem 6.5. Let π1 : V1 → X1 and π2 : V2 → X2 be two finite-dimensional diffeological vector pseudobundles, let (f˜, f ) be a gluing between them, and let g1 and g2 be pseudo-metrics on V1 and, respectively,
V2 compatible with respect to the gluing. Define g̃ : X1 ∪f X2 → (V1 ∪f˜ V2 )∗ ⊗ (V1 ∪f˜ V2 )∗ as

g̃(x) =

((j1−1 )∗ ⊗ (j1−1 )∗ ) ◦ g1 (x) for x ∈ i1 (X1 \ Y )
((j2−1 )∗ ⊗ (j2−1 )∗ ) ◦ g2 (x) for x ∈ i2 (X2 ).

Then g̃ is a pseudo-metric on the pseudo-bundle π1 ∪(f˜,f ) π2 : V1 ∪f˜ V2 → X1 ∪f X2 .

***
Theorem 6.6. Let πi : Vi → Xi for i = 1, 2 be two diffeological vector pseudo-bundles, and let (f˜, f ) be
a usual pair of maps defining gluing of V1 to V2 . Suppose that there is a diffeomorphism (V1 ∪f˜ V2 )∗ →
V2∗ ∪f˜∗ V1∗ covering the switch map ϕX1 ↔X2 . Finally, let gi be a pseudo-metric on πi : Vi → Xi and
assume that g1 and g2 are (f, f˜)-compatible. Then the commutative and the noncommutative versions of
g̃ yield the same pseudo-metric on π1 ∪(f˜,f ) π2 : V1 ∪f˜ V2 → X1 ∪f X2 .

***
Theorem 7.1. The map P is smooth.

***
Theorem 7.2. For any two (f, f˜)-compatible pseudo-metrics g1 and g2 on the pseudo-bundles π1 : V1 →
X1 and π2 : V2 → X2 consider the pseudo-metric g̃ on the pseudo-bundle π1 ∪(f˜,f ) π2 : V1 ∪f˜V2 → X1 ∪f X2
defined, for every x ∈ X1 ∪f X2 and v, w ∈ (π1 ∪(f˜,f ) π2 )−1 (x) as

g̃(x)(v1 , v2 ) =

−1
−1
g1 (i−1
1 (x))(j1 (v), j1 (w)) if x ∈ Im(i1 ),
−1
−1
g2 (i2 (x))(j2 (v), j2−1 (w)) if x ∈ Im(i2 ).

Then the map
P : G(V1 , X1 ) ×comp G(V2 , X2 ) → G(V1 ∪f˜ V2 , X1 ∪f X2 )
defined by P(g1 , g2 ) = g̃ is smooth.

***
Lemma 8.1. Let π : V → X be a finite-dimensional diffeological vector pseudo-bundle that admits a
pseudo-metric, and let g : X → V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ be a pseudo-metric on V . Then Φ is smooth as a map V → V ∗ .

***
Remark 8.2. Notice that the same conclusion holds for any smooth bilinear map g : X → V ∗ ⊗ V ∗ ,
not necessarily a pseudo-metric: whether it has, or not, the maximal rank possible for a given fibre, is
inessential for smoothness of Φ.

***
Theorem 8.3. Let π : V → X be a finite-dimensional diffeological vector pseudo-bundle that is locally
trivial and admits a pseudo-metric g. Then there is a natural induced pseudo-metric g ∗ on its dual
pseudo-bundle π ∗ : V ∗ → X.

***
Remark 8.4. We are not able to say whether the assumption of local triviality is truly necessary for the
existence of a smooth g ∗ , which is somewhat disappointing.
