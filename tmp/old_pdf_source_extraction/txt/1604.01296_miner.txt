Deﬁniton 3.2. Let X be a metric space and let m be a nonnegative function on

Theorem 3.3. Let X be a metric space, {xn} be a sequence in X, and m be

Corollary 3.4. Let T be a self-map of a metric space X, and m be a nonnegative
function on X × X. Suppose there exists a point x ∈ X such that

d(xn+1, xn+2) ≤ d(xn, xn+1),
d(xn+1, xn+2) < d(xn, xn+1),

(n ∈ N0),
(if xn (cid:54)= xn+1).

If m satisﬁes (2.3) and {xn} is m-contractive, then d(xn, xn+1) → 0 and, hence,

Theorem 3.6. Let T be an asymptotically regular self-map of a metric space X,
and m be a nonnegative function on X × X. Suppose
(i) for any  > 0, there exist δ > 0 and N ∈ N0 such that

(3.4)
(ii) for every x ∈ X, condition (2.3) holds for any two subsequences {xpn} and

{xqn} of the sequence {T nx}.

Then the Picard iterates of T are Cauchy sequences. Moreover, if X is complete,
T is continuous, and d(T nx, T ny) → 0, for all x, y ∈ X, then the Picard iterates
converge to a unique ﬁxed point of T .

Example 3.7. Let T be a self-map of X, and consider the following functions:

Theorem 3.8. Let X be a complete metric space, and T be a continuous and

(i) d(T x, T y) < m(x, y), for every x, y ∈ X with x (cid:54)= y,
(ii) for any  > 0, there exist δ > 0 and N ∈ N0 such that

∀x, y ∈ X, m(T N x, T N y) < δ +  =⇒ d(T N +1x, T N +1y) ≤ .

(3.6)

Then T has a unique ﬁxed point z, and the Picard iterates of T converge to z.

***
Example 3.9. Take ai = i, for 0 ≤ i < 4, let r0 = 0, and rn = 1/n for n ≥ 1, and
set x4n+i = ai + rn. Let

X = {x4n+i : 0 ≤ i < 4, n ≥ 0}.

Then, equipped with the Euclidean metric, X is a complete metric space. Deﬁne
a mapping T : X → X by T (x(cid:96)) = x2(cid:96). Deﬁne m(x, y) by setting s = t = 1 and
α = β = 1 in (??), that is,

m(x, y) = d(x, y) + d(x, T x) + d(y, T y).

(Note that m is also obtained from (1.3) by setting γ = 1.)
First, we show that T satisﬁes all conditions in Theorem 3.8 . Clearly, T is
continuous and, for every x(cid:96), xν ∈ X, we have

d(T n+2x(cid:96), T n+2xν) = d(T nx4(cid:96), T nx4ν) =

It is a matter of calculation to see that d(T x, T y) < m(x, y), for all x, y ∈ X. The
following shows that T satisﬁes (3.6) with N = 2:

Next, we show that the following condition (in Proinov’s theorem) is violated:

• for every  > 0, there exist δ > 0 such that

∀x, y ∈ X, m(x, y) < δ +  =⇒ d(T x, T y) ≤ .

Take  = a2 − a0. Let u(cid:96) = x4(cid:96) and v(cid:96) = x4((cid:96)+1)+1. Then

d(T u(cid:96), T v(cid:96)) = |x4(2(cid:96)) − x4(2(cid:96)+2)+2| = a2 − a0 + r2(cid:96) − r2(cid:96)+2 > ,

and

m(u(cid:96), v(cid:96)) = |u(cid:96) − v(cid:96)| + |u(cid:96) − T u(cid:96)| + |v(cid:96) − T v(cid:96)|

= |x4(cid:96) − x4((cid:96)+1)+1| + |x4(cid:96) − x4(2(cid:96))| + |x4((cid:96)+1)+1 − x4(2(cid:96)+2)+2|
= (a1 − a0 + r(cid:96) − r(cid:96)+1) + (r(cid:96) − r2(cid:96)) + (a2 − a1 + r(cid:96)+1 − r2(cid:96)+2)
= a2 − a0 + 2r(cid:96) − r2(cid:96) − r2(cid:96)+2.

If δ(cid:96) = 2r(cid:96) − r2(cid:96) − r2(cid:96)+2, we have

Since δ(cid:96) → 0 as (cid:96) → ∞, we see that T does not satisfy (3.6) for  = a2 − a0.

 < d(T u(cid:96), T v(cid:96)) < m(u(cid:96), v(cid:96)) ≤  + δ(cid:96).
