Definition. For F ⊂ P([n]), a set A ∈ F, and 1 ≤ j < i ≤ n, the shifting operator Sij is

otherwise. We define Sij (F) = {Sij (A) : A ∈ F}.
F is called n-compressed if A\ {n} ∪ {j} ∈ F for all A ∈ F such that A ∩ {j, n} = n, i.e., if
Snj (F) = F for all j < n. F is called shifted if Sij (F) = F for all j < i.
