Remark 3.5. One can also determine pLT, RTq by the following algorithm [20, (3.6)],
which will be useful in later arguments:
(s-1) Let yi “ T Rpiq for 1 ď i ď htpT Rq. First, slide down the box y1 in T R as far
as the entry of T L in the same row is no greater than y1. If no entry of T L
is greater than y, we place y1 next to T Lp1q.

(s-2) Next, slide down y2 until it is above y1 and the entry of T L in the same
row is no greater than y2. Repeat the same process with the other boxes
y3 , y4 , . . . until there is no moving down.

(s-3) Slide each box x in T L to the right if its right position is empty (indeed the

number of such boxes is a).

(s-4) Deﬁne RT to be the tableau determined by the boxes yi ’s in T R together
with boxes x ’s which have moved from T L by (s-3), and deﬁne LT to be the
tableau with the remaining boxes on the left.

For example, let T be as in Example 3.4 .

Remark 5.6. The (cid:96)-tuples pT tail

of shape ν and τ π, respectively, which are not necessarily rns-semistandard. But they
become rns-semistandard when T is equivalent to an rns- semistandard tableau of
a relatively small shape as an element of l-crystals. More precisely, if T ”l S for
some S P SSTrnspγq with γ1 ă (cid:96), then pT tail

rns-semistandard [18, Lemma 4.2], which implies that pT tail

Remark 5.10. In [8], it is proved that the set of certain KN tableaux of classical
type so called marginally large tableaux is isomorphic to Bp8q (see also [2]). One
may deﬁne an embedding of KNg
λ into the crystal of marginally large tableaux by
mapping T to T1 ” T b Hγ, where Hγ is a highest element in KNg
µ with xωγ, hiy " 0
for all i. Unlike in type A, it does not seem to be easy in general to describe T1 since
the insertion scheme in types BCD [23, 24] is more involved. On the other hand,
the embedding Ξλ in Theorem 5.9 uses only the Sch¨utzenberger’s jeu de taquin
sliding and RSK.
