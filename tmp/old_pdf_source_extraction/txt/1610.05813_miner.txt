Proposition 2.1. Let H be given by a presentation with ﬁnitely many generators and a
countable set of relators r1, r2, . . .. The following are equivalent.

(i) H is F P2.

(ii) There exists m so that for each i > m, the loop deﬁned by ri represents zero in the
homology of the partial Cayley complex corresponding to all the generators and the
relators r1, . . . , rm.

(iii) There is a connected free H-CW-complex with ﬁnitely many orbits of cells and

perfect fundamental group.

Lemma 2.2. If R is a homologically benign normal subgroup of a ﬁnitely generated group

Lemma 2.3. Let G be a ﬁnitely generated group which is embeddable in an F P2 group.

• Every ﬁnitely generated subgroup of G is homologically benign in G.
• If H and K are homologically benign subgroups of G, then so are their intersection

and the subgroup that they generate.
