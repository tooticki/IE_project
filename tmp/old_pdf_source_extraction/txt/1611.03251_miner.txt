Theorem 1. Let F be a ﬁnite family of convex sets in Rd. If every d + 1 or fewer
elements of F intersects, then all the sets in the family F intersect.

Problem 1. Let A be a ﬁnite family of linear operators Kd → Kd, where K is an
arbitrary ﬁeld and d (cid:62) 2. Find minimal k = HE(Kd) such that if any k or fewer
elements of A have a common eigenvector then there is a common eigenvector for
all operators in the family A.

Theorem 2. HE(Kd) = (cid:98)3d/2(cid:99) for an arbitrary ﬁeld K.

Problem 2. Let A be a ﬁnite family of linear operators Kd → Kd, where K is an
arbitrary ﬁeld and d (cid:62) 2. Find minimal l = HI(Kd) such that if any l or fewer
elements of A have a common non-trivial invariant subspace then there is a common
non-trivial invariant subspace for all operators in the family A.

***
Conjecture 1. HI(Kd) = O(d).

Theorem 3. Suppose that A is a ﬁnite family of linear operators such that A0 ∈ A
have d eigenvectors in Kd with diﬀerent eigenvalues and any 2d−1 or fewer elements
of A have a common non-trivial invariant subspace then there is a common non-
trivial invariant subspace for all elements of A.

Lemma 1. Let q > 0 and p ≥ 0 be integer numbers. Given a family M =
{M1, . . . , Mp} of non-empty and proper subsets of [q]. Suppose that for every non-
empty subset I ⊆ [p] we have either

Fact 1. Hi := span({vj : j ∈ Xi}) is a common eigenspace for operators Am,
m ∈ [n] \ (Xi ∪ {i}).

***
Fact 2. Suppose that l ∈ Xi for i ∈ [k]. Then vectors vj, j ∈ {i} ∪ [k + 1, n] \ {l},
are linearly independent.
