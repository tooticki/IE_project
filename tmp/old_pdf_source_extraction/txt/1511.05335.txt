Definition 6.1. Let T ⊂ H∨ be a torus such that the projection ZH∨ oWF (T ) →
WF is surjective. Then we call L L = ZH∨ oWF (T ) a Levi L-subgroup of L H.

***
Lemma 6.2. Let L L be a Levi L-subgroup of L H. There exists a WF -stable Levi
subgroup L∨ of H∨ such that L L is H∨ -conjugate to L∨ o WF and L := L L ∩ H∨ is
conjugate to L∨ .
Conversely, every H∨ -conjugate of L∨ o WF is a Levi L-subgroup of L H.

***
Remark 6.3. Most Levi L-subgroups of L H are not quasi-Levi, and conversely. For
example, let U = U(n, E/F ) be a p-adic unitary group (E is a quadratic extension
of F ) and let L U be its dual L-group. The group WF acts on U ∨ = GL(n, C) via an
outer automorphism which preserves the diagonal torus T and the standard Borel
subgroup B. Then T o WF is a Levi L-subgroup of L U: it is the centralizer of T WF
in L U. However, it is not quasi-Levi. Namely ZL U (T ) = T o WE , which is an index
two subgroup of T o WF .

***
Definition 6.4. A L-parameter for L H is a continuous group homomorphism
φ : WF × SL2 (C) → L H such that:
• φ(w) ∈ H∨ w for all w ∈ WF ;
• φ(w) is semisimple for all w ∈ WF ;
• φ|SL2 (C) : SL2 (C) → H∨ is a homomorphism of complex algebraic groups.

***
Definition 6.5. Let φ : WF × SL2 (C) → L H be a L-parameter. We say that φ is
bounded if φ(Frob) = (h, Frob) with h in some compact subgroup of H∨ .
Suppose that L L is a Levi L-subgroup of L H and that
• L L contains the image of φ;
• there is no smaller Levi L-subgroup of L H with this property.
Then we call φ relevant for H if and only if the conjugacy class of L L is relevant for
H, that is, it corresponds to a conjugacy class of Levi subgroups of H.
In this case we also say that φ is a discrete L-parameter for L L, and for any Levi
subgroup L ⊂ H in the associated class. In particular φ is discrete for H if and only
if there is no proper Levi L-subgroup of L H containing the image of φ.

***
Definition 6.6. Let (φ, ρ) be an enhanced L-parameter for L H. We say that (φ, ρ)
or ρ is H-relevant if ζρ parametrizes the inner twist H via (??).

***
Proposition 6.7.
Let H be an inner twist of a quasi-split group and let ζ ∈

∨ )WF be the associated character. Let φ be a Langlands parameter for
IrrC Z(Hsc
L H. The following are equivalent:
(1) φ is relevant for H;
∨ )WF ∩ Z ∨ (φ)◦ ⊂ ker c;
(2) Z(Hsc
Hsc
(3) there exists a ρ ∈ IrrC (Sφ ) with ζρ = ζ, that is, such that (φ, ρ) is H-relevant.

***
Definition 6.8. An enhanced L-parameter (φ, ρ) for L H is cuspidal if φ is discrete
1 (φ|
and (uφ , ρ) is a cuspidal pair for G = ZH
∨
WF ). Here ρ is considered as a
sc
representation of π0 (ZG (uφ )) via (??).
We denote the set of H∨ -equivalence classes of H-relevant cuspidal L-parameters by
Φcusp (H). When ζH is as in (??), we put Φcusp,ζH (H) = Φcusp (H) ∩ Φe,ζH .

***
Example 6.9. Let F be a p-adic field, D a division algebra over F such that
dimF D = d2 and H = GLm (D). Then H is an inner form of GLn (F ) with n = md.
∨ = SL (C), and S = π (Z
Let (φ, ρ) ∈ Φcusp (H). We have Hsc

L H = GL (C) × W , we can decompose φ as

where I is a set of irreducible representations of WF and for all π ∈ I, Sπ is a
representation of SL2 (C). Let dπ denote the dimension of Sπ . We will use same
argument as in [Lus2, p. 247]. Then
Y

G = ZSLn (C) (φ(WF )) '
GLdπ (C) ∩ SLn (C).
π∈I

Hence, we can write uφ = (uφ,π )π∈I . Since we assume that φ is cuspidal, this
implies that for all π ∈ I, uφ,π is in the regular unipotent class, corresponding to
the partition dπ and Z(SLdπ (C)) acts on ρ by a character of order dπ . But AG (uφ )
is a cyclic group of order gcd(dπ , π ∈ I). So, since its contains a subgroup of order
dπ and its cardinality is at most dπ , we get that all dπ are equal to some integer d0
and Sφ = Z/d0 Z. Moreover
ZSLn (C) (φ(WF )) ' (GLd0 (C))#I ∩ SLn (C).
Because we suppose that φ is discrete, I is a singleton. We obtain that φ = π  Sd0 .
∨ (φ) by a character of order d, so
In particular, the center of SLn (C) acts on SHsc
that d = d0 . Hence φ = π  Sd . We recover the case when D = F and φ = π
is an irreducible representation of WF . An other case is when H = GL1 (D) with
d = 2. We obtain that the supercuspidal representations of GL1 (D) are of the form
χ  S2 , with χ a character of WF . (This Langlands parameter is the parameter
of χStGL2 (F ) and the two representations are connected by the Jacquet–Langlands
correspondence).

***
Example 6.10. Let F be a p-adic field, and let H be a symplectic group Sp2n (F )
or a split special orthogonal group SOm (F ). We have L H = H∨ × WF . Then [Mou,
Proposition 4.14] shows, using results of Arthur and Mœglin, that the supercuspidal
irreducible representations of H correspond, via the local Langlands correspondence,
to cuspidal enhanced L-parameters.

***
Example 6.11. Let F be a p-adic field and E a quadratic extension of F . Let
H = Un (F ) be the quasi-split unitary group defined over F and split over E. We
have L H = GLn (C) o Gal(E/F ). Let φ : WF × SL2 (C) −→ L H be a discrete
Langlands parameter and fix σ ∈ WF such that WF /WE ' hσi. We use the
notions of conjugate-dual, conjugate-orthogonal and conjugate-symplectic defined
in [GGP, §3]. We can decompose the restriction of φ to WE as an n-dimensional

Every term mπ π in (91) can be decomposed as ⊕a π  Sa , where Sa denotes the adimensional irreducible representation of SL2 (C). Here a runs through some subset
of N – every a appears at most once because φ is discrete. For every such (π, a) we
choose an element zπ,a ∈ AGLn (C) (φ) which acts as −1 on π  Sa and as the identity
on all other factors π 0  Sa0 .
From now on we assume that φ can be enhanced to a cuspidal L-parameter. The
above and the classification of cuspidal pairs in [Lus2] show that uφ = (uφ,π ) satisfies:

Moreover, in [Moe, Théorème 8.4.4], Mœglin classified the supercuspidal
representations in an Arthur packet. In particular, for tempered Langlands
parameters (which are Arthur parameters trivial on the second copy of SL2 (C)),
the description is given in term of a Jordan block and a character defined by this
Jordan block. Here the Jordan block Jord(φ) of the Langlands parameter φ of a
supercuspidal representation of H is the set of pairs (π, a), where π is an irreducible
representation of WE stable under the action of the composition of inverse-transpose
and σ, and a is an integer such that π  Sa is a subrepresentation of φ WE .
The condition on the Jordan block says that it has no holes (or is without jumps).
More explicitly, for all a > 2, if (π, a) ∈ Jord(φ) then (π, a−2) ∈ Jord(φ). The shape
of φ is then as (92). Moreover, the alternated characters are exactly the cuspidal
ones. More precisely, [Moe, p.194] gives the definition zπ,a as our zπ,a zπ,a−2 (or zπ,2
in the case of a = 2). But the cuspidal characters are exactly the characters which
are alternated, i.e. such that ε(zπ,a zπ,a−2 ) = −1.

Example 6.12. Let φ be a relevant discrete L-parameter which is trivial on the
wild inertia subgroup PF of the inertia group IF , and such that the centralizer of
φ(IF ) in H∨ is a torus. The latter condition forces φ to be trivial on SL2 (C). Hence
uφ = 1, and any enhancement of φ gives a cuspidal L-parameter. Let

Cφ = π0 ZH∨ (φ)/Z(L H)◦
and let ρ ∈ Irr(Cφ ). It is known from [DeRe] that these enhanced L-parameters (φ, ρ)
correspond to the depth-zero generic supercuspidal irreducible representations of H,
in the case where H is a pure inner form of an unramified reductive p-adic group.
We note that the component group Cφ is a quotient of our Sφ , namely by the kernel
∨ → H∨ . A priori in these references only a subset of our enhancements of φ
of Hsc
is considered. However, it boils down to the same, because the p-adic group H is
chosen such that ρ is relevant for it [DeRe, §2].

***
Example 6.13. Let (φ, ρ) be a relevant enhanced L-parameter such that φ is
(r+1)
(r)
discrete and trivial on PF
and nontrivial on PF for some integer r > 0, and
(r)
such that the centralizer in H∨ of φ(PF ) is a maximal torus of H∨ . Again any such
(φ, ρ) is cuspidal. The same argument as in Example 6.12 shows that the result
of Reeder in [Ree2, §6] implies that these enhanced L-parameters correspond to the
depth-zero generic supercuspidal irreducible representations of H, when H is a pure
inner form of an unramified reductive p-adic group.

Example 6.14. Let (φ, ρ) be a cuspidal relevant enhanced L-parameter such that
1 (φ(Frob)). Lusztig has
φ is trivial on the inertia group IF . We have G = ZH
∨
sc
proved in [Lus4] that these enhanced L-parameters correspond to the unipotent
irreducible representations of H in the case when H is simple of adjoint type. Under
these conditions H∨ is simply connected and Sφ coincides with the component group
considered by Lusztig.
Recall that a representation π of H is said to be unipotent (or to have unipotent
reduction) if for some parahoric subgroup P of H, and some unipotent cuspidal
representation σ of the reductive quotient of P, the space HomP (σ, π) is nonzero
(where σ is viewed as a representation of P by inflation).

Definition 7.1. Let L L be a Levi L-subgroup of L H. A Langlands parameter for
L L is a group homomorphism φ : W × SL (C) → L L satisfying the requirements

of Definition 6.4 . An enhancement of φ is an irreducible representation ρ of
π0 (ZL1 sc (φ)), where Lsc is the simply connected cover of the derived group of
L = L L ∩ H∨ . The group L acts on the collection of enhanced L-parameters for L L
by (??).
 
We say that (φ, ρ) is cuspidal for L L if φ is discrete for L L and uφ = φ 1, ( 10 11 ) , ρ
is a cuspidal pair for ZL1 sc (φ|WF ). We denote the set of L-orbits by Φe (L L) and the
subset of cuspidal L-orbits by Φcusp (L L).

Definition 7.9. Fix a pinning of H and a WF -stable pinning of H∨ . A standard
triple for H consists of:
• a standard Levi subgroup L of H;
• a bounded L-parameter φt ∈ Φbdd (L);
• an unramified twist z ∈ Xnr (L L), which is strictly positive with respect to
the standard parabolic subgroup P with Levi factor L.
The last condition means that α∨ (z) > 1 for every root α of (UP , Z(L)◦ ), where UP
denotes the unipotent radical of P.
An enhancement of a standard triple (L, φt , z) is an L-relevant irreducible
L . Let ζ

Definition 8.1. Let (L L, φv , q) and (L L0 , φ0v , q0 ) be two cuspidal data for L H.
They are inertially equivalent if there exist z ∈ Xnr (L L) and h ∈ H∨ such that
h L L0 h−1 = L L

and

(zφv , q) = (hφ0v h−1 , h · q0 ).

The class of (L L, φv , q) modulo Xnr (L L) is denoted [L L, φv , q]L L , and its inertial
equivalence class is denoted [L L, φv , q]L H . We say that [L L, φv , q]L H is H-relevant
if any of its elements is so. We write B∨ (L H) for the set of inertial equivalence
classes of cuspidal pairs for L H, and B∨ (H) for its subset of H-relevant classes.
Given an inertial equivalence class s∨ for L H, we write, using Definition 7.7 ,

Φe (L H)s = {(φ, ρ) ∈ Φe (L H) : the cuspidal support of (φ, ρ) lies in s∨ }.

Example 9.4. Yet there are also cases in which κ is definitely not trivial. Take
H = SL5 (D), where D is a quaternion division algebra over F . This is an inner form
of SL10 (F ) and L H = PGL10 (C) × WF .
We will rephrase Example 3.2 with L-parameters. We can ignore the factor WF
of L H, because it acts trivially on H∨ . Let φ : WF → SL2 (C)5 be a group
homomorphism whose image is the group Q from Example 3.2 . It projects to
a homomorphism φ|WF : WF → PGL10 (C). Let u and  be as in the same example.
