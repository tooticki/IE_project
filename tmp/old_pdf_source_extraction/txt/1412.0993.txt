3.1 . Theorem. If f ∈ BV ([a, b ], X) then there exists a break function f B : [a, b ] → X
such that f − f B is continuous on [a, b ]. Moreover, the function f B is determined
uniquely up to an additive constant.

***
3.2 . Remark. Let f ∈ BV ([a, b ], X) and let f B be given as in Theorem 3.1 . Let us
denote f C := f − f B . Then f = f C + f B and we say that f is decomposed into the
sum of its continuous part f C and its break part f B . Such a decomposition is in the
classical case of real valued functions called the Jordan decomposition of f.
Furthermore, note that, in view of (??) and (??), we have also
f B (t) =

∞
X
 +

∆ f (sk ) χ(sk ,b] (t) + ∆− f (sk ) χ[sk ,b] (t) for t ∈ [a, b ].
k=1

Let us put
fnB (t)

=

n
X



∆+ f (sk ) χ(sk ,b] (t) + ∆− f (sk ) χ[sk ,b] (t) for t ∈ [a, b ] and n ∈ N.

k=1

Then it is not difficult to prove that lim varba (fnB − f B ) = 0 (cf. [21, Lemma I.4.23] for
n→∞

the proof of an analogous assertion for real valued functions).

***
4.1 . Definition. Let J be a bounded interval in R. We say that a finite set
D = {α0 , α1 , . . . , αν(D) } ⊂ J
is a generalized division of J if
α0 < α1 < · · · < αν(D) .
The set of all generalized divisions of the interval J is denoted by D∗ (J).
Let f : [a, b ] → X and let J be an arbitrary subinterval of [a, b ]. Then we define the
variation of f on J by


 ν(D)

X
varJ f = sup
kf (αj ) − f (αj−1 )kX .

D∈D∗ (J) 
j=1

We say that f is of bounded variation on J if varJ f < ∞. In such a case, we write
f ∈ BV (J, X). For convention we set also
var∅ f = 0 and var[c] f = 0 for c ∈ [a, b ].

***
4.2 . Remark. It is easy to see that Definition 4.1 coincides with the definition of the
variation in the sense of Jordan if J is a compact interval, that is, for f : [a, b ] → X and
J = [c, d] ⊆ [a, b ] we have
var[c,d] f = varcd f.
For this reason, in the case of a compact interval, we may always restrict ourselves to
the divisions containing their end points (as defined in Section 2).
Moreover, it is easy to see that if J is a bounded interval and f ∈ BV (J, X), then f is
bounded on J.

***
4.3 . Proposition. Let f : [a, b ] → X and let J1 and J2 be subintervals of [a, b ] such
that J2 ⊆ J1 . Then
varJ2 f ≤ varJ1 f.
In particular, if J is a subinterval of [a, b ] and f ∈ BV (J, X), then f ∈ BV (I, X) for
every interval I ⊆ J.

***
4.4 . Theorem. Let f : [a, b ] → X and c, d ∈ [a, b ], with c < d.
(i) If f ∈ BV ([c, d), X), then

var[c,d) f = limδ→0+ vard−δ
f = supt∈[c,d) vartc f.
c

(ii) If f ∈ BV ((c, d], X), then

d
var(c,d] f = limδ→0+ varc+δ
f = supt∈(c,d] vartd f.

(iii) If f ∈ BV ((c, d), X), then

var(c,d) f = limδ→0+ vard−δ
c+δ f.

***
4.5 . Lemma. Let f : [a, b ] → X, a ≤ c < d ≤ b and f ∈ BV ((c, d), X). Then both
limits f (c+) and f (d−) exist.

***
4.6 . Theorem. Let f : [a, b ] → X and a ≤ c < d ≤ b.
(i) If f ∈ BV ([c, d), X), then f (d−) exists and
varcd f = var[c,d) f + k∆− f (d)kX .
(ii) If f ∈ BV ((c, d], X), then f (c+) exists and
varcd f = var(c,d] f + k∆+ f (c)kX .
(iii) If f ∈ BV ((c, d), X), then both limits f (c+) and f (d−) exist and
varcd f = var(c,d) f + k∆+ f (c)kX + k∆− f (d)kX .

***
4.7 . Corollary. Let f : [a, b ] → X and c, d ∈ [a, b ], with c < d. Then the following
assertions are equivalent:
(i) f ∈ BV ([c, d], X),
(ii) f ∈ BV ((c, d], X),
(iii) f ∈ BV ([c, d), X),
(iv) f ∈ BV ((c, d), X).

***
4.8 . Remark. In view Theorem 4.6 , we can also observe that for f : [a, b ] → X and
c ∈ [a, b ], we have
−
+
lim var c+δ
c−δ f = k∆ f (c)kX + k∆ f (c)kX

δ→0+

provided the one-sided limits exist at the point c (see [8, Proposition I.2.8]).
Furthermore, by Theorem 4.6 , if f ∈ BV ([a, b ], X) ∩ C([a, b ], X), then
var[c,d) f = var(c,d) f = var(c,d] f = varcd f

for c, d ∈ [a, b ] such that c < d.

***
4.9 . Definition. Let E ⊂ R be bounded. We say that E is an elementary set if it is
a finite union of intervals.
A collection of intervals {Jk : k = 1, . . . , m} is called a minimal decomposition of E if
m
[
E=
Jk and the union Jk ∪ J` is not an interval whenever k 6= `.
k=1

If S ⊆ R, then E(S) stands for the set of all elementary subsets of S.

***
4.10. Definition. Given a function f : [a, b ] → X and an elementary subset E of [a, b ],
the variation of f over E is
var(f, E) =

m
X

varJk f,

k=1

where {Jk : k = 1, . . . , m} is the minimal decomposition of E.

***
4.11. Remark. Let us note that in [6] Definition 4.1 is applied also to arbitrary subsets
E of [a, b ]. Unfortunately, such a definition is not convenient for our purposes, as the
variation would lose the additivity property even for continuous functions. Indeed, let
a < c < d < b and E = [a, c] ∪ [d, b]. Then, according to such a definition we would
have
varE f ≥ varca f + varbd f + kf (d) − f (c)k > var[a,c] f + var[d,b] f
whenever f (d) 6= f (c). This is why for elementary subsets of [a, b ] we will define the
variation in a different way than that used by Gordon in [6].

***
4.12 . Lemma. Let f ∈ BV ([a, b ], X)
\∩ C([a, b ], X) and let {An } be a contracting
sequence of subsets of [a, b ] such that
An = ∅. For n ∈ N put
n

vn = sup{ var(f, E): E ∈ E(An ) }.
Then

limn→∞ vn = 0.

5.1 . Definition. Let F : [a, b ] → L(X), g: [a, b ] → X and an elementary subset E of

for every F : [a, b ] → L(X).
Consequently,
