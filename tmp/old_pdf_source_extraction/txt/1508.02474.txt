Theorem 1.1. If W is a matrix Ap weight and T is a (W, p)-CZO
on Rd , then T extends to a bounded operator on Lp (W ) if and only if
0
T 1 ∈ BMOpW and T ∗ 1 ∈ BMOpW 1−p0 .

Corollary 1.2. Let W be a matrix Ap weight, let T be a scalar kernelled
CZO, and let A be a constant n × n matrix. If W and A satisfy the
condition
sup (kVI AVI−1 k + kVI0 A∗ (VI0 )−1 k) < ∞
I⊆Rd
I is a cube

then TA : Lp (W ) → Lp (W ) (where TA is defined as above) iff TA 1 ∈

BMOpW and (T ∗ )A 1 ∈ BMOpW 1−p0 .

Conversely, if (1.8 ) holds then so does (1.7 ) for q = p.

Proposition 1.4. Let K : Rd \{0} → C be not identically zero, be
homogenous of degree −d, have mean zero over the unit sphere ∂Bd ,
and satisfy K ∈ C ∞ (∂Bd ) (so in particular K could be any of the Riesz
kernels). If T is the (convolution) CZO associated to K, B is a locally
integral Mn (C) valued function, and W is a matrix Ap weight then
[T, B ∗ ] : Lp (W ) → Lp boundedly (directly) implies that both (1.7) and
(1.8) are true (for q = p, and f~ replaced by B).
