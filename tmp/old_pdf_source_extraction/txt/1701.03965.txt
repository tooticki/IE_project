Remark 2.2. As can be seen from the proof of Theorem 2.1 , the assumption on the cocycle
being class injective is not necessary for this convergence result. But we dispense with this
additional generality in order to make sure that the values h∗P (α) accurately reflect entropy
theoretic information regarding the action of Γ on X.

Definition 2.3. [Cocycle entropy] Let (X, λ) be a p.m.p. ergodic action of Γ. Let α : R → Γ be
a class injective cocycle defined on a hyperfinite relation. The number

	
hC (Γ y X) := inf h∗P (α) | P countable, generating partition
is called the cocycle entropy for the action Γ y (X, λ) and for the injective cocycle α : R → Γ.

Corollary 2.8. Convergence in Theorem 2.7 holds for ν-almost every y ∈ Y in the L1 (X, λ)norm, and also in the L1 (X × Y, λ × ν)-norm.

Proposition 3.1. If (Rn ) is a bounded hyperfinite exhaustion of the relation R, then S
there exists
an increasing sequence of finite subgroups Φn ⊆ Aut(R), n ≥ 1, such that Φ := n≥1 Φn is

In particular, for every φ ∈ Φ, there is an n0 ∈ N such that Rn (y) 4 φ(Rn (y)) = ∅ for ν-almost
every y ∈ Y and every n ≥ n0 .

Definition 4.1. [Subadditive functions] A mapping H : BSF(R) → Map Y, [0, ∞) is called
subadditive if
• for every bounded subset function A, the function H(A) : Y → [0, ∞) is measurable;
• H is bounded in the sense that there exists C > 0 such that for all subset functions A, we
have H(A)(y) ≤ C |A(y)| a.e.;
• H is R-invariant, i.e. for every bounded sub-equivalence relation T ⊆ R, one has h(T )(y) =
h(T )(z), whenever yT z.
• H has the following
`m subadditivity property: if A, Ai are bounded subset functions that
satisfy A(y) := i=1 Ai (zi ) then for a.e. y ∈ Y

Examples 7.1.
(1) Let Γ be an irreducible lattice in a connected semisimple Lie group with
finite center and without compact factors. Then the action of Γ on the maximal boundary
(G/P, m), where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup and m is the Lebesgue measure class,
is amenable and has stable type III1 , see [BN13b].
(2) Let Γ be a discrete non-elementary subgroup of isometries of real hyperbolic space. By
[Su78] [Su82], the type of the action of Γ on the boundary of hyperbolic space with respect
to the Lebesgue measure class is III1 . In [Sp87] this result was proved for the action of
fundamental groups of compact connected negatively curved manifolds acting on the visual
boundary with the manifold measure class.
(3) Let Γ be a finitely generated free group. By [RR07], the action of Γ has non-trivial type
with respect to harmonic measures, namely stationary measures of suitable random walks.
For Γ being a word hyperbolic group, it was proved in [INO08] that the action of Γ on the
Poisson boundary associated with a generating measure of finite support has non-trivial
type.
(4) In [Bo14] it was proved that for word hyperbolic groups (with an additional technical
condition) the action on the Gromov boundary with respect to a quasi-conformal measure
(and in particular the Patterson-Sullivan measure) measure has non-trivial stable type.
