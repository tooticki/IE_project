Lemma 1.1. Let A and B be Grothendieck categories with localizing subcategories
S ⊆ A and T ⊆ B. Let π : A → A/S and π(cid:48) : B → B/T be the quotient functors,
and let ω and ω(cid:48) be right adjoints to π and π(cid:48) respectively. Consider the following
diagram of functors:

(1-1)

F

A

π

B

π(cid:48)

B/T.
Suppose that F is right exact and F (S) ⊆ T.
If L1(π(cid:48)F ), the ﬁrst left derived
functor of π(cid:48)F , exists, which it does when A has enough projectives, and vanishes
on S, then

A/S

transformation π(cid:48)F → π(cid:48)F ωπ induced by the natural
(1) the natural
(2) there is a unique functor G : A/S → B/T such that π(cid:48)F = Gπ; furthermore,

transformation η : idA → ωπ is an isomorphism;
G ∼= π(cid:48)F ω;

(3) G is right exact;
(4) if F commutes with direct sums so does G;
(5) if F has a right adjoint so does G: if F (cid:97) H, then G (cid:97) πHω(cid:48).

Theorem 1.2. Let J be a graded ideal in an N-graded k-algebra A and consider
the diagram

Gr(A/J)

f∗

Gr(A)

ω(cid:48)

π(cid:48)

π

ω

QGr(A/J)

QGr(A)

in which π and π(cid:48) denote the quotient functors and ω and ω(cid:48) are their right adjoints.
Deﬁne i∗ = π(cid:48)f∗ω and i! = π(cid:48)f !ω. Then
(1) there is a unique functor i∗ : QGr(A/J) → QGr(A) such that i∗π(cid:48) = πf∗;
(2) i∗ ∼= πf∗ω(cid:48);
(3) i∗ is fully faithful;
(4) i∗ is left adjoint and i! right adjoint to i∗;
(5) the essential image of i∗ is closed under quotients and submodules.

furthermore, i∗ is exact;

In the language of [5], Projnc(A/J) is a closed subspace of Projnc(A) and the
homomorphism A → A/J induces a closed immersion i
: Projnc(A/J) →
Projnc(A).

Theorem 1.3. Let J be a two-sided graded ideal in a connected graded k-algebra
A. Let X be a noetherian scheme having an ample line bundle; for example, let X
be a quasi-projective scheme over Spec(k). If there is an equivalence of categories
Φ : QGr(A) → Qcoh(X), then QGr(A/J) ≡ Qcoh(Z) for some closed subscheme
Z ⊆ X. More precisely, there is a commutative diagram
/ QGr(A)

QGr(A/J)

i∗

≡

Qcoh(Z)

Φ

/ Qcoh(X)

in which the horizontal arrows are the natural inclusion functors and the dotted
arrow is an equivalence between QGr(A/J) and the essential image of Φi∗.
