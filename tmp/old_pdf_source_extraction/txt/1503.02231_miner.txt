The largest eigenvalue of a convex function, duality, and a theorem

of Slodkowski

Matthew Dellatorre

Abstract

First, we provide an exposition of a theorem due to Slodkowski regarding the largest “eigenvalue” of a
convex function. In his work on the Dirichlet problem, Slodkowski introduces a generalized second-order
derivative which for C 2 functions corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian. The theorem
allows one to extend an a.e lower bound on this largest “eigenvalue” to a bound holding everywhere.
Via the Dirichlet duality theory of Harvey and Lawson, this result has been key to recent progress on
the fully non-linear, elliptic Dirchlet problem. Second, using the Legendre-Fenchel transform we derive
a dual interpretation of this largest eigenvalue in terms of convexity of the conjugate function. This dual
characterization oﬀers more insight into the nature of this largest eigenvalue and allows for an alternative
proof of a bound needed for the theorem.

1. Introduction

1.1 Motivation
It is known that a convex function u on Rn is diﬀerentiable almost everywhere and has distributional second-
order partial derivatives. It is also known that a convex function is twice diﬀerentiable almost everywhere
in the sense that for a.e. x ∈ Rn, there exists a symmetric positive semi-deﬁnite matrix D2f (x) such that

f (x + h) = f (x) + (cid:104)∇f (x), h(cid:105) +

(cid:104)D2f (x)h, h(cid:105) + o(||h||2).

The operator D2f is called the second-order Peano derivative. Note that its existence does not imply the
existence of ∇f in a neighbourhood, so it should not be considered the second derivative of f in the usual
sense. This result is due to Alexandrov [1]. See also [5], [6].
In [9], Slodkowski studies uniqueness for a generalized Dirichlet problem in the class of q−plurisubharmonic
(q–psh) functions (for C 2 functions on Cn this is equivalent to the complex Hessian having n− q nonnegative
eigenvalues at every point). The problem of uniqueness reduces to showing that the diﬀerence of two such
functions is n − 1–psh, which implies that it satisﬁes a maximum principle, from which uniqueness then
follows. Functions of this q–psh class can be approximated by a subclass which are convex up to a quadratic
polynomial. Because of this it is suﬃcient to study this smaller class, which given their quasi-convexity,
retain some of the nice properties of convex functions. In particular, quasi-convex functions are a.e. twice
diﬀerentiable, in the above sense. Thus, the second-order behavior of these functions and their diﬀerence
is known a.e. However, to show that the diﬀerence is a member of the above mentioned class, they must
satisfy this eigenvalue property everywhere. To this end, Slodkowski introduces a generalized second-order
derivative, which is simply the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian for C 2 functions, and proves that if this
quantity is bounded below almost everywhere in some domain, it is bounded below everywhere in that
domain. Using this, he shows that the diﬀerence is contained in the desired n − 1–psh class.

Following Slodkowski [9, §3 ], we deﬁne the largest “eigenvalue” of a convex function.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let u : Rn → R. If ∇u(x0) exists, K(u, x0) is deﬁned by the formula

K(u, x0) = lim sup

→0

2−2 max {u(x0 + h) − u(x0) − (cid:104)∇u(x0), h(cid:105) : h ∈ Sn−1}

otherwise K(u, x) is deﬁned as +∞.

This is the generalized second-order derivative that Slodkowski deﬁnes. For the sake of context, note
that this quantity is a modiﬁcation to the second-order upper Peano derivative of u in the direction of h,
which is deﬁned as

2−2(u(x0 + h) − u(x0) − (cid:104)∇u(x0), h(cid:105)).

lim sup
→0+

Being maximal, this second-order derivative is of particular interest because it corresponds to the largest
eigenvalue of the Hessian when deﬁned (which it does, in the above sense, almost everywhere for convex
functions), and gives a useful quantity to work with otherwise, especially in the context of Slodkowski’s C 1,1
estimates.

Regarding this quantity K(u, x), Slodkowski shows the following.

Theorem 1.2. ([9, Cor. 3.5]) Let u : Rn → R be a locally convex function in U ⊂ Rn, such that K(u, x) ≥
M for almost every x ∈ U . Then K(u, x) ≥ M for all x ∈ U .

As mentioned above, the recent work of Harvey and Lawson on the Dirichlet problem was one of our
motivations for studying this quantity K(u, x) and Slodkowski’s proof of the above result. In [4] they study
fully non-linear degenerate elliptic equations of the form

F (Hess(u)) = 0 on Ω

u = φ on ∂Ω.

Given certain convexity assumptions on the boundary, they establish the existence and uniqueness of
continuous solutions using their new Dirichlet duality theory. The work of Slodkowski was “an inspiration”
for that paper, and in particular Theorem 1.2 is the “deepest ingredient” of their proof of uniqueness of
viscosity solutions of (1) [4, p. 398]. These existence and uniqueness results apply to many important
problems including all branches of the homogeneous Monge-Amp`ere equation, all branches of the special
Lagrangian potential equation, and equations appearing naturally in Lagrangian and calibrated geometry.

Given the usefulness of this generalized derivative and the above result to recent progress on important
problems, it makes sense to better understand both the derivative and the proof of the theorem. The proof
is fairly diﬃcult and very geometric so here an illustrated exposition is provided. The quantity K(u, x)
is then studied further for convex u.
In particular, the Legendre–Fenchel transform is applied to give a
simple alternative characterization of K(u, x) in terms of the convexity of the dual function u∗ to u. This
allows for an alternative proof to a key proposition needed to prove Slodkowski’s theorem. Altogether, there
are now three ways to view this generalized derivative K(u, x): analytically (Deﬁnition 1.1), geometrically
(Proposition 1.6), and dually (Theorem 1.9).

1.2 Summary

Theorem 1.2 follows immediately from the following theorem, the proof of which is the main focus of the
ﬁrst part of this paper.
Theorem 1.3. ([9, Thm. 3.2]) Let u be convex near x0 ∈ Rn. Assume that K(u, x0) = k0 is ﬁnite. Then
for every k > k0 the set {x : K(u, x) < k} is Borel and its lower density at x0 is not less than

(cid:16) k−k0

(cid:17)n

.

2k

Lower density is deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 1.4. The lower density of a Lebesgue measurable set Z ⊂ Rn at x0 ∈ Rn is the number

(cid:0)Z ∩ B(x0, ε)(cid:1)
(cid:0)B(x0, ε)(cid:1)

,

mn

lim inf
ε→0

where mn denotes the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure.

Slodkowski’s proof of Theorem 1.3 divides naturally into two parts. First, an equivalent geometric
characterization of a bound on K(u, x) is given in terms of spheres tangent to the graph of u. This is the
content of the following deﬁnition and proposition.
For c = (c1, . . . , cn+1) ∈ Rn, let S(c, r) denote the n−sphere with center c and radius r, and B(c, r)

denote the open n + 1-disk of radius r centered at c.
Deﬁnition 1.5. The sphere S(c, r) is a sphere of support from above at y = (x0, u(x0)) if y ∈ S(c, r),
B(c, r) ∩ graph(u) = ∅ and cn+1 > u(P (c)), where P denotes the orthogonal projection of Rn+1 onto Rn.

Thus, S(c, r) can be visualized as a ball resting on a “surface” that is the graph of u, and such that

(x0, u(x0)) is one of its resting points.
Proposition 1.6. ([9, Prop. 3.3]) Let U ⊂ Rn be open and u : U → R be convex. Assume that u has
gradient at x.

(i) If u has second-order Peano derivatives at x, then K(u, x) is equal to the norm (i.e.

the largest

eigenvalue) of the real Hessian of u at x.

(ii) If K(u, x) is ﬁnite, then for every K > K(u, x) there is ε > 0 such that u(x+h)−u(x)−(cid:104)∇u(x), h(cid:105) ≤
K|h|2.

(iii) If there is a sphere S(c, r), r > 0 which supports the graph of u from the above at (x, u(x)), then

K(u, x) ≤ (1 + |∇u(x)|2) 3

Parts (ii) and (iii) give the above mentioned equivalence between a bound on K(u, x) and a sphere of support
to the graph of a corresponding radius at (x, u(x)). See section 2.2 for a more detailed explanation.

The second part of the proof then uses this alternative characterization of K(u, x) to obtain a density
result, which is essentially the statement of the theorem in terms of spheres of support as opposed to K(u, x).
This is the content of the following lemma.
Lemma 1.7. ([9, Lemma 3.4]) Let u be a non-negative convex function in B(0, d) ⊂ Rn, d > 0, such that
u(0) = 0 and ∇u(0) = 0. Let R > 0 and assume that the closed ball ¯B(c, R), c = (0, ..., 0, R) ∈ Rn+1,
intersects the graph of u only at 0 ∈ Rn+1. Let Xr, 0 < r < R denote the set of all x ∈ B(0, d) ⊂ Rn
such that there exists a sphere of radius r supporting the graph of u from above at (x, u(x)). Then the lower
density of Xr at 0 is not less than ((R − r)/2R)n.
As will be seen in more detail in section 2, there is an inverse relationship between the bound on K(u, x) and
the radius of the sphere of support to the graph of u at (x, u(x)). This will explain the similarity between
the lower bound on density given in the lemma and the one in the theorem.

The geometric characterization of K(u, x) is key to proving Theorem 1.3 and helpful in understanding
what quality this generalized derivative captures about the function u and its graph. Since the results here
concern functions that are at least locally convex, it is natural to study them via the Legendre–Fenchel
transform, the classical transform of convex analysis. By deﬁnition, the set of points above the graph of
a convex function (epigraph) is a convex set. Any convex set in Rn can be deﬁned entirely by a family
of supporting hyperplanes. Thus, since the epigraph of u completely determines the graph of u, which in
turn completely determines u, this family of hyperplanes can be considered an alternative description or
parametrization of u. This is essentially how the transform of u (or dual function to u) u∗ is deﬁned. Each
point p ∈ Rn deﬁnes a collection of hyperplanes (via gradient), and u∗ speciﬁes a point u∗(p) ∈ R, such that
(0, ..., 0,−u∗(p)) ∈ Rn lies on the one hyperplane of this collection which supports the epigraph (or graph)
of u.
properties of u∗. Two classic examples of this are the following.
Proposition 1.8. Let f : Rn → R. Then
(i) f is strictly convex if and only if f∗ is diﬀerentiable.
(ii) f is strongly convex with modulus c if and only if f∗ is diﬀerentiable and ∇f∗ is Lipschitz continuous
with constant 1
c .

Interestingly, under the Legendre–Fenchel transform, diﬀerentiability properties of u correspond to convexity

k . Conversely, if u∗ is quadratically convex with modulus 1

Given that K(u, x) is a (local) diﬀerentiability property of u, it seems there should be an appropriate (local)
convexity property corresponding to u∗. In section 3 we prove the following result.
Theorem 1.9. Let f : Rn → R be convex. If K(f, x0) = k0 < k then f∗ is quadratically convex at y0 =
k , then K(f, x0) = k0 ≤ k.
∇f (x0) with modulus 1
Quadratically convex at y0, which is deﬁned in section 3, is a more local form of convexity than the two types
of convexity referred to in Proposition 1.8. This dual characterization of K(u, x) allows for an alternative
proof of Proposition 1.6. Using quadratics to deﬁne diﬀerent types of convexity is standard (e.g. quasi-
convexity, strong convexity). See section 3 for deﬁnitions of all these terms and a more detailed discussion.
In Slodkowski’s proof quadratics arise naturally via the deﬁnition of K(u, x), and from this, spheres. The
geometric properties of spheres make certain arguments very clear (see proof of Lemma 1.7), however some
manipulations and calculations are simpler with quadratics, given their constant second-order behavior. For
example, in [5] Harvey and Lawson provide an alternative proof of Slodkoski’s lemma (as well as Alexandrov’s
theorem stated above) via a generalization by using quadratics instead of spheres. Their proof is modelled
oﬀ of Slodkowski’s, and they obtain their result for the larger class of quasi-convex functions. Instead of
spheres of support, they use the notion of upper contact jets, where given p ∈ Rn, and A a real symmetric
n × n matrix, (p, A) is an upper contact jet for u at x if there exists a neighbourhood of x such that

Slodkowski’s result then corresponds to A = λI.

u(y) ≤ u(x) + (cid:104)p, y − x(cid:105) +

(cid:104)A(y − x), y − x(cid:105).

1.4 Organization
Section 2 contains the exposition of Slodkowski’s proof of Theorem 1.3: §2.1 gives an overview of the proof,
§2.2 a slight variation of Slodkowski’s proof to Proposition 1.6 (the generalized C 1,1 estimate), §2.3 an
expanded and illustrated version of Slodkowski’s proof to Lemma 1.7, and §2.4 combines these for the proof
of the theorem.
Section 3 studies K(u, x) from the dual perspective: §3.1 recalls some basic convex analysis, including
Legendre–Fenchel duality, §3.2 provides an equivalent interpretation of K(u, x) in terms of the dual function
to u, and uses this for an alternative proof of the C 1,1 estimate.
The Appendix considers Lipschitz continuity of the gradient and the geometric interpretation of K(u, x):
§A.1 demonstrates K(u, x) is bounded by the Lipschitz constant when u is C 1,1, §A.2 gives an example of
a function with a sphere of support that is not C 1,1 on any neighbourhood, §A.3 compares K(u, x) to the
classical notion of an osculating circle to a plane curve and gives an extension of this to higher dimensions,
§A.4 relates the radius of a sphere of support to a function to that of the radius of a supporting sphere to
its dual.

2. Exposition of Slodkowski’s proof

2.1 Overview

Theorem 1.3 is concerned with the set of points (near x0) such that K(u, x) < k, for some ﬁxed k > k0 =
K(u, x0). However this set may be diﬃcult to study directly given that the only information available about
u is that it is continuous (bounded and convex) on some neighbourhood of x0 and K(u, x0) = k0 < ∞.
In particular, knowing the value of K(u, x) at a given point does not immediately suggest anything about
its value nearby. Thus, the ﬁrst step towards a better understanding of this set of points is an alternative
characterization of what it means for K(u, x) to bounded at some point.
If at the point x, K(u, x0) < ∞ this is equivalent to a (local) sphere of support from above to the graph
of u at (x, u(x)). This is precisely what Proposition 1.6 (ii) and (iii) states. (ii) implies the existence (locally)
of a quadratic function tangent to the graph of u at (x, u(x)) which majorizes u on some neighbourhood, and
this in turn implies the (local) existence of a sphere of support to the graph of u at (x, u(x)). The content
of (iii) is clear.

With this alternative geometric characterization in hand, Lemma 1.7 then proves the theorem in terms
of these spheres of support. To accomplish this another change in perspective is needed, which takes further
advantage of this more geometric interpretation of K(u, x). Instead of looking at points x in the domain of
u such that there exists a sphere of support to the graph of u at (x, u(x)), it is better to consider for each
point x in domain of u an n−sphere (of ﬁxed radius) in Rn+1 above the graph of u with center c ∈ Rn+1
such that P (c) = x, where P : Rn+1 → Rn is the projection map. If we lower this sphere down towards x
it will of course eventually intersect the graph of u. Since u is continuous, it is not diﬃcult to show that
on a small enough neighbourhood these spheres will come down on a closed part of the graph of u and thus
there will be an initial point of contact. This sphere is by deﬁnition a sphere of support to the graph of u
at that point. The next step is to show that for every  neighbourhood of 0 (x0 = 0 for Lemma 1.7) there
is a corresponding δ = δ() such that the spheres above the points in B(0, δ) are spheres of support to the
graph at points (x, u(x)), where x ∈ B(0, ). Now B(0, δ) is a much nicer set to work with then Xr ∩ B(0, ),
and these two sets can be related by a few simple Lipschitz maps. Since Lipschitz maps behave nicely with
respect to measures, this allows us to place a lower bound on the measure m(Xr ∩ B(0, )) for each epsilon.
A limiting argument is then used to obtain the lower bound on the lower density at 0.

Proposition 1.6 and Lemma 1.7 can then be combined to give Theorem 1.3. A sketch of the proof is
as follows. Start with a point x0 where K(u, x0) is ﬁnite (hypothesis of Theorem 1.3), and choose any
k > K(u, x0). Note it can be assumed without loss of generality that x0 = 0, u(0) = 0, and ∇u(0) = 0 (see
section 2.3 for details). Then apply Proposition 1.6 (ii), which locally gives a sphere of support of radius
1/k at (x0, u(x0)). Now, apply Lemma 1.7 to get a lower bound on the density of Xr, r < 1/k, at x0. Next,
apply Proposition 1.6 (iii) to convert this into a statement about the density of X(cid:48)

k, where

k ≡ {x ∈ dom(u)|K(u, x) < k}.
X(cid:48)

5

This last step is accomplished by using the continuity of the gradient to show that in a small enough
neighbourhood Xr ⊂ X(cid:48)
k. More explicitly, x ∈ Xr implies K(u, x) ≤ r−1(1 + |∇u(x)|2)3/2 and ∇u(x0) = 0,
so by continuity of the gradient of convex functions and since k > 1/r, ∇u(x) will eventually be small enough
so that r−1(1 + |∇u(x)|2)3/2 < k. Thus, for x ∈ Xr, K(u, x) < 1/k. This gives the theorem by choosing R
arbitrarily close to 1/k0 and r arbitrarily close to 1/k (see section 2.4 for a detailed proof).

In this subsection we provide an alternative proof to Proposition 1.6 (iii). The main idea is as follows: given
a sphere of support of radius r to the graph of u at the point (x, u(x)), the lower hemisphere of this sphere
deﬁnes the graph of a smooth convex function that agrees up to ﬁrst order with u at x and majorizes u
elsewhere. Denote this function by d. It immediately follows that K(u, x) ≤ K(d, x), and the rest of the
proof consists in computing K(d, x), which is equal to the largest eigenvalue of d because d is smooth
Proof of Proposition 1.6 (iii). Assume that the sphere S((c, t), r), c ∈ Rn supports the graph of u from the
above at (x, u(x0)) and that u is diﬀerentiable at x0. Deﬁne d : B(c, r) → R to be the function whose graph
is the lower open hemisphere of S((c, t), r). Recall the deﬁnition for K(f, x0) :

K(u, x0) := lim sup

→0

2−2 max {u(x0 + h) − u(x0) − (cid:104)∇u(x0), h(cid:105) : |h| = 1}.

Clearly, since d(x0) = u(x0) and ∇d(x0) = ∇u(x0),

K(u, x0) ≤ K(d, x0).

Since d is smooth,

K(d, x0) = lim sup

Without loss of generality we may assume that the sphere of support is centered at the origin and x0 has
just ﬁrst component non-zero, as otherwise we could always shift and then rotate without aﬀecting the
second-order behavior. In other words, assume (c, t) = 0 ∈ Rn+1 and x0 = (s1, ..., sn) = (s, 0, ..., 0) ∈ Rn.

Then d(x) = −(cid:112)r2 − |x|2.

and |x0|2 = s2, we can write d(x) as

Now expanding(cid:112)1 − w(x) as a series and dropping the terms of order higher than two (as they will have 0

We state explicitly the following interesting result on “lower hemisphere functions”, i.e. functions on a
disc D ⊂ Rn deﬁned by the lower hemisphere of an n− sphere in Rn+1. The proof follows immediately from
the above proof, by looking at the expression for the Hessian.
Proposition 2.1. Let d : D → R be a lower hemisphere function deﬁned on a disc D ⊂ Rn and ˜x ∈ D. If
∇d(˜x) (cid:54)= 0, then ∇d(˜x) (cid:54)= 0 is an eigenvector of ∇2d(˜x) corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.

Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that the lower hemisphere and thus D are centered at the
origin and ˜x has only ﬁrst coordinate non-zero, ˜x = (s, 0, ..., 0). Then, as shown above, the Hessian of d at
˜x is a diagonal n × n matrix of the form

(cid:32)

∇2d(˜x) = diag

Thus, (1, 0, ..., 0) is an eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. As calculated above,

∇d(˜x) =

˜x√
r2 − s2

=

s√
r2 − s2

(1, 0, ..., 0),

so clearly ∇d(˜x) is also an eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.

2.3 The density lemma

If at the point x0 = 0 there is a sphere of support of radius R, Lemma 1.7 provides a lower bound on the
lower density of the set Xr of points with sphere of support of a radius r < R. Note that without loss of
generality it may be assumed that x0 = 0, u(0) = 0, and ∇u(0) = 0, since any convex function ˜u can always
be adjusted by a constant and linear term so that this is true without aﬀecting the 2nd-order behaviour of
˜u.

As mentioned in section 2.1, Lemma 1.7 is proved by looking not directly at Xr but at small neighbourhoods
of 0 that are the projection of the set of centers of spheres of support to the graph of u on shrinking
neighbourhoods. For each  > 0 a δ = δ() is needed so that B(0, δ) is contained in the projection onto Rn
of the set of centers of spheres of support to the graph of u restricted to an epsilon neighbourhood. Since the
only information about u is that there is a sphere of support at 0, this is what is used to construct  and δ.
More speciﬁcally, the appropriate ’s and δ’s are found by constructing a family of convex functions that are
identical to u on a neighbourhood of 0, but greater and simpler outside this neighbourhood. This allows one
to fully utilize the only initial information given. Using this family of simple functions and basic geometry,
three key set inclusions are obtained, which essentially relate B(0, δ()) to Xr ∩ B(0, ). Then using Lipschitz
maps to relate these sets and by applying properties of Lipschitz functions on measure, the lower density
bound is shown. This whole construction is crucial because it provides a much simpler approach to studying
the possibly very complex set Xr. The following is the proof given by Slodkowski.

Proof. of Lemma 1.7.
The number r ∈ (0, R) will be kept ﬁxed so let X ≡ Xr. Deﬁne

Z = {(x, u(x)) ∈ Rn+1 : x ∈ X}.

It is clear that Z ∩ ( ¯B(0, d(cid:48)) × R) is compact for every d(cid:48) < d, thus X ∩ ( ¯B(0, d(cid:48)) × R) is also compact, as it
is the orthogonal projection P : Rn+1 → Rn of Z. Since compact sets are Lebesgue measurable, the notion
of lower density is applicable to both X and Z.

It is more convenient to ﬁrst estimate the density of Z at 0 with respect to Hausdorﬀ measure, and then
use the properties of Lipschitz functions on measure to obtain bounds on the density of X. To accomplish

8

this a family of convex functions, built from the initial sphere of support of radius R at 0, which modify u
outside a small neighbourhood of 0 will be constructed. As mentioned above, these functions will be identical
to u on a neighbourhood of 0 and very simple outside this neighbourhood. These functions will enable us
to ﬁnd a corresponding δ = δ() neighbourhood for each  so that x ∈ B(0, δ) implies that x = P (c), where
c ∈ Rn is the center of a sphere of support to (x(cid:48), u(x(cid:48))), for some x(cid:48) ∈ B(0, ) ∩ Xr.
Step One. A family of convex functions is constructed which will let us ﬁnd an appropriate δ(), as explained
above. For each α such that 0 < α < 1

R ), deﬁne the function

S(c, R), and clearly the projection of Y , P (Y ), onto Rn is the n − 1 sphere of radius R sin 2α, centered at 0.
Next, let Cα denote the union of all closed segments wy with one endpoint w on the axis 0 × R ⊂ Rn+1 and
tangent to the sphere S(c, R) at the other endpoint y, where y ∈ Y . Note that w is independent of which
y ∈ Y that is being used. Cα is simply a ﬁnite cone with vertex w and base Y , tangent to S(c, R) along Y .
See Figure 2.
Deﬁne now

Tα = {y ∈ S(c, R) : R(1 − cos 2α) ≤ yn+1 < R}.

(5)
Tα can be visualized as a “strip” of S(c, r), and note that Tα ∩ Cα = Y and that Tα ∪ Cα deﬁnes a convex
function kα : B(0, R) → R.
For 0 < α < 1

R ), deﬁne

(cid:40)

vα =

max(u(x), kα(x)),
kα(x),

|x| < R sin 2α
R sin 2α ≤ |x| < R.

Note that u is only deﬁned on B(0, d) and R sin 2α < d < R, so that is why vα is deﬁned this way. It is clear
that

vα(x) ≥ u(x), for |x| < d.

(6)

Observe that vα is locally convex on the set |x| (cid:54)= R sin 2α since for |x| > R sin 2α, vα = kα(x), which is
convex, and for |x| < R sin 2α, vα is the maximum of two convex functions which is convex. If |x| = R sin 2α,
then (x, vα(x)) ∈ Y ⊂ S(c, r) Since S(c, r) lies above the graph of u, so kα|Y > u|Y . Thus near Y, vα ≡ kα,
and so vα is locally convex in B(0, R), which implies that vα is convex.
Step Two. For any convex function the following Lipschitz map can be constructed. This will let us
relate the possibly complex set, X, to the disk B(0, δ()). Given a convex function v : B(0, R) → R. Let
E(v) = {(x, t) ∈ Rn+1 : t > v(x)} denote the strict epigraph of v, and deﬁne Z v as the set of all y = (x, v(x)),
where |x| < R, and such that for some c(cid:48) ∈ Rn+1, B(c(cid:48), r) ⊂ E(v) and y ∈ S(c(cid:48), r), where r < R, as deﬁned
earlier.
Note that if y = (x, v(x)) ∈ Z v, then the graph(v) has a unique supporting hyperplane at y (since any
such hyperplane is tangent to S(c(cid:48), r)), and thus c(cid:48) is uniquely determined by y.
Now consider the map γv : Z v → Rn+1, where γv(y) = c(cid:48). This map is Lipschitz with constant one. To
see this, let y1, y2 ∈ Z v and c(cid:48)
i = γv(yi), i = 1, 2. The set E(v) is convex (by deﬁnition since v is convex),
In particular, W∩
and so it contains W := co(B(c1, r) ∪ B(c1, r)), where co() denotes the convex hull.
graph(v)=∅. Since yi ∈ S(ci, r) ∩ graph(v), yi ∈ S(c(cid:48)
i, r) \ W, i = 1, 2. Thus, y1 and y2 do not belong to, and
1c(cid:48)
are separated by, the open region between two hyperplanes which are orthogonal to the segment c(cid:48)
2 and
pass through its ends. Therefore |c(cid:48)
2| ≤ |y1 − y2|. The importance of this map will be seen below, where
combined with u and the projection map P it allows the set of interest in Rn to be related to a small disk.
Step Three. Three key set inclusions are established. Along with step two this will allow on small
neighborhoods the measure of X to be bounded from below by the volume of small n− balls. Using
let Z α and γα denote the set Z v and map γv, respectively, for v = vα, where
the notation above,
0 < α < 1
R ).
Consider the set

2 arcsin( d

1 − c(cid:48)

Uα = graph(vα) \ (Cα ∪ Tα).

(7)

Note that this is a subset of the graph of u. For α ∈ (0, 1

2 arcsin( d

R )), we have the following three inclusions:

P (Uα) ⊂ B(0, R sin 2α)
Z α ∩ Uα ⊂ Z ∩ Uα
BN (0, δ) ⊂ P γα(Z α ∩ Uα), where δ = (R − r) tan α.

(8)

(9)

(10)

The ﬁrst inclusion follows directly from the deﬁnition of Uα: |x| ≥ R sin 2α ⇒ vα(x) ∈ Tα.
By (5), Z α∩ graph(u) ⊂ Z. To see this, let z ∈ Z α. Thus we have a c(cid:48) ∈ Rn+1 such that B(c(cid:48), r) ⊂ E(vα)
and z ∈ S(c(cid:48), r). So there is a sphere of radius r supporting the graph of vα from above at z. If z ∈ graph(u),
then we must have z ∈ Z: B(c(cid:48), r) ⊂ E(vα) and vα(x) ≥ u(x) give us that B(c(cid:48), r) ∩ graph(u) = ∅ and
n+1 > u(P c(cid:48)), which together with z ∈ S(c(cid:48), r) imply that z ∈ Z, by deﬁnition. Since Uα ⊂ graph(u), Z α ∩
c(cid:48)
Uα ⊂ Z α ∩ graph(u) ⊂ Z. And of course Z α ∩ Uα ⊂ Uα, so together we have Z α ∩ Uα ⊂ Z ∩ Uα, which gives
us the second inclusion.
The third inclusion is the critical aforementioned relation between the set of points with spheres of
support and a disk in Rn. (Below we will take  = R sin α and δ = (R − r) tan α). To obtain this inclusion
we proceed as follows. Let x ∈ Rn, be such that |x| < R − r, and consider the set

{c(cid:48) ∈ {x} × R : B(c(cid:48), r) ⊂ E(vα)}.

(11)
This set is a non-empty, closed half-line. To see this, consider lowering the sphere S((x, c(cid:48)
n+1), r) in Rn+1
onto the graph of vα, by continuously decreasing the last coordinate. Because the radius of this sphere is r
and |x| < R−r, this sphere comes down on a closed subset of the graph of vα. Once contact is made with the
n+1) is our closed endpoint. Let c(cid:48) ∈ Rn+1 be this
graph of vα we stop, and the corresponding value of (x, c(cid:48)
endpoint and y ∈ S(c(cid:48), r) ∩ graph(vα) (note that y may not be unique). Then c(cid:48) = γα(y) and x = P γα(y),
and so

BN (0, R − r) ⊂ P γα(Z α).

Now Z α \ (Cα ∪ Tα) ⊂ graph(vα) \ (Cα ∪ Tα) = Uα, so clearly Z α \ (Cα ∪ Tα) ⊂ Z α ∩ Uα. Therefore,

P γα(Z α) \ P γα(Z α ∩ (Cα ∪ Tα)) ⊂ P γα(Z α ∩ Uα).

(13)

This relation and (12) will give us our third inclusion (9), once we show that

P γα(Z α ∩ (Cα ∪ Tα)) ∩ BN (0, δ) = ∅.

(14)
Consider the family of all spheres S(c(cid:48), r) which support Cα\Y from above and are contained in the upper
half space yn+1 ≥ 0. Clearly the smallest value of |P (c(cid:48))| is attained when the sphere S(c(cid:48), r) is tangent to
both Cα and {yn+1 = 0} (see Fig. 3). It is not diﬃcult to see that in this case(cid:30)(c(cid:48)−c, 0−c) = α, where c here
N +1) tan α = (R − r) tan α = δ,
is the center of the initial sphere of support. This gives us |P (c(cid:48))| = (|c| − c(cid:48)
which implies

(15)
Now when S(c(cid:48), r) supports Tα \ Y from the above at some point y, the segment c(cid:48), y is normal to S(c, R)
and yN +1 ≥ R(1 − cos 2α) ≥ δ. Thus (cid:30)(c(cid:48) − c, 0 − c) ≥ 2α and, as above, |P (c)| ≥ (R − r) tan 2α ≥ δ (note
0 ≤ α ≤ π

4 ). This gives

P γα(Z α ∩ Cα) ∩ BN (0, δ) = ∅.

P γα(Z α ∩ Tα) ∩ BN (0, δ) = ∅.

(16)

Combining (15) and (16) we have (13), which gives the third inclusion.
Step Four. Estimate of the density of X. The above inclusions and the eﬀect of Lipschitz maps on measure,
will be enough to estimate the density of X = P (Z). Recall that Z = {(x, u(x)) ∈ RN +1|x ∈ X}, where X
is the set of points in B(0, d) ⊂ RN such that there exists a sphere of radius r supporting the graph of u
from above at (x, u(x)).
Using a few theorems from Rockafellar [7], it can be shown that the map ϕ : P (Uα) → Uα, where
2 , where gα = sup{|∇u| : |x| < R sin 2α}. More
ϕ(x) = (x, u(x)) is Lipschitz with constant (1 + g2
speciﬁcally, by Theorem 10.4, u is Lipschitz, and by Theorems 24.7, 25.5, and 25.6 gα is a Lipschitz bound
for u|B(0,R sin 2α)). A simple Pythagorean argument then shows (1 + g2
2 is a Lipschitz bound for ϕ. Notice
that ϕ maps X ∩ P (Uα) = P (Z ∩ Uα) onto Z ∩ Uα.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. First, we prove the density result. Without loss of generality, let x0 = 0, u(x0) =
0,∇u(x0) = 0. Note that by the convexity of u this implies u ≥ 0. Set k0 = K(u, x0) = K(u, 0), and let
k > k0 be ﬁxed and take K such that k > K > k0.

immediately by contradiction. The left-hand side of this inequality is the last component of the point

the value of d(x), where d is the lower hemisphere function deﬁned in the proof of the proposition, see Fig.

Proposition 2.2. Let u : Rn → R be convex. Then the set on which u is diﬀerentiable is a dense Borel set,
speciﬁcally an Fσδ.

Proof. Since u is convex, u is diﬀerentiable at x if and only if all the partial derivatives of u exist at x, with
respect to any basis [6, IV.4.2]. Let {ei}n

which u is diﬀerentiable is an Fσδ. That Rn \ E is dense is well-known.
Lemma 2.3. Let u : Rn → R be convex and W ⊂ Rn the set on which u is diﬀerentiable. Then the function
K(x) := K(u, x) is of second Baire class on W .

Proof. We follow notes of Slodkowski, not contained in [9], for this proof. Let

3.1 Background

3. Dual Perspective

Since u is convex near x0, it is natural to study this quantity K(u, x0) from the dual perspective as well. Let
Cvx(Rn) denote the space of convex, lower semi-continuous functions on Rn. Given a function u ∈ Cvx(Rn),
one can apply the Legendre–Fenchel transform L : Cvx(Rn) → Cvx(Rn) of u to obtain its conjugate or
dual function u∗, where

u∗ ≡ L u(s) = sup

((cid:104)s, x(cid:105) − u(x)).

L is an order-reversing, involutive transform on Cvx(Rn), and for suﬃciently nice convex functions (diﬀerentiable,
strictly convex, and 1-coercive), u∗ is given by

x

u∗(s) = (cid:104)s, (∇u)−1(s)(cid:105) − u((∇u)−1(s)).

The conjugate function u∗ can be viewed as a reparametrization of the original function u in terms of its
tangents using the duality between points and hyperplanes. More speciﬁcally, given a vector in Rn, there is
an associated family of hyperplanes with that gradient. u∗ distinguishes the one that supports the epigraph
of u by specifying a point on that plane.
For convex functions deﬁned only in a neighbourhood it is standard to extend the function to all of Rn by
setting it equal +∞ outside that neighbourhood. In our case, we are given u convex near x0, so we extend
it in this manner, if necessary. Clearly this does not aﬀect K(u, x0), which is a purely local property. Recall
the following basic deﬁnitions:
Deﬁnition 3.1. The diﬀerentiable function f : Rn → R is convex if for all x, x(cid:48) ∈ Rn

f (x(cid:48)) ≥ f (x) + (cid:104)∇f (x), (x(cid:48) − x)(cid:105),

and strictly convex if the inequality is strict for x (cid:54)= x(cid:48).
Deﬁnition 3.2. The diﬀerentiable function f : Rn → R is strongly convex with modulus c if and only if for
all (x, x(cid:48)) ∈ Rn × Rn,

f (x(cid:48)) ≥ f (x) + (cid:104)∇f (x), (x(cid:48) − x)(cid:105) +

c|x(cid:48) − x|2.

2

When f is not diﬀerentiable a lot of analysis can still be done using the calculus of subdiﬀerentials.
Deﬁnition 3.3. Let f : Rn → R be convex. The subdiﬀerential of f , denoted ∂f , is a set function, where

∂f (x) =(cid:8)s ∈ Rn : f (y) ≥ f (x) + (cid:104)s, y − x(cid:105) ∀y ∈ Rn(cid:9) .

Under the Legendre transform, diﬀerentiability of u corresponds to convexity or monotonicity of u∗. Recall
from Proposition 1.8, two properties that transform especially well are (i) u ∈ C 1 if and only if u∗ is strictly
convex, and (ii) u ∈ C 1,1, where ∇u has Lipschitz constant c if and only if u is strongly convex with modulus

3.2 Quadratic convexity

In this section we look at how a bound on K(u, x0) or equivalently a sphere of support to the graph of u
at (x0, u(x0)) transforms to a property of u∗. More speciﬁcally, since K or a sphere of support is a bound
on a generalized second-order derivative of u, how does this translate to information about the convexity of
u∗? We should expect a more localized property then in Proposition 1.8, as we only have information at x0.
Further, we are not assuming any regularity beyond diﬀerentiable at x0.

if u + 1

2 m|x|2 is convex. Similarly, quasi-convexity, is deﬁned via quadratics: u is λ- quasi-convex

Now, strong convexity may also deﬁned in terms of quadratic functions: u is strongly convex with

2 λ|x|2 is convex.

Let u : Rn → R be convex with K(u, x0) = k0 < ∞. By the deﬁnition of K(u, x), for any k > k0 there

exists  > 0 such that

u(x0 + h) − u(x0) − (cid:104)∇u(x0), h(cid:105) ≤ 1
2

k|h|2, for all |h| < .

This motivates the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.4. Let f : Rn → R be convex. Then f is quadratically (resp. sub-quadratically) convex at x0
with modulus m > 0 if there exists  > 0 and a quadratic function Q : Rn → R with ∇2Q = mI such that

resp.

f (x0) = Q(x0) and f (x) ≥ Q(x),

∀x ∈ B(x0, )

f (x0) = Q(x0) and f (x) ≤ Q(x),

∀x ∈ B(x0, ).

Example 3.5. f (x) = |x|4/3 is quadratically convex at 0, but not sub-quadratically convex at 0. Note also
that K(f, 0) = +∞ and it does not have a sphere of support at 0.
Example 3.6. More generally, consider any function of the form f (x) = A|x|k, at x = 0. If 0 < k < 1, f is
not convex. If k = 1, f is quadratically convex at 0, but not sub-quadratically convex. If 1 < k < 2 then f is
strictly convex and quadratically convex but not sub-quadratically convex. If k = 2, f is both quadratically
convex and sub-quadratically convex. If k > 2, f is sub-quadratically convex but not quadratically convex.

If f is of the form f =
Fenchel transform is order-reversing and quadratics are transformed into quadratics, it follows that if f is
quadratically convex, f∗ is sub-quadratically convex. For a convex C 2 function f , if ∇2f (x0) is positive
deﬁnite then f is both quadratically and sub-quadratically convex at x0.
Proof of Theorem 1.9. Suppose K(u, x0) = k0 < ∞. As stated above, by deﬁnition of K(u, x0), for any
k > k0, there exists  > 0 such that u satisﬁes

for all x ∈ B(x0, ). Thus, on this neighbourhood of x0

u(x) − u(x0) − (cid:104)∇u(x0), x − x0(cid:105) ≤ 1
2

u(x) ≤ u(x0) + (cid:104)∇u(x0), x − x0(cid:105) +

By assumption u is convex, and k > k0 ≥ 0, so the right-hand side is also convex. Taking the Legendre
transform gives

k|x − x0|2,

k|x − x0|2.

Now u∗ may not be diﬀerentiable at ∇u(x0), however ∇u(x0) ∈ ∂u(x0) if and only if x0 ∈ ∂u∗(∇u(x0)),
which is equivalent to u∗(∇u(x0)) = (cid:104)∇u(x0), x0(cid:105) − u(x0). So the above inequality simpliﬁes to

u∗(y) ≥ u∗(∇u(x0)) + (cid:104)x0, y − ∇u(x0)(cid:105) +

In the above proof we do not need to worry about ∂u(B(x0, )) being degenerate (for example if u is
locally a hyperplane at x0) because in that case u∗(y) will then be +∞ away from ∇u(x0) so clearly the
inequality will hold on some neighbourhood.

Our goal now is to obtain the nice bound on K(u, x) in Proposition 1.6 using the dual function, given a
sphere of support to the graph of u at (x, u(x)). The following elementary lemma, which we state without
proof, will help us to reduce arguments on Rn to ones on R.

Proposition 3.8. Let f : Rn → R be C 2 and convex and suppose there exists a sphere of support to the
graph of f at (x0, f (x0)) of radius r. Then

r

Proof. Because f is C 2, K(f, x0) is the largest eigenvalue λmax of ∇2f (x0). If λmax=0 or ∇f (x) = 0 then the
bound on K(f, x0) is trivial, so let λmax > 0 and ∇f (x) (cid:54)= 0. f is convex so ∇2f (x0) is symmetric positive
semi-deﬁnite, and there exists an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. Let v be the eigenvector coresponding
to λmax. By duality, v is also an eigenvector corresponding to λ∗
, the smallest eigenvalue of
∇2f∗(∇f (x0)). This follows from the fact that the Hessians of dual functions satisfy

min = 1

λmax

∇2f∗(y0) = ∇2f (x0)−1,

where y0 = ∇f (x0).

(Here we assume without loss of generality that ∇2f (x0) is invertible because we are only concerned with
λmax > 0).
Let S((c, t), r) be the sphere of support of radius r, to the graph of f at x0, and d the associated lower
hemisphere function, i.e.

d(x) =t −(cid:112)r2 − |x − c|2, x ∈ ¯B(c, r)

d(x) =∞, else.

Clearly d is convex and d ≥ f , by deﬁnition of a supporting sphere. Also, recall that f and d agree up to
ﬁrst order at x0.

Again by basic properties of the Legendre transform, the following relations hold:

f∗(y0) = d∗(y0)

f∗ ≥ d∗

∇f∗(y0) = ∇d∗(y0) = x0.

It follows that

where γ∗

min is the smallest eigenvalues of ∇2d∗(∇f (x0)). Note that this is equivalent to

min ≥ γ∗
λ∗

λmax ≤ 1

min can always be computed using a function on R.

Let v(cid:48) be the unit-length eigenvector corresponding to γ∗

Given this bound, we now show that γ∗
min and γmax. By Proposition 2.1, v(cid:48) is in
the direction of ∇d(x0). By Lemma 3.7, ˜d, the restriction of d to this 1−dimensional subspace deﬁnes
a lower semi-circle function, and this function has the properties: ˜d(cid:48)(x0) = (cid:104)∇d(x0), v(cid:48)(cid:105) = |∇d(x0)| and
˜d(cid:48)(cid:48)(x0) = γmax. Therefore, the dual function ˜d∗ has second derivative at |∇f (x0)| equal to γ∗
min, and so we
may assume without loss of generality that f and d are functions on R.

Now we compute d∗ directly by using the Legendre transforms of common functions. Rewriting d

From Proposition 3.8 the smallest eigenvalue of ∇2d∗(y0) is equal to

A.1 Lipschitz gradient

Appendix

Here we show that the generalized derivative K(f, x) retains the following standard property regarding the
derivative of a Lipschitz continuous function.
Proposition A.1. Suppose f : Rn → R is convex and C 1,1 (i.e f is diﬀerentiable and has Lipschitz
gradient), with Lipschitz constant L. Then K(f, x) ≤ L for all x.

Proof. Let x0 ∈ Rn.

K(f, x0) := lim sup

A.2 Example of a non C 1,1 function with a sphere of support

Example A.2. It may seem that since a bound on K(u, x) implies a sphere of support to the graph of u at
(x, u(x)), that this in turn implies some kind Lipschitz continuity of the gradient in a small neighbourhood
of x. Here we construct an example of a strictly convex function f that is C 1 and twice diﬀerentiable with
K(f, 0) < ∞, but with gradient not Lipschitz in any neighbourhood of 0, to show this is not the case. Let
f : [−1, 1] → R be given by f (0) = 0, and for x ≥ 0

γ(t)dt,

where γ(t) := n + 4 on In and 0 otherwise,

with In =

1

1

(n + 4)2 [1 −

(n + 4)2 , 1]. Deﬁne f(cid:48)(−x) := −f(cid:48)(x).
Then f(cid:48) is clearly increasing and so f is convex. And for xn =

(n + 4)2 = xn.

(cid:88)

k≥n

So we have f(cid:48)(x) ≤ x for all x ∈ [0, 1] and f(cid:48)(x) ≥ x for all x ∈ [−1, 0]. Since d(cid:48)(x) ≥ x for all x ∈ [0, 1]
and d(cid:48)(x) ≤ x for all x ∈ [−1, 0], it follows that the graph of d, and thus the unit circle centered at (0, 1), is
always at or above the graph of f , with f (0) = d(0). Therefore, f has a sphere of support at x0 = 0.

However, there exist sequences {xi},{xj} such that

f(cid:48)(xi) − f(cid:48)(xj)

xi − xj

blows up: Taking xi and xj as the endpoints of In,

We can make f strictly convex by adding an xm term, which does not aﬀect any of the above analysis. The
above example can be adjusted to show that f(cid:48) is not α-Holder continuous for any α.

A.3 Osculating and locally supporting spheres

Here we extend the concept of an osculating circle to a plane curve to that of an “osculating sphere”to the
graph of a function in higher dimensions. The bound on the “largest eigenvalue ”K(u, x) can be seen as a
generalization of the relationship between the second derivative of a C 2 plane curve u and the radius of its
osculating circle:

Let u : R → R be C 2. Provided u(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:54)= 0, the radius of curvature at x is deﬁned as

ru,x :=

1
κ

=

(1 + u(cid:48)2) 3

2

u(cid:48)(cid:48)

,

where κ is the curvature of u at x, and the right-hand side is the standard formula for computing the
curvature of a planar curve [2, §8]. Thus,

u(cid:48)(cid:48) =

(1 + u(cid:48)2)3/2

r

.

Deﬁnition A.3. The osculating circle, or circle of curvature, to a planar curve C at p is the circle that
touches C (on the concave side) at p and whose radius is the radius of curvature of C at p.

We extend this to the graphs of C 2 convex functions in higher dimensions by
Deﬁnition A.4. For a convex function u : Rn → R let the osculating sphere to the graph of u at x be the
n−sphere tangent to the graph of u at x the with radius equal to that of

.

1

λmax

It is easy to show that any tangent sphere at (x, u(x)) with radius less than the osculating sphere at that
point is a (local) sphere of support. And any tangent sphere at (x, u(x)) with radius greater than the
osculating sphere cannot be a (local) sphere of support.

4|x|4 and u∗ = 3

A.4 Spheres of support to a function and its dual
Given a convex function u with a sphere of support at (x0, u(x0)), the conjugate function u∗ will not
necessarily have a sphere of support at the corresponding point (∇u(x0), u∗(∇u(x0)). For example take
u = 1
3 . However, for more regular and suﬃciently convex functions (e.g. C 2 and locally
strongly convex), we will have a sphere of support (locally) to both graphs at corresponding points, and the
order-reversing property of L provide a simple inequality relating the radii of these spheres. We state this
without proof.
Proposition A.5. Let u : Rn → R be strongly convex and C 2 near x0, and suppose u has a sphere of
support of radius rx0 . If ry0 is the radius of a sphere of support to u∗ at y0 = ∇u(x0), then
