Lemma 1.1. Let A and B be Grothendieck categories with localizing subcategories
S âŠ† A and T âŠ† B. Let Ï€ : A â†’ A/S and Ï€ 0 : B â†’ B/T be the quotient functors,
and let Ï‰ and Ï‰ 0 be right adjoints to Ï€ and Ï€ 0 respectively. Consider the following
diagram of functors:
(1-1)

A
Ï€


A/S

F

/B
Ï€0


B/T.

Suppose that F is right exact and F (S) âŠ† T. If L1 (Ï€ 0 F ), the first left derived
functor of Ï€ 0 F , exists, which it does when A has enough projectives, and vanishes
on S, then
(1) the natural transformation Ï€ 0 F â†’ Ï€ 0 F Ï‰Ï€ induced by the natural
transformation Î· : idA â†’ Ï‰Ï€ is an isomorphism;
(2) there is a unique functor G : A/S â†’ B/T such that Ï€ 0 F = GÏ€; furthermore,
Gâˆ¼
= Ï€ 0 F Ï‰;
(3) G is right exact;
(4) if F commutes with direct sums so does G;
(5) if F has a right adjoint so does G: if F a H, then G a Ï€HÏ‰ 0 .

Theorem 1.2. Let J be a graded ideal in an N-graded k-algebra A and consider
the diagram

in which Ï€ and Ï€ 0 denote the quotient functors and Ï‰ and Ï‰ 0 are their right adjoints.
Define iâˆ— = Ï€ 0 f âˆ— Ï‰ and i! = Ï€ 0 f ! Ï‰. Then
(1) there is a unique functor iâˆ— : QGr(A/J) â†’ QGr(A) such that iâˆ— Ï€ 0 = Ï€fâˆ— ;
furthermore, iâˆ— is exact;
(2) iâˆ— âˆ¼
= Ï€fâˆ— Ï‰ 0 ;
(3) iâˆ— is fully faithful;
(4) iâˆ— is left adjoint and i! right adjoint to iâˆ— ;
(5) the essential image of iâˆ— is closed under quotients and submodules.
In the language of [5], Projnc (A/J) is a closed subspace of Projnc (A) and the
homomorphism A â†’ A/J induces a closed immersion i : Projnc (A/J) â†’
Projnc (A).

Theorem 1.3. Let J be a two-sided graded ideal in a connected graded k-algebra
A. Let X be a noetherian scheme having an ample line bundle; for example, let X
be a quasi-projective scheme over Spec(k). If there is an equivalence of categories
Î¦ : QGr(A) â†’ Qcoh(X), then QGr(A/J) â‰¡ Qcoh(Z) for some closed subscheme
Z âŠ† X. More precisely, there is a commutative diagram
QGr(A/J)
â‰¡



in which the horizontal arrows are the natural inclusion functors and the dotted
arrow is an equivalence between QGr(A/J) and the essential image of Î¦iâˆ— .
