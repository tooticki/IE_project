Question 1.1. For which G Ă Sn is krxsG Cohen-Macaulay regardless of k?

***
Theorem 1.2. Let G Ă Sn. The ring krxsG is Cohen-Macaulay for all choices of k if and only
if G is generated by transpositions, double transpositions, and 3-cycles.

***
Deﬁnition 2.1. The Stanley-Reisner ring of P over k, written krPs, is the quotient of the
polynomial ring krtyαuαPPs, with indeterminates indexed by the elements of P, by the ideal
generated by products yαyβ indexed by incomparable pairs α, β P P.

***

Remark 2.2. This is a special case of a more general deﬁnition, which we will not use directly:
the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex. (We will use a further generalization – see
deﬁnition 2.5 below.) The Stanley-Reisner ring of a poset is nothing but the Stanley-Reisner
ring of the chain complex of the poset, i.e. the simplicial complex with vertex set the elements
of the poset, whose simplices are the chains in the poset. It is helpful to keep in mind that
the Stanley-Reisner ring of a poset has an underlying simplicial complex as well.

***
Remark 2.3. Garsia [9], Garsia-Stanton [10], and Reiner [15] all refer to the map G as the
transfer map. Other authors in invariant theory ([27], [32]) use the same phrase to denote the
AG-linear map

ÿ
Tr : A Ñ AG

x ÞÑ

gpxq.

gPG

While this latter map is also called the trace, there are well-established usages of transfer to
describe maps analogous to Tr in both topology and group theory, so we prefer to call G the
Garsia map to avoid competition for the term and to honor Garsia’s introduction of it in [9].
The present paper makes no use of the Garsia map except implicitly in quoting [15, Theorem
A.1].

Deﬁnition 2.4. A boolean complex is a regular CW complex in which every face has the
combinatorial type of a simplex.

***
Deﬁnition 2.5. The quotient ring krtzαuαPPs{I is called the Stanley-Reisner ring of Ω and
denoted krΩs.

***

Remark 2.6. Deﬁnition 2.5 generalizes deﬁnition 2.1 , but in a somewhat subtle way. Given
a poset P, one can form its chain complex Ω, regarded as a boolean complex, and then the
krPs of 2.1 will be isomorphic to the krΩs of 2.5 ; however, the poset Q of the latter deﬁnition
will not be P. Instead, its elements will be chains in P, ordered by inclusion. For example,
let P “ B2ztHu. Then the elements of P may be abbreviated 1, 2, and 12, and the only
incomparable pair consists of 1 and 2. Thus

krPs “ kry1, y2, y12s{py1y2q

according to deﬁnition 2.1 . However, Q consists of the six chains in P: the empty chain H,
three chains of length 1 (1, 2, and 12), and two chains of length 2 (1 Ă 12 and 2 Ă 12). Thus

krΩs “ krzH, z1, z2, z12, z1Ă12, z2Ă12s{I

where I is as described above. The isomorphism is given by mapping the z of a given chain
to the product of y’s corresponding to elements of the chain, for example z1Ă12 ÞÑ y1y12.
Indeed, the deﬁnition of I becomes much more transparent after considering why this map is
an isomorphism.

***
Deﬁnition 2.7. A boolean complex of dimension d is balanced if there is a labeling of its
vertices by d ` 1 labels such that the vertices of any one face have distinct labels. Given such
a labeling, a cellular action by a group is a balanced action if it preserves the labeling.

***

Remark 2.8. Since we only use Stanley-Reisner theory to show the “if” direction of theorem
1.2 and thus we only need it to deduce Cohen-Macaulayness, and not the failure of Cohen-
Macaulayness, the proof of 1.2 only uses Stanley’s and not Duval’s part of the generalization
of (??) to boolean complexes.

***

Remark 2.9. This deﬁnition of polyhedron is a technical device, used here to deﬁne the
concepts piecewise-linear and polyhedral star. It includes the more conventional meaning of a
three-dimensional polytope as a special case, but is much, much broader. For example, any
open subset of Rn, or of any polytope, is a polyhedron.
More broadly, our use of PL topology in this paper is only to serve a technical need linking
Lange’s result to our setting.

Lemma 2.11. Let C be an arbitrary AG-algebra, and let B :“ AbAG C. Let G act on B through
its action on A and trivial action on C. If there is a prime Q of B pulling back to P in A,
then DGpQq Ă DGpPq, and IGpQq “ IGpPq.

***

Remark 2.12. Examining the proof of lemma 2.11 , we see why the analogous equality to
IGpPq “ IGpQq may fail for decomposition groups. If g P DGpPq, then we do have the xgy-
equivariant isomorphism (??), and therefore g does act on the cosets of τpPqB in B, but the
only one we know it ﬁxes is τpPqB itself. In particular, Q, which may be the union of many
of these cosets, need not be ﬁxed setwise, so that g R DGpQq.

Remark 3.6. This lemma does not require a noetherian hypothesis on A.

***
Lemma 3.7. Let A be a ring containing the prime ﬁeld Fp, and let G be a p-group. Suppose
that A is Cohen-Macaulay, AG is noetherian, and A is ﬁnite over AG. Further, suppose there
is a prime ideal P of A such that G “ IGpPq. Then AG is not Cohen-Macaulay unless G is
generated by its 2-reﬂections.

***

Remark 3.8. This statement is closely related to [11, Theorem 5.5], which also applies to
non-p-groups and gives some control over how far AG can be from Cohen-Macaulay. However,
a key step in the proof of that result requires the rings to be normal rings that are localizations
of algebras ﬁnitely generated over ﬁelds. As our application will be to rings that do not fulﬁll
this hypothesis, we give an independent proof.

***
Remark 3.9. The map TrG{N is called the relative trace or relative transfer; see remark 2.3 .

***

Remark 3.10. The proof uses the result [25, Lemma 4.3] of Lorenz and Pathak, which has as
a hypothesis that A is noetherian as an AG-module; call this (‹). Above, we deduced (‹) from
the assumptions that (1) AG is noetherian and (2) A is ﬁnite over it. Actually, (‹) also implies
(1) and (2), hence is equivalent to them. Since any ideal of AG is also an AG-submodule of
A (since AG embeds in A), (‹) implies that all these ideals are ﬁnitely generated, thus (1).
Meanwhile, A itself is an AG-submodule of A, so (‹) implies it is ﬁnitely generated as an
AG-module, thus (2). More generally, if a module M over a ring R has an injective R-module
map from R, then noetherianity of M as R-module is equivalent to noetherianity of R as a
ring plus ﬁnite generation of M over R, by the same arguments.

***
Proposition 3.11. Let A be a ring containing Fp and let G be a ﬁnite group of automorphisms
of A. Let N be the normal subgroup of G generated by the 2-reﬂections. Suppose that AN is
Cohen-Macaulay, AG is noetherian, and AN is ﬁnite over AG. If there is an inertia group for
the action of G{N on AN that is a nontrivial p-group, then AG is not Cohen-Macaulay.

Proposition 4.1. If G is generated by transpositions, double transpositions, and 3-cycles,
then krxsG is Cohen-Macaulay regardless of the ﬁeld k.

Proposition 4.2. If G is not generated by transpositions, double transpositions, and 3-cycles,

that krxsG is not Cohen-Macaulay if char k “ p.

Question 5.1. How can Cohen-Macaulayness of krxsG be assessed when [20, Theorem 3.3]

come from a minimal g P GzN as in proposition 4.2b ?
