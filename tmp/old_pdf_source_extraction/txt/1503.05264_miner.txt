Theorem 1.1. [see Theorem 2.6 , Corollary 3.6 and Theorem 4.5 ] Let M be a torus
manifold. Then any irreducible subsystem of R(M ) is of type A, B or D and only type
A appears if H∗(M ) is generated by H 2(M ) as a ring. Moreover, if G is a compact Lie
subgroup of Diﬀ(M ) containing the torus acting on M , then the root system of G is a
subsystem of R(M ).

Theorem 1.2. [see Theorem 5.3 and Corollary 5.5 ] Let M be a torus manifold with an
invariant stable complex structure J. Then any irreducible subsystem of R(M, J) is of type
A and if G is a compact Lie subgroup of Diﬀ(M, J) containing the torus acting on M , then
the root system of G is a subsystem of R(M, J).

type 1: |(cid:104)α, vi(cid:105)| = 1 for some i and (cid:104)α, vk(cid:105) = 0 for k (cid:54)= i,
type 2: |(cid:104)α, vi(cid:105)| = |(cid:104)α, vj(cid:105)| = 1 for some i, j and (cid:104)α, vk(cid:105) = 0 for k (cid:54)= i, j,

Theorem 2.6. Let Φ be an irreducible subsystem of R(V ) of rank ≥ 2. Then Φ is of type

(1) Φ is of type B ⇐⇒ Φ contains a simple root of type 1,

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let M be a torus manifold with an omniorientation and let vi (i =

Corollary 3.6. If H∗(M ) is generated by H 2(M ) as a ring, then any irreducible subsystem

***

Example 3.7. Suppose that a torus manifold M is 4-dimensional. Since a characteristic
submanifold is of codimension two, orientable and is assumed to have a T -ﬁxed point,
every characteristic submanifold of our M must be a 2-sphere and have two T -ﬁxed points.
Therefore, Lemma 3.5 tells us that R(M ) has no element of type 1 (resp. type 2) unless
|M T| is 2 (resp. 2, 3, 4), and R(M ) is empty if |M T| ≥ 5, where |M T| denotes the cardinality
of M T .

***

Remark 3.8. For some class of manifolds with nice torus actions such as ﬂag manifolds
and toric hyperK¨ahler manifolds (also manifolds treated in [11], [13]), one could deﬁne root
systems similarly to Deﬁnition 3.3 .

Lemma 3.9. If g ∈ Diﬀ(M ) is ρ-equivariant,
then g permutes the characteristic
submanifolds Mi’s, i.e., there is a permutation σ on [m] such that g(Mi) = Mσ(i) for
any i ∈ [m]. Moreover, ρ∗(vi) = ivσ(i) with some i ∈ {±1} for any i ∈ [m], where ρ∗ is
an automorphism of H2(BT ) induced from ρ.

***

Lemma 3.10. [Lemma 2.1 in [21]] If the ρ-equivariant diﬀeomorphism g of a torus
manifold M is in the identity component of Diﬀ(M ) and ρ∗ is a reﬂection on H 2(BT ),
then the permutation σ in Lemma 3.9 satisﬁes either of the following:

(1) σ is the identity, i = −1 for some i and j = 1 for j (cid:54)= i,
(2) σ permutes two elements, say i and j, ﬁxes the others, i = j and k = 1 for

k (cid:54)= i, j.

Moreover, if g preserves the omniorientation on M (this is the case when G preserves a
stable complex structure on M discussed in Section ??), then (1) above does not occur by
the remark after (??).

Deﬁnition 4.1. A root of G is a non-zero weight of the adjoint representation of T on
g ⊗ C, where g denotes the Lie algebra of G. We think of a root of G as an element of
H 2(BT ) (through the above canonical isomorphism) and denote the set of roots of G by
∆(G).

***
Lemma 4.2. Either of the following holds for α ∈ ∆(G):

(1) There is i ∈ [m] such that α takes a non-zero value on vi and zero on the others.
(2) There are i, j ∈ [m] such that

If an element of NGα(T )\T preserves the omniorientation on M (this is the case when G
preserves a stable complex structure on M discussed in Section ??), then (1) above does
not occur and α = 1.

Lemma 4.4. Let α and β be roots in an irreducible factor Φ of ∆(G) and assume α (cid:54)= ±β.

(1) If both α and β are of type 1, then (α, β) = 0.
(2) If both α and β are of type 2 and (α, β) (cid:54)= 0, then Nα = Nβ and (cid:107)α(cid:107) = (cid:107)β(cid:107).
(3) Suppose that rank Φ ≥ 3. If α is of type 1 and β is of type 2 and (α, β) (cid:54)= 0, then

Nα = Nβ and

2(cid:107)α(cid:107) = (cid:107)β(cid:107).

Theorem 4.5. If a connected compact Lie group G acts eﬀectively on a torus manifold M
extending the T -action, then the root system ∆(G) of G is a subsystem of the root system
R(M ) of M .

***

Corollary 4.6. Let M be a torus manifold and let G be a compact connected Lie subgroup
of Diﬀ(M ) containing the torus T . If ∆(G) = R(M ), then G is maximal among connected
compact Lie subgroups of Diﬀ(M ) containing T .

***

Remark 4.7. As pointed out by Wiemeler, the equality in Corollary 4.6 cannot be
attained in general. For example, take an n-dimensional homology sphere Σ with non-
trivial fundamental group and consider Σ× T , where the T -action on Σ is trivial while that
on the second factor T is the group multiplication. Take also the standard sphere S2n with
the standard T -action. We choose a free T -orbit from Σ × T and S2n respectively, remove
their T -invariant open tubular neighborhoods and glue them along their boundaries. The
resulting manifold M is a homology sphere and a torus manifold. The vi’s for M are the
same as those for S2n because vi’s are deﬁned as parametrization of circle subgroups which
ﬁx the characteristic submanifolds and the characteristic submanifolds of M and S2n are
same. Therefore R(M ) = R(S2n) and if there is a connected compact Lie subgroup G of
Diﬀ(M ) with ∆(G) = R(M )(= R(S2n)), then G is a simple Lie group of type A and the
G-action on M must be transitive. Therefore, M must be diﬀeomorphic to S2n which is
a contradiction because M is non-simply connected. Therefore, there is no compact Lie
subgroup G of Diﬀ(M ) with ∆(G) = R(M ).

***

Example 4.8. (1) Take S2n with the T -action deﬁned in Example 3.4 . The linear action of
SO(2n+1) on S2n is eﬀective, SO(2n+1) contains the torus T and ∆(SO(2n+1)) = R(S2n).
Therefore, SO(2n+1) is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diﬀ(S2n) containing
T by Corollary 4.6 .
(2) Take CP n with the T -action deﬁned in Example 3.4 . The linear action of U(n + 1) on
Cn+1 induces an eﬀective action of PU(n + 1) containing the torus T and ∆(PU(2n + 1)) =
R(CP n). Therefore, PU(n+1) is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diﬀ(CP n)
containing T by Corollary 4.6 .

***

Proposition 5.1. Diﬀ(M, J) is a Lie group.

***

Deﬁnition 5.2. For (M, J), we deﬁne

R(M, J) := {α ∈ H 2(BT ) | (cid:104)α, vi(cid:105) = 1,(cid:104)α, vj(cid:105) = −1 for some i (cid:54)= j

and (cid:104)α, vk(cid:105) = 0 for any k (cid:54)= i, j}.

Theorem 5.3. Let M be a torus manifold with a T -invariant stable complex structure
J. If a connected compact Lie group G acts eﬀectively on M extending the T -action and
preserving the stable complex structure J, then the root system ∆(G) of G is a subsystem
of R(M, J) and every irreducible factor of ∆(G) is of type A.

***

Remark 5.4. It is shown in [20, Lemma 5.8] that any irreducible factor of the G in
Theorem 5.3 is of type A.

***

Corollary 5.5. Let M be a torus manifold with a stable complex structure J and let G be a
connected compact Lie subgroup of Diﬀ(M, J) containing the torus T . If ∆(G) = R(M, J),
then G is maximal among connected compact Lie subgroups of Diﬀ(M, J) containing T .

***
Example 5.6. (1) Take M = S2n(⊂ Cn ⊕ R) with the standard T -action deﬁned in
Example 3.4 . Since τ S2n ⊕ R ∼= Cn ⊕ R, we have

τ S2n ⊕ R ⊕ R ∼= Cn ⊕ R ⊕ R ∼= Cn+1.

Let J be a stable complex structure deﬁned from this identiﬁcation. Then one see that
{vi}n
i=1 through an identiﬁcation of H2(BT ) = Hom(S1, T )
with Zn, so that

i=1 is the standard basis {ei}n

R(S2n, J) = {±(e∗

i − e∗

j ) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}.

This is a root system of type An−1. Note that R(S2n, J) is a proper subsystem of R(S2n).
The linear action of U(n) on Cn induces an action on S2n preserving the J and U(n)
contains the torus T and ∆(U(n)) = R(S2n, J). Therefore, U(n) is a maximal connected
compact Lie subgroup of Diﬀ(S2n, J) containing T by Corollary 5.5 .
(2) Take M = CP n with the T -action deﬁned in Example 3.4 and with the standard
complex structure Jst. Then one sees that {vi}n+1
i=1 as vi = ei for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and vn+1 =

i=1 ei through an identiﬁcation of H2(BT ) = Hom(S1, T ) with Zn. Hence

−(cid:80)n

R(CP n, Jst) = R(CP n) = {±e∗

j ) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}.

Since the action of PU(n + 1) mentioned in Example 4.8 preserves Jst, PU(n + 1) is also
a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diﬀ(CP n, Jst).

Lemma 6.1. The action of GLα on Cm leaves Z invariant.

***

Proposition 6.2. Let (X(∆), Jst) be a toric manifold with the standard complex structure.
Then, the G above is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diﬀ(X(∆), Jst)
containing T .

***

Remark 6.3. Demazure deﬁnes roots associated to the fan ∆ in [4] (also see [18]) and
intoduces a root system which describes the reductive part of Aut(X(∆)). Proposition 6.2
follows from his result.

***

Proposition 6.4. Let (X(∆), J) be a toric manifold with the stable complex structure
J. Then, the GJ above is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diﬀ(X(∆), J)
containing T .

***
Example 6.5. We take X(∆) = CP 1.
In this case, m = 2 and take q = 1. Then
G(∆)J = (GL(1, C)× GL(1, C))/ GL(1, C) is isomorphic to GL(1, C). Note that our stable
complex structure J on CP 1 is isomorphic to that in Example 5.6 (1) for S2. Therefore,
Diﬀ(S2, J) is non-compact.
