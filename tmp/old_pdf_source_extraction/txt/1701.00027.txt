Definition 1.1. A smooth Fano variety X is k-Fano if the sth Chern character chs (X) is
positive (see Definition 2.3 ) for 1 â‰¤ s â‰¤ k, and weak k-Fano for k > 1 if X is (k âˆ’1)-Fano
and chk (X) is nef.

***
Conjecture 1.2. If X is k-Fano, then Eff k (X) is a polyhedral cone.

***
Theorem 1.3. Let X be a n-dimensional 2-Fano variety with iX â‰¥ n âˆ’ 2. Then Eff 2 (X)
is polyhedral. Also, Eff 3 (X) is polyhedral with the possible exception of the complete
intersection of type (2, 2) in P8 .
In particular, Conjecture 1.2 is true for any n-dimensional k-Fano variety with iX â‰¥ nâˆ’2
and k = 2, 3.

***
Theorem 1.4. Let Y = G(2, 5) or G(2, 6), let X be a smooth complete intersection of
type (1, 1) in Y under the PlÃ¼cker embedding. Then X is not weak 2-Fano.

Notation.
â€“ X is a variety of dimension n â‰¥ 4.
â€“ k is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ n âˆ’ 1.
â€“ Hi (X, G) and H i (X, G) are the singular homology and cohomology groups of X for
1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ 2n and coefficients in a group G.
â€“ bi (X) is the ith Betti number of X for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ 2n, that is the rank of Hi (X, Z) or of
H i (X, Z).
â€“ Zk (X) is the group of k-cycles with integer coefficients.
â€“ Ratk (X) is the group of k-cycles rationally equivalent to zero.
â€“ Ak (X) is L
the Chow group of k-cycles on X, that is Ak (X) = Zk (X)/Ratk (X).
â€“ Aâˆ— (X) = nk=0 Ak (X) is the Chow ring of X.
â€“ Algk (X) is the group of k-cycles algebraically equivalent to zero.
â€“ Homk (X) is the group of k-cycles homologically equivalent to zero, that is the kernel
of the cycle map cl : Zk (X) â†’ H2k (X, Z).
â€“ Numk (X) is the group of cycles numerically equivalent to zero, that is the group of
cycles Î± âˆˆ Zk (X) such that P Â· cl(Î±) = 0 for all polynomials P in Chern classes of
vector bundles on X.
â€“ Nk (X) is the quotient group Zk (X)/Numk (X), and Nk (X)R := Nk (X) âŠ— R.
â€“ Eff k (X) âŠ† Nk (X)R is the cone generated by numerical classes of effective k-cycles.
â€“ Let s â‰¥ 1 be an integer. The sth Chern character of X, chs (X), is the homogeneous
part of degree s of the total Chern character of X. For example, if ci (X) are the
Chern classes of X, then ch1 (X) = c1 (X), ch2 (X) = 21 (c21 (X) âˆ’ 2c2 (X)), ch3 (X) =
1 3
6 (c1 (X) âˆ’ 4c1 (X)c2 (X) + 3c3 (X))

Remark 2.1. There is a chain of inclusions [Ful84, p.374]
Ratk (X) âŠ† Algk (X) âŠ† Homk (X) âŠ† Numk (X) âŠ† Zk (X)
that gives rise to a diagram

We set
(2.2)

Ï€k,R : Zk (X)/Homk (X) âŠ— R  Nk (X)R

the tensor product of Ï€k and idR .

***
Remark 2.2. By linearity of the intersection product, Nk (X) is torsion free. When X is
smooth, the intersection product gives a perfect pairing [Ful84, Definition 19.1]
Nk (X)R âŠ— Nnâˆ’k (X)R â†’ R.

***
Definition 2.3. Let X be a smooth variety. A class Î± âˆˆ Nk (X)R is positive if Î± Â· Î² > 0
for every Î² âˆˆ Eff nâˆ’k (X)\{0}, and it is nef if Î± Â· Î² â‰¥ 0 for every Î² âˆˆ Eff nâˆ’k (X). The
cone generated by nef classes of k-cycles is Nef k (X).

***
Lemma 2.4. Let X be a projective variety. Then
(1) If either rkAk (X) = 1 or b2k (X) = 1, then Eff k (X) is a half-line.
(2) If either rkAk (X) = 2 or b2k (X) = 2, then Eff k (X) is either a half-line or it is
spanned by two extremal rays.

***
Remark 2.5. In a general, a variety X with chk (X) positive may not be k-Fano. For
example, in [Mum79] Mumford found a smooth surface S of general type with ch2 (S) = 32 .

***
Proposition 3.1. Let X be a n-dimensional smooth complete intersection in a weighted
projective space. If k 6= n2 then b2k (X) = 1. In particular Eff k (X) is polyhedral.

***
Theorem 3.2. Let X be a n-dimensional weak k-Fano complete intersection in a
projective space. If 1 â‰¤ s â‰¤ k, then b2s (X) â‰¤ 2. In particular Eff s (X) is polyhedral.

***
Proposition 3.3. Let X be a smooth n-dimensional variety and let G be an affine group
which acts transitively on X. Suppose that, for every k = 1, ..., n âˆ’ 1, there exists a finite
family of subvarieties {â„¦a }aâˆˆIk of dimension k such that
(1) h{[â„¦a ] /a âˆˆ Ik }i = H2k (X, Z) or Ak (X), and
(2) âˆ€a âˆˆ Ik , âˆƒb âˆˆ Inâˆ’k such that â„¦c Â· â„¦b = Î´a,c âˆ€c âˆˆ Ik .
Then Nef k (X) = Eff k (X) = Eff k (X) is polyhedral and simplicial.

***
Proposition 3.4. Let X be a rational homogeneous variety. Then Nef k (X) = Eff k (X) =
Eff k (X) is polyhedral.

***
Definition 3.5. Let r, s be two integers such that 2 â‰¤ r â‰¤ 2s . The Grassmann variety
of r-planes G(r, s) is the scheme of r-dimensional subspaces of Cs . Let Ï‰ be a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on Cs . The orthogonal Grassmannian of isotropic
r-planes OG(r, s) is the scheme of r-dimensional subspaces of Cs isotropic with respect
to Ï‰. The scheme OG(r, 2m) has two isomorphic connected components if r = m or
m âˆ’ 1. In these two cases, we will denote by OG+ (r, 2m) a connected component of
OG(r, 2m). Let Ïƒ be a non-degenerate symplectic bilinear form on Cs . The symplectic
Grassmannian of isotropic r-planes SG(r, s) is the scheme of r-dimensional subspaces of
Cs isotropic with respect to Ïƒ.

***
Remark 3.6. Let S be the universal subbundle of G(r, s). The PlÃ¼cker embedding is
the embedding given by the very ample line bundle âˆ§r Sâˆ¨ . The varieties OG(r, s) and
SG(r, s) can be embedded in G(r, s) as zero sections of, respectively, Sym2 Sâˆ¨ and âˆ§2 Sâˆ¨ .

***
Remark 3.7. In [AC13, Proposition 34], it is stated that the smooth complete intersection
of OG+ (k, 2k) of type (2, 2) under the PlÃ¼cker embedding is a weak 2-Fano variety. This
should be read as (2).

***
Remark 3.8. We introduce the following notation: the group H 4 (G(r, s), Z) is generated
by {Ïƒ2 , Ïƒ1,1 }, while H r(sâˆ’r)âˆ’4 (G(r, s), Z) is generated by a basis {Ïƒâˆ¨2 , Ïƒâˆ¨1,1 } dual to
{Ïƒ2 , Ïƒ1,1 }.

***
Remark 3.9. Let X be a smooth complete intersection of G(2, 5) of type (1, 1) under the
PlÃ¼cker embedding, let Z be the variety of lines through a general point of X. [AC13,
Example 30] says that Z has homology class equal to Ïƒâˆ¨2 + Ïƒâˆ¨1,1 . This should be read as
2Ïƒâˆ¨1,1 + Ïƒâˆ¨2 .

***
Remark 3.10. By Serre duality Ï‡(â„¦pG(2,5) (âˆ’m)) = Ï‡(â„¦6âˆ’p
G(2,5) (m)), and for m = 1, 2, 3 we
5
have Ï‡(â„¦G(2,5) (âˆ’m)) = Ï‡(â„¦G(2,5) (m)) = 0 because all the groups H p (G(2, 5), â„¦5G(2,5) (m))
are zero by [Sno86, Theorem p. 171(3)]. If m = 1, 2 we have Ï‡(â„¦2G(2,5) (âˆ’m)) =
Ï‡(â„¦4G(2,5) (m)) = 0, because âˆ€p â‰¥ 0 H p (G(2, 5), â„¦4G(2,5) (m)) = 0 by [Sno86, Theorem
p.p. 165,169]. It can easily be seen that Ï‡(â„¦G(2,5) ) = âˆ’1 and Ï‡(â„¦2G(2,5) ) = 2.

***
Lemma 3.11. Let X be a smooth complete intersection of type (1, 1) in a Grassmann
variety G(2, 5) under the PlÃ¼cker embedding. Then b4 (X) = 2.

***
Proposition 3.12. Let X be a n-dimensional weak 2-Fano complete intersection in a
Grassmann variety G(r, s) under the PlÃ¼cker embedding. Then, b4 (X) â‰¤ 2. In particular
Eff 2 (X) is polyhedral.

***
Remark 3.13. By [Laz04b, Theorem 7.1.1] we have H 5 (Xt , Z) = 0. By [Hat02, Corollary
3.3] H4 (Xt , Z) is torsion free, then also H 8 (Xt , Z) is torsion free by PoincarÃ© duality.

Proposition 3.17. Let s, r be positive integers such that 2 â‰¤ r â‰¤ 2s , and 2s âˆ’ r 6= 1, 2
if s is even. Let s 6= 2r (respectively, s = 2r), let X be a n-dimensional weak 2-Fano
complete intersection in a connected component of the orthogonal Grassmann variety
OG(r, s) under the PlÃ¼cker (respectively, half-spinor) embedding, with X very general if
X âŠ† OG(2, 7). Then Eff 2 (X) is polyhedral.

Proposition 3.18. Let X be a smooth n-dimensional weak 2-Fano complete intersection
in a symplectic Grassmann variety SG(r, s) under the PlÃ¼cker embedding. Then, b4 (X) â‰¤
