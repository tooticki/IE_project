Question 1.1. For which G Ă Sn is krxsG Cohen-Macaulay regardless of k?

***
Theorem 1.2. Let G Ă Sn . The ring krxsG is Cohen-Macaulay for all choices of k if and only
if G is generated by transpositions, double transpositions, and 3-cycles.

***
Definition 2.1. The Stanley-Reisner ring of P over k, written krPs, is the quotient of the
polynomial ring krtyα uαPP s, with indeterminates indexed by the elements of P, by the ideal
generated by products yα yβ indexed by incomparable pairs α, β P P.

***
Remark 2.2. This is a special case of a more general definition, which we will not use directly:
the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex. (We will use a further generalization – see
definition 2.5 below.) The Stanley-Reisner ring of a poset is nothing but the Stanley-Reisner
ring of the chain complex of the poset, i.e. the simplicial complex with vertex set the elements
of the poset, whose simplices are the chains in the poset. It is helpful to keep in mind that
the Stanley-Reisner ring of a poset has an underlying simplicial complex as well.

***
Remark 2.3. Garsia [9], Garsia-Stanton [10], and Reiner [15] all refer to the map G as the
transfer map. Other authors in invariant theory ([27], [32]) use the same phrase to denote the
AG -linear map
Tr : A Ñ AG
ÿ
x ÞÑ
gpxq.
gPG

While this latter map is also called the trace, there are well-established usages of transfer to
describe maps analogous to Tr in both topology and group theory, so we prefer to call G the
Garsia map to avoid competition for the term and to honor Garsia’s introduction of it in [9].
The present paper makes no use of the Garsia map except implicitly in quoting [15, Theorem
A.1].

***
Definition 2.4. A boolean complex is a regular CW complex in which every face has the
combinatorial type of a simplex.

***
Definition 2.5. The quotient ring krtzα uαPP s{I is called the Stanley-Reisner ring of Ω and
denoted krΩs.

***
Remark 2.6. Definition 2.5 generalizes definition 2.1 , but in a somewhat subtle way. Given
a poset P, one can form its chain complex Ω, regarded as a boolean complex, and then the
krPs of 2.1 will be isomorphic to the krΩs of 2.5 ; however, the poset Q of the latter definition
will not be P. Instead, its elements will be chains in P, ordered by inclusion. For example,
let P “ B2 ztHu. Then the elements of P may be abbreviated 1, 2, and 12, and the only
incomparable pair consists of 1 and 2. Thus
krPs “ kry1 , y2 , y12 s{py1 y2 q
according to definition 2.1 . However, Q consists of the six chains in P: the empty chain H,
three chains of length 1 (1, 2, and 12), and two chains of length 2 (1 Ă 12 and 2 Ă 12). Thus
krΩs “ krzH , z1 , z2 , z12 , z1Ă12 , z2Ă12 s{I
where I is as described above. The isomorphism is given by mapping the z of a given chain
to the product of y’s corresponding to elements of the chain, for example z1Ă12 ÞÑ y1 y12 .
Indeed, the definition of I becomes much more transparent after considering why this map is
an isomorphism.

***
Definition 2.7. A boolean complex of dimension d is balanced if there is a labeling of its
vertices by d ` 1 labels such that the vertices of any one face have distinct labels. Given such
a labeling, a cellular action by a group is a balanced action if it preserves the labeling.

***
Remark 2.8. Since we only use Stanley-Reisner theory to show the “if” direction of theorem
1.2 and thus we only need it to deduce Cohen-Macaulayness, and not the failure of CohenMacaulayness, the proof of 1.2 only uses Stanley’s and not Duval’s part of the generalization
of (??) to boolean complexes.

***
Remark 2.9. This definition of polyhedron is a technical device, used here to define the
concepts piecewise-linear and polyhedral star. It includes the more conventional meaning of a
three-dimensional polytope as a special case, but is much, much broader. For example, any
open subset of Rn , or of any polytope, is a polyhedron.
More broadly, our use of PL topology in this paper is only to serve a technical need linking
Lange’s result to our setting.

***
Lemma 2.10. We have
DG{N pP X AN q – DG pPq{DN pPq
and
IG{N pP X AN q – IG pPq{IN pPq.

***
Lemma 2.11. Let C be an arbitrary AG -algebra, and let B :“ AbAG C. Let G act on B through
its action on A and trivial action on C. If there is a prime Q of B pulling back to P in A,
then DG pQq Ă DG pPq, and IG pQq “ IG pPq.

***
Remark 2.12. Examining the proof of lemma 2.11 , we see why the analogous equality to
IG pPq “ IG pQq may fail for decomposition groups. If g P DG pPq, then we do have the xgyequivariant isomorphism (??), and therefore g does act on the cosets of τpPqB in B, but the
only one we know it fixes is τpPqB itself. In particular, Q, which may be the union of many
of these cosets, need not be fixed setwise, so that g R DG pQq.

***
Lemma 2.13. If A is a noetherian ring, then Ahs
p is noetherian too.

***
Lemma 2.14. [Raynaud] We have a ring isomorphism
I pPq

***
Theorem 3.1. Assume that AG is noetherian. Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(1) AG is Cohen-Macaulay.
hs
(2) For every prime ideal p of AG , and for every prime ideal Q of Ahs
p lying over pCp and
pulling back to a prime P of A lying over p,

pAhs
p qQ

IG pPq

is Cohen-Macaulay.
hs
(3) For every maximal ideal p of AG , there is some prime ideal Q of Ahs
p lying over pCp
and pulling back to a prime P of A lying over p, such that

pAhs
p qQ
is Cohen-Macaulay.

IG pPq

***
Lemma 3.2. If A is Cohen-Macaulay, then for any prime ideal p of AG , Ahs
p is CohenMacaulay.

***
Lemma 3.3. If an element g P IG pPq acts as a t-reflection on AP , then it acts as a t-reflection
on A.

***
Lemma 3.4. If A is noetherian, and g P IG pPq “ IG pQq acts as a t-reflection on Ahs
p , then it
acts as a t-reflection on A.

***
Lemma 3.5. If N is the normal subgroup of G generated by the t-reflections, then no element
of GzN acts on AN as a t-reflection.

***
Remark 3.6. This lemma does not require a noetherian hypothesis on A.

***
Lemma 3.7. Let A be a ring containing the prime field Fp , and let G be a p-group. Suppose
that A is Cohen-Macaulay, AG is noetherian, and A is finite over AG . Further, suppose there
is a prime ideal P of A such that G “ IG pPq. Then AG is not Cohen-Macaulay unless G is
generated by its 2-reflections.

***
Remark 3.8. This statement is closely related to [11, Theorem 5.5], which also applies to
non-p-groups and gives some control over how far AG can be from Cohen-Macaulay. However,
a key step in the proof of that result requires the rings to be normal rings that are localizations
of algebras finitely generated over fields. As our application will be to rings that do not fulfill
this hypothesis, we give an independent proof.

***
Remark 3.9. The map TrG{N is called the relative trace or relative transfer; see remark 2.3 .

***
Remark 3.10. The proof uses the result [25, Lemma 4.3] of Lorenz and Pathak, which has as
a hypothesis that A is noetherian as an AG -module; call this (‹). Above, we deduced (‹) from
the assumptions that (1) AG is noetherian and (2) A is finite over it. Actually, (‹) also implies
(1) and (2), hence is equivalent to them. Since any ideal of AG is also an AG -submodule of
A (since AG embeds in A), (‹) implies that all these ideals are finitely generated, thus (1).
Meanwhile, A itself is an AG -submodule of A, so (‹) implies it is finitely generated as an
AG -module, thus (2). More generally, if a module M over a ring R has an injective R-module
map from R, then noetherianity of M as R-module is equivalent to noetherianity of R as a
ring plus finite generation of M over R, by the same arguments.

***
Proposition 3.11. Let A be a ring containing Fp and let G be a finite group of automorphisms
of A. Let N be the normal subgroup of G generated by the 2-reflections. Suppose that AN is
Cohen-Macaulay, AG is noetherian, and AN is finite over AG . If there is an inertia group for
the action of G{N on AN that is a nontrivial p-group, then AG is not Cohen-Macaulay.

***
Proposition 4.1. If G is generated by transpositions, double transpositions, and 3-cycles,
then krxsG is Cohen-Macaulay regardless of the field k.

***
Proposition 4.2. If G is not generated by transpositions, double transpositions, and 3-cycles,
then there exists a prime p such that for any k of characteristic p, krxsG is not Cohen-Macaulay.

***
Lemma 4.3. With this notation, we have
IG pP‹π q “ GBπ .

***
Lemma 4.4. With this notation, we have
IG{N pPπ q “ GBπ N{N.

***
Lemma 4.5. Let NŸG be a proper normal subgroup. Let π be minimal in Πn among partitions
associated (via ϕ) with elements of G that are not in N. Then:
(1) The group GBπ N{N is cyclic of prime order, say p;
(2) any element g of GzN whose orbits are given by π has order a power of p, and
(3) the image of g in G{N generates GBπ N{N.

***
Proposition 4.2b. Let N be the subgroup of G generated by the transpositions, double
transpositions, and 3-cycles. If N Ĺ G, then for any g P GzN whose orbits are not refined by
the orbits of any other g P GzN, the order of g is a prime power p` , where p has the property
that krxsG is not Cohen-Macaulay if char k “ p.


***
Question 5.1. How can Cohen-Macaulayness of krxsG be assessed when [20, Theorem 3.3]
and the present work are both inapplicable, i.e. when p | rG : Ns and p2 | |G|, but p does not
come from a minimal g P GzN as in proposition 4.2b ?

***
Question 5.2. Is there a purely algebraic proof of theorem 1.2 , making no use of StanleyReisner theory or Lange’s result on PL manifolds?

***
Question 5.3. For a fixed p “ char k as in question 5.1 , can krxsG be Cohen-Macaulay
without kr∆{Gs being Cohen-Macaulay?
