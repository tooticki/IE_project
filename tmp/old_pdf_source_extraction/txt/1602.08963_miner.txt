Theorem 1.1. [Read] There exists a Banach space ER such that the Banach algebra B(ER)
contains a closed ideal I of codimension one, but the closed linear span of its products,

I 2 = span{ST : S, T ∈ I },

has inﬁnite codimension in B(ER). More precisely,

(i) I contains the ideal W (ER) of weakly compact operators on ER;
(ii) W (ER) has inﬁnite codimension in B(ER);
(iii) I 2 ⊆ W (ER).

Theorem 1.2. There exists a continuous, surjective homomorphism ψ from the Banach
algebra B(ER) onto (cid:96)∼

2 with ker ψ = W (ER) such that the short-exact sequence

{0}

/ W (ER)

/ B(ER)

ψ /

/ (cid:96)∼

2

/ {0}

splits strongly, in the sense that there is a continuous homomorphism from (cid:96)∼
which is a right inverse of ψ.

2 into B(ER)

Note added in proof. After the completion of [6], in joint work with Kania [5], we have
succeeded in constructing a singular extension of B(ER) which is admissible and splits
algebraically, but does not split strongly, thus complementing the ﬁrst of the two results
mentioned above. Once again, Theorem 1.2 plays a key role in the proof of this result.

Note. Our deﬁnition of β(cid:48)
n above corrects a typo in [7, Deﬁnition 3.4(b)], where the sign
of yn is wrong, as one can see by comparing it with the second line of the displayed equations
at the bottom of [7, p. 313] and the seventh displayed equation of [7, p. 319].
