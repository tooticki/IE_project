Definition 1.1. A function f : [N]2 → N is addition-like if
(1) f is computable,
(2) there is a computable function g such that if y > g(x, n) then f ({x, y}) > n,
and
(3) there is a b such that for all x 6= y, there are at most b many z’s for which
f ({x, z}) = f ({x, y}).

functions N → 2, each of size at least M . Suppose that for each m > M and
n, there are at most 2qm many j such that σj has size m and n ∈ dom(σj ), and
that we can computably determine the set of all such j given m and n. Then there
