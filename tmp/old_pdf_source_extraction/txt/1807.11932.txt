Two Maurer–Cartan elements ξ, η ∈ V ⊗ A are said to be gauge equivalent if they lie in the
same orbit of the gauge action. We write M C (V, A) for the quotient of M C(V, A) by the
gauge action.
If V is a complete dga, we say that two Maurer–Cartan elements in V ⊗A are gauge equivalent
if they are gauge equivalent in the corresponding dgla, taken with the commutator bracket.

Theorem 4.3.
(1) Let V be a complete L∞ -algebra. Two Maurer–Cartan elements ξ, η ∈ V are left
homotopic if and only if their representing cdga maps ξ, η : SΣ−1 V ∗ → k satisfy
η = ξ ◦ e[x̃,d] ,

where x̃ is the constant degree −1 derivation of SΣ−1 V ∗ induced by the left homotopy.
(2) Let V be a complete A∞ -algebra. Two Maurer–Cartan elements ξ, η ∈ V are left
homotopic if and only if their representing dga maps ξ, η : T Σ−1 V ∗ → k satisfy
η = ξ ◦ e[x̃,d] ,

where x̃ is the constant degree −1 derivation of T Σ−1 V ∗ induced by the left homotopy.

***

Example 4.4. Take V to be a dg vector space, so that it has a linear differential and a
decomposition V = H(V ) ⊕ ΣB ⊕ B, and take A = SΣ−1 V ∗ . Let ξ be the identity map, and
η be the map induced by the projection of V onto its homology H(V ). Then ξ and η are left
homotopic, but η is not an automorphism, so cannot be of the form id ◦ e[x̃,d] . Indeed, if x̃ is
the constant derivation corresponding to the homotopy, then the exponential e[x̃,d] diverges.

Lemma 4.5. Let V be a pseudocompact vector space.

(2) Any continuous linear map V → S 0 V extends uniquely to a continuous derivation
of S 0 V , and any continuous linear map V → T 0 V extends uniquely to a continuous
derivation of T 0 V .

Remark 5.4. In the case where V ⊗ A is complete (in particular, when A = k), we can simplify
the above proof, as the result is just a direct consequence of Theorem 4.3 and Theorem 5.2.
