Theorem 1.1. For any integers 1 ≤ k < n and s ∈ [0, 1] the union of any
nonempty s-Hausdorﬀ-dimensional family of k-dimensional aﬃne subspaces of Rn
has Hausdorﬀ dimension s + k.

Theorem 1.2. Let 1 ≤ k < n be integers and s ∈ [0, 1].

Notation 1.3. For any integers 1 ≤ k < n, let A(n, k) denote the space of all
k-dimensional aﬃne subspaces of Rn. For any s ≥ 0, δ ∈ (0,∞] and A ⊂ Rn,
the s-dimensional Hausdorﬀ δ-premeasure of A will be denoted by Hs
δ(A), the
s-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure by Hs(A), and the Hausdorﬀ dimension of A by
dim A. The open ball of center x and radius r will be denoted by B(x, r) or Bρ(x, r)
if we want to indicate the metric ρ. For a set U ⊂ Rn, Uδ = ∪x∈U B(x, δ) denotes
the open δ-neighborhood of U . We will use the notation a (cid:46)α b if a ≤ Cb where C
is a constant depending on α. If it is clear from the context what C should depend
on, we may write only a (cid:46) b.

Theorem 2.1. Let 1 ≤ k < n be integers, let A(n, k) denote the space of all k-
dimensional aﬃne subspaces of Rn and consider any natural metric on A(n, k). Let
0 < α ≤ k be any real number. Suppose that B ⊂ Rn,∅ (cid:54)= E ⊂ A(n, k) and for
every k-dimensional aﬃne subspace P ∈ E, dim (P ∩ B) ≥ α. Then
(2)

dim B ≥ 2α − k + min(dim E, 1).

***

Remark 2.2. An example for such a metric on A(n, k) is deﬁned in [11], p. 53.
Let ρ denote the given metric on A(n, k). We say that ρ is a natural metric if ρ
and the metric d deﬁned in [11] are strongly equivalent; that is, there exist positive
constants K1 and K2 such that, for every P, P (cid:48) ∈ A(n, k), K1·d(P, P (cid:48)) ≤ ρ(P, P (cid:48)) ≤
K2 · d(P, P (cid:48)).

***
Remark 2.3. For α = k and dim E ≤ k + 1 the estimate (2) is sharp in the sense
that for any s ∈ [0, k + 1] there exist sets E and B with the above property and
dim E = s such that we have equality in (2): it is easy to see using Theorem 1.2
that we obtain such an example by letting E to be any s-Hausdorﬀ dimensional
collection of k-dimensional aﬃne subspaces of a ﬁxed k + 1-dimensional subspace
of Rn and B = ∪P∈EP .
Clearly, (2) can be a good estimate only when α is close to k: for α < k − 1 the
right-hand side of (2) is less than α but trivially, dim B ≥ α. Since ﬁnding the best
estimate for the n = 2, k = 1, dim E = 1, α < 1 case is essentially equivalent to
ﬁnding the minimal Hausdorﬀ dimension of a Furstenberg set, this cannot be easy
and it is unlikely that our estimate is sharp for any α < k.

Corollary 2.5. Let 0 ≤ k < n be integers, 0 ≤ α ≤ k, ∅ (cid:54)= C ⊂ Rn, and B ⊂ Rn
such that for every x ∈ C there exists a k-dimensional aﬃne subspace P containing
x such that P intersects B in a nonempty set of Hausdorﬀ dimension at least α.
Then dim B ≥ 2α − k + min(dim C − k, 1).
Specially, if 1 ≤ k and a set A ⊂ Rn contains a k-dimensional punctured aﬃne
subspace through every point of a set C with dim C ≥ k + 1, then dim A ≥ k + 1.

***
Theorem 2.6. Let 0 ≤ k < n be integers, 0 ≤ α ≤ k and 0 ≤ r be real numbers,
∅ (cid:54)= C ⊂ Rn, and B ⊂ Rn be such that for every x ∈ C there exists a k-dimensional
aﬃne subspace P at distance r from x such that P intersects B in a nonempty set
of Hausdorﬀ dimension at least α. Then dim B ≥ 2α − k + dim C − (n − 1).
Specially, if B contains a k-dimensional aﬃne subspace at a ﬁxed positive distance
from every point of Rn, or if B contains the k-skeleton of a rotated unit cube around
every point of Rn, then dim B ≥ k + 1.

***

Remark 2.7. In the special cases mentioned in Theorem 2.6 , the estimate is sharp.
It is easy to see that B = Rk+1 × Qn−k−1 contains a k-dimensional aﬃne subspace
at every positive distance from every point of Rn and clearly dim B = k + 1. The
construction given in [1] for a set B with dim B = k + 1 containing the k-skeleton
of a rotated unit cube centered at every point of Rn is also based on this example.

***
Corollary 2.8. Let 0 ≤ k < n be integers, S ⊂ Rn with dim S = k that can be
covered by a countable union of k-dimensional aﬃne subspaces. Let ∅ (cid:54)= C ⊂ Rn,
A ⊂ Rn such that for all x ∈ C there exists a rotation T ∈ SO(n) such that A
contains x + T (S). Then dim A ≥ max(k, k + dim C − (n − 1)).

***

Remark 2.9. The authors in [1] show that the estimate in Corollary 2.8 is sharp
if dim C = n and S can be covered by a countable union of k-dimensional aﬃne
subspaces that do not contain the origin.
On the other hand, if the covering subspaces contain the origin, then the estimate is
not always sharp. Indeed, if S is a punctured line through the origin and C = Rn,
then A is a Nikodym set, thus the conjecture is dim A = n. The lower bounds
obtained for the dimension of Besicovitch sets give lower bounds for the dimension
of Nikodym sets, thus for dim A as well. A survey of the currently best lower bounds
can be found in [12]. As an example, by [17], dim A ≥ n+2
2 which is better than
the bound 2 given by Corollary 2.8 provided n > 2.

Lemma 3.1. For X ⊂ Rn, α > 0 and c ≥ 0 let

Eα,c,X = {P ∈ A(n, k) : Hα∞(P ∩ X) > c}.

If X ⊂ Rn is bounded Gδ, then Eα,c,X is analytic.

***
Remark 3.2. It is easy to see that if X ⊂ Rn is compact, then Eα,c,X is Fσ, thus
also analytic. Therefore, to prove Theorem 2.1 (or any of the above mentioned
results) with the extra assumption that B ⊂ Rn is compact, the following argument
could be skipped.

***

Deﬁnition. Let Y be a Hausdorﬀ topological space. A capacity on Y is a map
γ : P(Y ) → [0,∞] such that
(i) A ⊂ B =⇒ γ(A) ≤ γ(B),
(ii) A0 ⊂ A1 ⊂ ··· =⇒ γ(An) → γ(∪nAn),
(iii) for any compact K ⊂ Y we have γ(K) < ∞, and if γ(K) < r, then for some

open U ⊃ K, γ(U ) < r.

***

Lemma 3.3. Let s = min(dim E, 1) > 0. We can make the following assumptions
in the proof of Theorem 2.1 :

(i) B is a Gδ set, that is, a countable intersection of open sets;
(ii) Hα(P ∩ B) > 0 for every P ∈ E;
(iii) B is bounded;
(iv) E ⊂ A(n, k) is compact, and Hs(E) > 0. Moreover, there is ε > 0 such that

for every P ∈ E,

Hα∞(P ∩ B) ≥ ε.

***

Lemma 3.4. We can make the following further assumptions in Theorem 2.1 .

(I) For every P ∈ E, P ∩ Hi is a singleton and contained in S for all i =

Remark 3.5. In the subsequent proofs, applications of Lemma 3.1 imply that
the sets we take µ-measure of are µ-measurable, since they are in the σ-algebra
generated by analytic sets.

Lemma 3.7. There is a constant c > 0 depending on E, n, and k but independent
of l, ε, γ and the covering of B such that, for every 0 < δ ≤ δ0,

***

Remark 3.8. Note that the integer l, the sets (cid:101)E, (cid:101)P for every P ∈ (cid:101)E, and F depend
on the cover B ⊂(cid:83)∞

i=1 B(xi, ri).

***

Remark 3.9. As it happens often, it would be easier to prove the lower bound for
the box dimension of B. For that purpose, we would not need the previous steps,
it would be enough to estimate Ln(Bδ) from below. To prove the lower bound for
the Hausdorﬀ dimension, we sorted out a big enough part of B that can be covered
by balls of approximately the same radius.

constants K1 and K2 such that, for every P, P (cid:48) ∈ (cid:101)E, K1 · d(P, P (cid:48)) ≤ ρ(P, P (cid:48)) ≤

Thus the metrics d and ρ are strongly equivalent, this means, there exist positive
K2 · d(P, P (cid:48)).
