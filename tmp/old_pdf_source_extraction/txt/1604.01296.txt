Definiton 3.2. Let X be a metric space and let m be a nonnegative function on

Theorem 3.3. Let X be a metric space, {xn } be a sequence in X, and m be

(ii) condition (2.3) holds for any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn } of {T x}.
If d(T n x, T n+1 x) → 0, then {T n x} is a Cauchy sequence.

(ii) for every x ∈ X, condition (2.3) holds for any two subsequences {xpn } and
{xqn } of the sequence {T n x}.
Then the Picard iterates of T are Cauchy sequences. Moreover, if X is complete,
T is continuous, and d(T n x, T n y) → 0, for all x, y ∈ X, then the Picard iterates
converge to a unique fixed point of T .

Theorem 3.8. Let X be a complete metric space, and T be a continuous and
asymptotically regular self-map of X. Define m by (??), and suppose
(i) d(T x, T y) < m(x, y), for every x, y ∈ X with x 6= y,
(ii) for any  > 0, there exist δ > 0 and N ∈ N0 such that
∀x, y ∈ X,

m(T N x, T N y) < δ +  =⇒ d(T N +1 x, T N +1 y) ≤ .

(3.6)

Then T has a unique fixed point z, and the Picard iterates of T converge to z.

Example 3.9. Take ai = i, for 0 ≤ i < 4, let r0 = 0, and rn = 1/n for n ≥ 1, and
set x4n+i = ai + rn . Let
X = {x4n+i : 0 ≤ i < 4, n ≥ 0}.
Then, equipped with the Euclidean metric, X is a complete metric space. Define
a mapping T : X → X by T (x` ) = x2` . Define m(x, y) by setting s = t = 1 and
α = β = 1 in (??), that is,
m(x, y) = d(x, y) + d(x, T x) + d(y, T y).
(Note that m is also obtained from (1.3) by setting γ = 1.)
First, we show that T satisfies all conditions in Theorem 3.8 . Clearly, T is
continuous and, for every x` , xν ∈ X, we have
 1

d(T n+2 x` , T n+2 xν ) = d(T n x4` , T n x4ν ) =  n+1 − n+1  → 0.

It is a matter of calculation to see that d(T x, T y) < m(x, y), for all x, y ∈ X. The
following shows that T satisfies (3.6) with N = 2:

Next, we show that the following condition (in Proinov’s theorem) is violated:
• for every  > 0, there exist δ > 0 such that
∀x, y ∈ X,

m(x, y) < δ +  =⇒ d(T x, T y) ≤ .

Take  = a2 − a0 . Let u` = x4` and v` = x4(`+1)+1 . Then
d(T u` , T v` ) = |x4(2`) − x4(2`+2)+2 | = a2 − a0 + r2` − r2`+2 > ,
and
m(u` , v` ) = |u` − v` | + |u` − T u` | + |v` − T v` |
= |x4` − x4(`+1)+1 | + |x4` − x4(2`) | + |x4(`+1)+1 − x4(2`+2)+2 |
= (a1 − a0 + r` − r`+1 ) + (r` − r2` ) + (a2 − a1 + r`+1 − r2`+2 )
= a2 − a0 + 2r` − r2` − r2`+2 .
If δ` = 2r` − r2` − r2`+2 , we have
 < d(T u` , T v` ) < m(u` , v` ) ≤  + δ` .
Since δ` → 0 as ` → ∞, we see that T does not satisfy (3.6) for  = a2 − a0 .
