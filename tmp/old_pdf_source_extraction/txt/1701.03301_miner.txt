Deﬁnition 1.1. The pseudo-sum of two ﬁlters F and G is deﬁned by letting for
every set A ⊆ N:

where A − n = {m ∈ N | m + n ∈ A} is the rightward shift of A by n.

A ∈ F ⊕ G ⇐⇒ {n | A − n ∈ G} ∈ F

***
Deﬁnition 1.2. An idempotent ultraﬁlter is an ultraﬁlter U which is idempotent
with respect to the pseudo-sum operation, i.e., U = U ⊕ U .

***
Deﬁnition 1.3. For ﬁlters F , G and ultraﬁlter V , let

F (V , G ) = {B ⊆ N | B ⊇ F ∩ AV for some F ∈ F and some A ∈ G}.

***
Proposition 1.4. [ZF] Let F be a ﬁlter, and let V be an ultraﬁlter. Then for
every ﬁlter G ⊇ F ⊕ V , the family F (V , G ) is a ﬁlter such that F ⊆ F (V , G )
and G ⊆ F (V , G ) ⊕ V .

***
Corollary 1.5. [ZF] Let F be a ﬁlter, and let V , W be ultraﬁlters where W ⊇
F ⊕ V . Then for every ultraﬁlter U we have:
(1) If U ⊇ F (V , W ) then U ⊕ V = W ;
(2) If U ⊕ V = W and F ⊆ U then F (V , W ) ⊆ U .

***
Corollary 1.6. [ZF+UT(N)] Let F be a ﬁlter and let V , W be ultraﬁlters. Then
W ⊇ F ⊕ V if and only if W = U ⊕ V for some ultraﬁlter U ⊇ F .

***
Deﬁnition 2.1. A ﬁlter F is additive if for every ultraﬁlter V ⊇ F , the pseudo-
sum F ⊕ V ⊇ F ; that is, AV ∈ F for every A ∈ F .

***

Remark 2.2. In 1989, T. Papazyan [16] considered the almost translation invariant
ﬁlters F such that F ⊆ F ⊕ F , and showed that every maximal ﬁlter in that
class is necessarily an ultraﬁlter, and hence an idempotent ultraﬁlter. We remark
that almost translation invariance is a stronger notion with respect to addivity;
indeed, it is straightforwardly seen that any almost translation invariant ﬁlter is
additive, but not conversely. (For the latter assertion, see Example 3.9 in the next
section.) That same class of ﬁlters, named idempotent ﬁlters, has been thoroughly
investigated by P. Krautzberger in [15].

***
Example 2.3. Given an inﬁnite set X = {x1 < x2 < . . .}, denote by

FS X = {A ⊆ N | A ⊇ FS(X \ F ) for some ﬁnite F ⊂ X} .

Clearly, FS X is a ﬁlter that contains FS(X). It just takes a quick check to verify
that FS X ⊆ FS X ⊕ FS X , and hence FS X is additive.

***
Proposition 2.4. [ZF+UT(N)] A ﬁlter F is additive if and only if F ⊆ U ⊕ V
for every pair of ultraﬁlters U , V ⊇ F .

***
Remark 2.5. If C is a nonempty closed sub-semigroup of (βN,⊕) then

(cid:92)

Fil(C) =

U

U ∈C

is an additive ﬁlter. To show this, notice ﬁrst that if V ⊇ Fil(C) is an ultraﬁlter,
then V ∈ C = C. So, for all ultraﬁlters V , V (cid:48) ⊇ Fil(C) one has that V ⊕ V (cid:48) ∈ C
by the property of sub-semigroup, and hence V ⊕ V (cid:48) ⊇ Fil(C). Conversely, if F is
an additive ﬁlter, then UT(N) implies that

Cl(F ) = {U ∈ βN | U ⊇ F}

is a nonempty closed sub-semigroup. Moreover, the two operations are one the
inverse of the other, since Cl(Fil(C)) = C and Fil(Cl(F )) = F for every nonempty
closed sub-semigroup C and for every additive ﬁlter F .

***

Remark 2.10. As already pointed out in the introduction, with the only exception
of [16], the only known proof of existence of idempotent ultraﬁlters is grounded on
Ellis-Numakura’s Lemma, a general result in semigroup theory that establishes the
existence of idempotent elements in every compact right-topological semigroups.
An alternate argument to prove the above Theorem 2.9
can be obtained by
same pattern. Indeed, given an additive ﬁlter F , by Remark 2.5 we know that
C = Cl(F ) is a closed nonempty sub-semigroup of the compact right-topological
semigroup (βN,⊕).
In consequence, (C,⊕) is itself a compact right-topological
semigroup, so Ellis-Numakura’s Lemma applies, and one gets the existence of an
idempotent element U ∈ C; clearly, U ⊇ F .

Proposition 3.1. [ZF] Assume there exists a choice function Φ that associates
to every additive ﬁlter F an ultraﬁlter Φ(F ) ⊇ F . Then there exists a choice
function Ψ that associates to every additive ﬁlter F an ultraﬁlter Ψ(F ) ⊇ F such
that Ψ(F ) ⊇ F ⊕ Ψ(F ).

Theorem 3.2. [ZF] Assume there exists a choice function Φ that associates to every
additive ﬁlter F an ultraﬁlter Φ(F ) ⊇ F . Then there exists a choice function Θ
that associates to every additive ﬁlter F an idempotent ultraﬁlter Θ(F ) ⊇ F .

***

Corollary 3.3. [ZF] Assume there exists a choice function Φ that associates to
every additive ﬁlter F an ultraﬁlter Φ(F ) ⊇ F . Then for every additively large
set A there exists an idempotent ultraﬁlter U where A ∈ U .

***
Proposition 3.4. [ZF+UT(R)] There exists a choice function Φ that associates to
every ﬁlter F on N an ultraﬁlter Φ(F ) ⊇ F .

***

Remark 3.5. In ZF, the property that “there exists a choice function Φ that
associates to every ﬁlter F on N an ultraﬁlter Φ(F ) ⊇ F ” is equivalent to the
property that “βN is compact and Loeb” (see [8, Proposition 1(ii)]). We remark
that the latter statement is strictly weaker than UT(R) in ZF (see [14, Theorem
10]).

***
Theorem 3.6. [ZF+UT(R)] Every additive ﬁlter can be extended to an idempotent
ultraﬁlter.

***
Remark 3.7. Since every idempotent ﬁlter F ⊆ F ⊕ F is readily seen to be
additive, as a straight corollary we obtain Paparyan’s result [16] that every maximal
idempotent ﬁlter is an idempotent ultraﬁlter.

***

Remark 3.8. The above Theorem 3.6 cannot be proved by ZF alone.
Indeed,
since the Fr´echet ﬁlter {A ⊆ N | N \ A is ﬁnite} is additive, one would obtain the
existence of a non-principal ultraﬁlter on N in ZF, against the well-known fact that
there exist models of ZF with no non-principal ultraﬁlters on N (see [13]).

***

Example 3.9. (ZF). The following family is an additive ﬁlter which is not
idempotent:

F = {A ⊆ N | Ac is not FAL}.

Since the ﬁnite intersection B =(cid:84){Ac − s | s ∈ FS({xi}n

First of all, the dual family F is a ﬁlter because the family of FAL sets is partition
regular. Recall that the latter property is a consequence of Folkman’s Theorem in
its ﬁnite version: “For every n and for every r there exists N such that for every
r-coloring {1, . . . , N} = C1 ∪ . . . ∪ Cr there exists a set S of cardinality n with
FS(S) monochromatic.” (For a ZF-proof of Folkman’s Theorem, see [6, Theorem
11, Lemma 12], pp. 81–82.)
In order to show that F is additive, ﬁx any ultraﬁlter V ⊇ F ; we want to see
that F ⊆ F ⊕ V . Notice that every B ∈ V is FAL, as otherwise Bc ∈ F ⊆ V
and we would have ∅ = B ∩ Bc ∈ V . By the deﬁnitions, if A /∈ F ⊕ V then
AV = {n | A − n ∈ V } (cid:54)∈ F , i.e., (AV )c = {n | Ac − n ∈ V } is FAL. Then for
every n there exist x1 < . . . < xn such that Ac − s ∈ V for every s ∈ FS({xi}n
i=1).
i=1)} also belongs to V ,
we can pick y1 < . . . < yn where y1 > x1 + . . . + xn such that FS({yi}n
i=1) ⊆ B. It
i=1) ⊆ Ac.
is readily veriﬁed that x1 + y1 < . . . < xn + yn and that FS({xi + yi}n
This shows that Ac is FAL, and hence A (cid:54)∈ F .
Let us now check that the ﬁlter F is not idempotent. To this end, we need some
preliminary work. Denote by N0 = N ∪ {0}, and let ψ : Fin(N0) → N0 be the
i∈F 2i for F (cid:54)= ∅ and ψ(∅) = 0. Notice that ψ(F ) +
ψ(G) = ψ(F(cid:52)G)+2·ψ(F ∩G), and also observe that for every H one has 2·ψ(H) =
ψ(1 + H) where 1 + H = {1 + h | h ∈ H}. In consequence, if E is the set of even
natural numbers, the following property is easily checked:

bijection where ψ(F ) = (cid:80)

((cid:63)) Let F, G ∈ Fin(E). Then ψ(F ) + ψ(G) = ψ(H) for some H ∈ Fin(E) if

and only if F ∩ G = ∅ and F ∪ G = H.

Now ﬁx a partition E =(cid:83)

inﬁnite sets, and deﬁne

n∈N0

X = (cid:8)ψ(F ∪ G) | ∅ (cid:54)= F ∈ Fin(A0) & ∅ (cid:54)= G ∈ Fin(Aψ(F ))(cid:9) .

An of the even natural numbers into inﬁnitely many

We will see that X c ∈ F and X c /∈ F ⊕ F , thus showing that F (cid:54)⊆ F ⊕ F .
The ﬁrst property follows from the fact that there are no triples a, b, a + b ∈ X, and
hence X is not FAL. To see this, assume by contradiction that ψ(F1 ∪ G1) + ψ(F2 ∪
G2) = ψ(F3∪G3) for suitable nonempty F1, F2, F3 ∈ Fin(A0) and Gi ∈ Fin(Aψ(Fi)).
By the above property ((cid:63)), it follows that (F1 ∪ G1) ∩ (F2 ∪ G2) = ∅, and hence
F1∩ F2 = ∅; moreover, (F1∪ G1)∪ (F2∪ G2) = F3∪ G3, and hence F1∪ F2 = F3 and
G1 ∪ G2 = G3. This is not possible because F1 ∩ F2 = ∅ implies that F1, F2 (cid:54)= F3,
and so (G1 ∪ G2) ∩ G3 = ∅.
By the deﬁnitions, X c (cid:54)∈ F ⊕ F if and only if Ξ = {n | X c − n ∈ F} (cid:54)∈ F
if and only if Ξc = {n | X − n is FAL} is FAL, and this last property is true.
Indeed, for every nonempty F ∈ Fin(A0) and for every nonempty G ∈ Fin(Aψ(F )),
we have that F ∩ G = ∅ and so ψ(F ∪ G) = ψ(F ) + ψ(G). In consequence, the
set X − ψ(F ) ⊇ {ψ(G) | ∅ (cid:54)= G ∈ Fin(Aψ(F ))} = FS(Aψ(F )) is additively large,
and hence FAL. But then also Ξc ⊇ {ψ(F ) | ∅ (cid:54)= F ∈ Fin(A0)} = FS(A0) is FAL
because it is additively large, as desired.

Remark 3.10. The above example is fairly related to Example 2.8 found in P.
Krautzberger’s thesis [15]; however there are relevant diﬀerences. Most notably,
besides the fact that diﬀerent semigroups are considered, our example is carried
within ZF, whereas the proof in [15] requires certain weak forms of the axiom of
choice. Let us see in more detail.
In [15] one ﬁrst considers a partial semigroup (F,·) on the family F of ﬁnite subsets
of N where the partial operation is deﬁned by means of disjoint unions, and then the
corresponding semigroup of ultraﬁlters (δF,·) where δF is a suitable closed subspace
of βF. (See [15, Deﬁnition 1.4] for details.) By Graham-Rothschild parameter-sets
Theorem [5], the family of sets that contain arbitrarily large ﬁnite union sets10 is
partition regular, and so the following closed set is nonempty:

H = {U ∈ δF | (∀A ∈ U )(∀n ∈ N)(∃x1 < . . . < xn) FU({xi}n

i=1) ⊆ A}.

(Notice that UT(N) suﬃces to prove H (cid:54)= ∅; indeed, any ultraﬁlter on F extending
the ﬁlter {A ⊆ F | Ac does not contain arbitrarily large union sets} is in H.) It is
then shown that H is a sub-semigroup and that the ﬁlter

(cid:92){U | U ∈ H}

H = Fil(H) =

is not idempotent. This last property is proved by showing the existence of an
injective sequence of ultraﬁlters (cid:104)Un | n ∈ N(cid:105) in H whose limit U -limn(n+Un) /∈ H
for a suitable U ∈ H; notice that here countably many choices are made.11
It is well-known that partition regularity results about ﬁnite unions can be (almost)
directly translated into partition regularity results about ﬁnite sums, and conversely
(see, e.g., [6, Theorem 13] and [12, pp.113-114]). Along these lines, our Example
3.9 can be seen as a translation of the above example to (βN,⊕). We remark
that, besides some non-trivial adjustments, we paid attention not to use any form
of choice; to this end, we directly considered the dual ﬁlter
F = {A ⊆ N | Ac is not FAL}.

instead of the corresponding closed sub-semigroup {U ∈ βN |
U )(A is FAL)}.

Remark 4.4. A detailed investigation of the strength of Ellis-Numakura’s Lemma
in the hierarchy of weak choice principles is found in [17]. In particular, in that
paper it is shown that either one of the Axiom of Multiple Choice MC or the
Ultraﬁlter Theorem UT (in its equivalent formulation given by the Boolean Prime
Ideal Theorem BPI) suﬃces to prove Ellis-Numakura’s Lemma.12 (The key point of
the proof is the fact that both MC and UT imply the existence of a choice function
for the family of nonempty closed sub-semigroups of any compact right topological
semigroup.) Recall that, as pointed out in Remark 2.5 , under the assumption of
UT(N) (or of MC, since MC ⇒ UT(N)), nonempty closed sub-semigroups of (βN,⊕)
exactly correspond to additive ﬁlters, and so one obtains that either one of MC or
UT implies that every additive ﬁlter on N is extended to an idempotent ultraﬁlter.
