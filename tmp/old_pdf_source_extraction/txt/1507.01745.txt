Example 2.1. For a small category C, we define a partition S by S = {{f }}f ∈mor(C) ;
that is, all morphisms have pairwise different colors. Then we see that K(C) :=
(C, S) is a schemoid. It is called a discrete schemoid. Observe that the Bose-Mesner
algebra is the category algebra of the underlying category C.

***
Example 2.2. For an association scheme (X, S), we define a quasi-schemoid (X, S)
by the pair (C, V ) for which ob(C) = X, HomC (y, x) = {(x, y)} ⊂ X ×X and V = S,
where the composite of morphisms (z, x) and (x, y) is defined by (z, x) ◦ (x, y) =
(z, y). It follows that the Bose-Mesner algebra is nothing but the original adjacency
algebra of the association scheme; see [11, Example 2.6 (i)].

***
Definition 2.3. Let F, G : (C, S) → (D, S 0 ) be morphisms between the schemoids
(C, S) and (D, S 0 ) in qASmd. We write H : F ⇒ G if H is a morphism from (C, S)×I
to (D, S 0 ) in qASmd with H ◦ ε0 = F and H ◦ ε1 = G. Here (C, S) × I denotes
the product of the quasi-schemoids and εi : (C, S) → (C, S) × I is the morphism of
quasi-schemoids defined by εi (a) = (a, i) for an object a in C and εi (f ) = (f, 1i ) for
a morphism f in C. We call the morphism H above a homotopy from F to G. A
morphism F is equivalent to G, denoted F ∼ G, if there exists a homotopy from F
to G or that from G to F .

Theorem 2.4. (See Theorem 3.5 for a more precise version.) Let (C, S) be a tame
schemoid. Then the functor category T (C,S) is equivalent to the module category
R(C, S)-Mod if the set {idx }x∈obC / ∼S is finite and every structure constant is less
than or equal to 1.

***
Definition 2.5. Schemoids (C, SC ) and (C 0 , SC 0 ) are Morita equivalent if the functor

Theorem 2.6. Let (D, S 0 ) be a tame schemoid and u : (C, S) → (D, S 0 ) a morphism

(relative) schemoid cohomology of u with coefficients in M is defined by
u

H ∗ ((C, S) → (D, S 0 ); M ) = H ∗ (u; M ) := Ext∗T (D,S) (R, Ranu M ).

Theorem 2.8. With the above notation, suppose further that ob([D]) is finite.
Then there is a cofibrantly generated model category structure on Ch(T (C,S) ) in
which the weak equivalences are the maps that Ranu takes into weak equivalences

Remark 2.9. Let A be the category of (unbounded) chain complexes of left Rmodules, where R is a ring. When we consider the projective model structure on

***
Remark 3.1. It follows from the proof of [11, Lemma 4.2] that the condition T(ii)
necessarily holds for a unital schemoid. We recall the argument for the reader.
Suppose that f, g ∈ σ, s(f ) ∈ τ1 and s(g) ∈ τ10 . Then pστ1 σ ≥ 1 because f is indeed
in πτ−1
(f ). Then there exists u ∈ τ1 and h ∈ σ such that u ◦ h = g. If (C, S) is
1σ
unital, we see that u = ids(g) and hence τ10 = τ1 . The same argument as in above
yields that there is an element τ2 such that idt(f ) , idt(g) ∈ τ2 .

Theorem 3.5. Let (C, S) be a tame schemoid. The category T (C,S) is embedded

Proposition 3.6. Let G be a groupoid. Then the associated schemoid S(G)

Remark 3.7. The result [11, Lemma 4.4] implies that a semi-thin schemoid is tame;
see [11, Definition 4.1] for the definition of a semi-thin schemoid. Moreover, for

a semi-thin schemoid (C, S), the groupoid R(C,

(C, SC ) and natural isomorphisms uw ⇒ 1 and wu ⇒ 1 which preserve the
partition of identities and so do the inverses. Then (C, SC ) and (C 0 , SC 0 ) are Morita
equivalent.

***
Remark 3.9. Let (C, S) be a schemoid with mor(C) finite. Suppose that the
schemoid (C, S) satisfies the condition T(i) and hence T(ii). For example, a
schemoid arising from an association schemes is such one. We define a small Rlinear category R-[C] by ob(R-[C]) = ob([C]) and
HomR-[C] ([x], [y]) := RhHom[C] ([x], [y])i,
namely the free R-module generated by the set Hom[C] ([x], [y]). For morphisms
σ ∈ Hom[C] ([y], [z]) and τ ∈ Hom[C] ([x], [y]), the composite σ ◦ τ of the morphisms
P
is defined to be µ pµστ µ. Let T R-[C] be the functor category of additive functors
from R-[C] to T . We define a pair (θ, η) of functors
/ R(C, S)-Mod : η ,
θ : T R-[C] o
L
which is so-called Mitchell’s correspondence, by θ(F ) =
[x]∈ob([C]) F ([x]) and
η(M )([x]) = [idx ]M . It is readily seen that θ is an embedding with left inverse η.
Moreover, we see that θ is an equivalence with inverse η if ob([C]) is finite. Observe
that T R-[C] is not functorial with respect to morphisms in qASmd in general; see
[11, Section 6] and [6, Section 6].

Lemma 3.11. Let (D, S 0 ) be a tame schemoid and u : (C, S) → (D, S 0 ) a morphism
of schemoids. Suppose that one of modules N and M in T (C,S) is in the image of
0
the functor u∗ : T (D,S ) → T (C,S) . Then the Hom-set T (C,S) (M, N ) coincides with
T C (M, N ).

***
Remark 3.12. Let v : (D, S 0 ) → (C, S) be a morphism of schemoids. The same
argument as in the proof of Theorem 2.6 does not work well in showing the existence
0
of the left/right adjoint of the restriction functor v ∗ : T (C,S) → T (D,S ) in general
even if (D, S 0 ) is tame. Indeed, suppose that idc ∼S id0c . We claim that Lanv N (c) =
0
Lanv N (c0 ) for any N in T (D,S ) . Recall the left adjoint Lanv : T D → T C is defined
by
Z d∈D
Lanv N (c) =
C(v(d), c) · N (d)
for N in T D and c ∈ C; see [12, X]. There is no relation between the hom-sets
C(v(d), c) and C(v(d), c0 ) in general.

***
Example 4.1. Let G be a group and H a subgroup. Let G/H denote the groupcase association scheme whose underlying set is the homogeneous one G/H. By
considering a normal subgroup N containing H, we have a natural map u : G/H →
G/N . Then G/N is a group and hence a tame schemoid. Therefore, for a functor
u
M ∈ T (G/H) , schemoid cohomology H ∗ (G/H → G/N ; M ) is isomorphic to group
∗
cohomology of the form H (G/N ; Ranu M ).

***
Example 4.2. Let L be a simplicial complex and N is a category whose objects
are non-negative integers and which has the one arrow i → j if and only if i ≤ j.
The length of the arrow i → j is defined to be the difference j − i. In the category
N , lengths of arrows give a partition len of the set of morphisms (arrows). Then
we see that (N , len) is a tame schemoid whose structure constants are less than or
equal to 1. Moreover, the Bose-Mesner algebra of this schemoid is isomorphic to
the polynomial algebra R[σ1 ].
We have a morphism u : (P (L), S) → (N , len) of schemoids by ”collapsing” the
Hasse diagram of the face poset of L, where (P (L), S) is the schemoid associated
with L; see Remark 6.2 . Thus the schemoid cohomolgoly of the morphism u is
considered by using the Koszul resolution of the constant functor R as a R[σ1 ]module. In fact, we have
u
(R, Ranu M )
H ∗ (P (L) → (N , len); M ) ∼
= Ext∗
R[σ1 ]

∼
= H(Hom(∧(s−1 σ1 ), ΨRanπ◦u M ); δ)
for any M ∈ T (P (L),S) ; see Remark 2.9 . It follows that the differential δ is defined
by δ(f )(s−1 σ1 ) = σ1 f (1).
Let n be the number of vertices of a simplicial complex L. Then we define a
morphism v : (P (L), S) → (N , len)×n of schemoids by v(φ) = (0, ...., 0) and v(xi ) =
(0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0), where 1 appears in the ith entry. Then the morphism v also
defines schemoid cohomology H ∗ (v; M ).

***
Proposition 4.3. Let H(n, 2) be the Hamming scheme of binary codes with length
n. More precisely, H(n, 2) = ({0, 1}×n , {T0 , T1 , ..., Tn }), where Ti denotes the set
e
of the pair of words with the Hamming metric i. Then schemoids S(Z/2)
and
e
(H(n, 2)) are Morita equivalent; see Section ?? for the functor S( ).

***
Remark 4.4. In the observation above, we see that the morphism v of schemoids is
an equivalence on the underlying categories with u its inverse. In fact, for example,
a natural isomorphism η : uv ⇒ 1 on (H(n, 2)) is determined uniquely with the
condition that η11 : 00 = uv(11) → 11 and η00 : 00 = uv(00) → 00 because
an association scheme is regarded as a complete graph. However, since η00 ∈ T0 ,
η11 ∈ T2 and id00 ∼S id11 , it follows that η does not preserve the partition. Thus
Proposition 3.8 is not applicable to this case.
Observe that an association scheme has an initial object if we consider it a category
with the functor  : AS → qASmd and the forgetful functor U : qASmd → Cat
described in Section ??. Therefore, each association scheme is equivalent to the
trivial category as a category.

***
Remark 4.5. (i) The category T (H(2,2)) is not equivalent to the module category
R((H(2, 2)))-Mod. Suppose that the categories are equivalent. Then the Bosee
Mesner algebras R((H(2, 2))) and RS(Z/2)
= R(Z/2) are Morita equivalent.
e
(H(2,2))
In fact, we see that R((H(2, 2)))-Mod ' T
' T S(Z/2) ' R(Z/2)-Mod.
The third equivalence follows from Theorem 3.5 . The algebra R((H(2, 2))) is
commutative and a free R-module of rank 3. On the other hand, the group ring
R(Z/2) is of rank 2 and commutative. Then the 0th Hochschild homology groups
of the two algebras are different from each other, which is a contradiction.
e
(ii) The underlying categories of the schemoids S(Z/4)
and KU ((H(2, 2))) are
the same as that of (H(2, 2)). However, Theorem 3.5 enables us to deduce
e
that the category T S(Z/4) is equivalent to the module category R(Z/4)-Mod. The
category T KU ((H(2,2))) is equivalent to T . In fact, T KU ((H(2,2))) is isomorphic
to the functor category T U ((H(2,2))) because KU ((H(2, 2))) is tame. Moreover,
e
the small category U ((H(2, 2))) is a groupoid with initial object. Then S(Z/4),
(H(2, 2)) and KU ((H(2, 2))) are not Morita equivalent one another.

Let w : (C1 , S1 ) → (D, S 0 ) be a morphism of schemoids, which induces a Morita
equivalence between the schemoids. We define a functor e

is a sheaf in T (OpenX ,SX ) . Then F (∅) = 0. For any open set U , idU : U → U
and ∅ → ∅ are contained in a common σ ∈ SX . This enables us to conclude that
F (id∅ ) = F (idU ) : F (U ) = F (∅) → F (∅) = F (U ). We have F (U ) = 0. Therefore,
F is nothing but the constant sheaf 0.
