Theorem 1. [CH] There is a T3 space X that has countable strong fan tightness
at each x ∈ X, yet ONE has a winning strategy in G1(Ωx, Ωx) at each x ∈ X.

Lemma 2. Let (X, τ ) be a T1-space with no isolated points. Assume that player
ONE has a winning strategy in the game G1(D, ND) on X. Then at each x ∈ X
ONE has a winning strategy in the game G1(Ωx, Ωx).
