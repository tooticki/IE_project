Abstract
A locally conformally K¨ahler (LCK) manifold is a complex

manifold, with a K¨ahler structure on its covering (cid:102)M , with
the deck transform group acting on (cid:102)M by holomorphic

homotheties. One could think of an LCK manifold as
of a complex manifold with a K¨ahler form taking values
in a local system L, called the conformal weight
bundle. The L-valued cohomology of M is called Morse-
Novikov cohomology; it was conjectured that (just as it
happens for K¨ahler manifolds) the Morse-Novikov complex
satisﬁes the ddc-lemma, which (if true) would have far-
reaching consequences for the geometry of LCK manifolds.
In particular, this version of ddc-lemma would imply
existence of LCK potential on any LCK manifold with
vanishing Morse-Novikov class of its L-valued Hermitian
symplectic form. The ddc-conjecture was disproved for
Vaisman manifolds by R. Goto. We prove that ddc-lemma
is true with coeﬃcients in a suﬃciently general power of
L on any Vaisman manifold or LCK with potential.

1.1 LCK manifolds and dθdc

θ-lemma

A locally conformally K¨ahler (LCK) manifold is a complex manifold which

admits a K¨ahler metric on its universal covering(cid:102)M such that the monodromy
acts on (cid:102)M by K¨ahler homotheties. For more details and the reference on

this subject, please see Section 2.
The LCK property is equivalent to existence of a Hermitian form ω on
M satisfying dω = ω ∧ θ, where θ is a closed 1-form. This form is called the
Lee form of an LCK-manifold.

One can consider the K¨ahler form on (cid:102)M as a K¨ahler form on M taking

values in a 1-dimensional local system, or, equivalently, in a ﬂat line bundle
L. This bundle is called the weight bundle of M .

The cohomology of this local system is known as the Morse-Novikov
cohomology of an LCK manifold. In locally conformally K¨ahler geometry,
the Morse-Novikov cohomology shares many properties of the Hodge decomposition
with the usual cohomology of the complex manifolds. The locally conformally
K¨ahler form represents a cohomology class (called the Morse-Novikov class)
of an LCK manifold, encoding the topological properties of an LCK structure.
However, the ddc-lemma, which plays a crucial role for the K¨ahler geometry,
is invalid in the Morse-Novikov setting. The main question of the locally
conformally K¨ahler geometry is to ﬁnd a replacement of the ddc-lemma
which would allow one to study the interaction between the complex geometry
and the topology of a manifold.

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

The statement of the ddc-lemma seems, on the ﬁrst sight, to be technical.
It says that on any compact K¨ahler manifold (M, I), one has im d∩ ker dc =
im ddc, where dc = IdI−1 is the twisted de Rham diﬀerential. However, it
is used as a crucial step in the proof of the degeneration of the Dolbeault-
Fr¨olicher spectral sequence, and in the proof of homotopy formality of K¨ahler
manifolds.
For an LCK manifold, one replaces the de Rham diﬀerential by its Morse-
Novikov counterpart dθ := d − θ, where θ is the connection form of its
θ = IdθI−1.
weight bundle; the twisted de Rham diﬀerential is replaced by dc
It was conjectured in [OV1] that the dθdc
θ-lemma would hold on any LCK
manifold, giving im dθ ∩ ker dc
θ = im dθdc
θ. The implication of the dθdc
θ-
lemma would include the topological classiﬁcation of LCK structures on
some manifolds (such as nilmanifolds) and a construction of automorphic
K¨ahler potentials on LCK manifolds with vanishing Morse-Novikov class.
However, this conjecture was false, as shown by R. Goto ([G]).

1.2 Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology

When the dθdc

θ-lemma is false, one needs to study a more delicate cohomological

H p,q

BC(M, L) :=

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Λp,q (M )

.

In [G], Goto has shown that the Bott-Chern cohomology group is responsible
for the deformational properties of an LCK manifold, and computed it for
certain (p, q) and certain examples of LCK manifolds, called the Vaisman
manifolds (see Subsection 2.2).

Deﬁnition 1.1. The local system L associated to a LCK manifold M is a
real, oriented line bundle over M with a ﬂat connection. Trivializing this
bundle, we can write its connection as ∇L = d − θ, where θ is the Lee form
of our LCK manifold. For arbitrary a ∈ C, the connection ∇La := d − aθ is
also ﬂat. For a ∈ Z, the corresponding line bundle is identiﬁed with the a-th
tensor power of L, denoted as La. One may think of the ﬂat line bundle
(L,∇La) as of a real (or complex) power of L. We denote this line bundle
and its local system by La, and call it a-th power of a weight bundle.

In this paper we compute the weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for La,
on LCK manifolds with proper potential, and show that it vanishes for all
a outside of a discrete countable subset of R (Corollary 4.2). This implies

ddc-lemma for forms with coeﬃcients in La, for these values of a. This result
is based on a computation of Dolbeault cohomology with coeﬃcients in La,
which also vanishes for all a but a discrete countable subset (Theorem 3.2).

1.3 LCK manifolds with potential

Deﬁnition 1.2. A compact LCK manifold (M, ω, θ) is called LCK with
potential if ω = dθdc
θψ for a positive function ψ which is called LCK
potential.

An equivalent deﬁnition will be given in Subsection 2.3.
LCK manifolds with potential are understood very well now. The following
results were proven in [OV2] and [OV3] (see also [OV6]). Recall that a
linear Hopf manifold is a quotient of Cn\0 by a Z-action generated by a
linear map with all eigenvalues |αi| > 1.

Theorem 1.3. Let M be a compact complex manifold. Then M admits
an LCK metric with potential if and only if M admits an embedding to a
linear Hopf manifold.

Theorem 1.4. Let M be an LCK manifold with potential. Then M is
a deformation of a Vaisman manifold (Deﬁnition 2.2). In particular, M is
diﬀeomorphic to a principal S1 × S1-bundle over a projective orbifold.

It would be nice to have a topological characterization of LCK manifolds
with potential. Since [OV1], we were extending much eﬀort trying to prove
the following conjecture, which has many geometric consequences.

Conjecture 1.5. Let (M, ω, θ) be a compact LCK manifold. Assume that
ω is dθ-exact. Then ω is dθdc

θ-exact, that is, M is a LCK with potential.

This conjecture is still open. It would trivially follow if the dθdc

θ-lemma
were true, but it is known now to be false. However, a weaker conjecture
still stands.

Conjecture 1.6. Let (M, ω, θ) be a compact LCK manifold, L its weight
bundle, and La the weight bundle to the power of a ∈ R (Deﬁnition 1.1).
Then, for all a outside of a discrete countable set, daθdc
aθ-lemma is true: for
any daθ-exact (1,1)-form η, one has η = daθdc
aθf (but this does not imply
that the daθdc

aθ-lemma is true for other bidegrees).

In this paper, we prove that Conjecture 1.6 is true for LCK manifolds
with proper potential (Corollary 4.2). This is done by ﬁrst proving a generic
vanishing result for weighted Dolbeault cohomology (Theorem 3.2).

2 Locally conformally K¨ahler geometry

In this section we give the necessary deﬁnitions and properties of locally
conformally K¨ahler (LCK) manifolds.

2.1 LCK manifolds

Deﬁnition 2.1. A complex manifold (M, I) is LCK if it admits a K¨ahler

covering ((cid:102)M ,(cid:101)ω), such that the covering group acts by holomorphic homotheties.

Equivalently, there exists on M a closed 1-form θ, called the Lee form,

such that ω satisﬁes the integrability condition:

dω = θ ∧ ω.

Clearly, the metric g := ω(·, I·) on M is locally conformal to some K¨ahler
metrics and its lift to the K¨ahler cover in the deﬁnition is globally conformal
To an LCK manifold one associates the weight bundle LR −→ M . It is

to the K¨ahler metric corresponding to (cid:101)ω.

a real line bundle associated to the representation1
GL(2n, R) (cid:51) A (cid:55)→| det A | 1
n .

The Lee form induces a connection in LR by the formula ∇ = d − θ. ∇ is
associated to the Weyl covariant derivative (also denoted ∇) determined on
M by the LCK metric and the Lee form. As dθ = 0, then ∇2 = dθ = 0, and
hence LR is ﬂat.

The complexiﬁcation of the weight bundle will be denoted by L. The
Weyl connection extends naturally to L and its (0, 1)-part endows L with a
holomorphic structure.

1In conformal geometry, the weight bundle usually corresponds to | det A | 1

2n . For

LCK-geometry, | det A | 1

n is much more convenient.

2.2 Vaisman manifolds
Deﬁnition 2.2. A Vaisman manifold is an LCK manifold with ∇g-parallel
Lee form, where ∇g is the Levi-Civita connection.

The following deﬁnition is implicit in the work of Boyer & Galicki, see

[BG]:

Deﬁnition 2.3. A Sasakian manifold is an odd-dimensional contact manifold
S such that its symplectic cone CS is equipped with a K¨ahler structure,
compatible with its symplectic structure, and the standard symplectic homothety
map ρt : CS −→ CS is holomorphic.

Compact Vaisman manifolds can be described in terms of Sasakian geometry

as follows.

Theorem 2.4. Let (M, I, g) be a compact Vaisman manifold. Then M
admits a conic K¨ahler covering (W × R+, t2gW + dt2) such that the covering
group is an inﬁnite cyclic group, generated by the transformation (w, t) (cid:55)→
(ϕ(w), qt) for some Sasakian automorphism ϕ and q ∈ Z.

The typical example of a compact Vaisman manifold is the diagonal
Hopf manifold HA := Cn/(cid:104)A(cid:105) with A = diag(αi), with |αi| < 1. An explicit
construction of the Vaisman metric on HA is given in [OV5]. Other Vaisman
metrics appear on compact complex surfaces, [Be].

Among the LCK manifolds which do not admit Vaisman metrics are
some of the Inoue surfaces (cf. [Tr], [Be]) and their generalizations to higher
dimensions ([OT]). The rank 0 Hopf surfaces are also non-Vaisman ([GO]).

2.3 LCK manifolds with potential

Deﬁnition 2.5. ([OV2]) A compact complex manifold (M, I) is LCK with

potential if it admits a K¨ahler cover ((cid:102)M ,(cid:101)ω) with global potential ϕ : (cid:102)M →

R+, such that and the monodromy map τ acts on ϕ by multiplication with
a constant: τ (ϕ) = const·ϕ.

If ϕ is proper (inverse images of compact sets are compact), then (M, I)

is called LCK with proper potential.

Remark 2.6.

version 2.0, 5.04.2017

L. Ornea, M. Verbitsky, V. Vuletescu

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

In [OV2, Proposition 2.5] (see also [OV6]) it was proven that ϕ is proper
if and only if the monodromy of the weight bundle is discrete in R+, that
is, isomorphic to Z.

Vaisman manifolds are LCK with potential (the potential is equal to the
squared norm of the Lee ﬁeld), which can be easily seen from the Sasakian
description given above ([Ve1]). LCK metrics with potential are in one to
one correspondence with strongly pseudoconvex shells in aﬃne cones, as
shown in [OV5].

We summarize the main properties of compact LCK manifolds with

potential:

Theorem 2.7.

(i) ([OV2]) The class of compact LCK manifolds with potential is stable to

small deformations.

(ii) ([OV3, Theorem 2.1]) Any LCK manifold with potential can be deformed
to a Vaisman manifold. Moreover, the set of points which correspond
to Vaisman manifolds is dense in the moduli of compact LCK manifolds
with potential

(iii) ([OV2]) Any compact LCK manifold with potential can be holomorphically

embedded into a Hopf manifold. Moreover, a compact Vaisman manifold
can be holomorphically embedded in a diagonal Hopf manifold.

2.4 Morse–Novikov complex and cohomology of local systems

Let M be a smooth manifold, and θ a closed 1-form on M . Denote by
dθ : Λi(M ) −→ Λi+1(M ) the map d − θ. Since dθ = 0, d2

θ = 0.

Consider the the Morse–Novikov complex, (see e.g. [P], [Ra], [Mi])

Λ0(M )

dθ−→ Λ1(M )

dθ−→ Λ2(M )

dθ−→ ···

Its cohomology is the Morse–Novikov cohomology of (M, θ).

In Jacobi and locally conformal symplectic geometry, this object is called

Lichnerowicz-Jacobi, or Lichnerowicz cohomology, motivated by Lichnerowicz’s
work [Li] on Jacobi manifolds (see e.g. [LLMP] and [B]).

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

Obviously, the ﬂat line bundle L can be viewed as a local system associated

with the character χ : π1(M ) −→ R>0 given by the exponential eθ ∈ H 1(M, R>0),
considered as an element of R>0-valued cohomology. Then we have:

Proposition 2.8. (see e.g.
[N]) The cohomology of the local system L
is naturally identiﬁed with the cohomology of the Morse–Novikov complex
(Λ∗(M ), dθ).

The following result was proven in [LLMP] and, with a diﬀerent method,

in [OV1]:

Theorem 2.9. The Morse–Novikov cohomology of a compact Vaisman
manifold vanishes identically.

On the other hand on one of the Inoue surfaces (which is LCK but non-

Vaisman) the Morse–Novikov class of ω is non–zero, see [B, Theorem 1].

Let M be an LCK manifold with proper potential, and (cid:102)M its Z-covering

brieﬂy explain below. Note that we could arrive at the same results by using

more involved.

Theorem 3.4. For any local Noetherian C−algebra R endowed with a

R−module N endowed also with a Z action tN which is tR-equivariant, i.e.

for all r ∈ R, m ∈ N,

the map tM − α is a C−linear isomorphism for all α ∈ C but a countable

The long exact sequence associated to (3.5) is precisely (3.4).

Let now M be a locally conformally K¨ahler manifold with K¨ahler covering
Lα be its power associated with the character α ∈ Hom(Γ, R). Since the

(cid:102)M and monodromy Γ ∼= Z. Consider the weight bundle L on M , and let
automorphic forms on (cid:102)M can be identiﬁed with forms on M with values in

L, from the above result we directly obtain:

Corollary 3.7. For a compact LCK manifold with monodromy Z one has
the exact sequence for the Dolbeault cohomology of M with values in Lα:

0 −→ H 0(M, Ωi

M ⊗ Lα) −→ H 0(cid:16)(cid:102)M , Ωi(cid:102)M
t−α−→ H 0(cid:16)(cid:102)M , Ωi(cid:102)M

(cid:17) t−α−→
(cid:17) −→ H 1(M, Ωi

(cid:81)

n(cid:62)0 tn. Then

Spec(t) =

Spec(tn)

Remark 3.8. Let (Vn, tn)n(cid:62)0 be a sequence of ﬁnite-dimensional vector
n(cid:62)0 Vn and t =

M ⊗ Lα) −→ ···

(cid:91)

n(cid:62)0

Here, for a C-vector space V and u ∈ End(V ), Spec(u) := {λ ∈ C ;

In particular, Spec(t) is at most countable.
u − λ · id is not an isomorphism}.

This implies the following:

Lemma 3.9. If (M, tm) is a ﬁnitely generated complete R−module which
is equivariant, then Spec(tM ) is at most countable.

Proof: Since M is complete we have

(cid:89)

n(cid:62)0

M =

mnM/mn+1M.

Since M is ﬁnitely generated, mnM/mn+1M is ﬁnite dimensional C-vector
space for all n (cid:62) 0, so Remark 3.8 applies.

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

Unfortunately, the cohomology modules H i

m(M ) are usually not ﬁnitely
generated, so we need to elaborate further, by ﬁrst reducing to the case of
regular rings, and then using local duality and the explicit description of the
injective hull of the residue ﬁeld.

First, since local cohomology does not change under completion (cf

[Hun], Prop. 2.15), we may assume that both R and M are complete.

Next, we reduce to the case when R is regular.
To do this, we choose a minimal system of generators for mR, m1, . . . , mn

and deﬁne a map

π : S = C[[X1, . . . , Xn]] −→ R,

by Xi (cid:55)→ mi, i = 1, n.
The action tR on R lifts to an action tS on S as follows. Choose lifts
si ∈ S of t(mi) for all i = 1, . . . , n, and deﬁne tS(Xi) = si. Note that tS is
well-deﬁned as a morphism of local C-algebras by [E, Theorem 7.16].

[Hun, Proposition 2.14 (2)], we have H i

So we can look at M as an equivariant S-module.
Also, the local cohomology is preserved, since mR = mSR and using
(M ) (cid:39) H i
m(M ) induced by tM and tR.

mS
Denote by ti the endomorphism of H i
By local duality ([Hun, Theorem 4.4]) we have:

(M ).

mR

m(M ) (cid:39) Extn−i
H i

R (M, R)∨ = HomR(Extn−i

R (M, R), E(k))

where E(k) is the injective hull of the residue ﬁeld.

For regular rings, the injective hull E(k) is described by Lyubeznik ([Ly]):

E(k) = D/mD
where D is the space of diﬀerential operators.
Notice that D has a direct sum decomposition of the form D = ⊕n(cid:62)0Dn
where Dn is the set of diﬀerential operators of order n with no lower-order
terms. Note that Dn is invariant under the map induced by tR and ﬁnitely
generated over R. So

(cid:77)

n(cid:62)0

E(k) =

E(k)n

where E(k)n = Dm/mDn and each E(k)n is equivariant and ﬁnitely generated
R−module. This gives a decomposition as follows:

m(M ) (cid:39)(cid:77)

H i

n(cid:62)0

But each factor HomR(Extn−i
R (M, R), E(k)n) is ﬁnitely generated over R so
Lemma 3.9 applies to it. Since there are countably many factors in the
above decomposition, we see Spec(ti) is countable.

Now Theorem 3.2 is completely proven.

3.4 Degeneration of the Dolbeault-Fr¨olicher spectral sequence

with coeﬃcients in a local system

The next result, interesting in itself, proves that on compact LCK manifolds
with proper potential, in the Dolbeault-Fr¨olicher spectral sequence with
coeﬃcients in a local system Lα,

Ep,q
1

:= H q(M, Ωp

M ⊗ Lα) ⇒ H p+q(M, Lα(C)),

2 = 0 (where Lα(C) denotes the local
all the terms vanish at E2 level: Ep,q
system associated to Lα). This parallels the degeneration of this spectral
sequence at E1 level for compact K¨ahler manifolds (where Lα is taken to be
trivial). In particular, this gives a new proof to Theorem 2.9 and produces
new examples of compact complex manifolds that do not carry LCK metrics
with potential. One of the approaches to ﬁnding such manifolds is due to S.
Rollenske ([Ro]), who showed that on a nilmanifold, the Dolbeault-Fr¨olicher
spectral sequence does not necessarily degenerate, and gave examples when
the n-th diﬀerential dn is non-zero, for arbitrarily high n.

Proposition 3.10. Let M be a compact LCK manifold with proper potential,
α ∈ Hom(Γ, R+) a positive character, and Lα the corresponding line bundle.
For any p, q, consider the map

∂p.q : H p(M, Ωq

M ⊗ Lα) −→ H p(M, Ωq+1

M ⊗ Lα).

Then ker ∂q,p+1 = im ∂q,p, for all p, q.

Proof: The monodromy map(cid:101)t on (cid:102)M is the exponential of a holomorphic

vector ﬁeld X. This is proven in [OV4, Theorem 2.3] using the embedding of
M in a Hopf manifold CN \ {0})/(cid:104)A(cid:105) where A is linear, with all eigenvalues
smaller than 1. The holomorphic vector ﬁeld is then X = log A.
In
particular:

(cid:101)t∗(η) = LieX η.

Let now [η] ∈ H p(M, Ωq+1

(q + 1, p)−form on (cid:102)M which is ∂-closed and automorphic of weight α.

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

Suppose η is also ∂-closed. Then, since(cid:101)t∗(η) = α · η, we obtain

α · η = LieX (η) = diX η + iX dη,

by Cartan’s formula.

But ∂(η) = ∂η = 0 by assumption, thus iX dη = 0, and we are left with:

α · η = ∂(iX η) + ∂(iX η).

As X is holomorphic, iX η is of type (q, p), and hence ∂(iX η) is of type
(q, p + 1). On the other hand both ∂iX (η) and α · η are of type (q + 1, p),
implying ∂(iX η) = 0 and

(cid:0) 1
α η(cid:1), and hence η ∈ im(∂q,p).

α · η = ∂(iX η).

This yields η = ∂iX

4 Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

with potential

We now generalize [OV1, Theorem 4.7]. We have:

Proposition 4.1. Let (M, I, g) be a compact LCK manifold. Then the
following sequence is exact for all α ∈ C but a discrete countable subset:
H q−1
where ν is the tautological map, ∂θ = ∂ − θ1,0 and ∂θ = ∂ − θ0,1.

Proof: We prove that im(∂θ + ∂θ) = ker ν. Let η be a (p, q)-form with
values in Lα whose class vanishes in the cohomology of the local system
Lα(C). Then η = dθβ. Suppose that β has only two Hodge components,
β = βp,q−1 + βp−1,q. Then η decomposes as η = ∂θβp,q−1 + ∂θβp−1,q. On the
other hand, as η is of bidegree (p, q), we have ∂θβp,q−1 = 0 and ∂θβp−1,q = 0,
and hence βp,q−1 and βp−1,q produce the cohomology classes in [βp−1,q] ∈
H q−1
M ⊗ Lα). Then [η]BC = ∂θ[βp−1,q] +
(Ωp
∂θ[βp,q−1].

It remains to reduce Proposition 4.1 to the case when β has only two
Hodge components. We may already assume that H p,q(Lα) = 0 for all p, q
(Theorem 3.2). We use induction by the number of Hodge components. Take
the outermost Hodge component of β, say, βp−d−1,q+d, with d > 0. Then

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

∂θ(βp−d−1,q+d) = 0, hence, by vanishing of the Dolbeault cohomology group
H p−d−1,q+d(Lα), we have βp−d−1,q+d = ∂θ(γ), where γ ∈ Λp−d−1,q−1+d(M, Lα)
is an Lα-valued (p − d − 1, q − 1 + d)-form. Now if we replace β by β − dθγ,
we obtain another form β(cid:48) such that η = dθβ(cid:48), and β(cid:48) has a smaller number
of Hodge components.

As compact LCK manifolds with potential are topologically equivalent
with Vaisman manifolds, Theorem 2.7 (ii), by Theorem 2.9 their cohomology
of the local system Lα(C) vanishes identically. Together with our main result
(Theorem 3.2), this proves the following generic vanishing of Bott-Chern
cohomology (we keep the notations in Section 3):
Corollary 4.2. Let M be an LCK manifold with proper potential, α ∈ C
and Lα the ﬂat line bundle corresponding to α · θ. Then H p,q
BC(M, Lα) = 0
for all α ∈ C but a discrete countable subset.

Remark 4.3. Note that H p,q
αθ-lemma at
the level (p, q), and hence our result says that, generically, a compact LCK
manifold with proper potential satisﬁes the dαθdc

BC(M, Lα) = 0 implies the dαθdc

αθ-lemma for all (p, q).
