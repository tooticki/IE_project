Theorem 1.1. Let R be a regular local ring. Let f ∈ R be an element in R such
that the Newton polyhedron NP(f ) has a loose edge E. Suppose that the initial form
inE (f ) of f along E is a product of two coprime polynomials G and H, where G is

not divided by any variable. Then there exist elements(cid:98)g,(cid:98)h ∈ (cid:98)R in the completion of
and inE1((cid:98)g) = G and inE2((cid:98)h) = H, for certain faces E1,E2 of dimension at most one

R such that

f =(cid:98)g ·(cid:98)h

in (cid:98)R

such that E = E1 + E2.

***
Corollary 1.2. Assume that the Newton polyhedron of f ∈ R has a loose edge and

at least three vertices. Then f is not irreducible in (cid:98)R.

***
Corollary 1.3. Assume that the Newton polyhedron of f ∈ R has a loose edge E.

If f is irreducible in (cid:98)R, then E is the only compact edge of NP(f ) and

inE (f ) =  · P k,

where  ∈ K× is a unit and P ∈ K[X1, . . . , Xn] is an irreducible polynomial.
Moreover, if the residue ﬁeld K is algebraically closed, P = X α + λX β, for some
λ ∈ K× and α − β ∈ Zn is a primitive lattice vector.

Theorem 1.4. Let f ∈ R[z]. Assume that the Newton polyhedron NP(f ) has a
descendant, loose edge E. If inE (f ) is a product of two coprime polynomials G, H ∈

K[X1, . . . , Xn, Z], where G is monic with respect to Z, then there exist (cid:98)g,(cid:98)h ∈ (cid:98)R[z]
where (cid:98)g ∈ (cid:98)R[z] is monic, inE1((cid:98)g) = G and inE2((cid:98)h) = H, for certain faces E1,E2 of

dimension at most one such that E = E1 + E2.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 be a F -subset of Rn≥0. A convex subset F ⊂ ∆ is
called a face of ∆ if there exists a linear form L such that

If L is positive, then F deﬁnes a compact face. A vertex of ∆ is a compact face
v ∈ ∆ of dimension zero. An edge of ∆ is a compact face E ⊂ ∆ of dimension one.

∆ ∩ ∆(L) = F.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let f =(cid:80)

A ρAxA ∈ R be as before. Let F ⊂ NP(f ) be a compact
face of the Newton polyhedron and let LF : Rn → R be a positive linear form
determining F. The initial form of f along F is deﬁned as the LF -initial form of f ,

inF (f ) := inLF (f ) ∈ grF (R) := grLF (R) ∼= K[X1, . . . , Xn].

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 be a F -subset of Rn≥0. A loose edge of ∆ is a compact
edge E ⊂ ∆ that is not contained in any compact face of ∆ of dimension ≥ 2.

***
Lemma 3.2. Let ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 be a F -subset with a loose edge E ⊂ ∆ that has ends
α, β ∈ Rn≥0. Let L : Rn → R be a linear form such that L(α) = L(β). For every
γ ∈ ∆, we have L(γ) ≥ L(α).

***
Example 3.3. Let ∆ ⊂ R3≥0 be the F -subset deﬁned given by the three vertices
α = (1, 0, 0), β = (0, 1, 0), and γ = (0, 0, 1). Consider the linear form L : R3 → R
with L(v1, v2, v3) = v1 + v2. Clearly, the edge E with ends α and β is not loose. We
observe that L(α) = L(β) = 1 > 0 = L(γ).

***
Lemma 3.4. Let ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 be a F -subset with a loose edge E ⊂ ∆ that has ends
α = (α1, . . . , αn), β = (β1, . . . , βn) ∈ Rn≥0. If min{α1, β1} = . . . = min{αn, βn} = 0,
then α and β are the only vertices of ∆.

Remark 3.5. The main result of [RS] uses the associated polyhedron

of a Weierstraß polynomial P = zd +(cid:80)

∆P := ∆(P ; x; z) ⊂ Rd≥0

(cid:110)

(A,b) ρA,bxAzb ∈ K[[x1, . . . , xn]][z], where
ρA,b ∈ K. Here, ∆P ⊂ Rn≥0 is the projection of the Newton polyhedron NP(P ) ⊂
Rn+1≥0
from the distinguished point (0, . . . , 0, d) onto the subspace determined by the
variables (x1, . . . , xn). In other words, ∆P is the smallest F -subset containing all
points of the set
. The interesting case in [RS] is when ∆P is
orthant. Then the unique vertex corresponds to a descendant edge of NP(P ) (that
is not necessarily loose).
The idea of projecting from the distinguished point corresponding to zd comes from
resolution of singularities and is used to provide reﬁned information on a given
singularity, see [H], [CP2], [CS], [S].

Setup 3.6. We ﬁx a F -subset ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 that has a loose edge E ⊂ ∆ with ends
α, β ∈ E. Let L : Rn → R be a positive linear form determining the edge E. We
deﬁne
Since α = (α1, . . . , αn) (cid:54)= β = (β1, . . . , βn), we may assume without loss of generality
βn < αn. This implies δn < 0. Note that L(δ) = L(β) − L(α) = 0 and hence there
exists at least one i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} such that δi > 0.
Further, let (R, m, K) be a regular local ring with regular system of parameters
(x1, . . . , xn). Recall that we denote the images of the latter in grL(R) by capital
letters (X1, . . . , Xn) and grL(R) ∼= K[X1, . . . , Xn].

Remark 3.8.

(1) The condition δn < 0 and δi > 0, for at least one i, (up
to reordering the coordinates) is equivalent to the property that the line
generated by δ does intersect Rn≥0 only in the origin, i.e., (δ·R)∩Rn≥0 = {0}.
This is essential to obtain that Iδ,w is a ﬁnite set.
(2) It is possible that prδ(v) ∈ Rn−1 \ Rn−1≥0 . For example, if we consider δ =
(−1, 1,−1) and v = (0, 0, a), then (prδ(v), 0) = v +a·δ = (−a, a, 0), for every
a ∈ R≥0. We observe that R2
δ has a non-compact face that is not parallel to
a coordinate axis:

(3) Suppose ∆,E, δ are as in Setup 3.6 . We have prδ(v) ∈ Rn−1≥0 , for all v ∈ Rn≥0

In particular, Rn−1

Deﬁnition 3.9. Let δ = (δ1, . . . , δn) ∈ Rn be any vector with δn < 0 and δi > 0,
for at least one i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}. A F -subset ∆ ⊂ Rn−1 is called δ-orthant if it is
of the form ∆ = w + Rn−1

δ + Rn−1≥0 , for a unique vertex w ∈ Rn−1.

***
Lemma 3.10. Let ∆,E, δ be as in Setup 3.6 . Since E is a loose edge, we obtain
that the projection ∆δ ⊂ Rn−1 is δ-orthant. In particular, if E is descendant, then
∆δ ⊂ Rn−1≥0

the left and δ not descendant on the right). The triangle on the right determined
by the dotted lines is a subset of {v ∈ R3 | L(v) = a}. As we see, there are v ∈ R3≥0

Lemma 3.12. Let ∆,E, L, δ, R be as in Setup 3.6 . Let u ∈ Rn−1 and w ∈ Mδ.

Thus, dim Sδ,3.5 = #Iδ,3.5 = 1, dim Sδ,6.5 = #Iδ,6.5 = 2, and dim Sδ,10 = #Iδ,10 = 4.
In particular, dim Sδ,3.5 + dim Sδ,6.5 − 1 = 2 (cid:54)= 4 = dim Sδ,10. But clearly, Sδ,6.5 does
not contain two coprime monomials.

j ∈ {1, 2}.

GSδ,wj +i + HjSδ,u+i = Sδ,u+wj +i,

Lemma 3.16. Let ∆,E, L, δ, R, (x1, . . . , xn) be as in Setup 3.6 . Let G ∈ Sδ,u and
H ∈ Sδ,w be coprime polynomials. If G is monic with respect to Xn, then

GSδ,w+i + HSδ,u+i = Sδ,u+w+i,

for every i ∈ Mδ.

***

Remark 3.17. In contrast to [RS], we do not project from a distinguished point to
Rn−1. (One candidate for such a point would be the end point β of the loose edge).
The reason for projecting along the vector δ given by the loose edge is to obtain an
appropriate reﬁnement of the grading of grE (R) such that Lemma 3.12 holds which
is one of the key ingredients for the proofs.
Let us mention that the projection of NP(f ) along δ is δ-orthant if and only if the
projection of NP(f ) from β to Rn−1≥0
is orthant. Hence, this is another reason why
Lemma 3.10 yields a connection to [RS].
