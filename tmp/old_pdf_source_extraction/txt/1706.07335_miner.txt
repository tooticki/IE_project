Deﬁnition 2.1. A ﬂow φ on X is said to have the pseudo orbit tracing property,
POTP, if for all ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit is
ε-shadowed by an orbit of φ.

***

Deﬁnitions 2.2. Given positive numbers δ, T and ε, we say that a (δ, T )-pseudo-
orbit (xi, ti)i∈Z of φ passes through p if x0 = p, and we say that is ε-shadowed if
there are a point y ∈ X and a function h ∈ Rep such that

d(x0 (cid:63) t, φh(t)(y)) ≤ ε, for each t ∈ R.

***
Deﬁnition 2.3. A point p ∈ X is shadowable with respect to the parameter T > 0,
if for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, T )-pseudo-orbit of φ passing
through p can be ε-shadowed. When p is shadowable with respect to the parameter
T = 1 we say that p is shadowable.

***

Example 2.4. If a ﬂow φ on X has the POTP then Sh(φ) = X. The converse is
also true as we will see shortly.

***

Theorem 2.5. Given a ﬂow φ in a compact metric space (X, d), the set of
shadowable points satisﬁes the following properties:
(a) Sh(φ) is invariant possibly empty and noncompact.
(b) The ﬂow φ has the POTP if and only if Sh(φ) = X.
(c) If CR(φ) ⊆ Sh(φ) then CR(φ) = Ω(φ).
(d) If φ is expansive and CR(φ) ⊆ Sh(φ), then CR(φ) = P er(φ).
(e) If f is an equivalence between φ and ψ, then f (Sh(φ)) = Sh(ψ).

***

Example 2.6. If φ and ψ are continuous ﬂows on X, then it is not always true
that Sh(φ) × Sh(ψ) ⊂ Sh(φ × ψ). Indeed, if we consider φ(z, t) = e2tπiz, deﬁned
in the unit circle S1, this ﬂow has the POTP. Then Sh(φ) = S1 by item (b) of
Theorem 2.5 . If the inclusion holds then Sh(φ × φ) = S1 × S1. Again, by item (b)
of Theorem 2.5 , φ× φ would have the POTP. However this is not possible because
this ﬂow is isometric and is not minimal [8].

***

Theorem 2.7. If φτ,f is the suspension ﬂow of a homeomorphism f on X under
a continuous map τ : X → (0, +∞), then

Sh(φτ,f ) = (Sh(f ) × [0, 1])/ ∼ .

***
Example 2.8. Let C be the usual ternary Cantor set in [0, 1] and X = C ∪ [1, 2]
with the usual metric of R. Let id : X → X be the identity map of X. Example
2.1 in [10] shows that Sh(id) = C \{1}, so by Theorem 2.7 Sh(φ1,f ) = (C \{1})×
[0, 1]/ ∼ which is a proper subset non closed of X 1,f .

***

Theorem 2.9. The set of shadowable points of φ is a Gδ set of X.

***
Corollary 2.10. The set of shadowable points of a homeomorphism f : X → X on
a compact metric space X is a Gδ set of X.

***
Theorem 2.11. If the ﬂow φ is chain transitive then Sh+(φ) = X or Sh+(φ) = ∅.

***

Corollary 2.12.
either has the POTP or has no shadowable points.

[Kawaguchi, N.,

[7]] Every chain transitive homeomorphism

***
Corollary 2.13. If φ is a transitive ﬂow, then Sh+(φ) = X or Sh+(φ) = ∅.

***

Corollary 2.14. The geometric Lorenz attractor does not have shadowable points.

***

Theorem 2.15. Let X compact metric space and φ be a ﬂow with shadowable
points. Then φ is chain transitive if and only if is transitive.

***

Example 2.16. In virtue of Theorem 2.15 , for every chain transitive ﬂow φ which
is not transitive we have Sh(φ) = ∅. For a concrete example, take X = S1 and φ the
ﬂow associated with the diﬀerential equation ˙θ = sin2(θ) in the angular coordinates
of S1.

***

Corollary 2.17. Let φ be a chain recurrent ﬂow with shadowable points on a
compact connected metric space X. Then φ is transitive.

***

Example 2.18. In [11], it is proved that an equicontinuous homeomorphism f on a
compact metric space X has the POTP if and only if X is totally disconected. So if
C is the usual ternary Cantor set in the interval [0, 1], then identity map id : C → C
has the POTP. The suspension ﬂow of this map is then a chain recurrent ﬂow that
has POTP [14]. But this ﬂow is not transitive for its phase space is not connected.

***

Corollary 2.19. [He, L., Wang, M., [4]] Every distal ﬂow with POTP on a
connected compact metric is minimal.

***

Corollary 2.20. [Kato, K., [6]] Let M be a Riemannian manifold and φ an
equicontinuous ﬂow with respect to the Riemannian metric of M .
If φ has the
ﬁnite POTP then φ is minimal.

***

Corollary 2.21. [Komuro, M., [8]] Let M be a Riemannian manifold and φ an
isometric ﬂow with respect to the Riemannian metric of M .
If φ has the ﬁnite
POTP then φ is minimal.

***
Deﬁnition 3.1. We say that a ﬂow φ : X×R → X has the POTP through a subset
K, if given ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit passing
through K can be ε-shadowable.

***
Lemma 3.2. Let a > 0, K ⊆ X and φ be a ﬂow on a compact metric space X.
Then the following statements are equivalent:
(1) For all ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, a, 2a)-pseudo-orbit passing

through K is ε-shadowed by an orbit of φ.

(2) φ has the POTP through K with respect to the parameter a.
(3) φ has the POTP through K.

***

Lemma 3.3. Let φ be a ﬂow on a compact metric space X. If every point of a
compact subset K of X is shadowable, then φ has the POTP through the set K.

***

Lemma 3.4. Given a ﬂow φ in a compact metric space (X, d), then Sh(φ) is
invariant. So, if not empty, it is a union of orbits of φ.

***
Lemma 3.5. If φ is a ﬂow on a compact metric space X, then Sh(φ) ∩ CR(φ) ⊆
Ω(φ).

***
Lemma 3.6. If φ is a expansive ﬂow on a compact metric space X, then CR(φ)∩
Sh(φ) ⊂ P er(φ).

***

Deﬁnition 3.7. Given ε > 0 and Z a subset of X. We say that a ﬂow φ has the
POTP through a subset K if there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit
passing through K can be ε-shadowable.

***

Lemma 3.8. Let φ be a ﬂow on the compact metric space X and let ε > 0. If the
ﬂow φ has the POTP through a compact subset K, then there is δ > 0 so that φ
has the 2ε-POTP through B[K, δ].
