For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! Missing \endcsname inserted.
<to be read again> 
                   \endgraf 
l.1487 \end{remark}
                   
The control sequence marked <to be read again> should
not appear between \csname and \endcsname.

! Argument of \@firstoffive has an extra }.
<inserted text> 
                \par 
l.1487 \end{remark}
                   
I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Runaway argument?
! Paragraph ended before \@firstoffive was complete.
<to be read again> 
                   \par 
l.1487 \end{remark}
                   
I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.
