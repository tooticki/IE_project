Remark 1.8. Theorem 1.6 roughly says that the limiting isomorphism A∞ ≃ lim A∞ h pg i from Remark 1.7 holds true

Remark 2.4. Theorem 2.3 is proven in [An2] under a more restrictive setup (but with a stronger conclusion). I am
***
Remark 2.5. One might worry that the presentations from [Sc1, Lemma 6.4] used above are only valid in the nonderived sense, and thus do not play well with reduction modulo t or t-adic completion. More precisely, one may ask if

Lemma 2.6. Let A be an integral perfectoid K ◦ -algebra. Choose f1 , ..., fn , g ∈ A♭ , and set B to be the direct limit

Remark 2.7. One may upgrade the above techniques to show the following (see [Bh4, Corollary 9.4.7]): for any

Definition 3.2. A pro-A-module {Mn }n≥1 is said to be almost-pro-zero if for any k ≥ 0 and any n ≥ 1, there
