Remark 3 to obtain a new and simple proof of the WLP for d = 2 and m = 3,
***
Definition 1. A is said to have the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP), if for any k ∈
***
Definition 2. We say that A fails the WLP because of surjectivity in degree
***
Proposition 1. The following facts hold.

Proposition 2. The ideal I = (f0 , . . . , fm ) ⊂ C[x0 , . . . , xm ], with fi linearly independent and of degree d, is a c.i. ideal if and only if Id−1 does not contain any

Remark 2. The inverse system I −1 in association to the study of the WLP of the
