Lemma 4.8 in the article [1] contains a mistake, which implies a weaker regularity estimate than the one stated in Proposition 4.11. This does not affect the

Theorem 2.1. Assume u0 ∈ C η for some η > − 23 and v0 ∈ C γ for some γ > 1. Then
***
Proposition 3.1. Assume Q is supported on [0, 2T ] for a given T > 0, fix a scaling
***
Remark 3.2. We only need these results in the case β = 2, and for the parabolic
***
Lemma 3.3. Assume that τ ∈ Tα is such that Πz+hnm τ = Πz τ for all time shifts hnm
***
Lemma 3.4. Assume that τ ∈ Tα has a base-point independent model Πz τ = Πτ and
***
Remark 3.5. This result illustrates the fact that [1, Lem. 4.8] is incorrect in general.
***
Theorem 3.6. Let α0 = | |s be the regularity of the sector defining f . Assume

Proposition 4.1. Let Π be a model satisfying (4.4), and assume − 23 < η < α < − 21 ,

Lemma 5.1. For all (n, m) ∈ N, the bound

Remark A.1. An example of such a function would be a smooth even function, satisfying ϕ(θ) = 1 − ϕ(1 − θ) for any θ ∈ [0, 1]. For instance one can take
