  We extend to three-dimensional space the approximate $M_2$ model for
  the slab geometry studied in \cite{alldredge2016approximating}. The
  $B_2$ model therein, as a special case of the second order extended
  quadrature method of moments (EQMOM), is proved to be globally
  hyperbolic. The model we propose here extends EQMOM to multiple
  dimensions following the idea to approximate the maximum entropy
  closure for the slab geometry case. Like the $M_2$ closure, the
  ansatz of the new model has the capacity to capture both isotropic
  and beam-like solutions. Also, the new model has fluxes in
  closed-form; thus, it is applicable to practical numerical
  simulations. The rotational invariance, realizability, and
  hyperbolicity of the model are studied.
