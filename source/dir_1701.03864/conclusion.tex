\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclude}

We proposed a 3D $B_2$ model that is an extension of the EQMOM ($B_2$
model) in 1D. We showed, step by step, how the structure of the new
model is gradually refined. Particularly, we studied the main
properties of this new model, including rotational invariance,
realizability, and hyperbolicity.

We are currently carrying out numerical simulations using the new
model. For the first step, we hope that the model provides 
satisfactory results on standard benchmark problems.
