J-HOLOMORPHIC DISKS WITH PRE-LAGRANGIAN
BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
STEFAN MÜLLER
Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to carry out a classical construction
of a non-constant holomorphic disk with boundary on (the suspension of) a
Lagrangian submanifold in R2n in the case the Lagrangian is the lift of a
coisotropic (a.k.a. pre-Lagrangian) submanifold in (a subset U of) R2n−1 . We
show that the positive lower and finite upper bounds for the area of such a disk
(which are due to M. Gromov and J.-C. Sikorav and F. Laudenbach-Sikorav for
general Lagrangians) depend on the coisotropic submanifold only but not on
its lift to the symplectization. The main application is to a C 0 -characterization
of contact embeddings in terms of coisotropic embeddings in another paper by
the present author. Moreover, we prove a version of Gromov’s non-existence
of exact Lagrangian embeddings into standard R2n for coisotropic embeddings
into S 1 × R2n . This allows us to distinguish different contact structures on the
latter by means of the (modified) contact shape invariant. As in the general
Lagrangian case, all of the existence results are based on Gromov’s theory of
J-holomorphic curves and his compactness theorem (or persistence principle).
Analytical difficulties arise mainly at the ends of the cone R+ × U .

1. Introduction and main results
Throughout this paper, let (M, ξ) be a (connected) cooriented contact manifold
without boundary of dimension 2n − 1, α be a contact form with ker α = ξ that
induces the given coorientation of the contact structure ξ, and L be a closed (and
connected) smooth n-dimensional manifold. We consider embeddings ι : L ֒→ M
so that the one-form f ι∗ α on L is closed for some positive function f on L. Such
embeddings are called coisotropic or pre-Lagrangian. See subsection 2.3 for details.
We can identify M with the subset 1 × M in its symplectization R+ × M . If U is
an open subset of R2n−1 with its standard contact structure, its symplectization
can be identified with a cone CU in R2n with its standard symplectic structure.
Theorem 1.1. Let U ⊂ R2n−1 be an open subset, ι : L ֒→ U be a coisotropic
embedding, H : [0, 1] × U → R be a compactly supported contact Hamiltonian so
that (ϕ1H ◦ ι)(L) ∩ ι(L) = ∅, and ǫ > 0. Denote by Ψ : L × S 1 → U × R2 the induced
double suspension. Then there exists a non-constant holomorphic disk (D, ∂D) →
(R2n+1 , Ψ(L × S 1 )) of area a such that 0 < a < 4kHk + ǫ, and the obvious map
∂D → Ψ(L × S 1 ) → L × S 1 → L represents a nonzero element of H1 (L, R).

On the other hand, the area of such a disk is also bounded from below.
Lemma 1.2 ([2]). If K ⊂ Rd is a compact submanifold, then there exists a constant
b = b(K) > 0 so that any disk with non-trivial boundary in H1 (K, R) has area a ≥ b.
Our main interest is in (tubular neighborhoods of embedded) n-dimensional
submanifolds of R2n−1 that admit a nowhere tangent contact vector field. When
n = 2, such a submanifold is called a convex surface.
Theorem 1.3. Let  : L ֒→ R2n−1 be a (necessarily non-coisotropic) embedding
and X = XH be a contact vector field that is nowhere tangent to the image (L).
Then there exists a tubular neighborhood N of (L) with the property that there
exists no coisotropic embedding ι : L ֒→ N such that the induced homomorphism
ι∗ : H1 (L, R) → H1 (N, R) is injective. In particular, there exists no coisotropic
embedding ι : L ֒→ N with ι∗ = ∗ : H1 (L, R) → H1 (N, R).
A coisotropic embedding L ֒→ M lifts to a Lagrangian embedding of L into the
symplectization R+ × M , and if U is an open subset of R2n−1 , the latter can be
identified with a cone in R2n . If the Lagrangian submanifold of (the cone in) R2n is
displaceable, then a classical construction due to Gromov [1] and Sikorav [6] gives
rise to a non-constant holomorphic disk with boundary on (the suspension of) the
Lagrangian submanifold, and an upper bound for the area of such a disk. On the
other hand, this area is bounded from below by a positive constant if either the
Lagrangian submanifold is rational or if one imposes restrictions on its homotopy
type. Note however that if ι : L ֒→ M is as above, then the one-form sf ι∗ α on L
is also closed for all s > 0, and the above upper and lower bounds depend on this
parameter s. The purpose of this paper is to carry out the Gromov and Sikorav
construction for (Lagrangian lifts of) coisotropic embeddings into open subsets U
of R2n−1 , and to refine the corresponding estimates to prove the aforementioned
theorems. We moreover prove the following version of Gromov’s theorem regarding
the non-existence of exact Lagrangian embeddings into standard R2n .
Theorem 1.4. Let ι : S 1 × L ֒→ S 1 × R2n be a coisotropic embedding and f be a
positive function on S 1 × L so that the one-form f ι∗ αcan is closed, and suppose
that ι∗ = ι∗0 : H 1 (S 1 × R2n , R) → H 1 (S 1 × L, R), where ι0 denotes the canonical
map S 1 × L → S 1 × 0 → S 1 × R2n . Consider the corresponding cohomology class
[f ι∗ αcan ] = (A, Z) ∈ H 1 (S 1 , R) ⊕ H 1 (L, R). Then Z 6= 0.
The main applications of these theorems are to a C 0 -characterization of contact
embeddings and to the calculation of the (modified) shape invariant of S 1 × U for
open subsets U of R2n−1 in [4]. The present paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents necessary elements of contact geometry and symplectization,
and section 3 explains the suspension construction on a coisotropic embedding.
Section 4 reviews Gromov’s theory of J-holomorphic curves, and contains the proofs
of Theorems 1.1 and 1.3. Rational coisotropic embeddings and energy-capacity type
inequalities are discussed in Section 5. The final section 6 generalizes some of the
theory to embeddings into products Y × R2 , and contains the proof of Theorem 1.4.

2. Contact geometry and symplectization
2.1. Symplectization. The symplectization of (M, α) is the symplectic manifold
R+ × M with symplectic structure ω = d(tπ2∗ α), where t denotes the coordinate on
the first factor, and π2 : R+ × M → M denotes the projection to the second factor.
Up to an exact symplectic diffeomorphism, the symplectization depends only on
the contact structure ξ and not on the particular choice of contact form α.
Let U be an open subset of R2n−1 with its standard contact structure ξ0 = ker α0 ,
where

and xj = rj cos θj and yj = rj sin θj denote (rectangular and polar) coordinates
on R2n−2 . We can identify the symplectization (R+ × U, d(tπ2∗ α0 )) with a cone in
R+ × R2n−1 ⊂ R2n via the symplectic embedding

ρ(t, z, r1 , θ1 , . . . , rn−1 , θn−1 ) = (t, z, t r1 , θ1 , . . . , t rn−1 , θn−1 ).

to the one-form ρ∗ λ0 = tπ2∗ α0 , and thus is indeed symplectic with respect to the
standard symplectic form ω0 = dλ0 on R2n . We denote the image of this embedding
by CU = ρ(R+ × U ) ⊂ R2n .
The tangent bundle T (R+ × U ) decomposes naturally into the direct sum bundle
T R+ ⊕ T R ⊕ T R2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ T R2 , and we call a tangent vector planar if it is tangent
to one of the T R2 factors. We also call the image of a planar vector under the
homomorphism dρ planar. An important role will later be played by the projection
map Π : CU → CU defined by Π(ρ(t, z, x, y)) = ρ(1, z, x, y). For later reference, we
√
observe that if v ∈ Tρ(t,z,x,y) CU is a planar vector, then dΠ(v) = (1 / t)v.
2.2. Contact isotopies. Denote by Rα the Reeb vector field of the contact form α.
Let H : [0, 1] × M → R be a compactly supported smooth function. The identities
s
s
dα(XH
, ·) = (dHs (Rα ))α− dHs and α(XH
) = Hs define a unique (time-dependent)
s
vector field XH on M . This vector field integrates to an isotopy (or path) of
diffeomorphisms {ϕsH } that preserve the (cooriented) contact structure ξ = ker α.
That is, there exist positive functions hs on M such that (ϕsH )∗ α = hs α.
Let (W, ω) be a symplectic manifold without boundary, and F : [0, 1] × W → R
be a compactly supported smooth function. The identity ω(XFs , ·) = −dFs defines
a unique (time-dependent) vector field XFs on W . This vector field integrates to an
isotopy (or path) of diffeomorphisms {ϕsF } that preserve the symplectic form ω. A
contact isotopy {ϕsH } lifts to a Hamiltonian isotopy {ϕsF } on the symplectization
R+ ×M defined by ϕsF (t, x) = (t/hs (x), ϕsH (x)), and their Hamiltonian functions are
related by the identity Fs (t, x) = tHs (x). Note that although F is not compactly
supported (unless H = 0), the vector field XF is nevertheless uniquely integrable.

2.3. Coisotropic embeddings. An embedding ι : L ֒→ M is called coisotropic if ι
is transversal to the contact structure ξ, and the distribution ι∗ ξ = ker(ι∗ α) ⊂ T L
can be defined by a closed one-form. Any such one-form must be of the form
f ι∗ α for a non-zero function f on L. By replacing f by −f if necessary, we may
assume that f is positive. Note that the one-form sf ι∗ α is also closed for any
s 6= 0. However, since a smooth function on a closed manifold must have a critical
point, the codimension one distribution ι∗ ξ cannot be defined by an exact oneform. Coisotropic embeddings are also called pre-Lagrangian embeddings in the
literature. As in [4] (which in turn adapts this convention from Y. Eliashberg),
we continue to call them coisotropic in this paper. The term pre-Lagrangian is
used in the title of this paper solely to avoid possibly confusion with coisotropic
submanifolds of symplectic manifolds (of lower codimension).
An embedding ι : L ֒→ W is called Lagrangian if ι∗ ω = 0 and dim W = 2n. A
coisotropic embedding ι : L ֒→ M with function f as above lifts to a Lagrangian
embedding ι̂ of L into the symplectization R+ × M given by ι̂(x) = (f (x), ι(x)),
since ι̂∗ (tπ2∗ α) = f ι∗ α. In particular, [ι̂∗ (tπ2∗ α)] = [f ι∗ α] ∈ H 1 (L, R).
2.4. Products with exact symplectic manifolds. Let (M, ξ = ker α) be a
cooriented contact manifold of dimension 2n − 1, and (W, ω = dλ) be an exact
symplectic manifold of dimension 2m. Then the product M × W is a cooriented
contact manifold with contact structure induced by the contact form π1∗ α + π2∗ λ,
where π1 and π2 denote the obvious projections. Indeed, for dimension reasons
d(π1∗ α + π2∗ λ)n−1+m =
and the top-dimensional form

(n − 1 + m)! ∗
π (dα)n−1 ∧ π2∗ (dλ)m
(n − 1)! m! 1

(π1∗ α + π2∗ λ) ∧ d(π1∗ α + π2∗ λ)n−1+m =

(n − 1 + m)! ∗
π (α ∧ (dα)n−1 ) ∧ π2∗ (dλ)m
(n − 1)! m! 1

on M × W is nowhere vanishing. It is easy to see that the Reeb vector field of
the contact form π1∗ α + π2∗ λ is the Reeb vector field of α, or more precisely, it is
the horizontal (i.e. tangent to M ) lift Rα of Rα via the projection map π1 . For
simplicity, we often write the above contact form as α + λ when proper notation
becomes too cumbersome unless it is essential for a particular argument.
2.5. Sign conventions. There are various conventions in use for the sign of the
symplectic form on the symplectization and the sign of the (contact) Hamiltonian
function corresponding to a Hamiltonian or contact vector field, and unfortunately,
no combination of these choices yields all of the identities one desires. We choose
to define ω = d(tπ2∗ α) on the symplectization without a minus sign in order to not
introduce an awkward minus sign in the correspondence between the cohomology
class represented by a coisotropic embedding and its lift to a Lagrangian embedding
into the symplectization. Then if one wants the lift of a contact isotopy generated
by a (contact) Hamiltonian H to be generated by the Hamiltonian F = t π2∗ H
on the symplectization (again without a minus sign), one must introduce a minus
sign in the correspondence between a smooth function and either its contact or its

Hamiltonian vector field. Since this paper is mainly on contact geometry, we opt
to define dF = −ω(XF , ·). This is consistent with formulas in earlier work by the
author pertaining to the relationship between a contact Hamiltonian function and
its contact vector field and isotopy, and moreover, the Reeb vector field of a contact
form α is generated by the constant function 1 (rather than −1).
3. Suspension, double, and Gromov’s figure eight trick
3.1. The Lagrangian suspension construction. Let (W, ω) be a (connected)
symplectic manifold without boundary, ι : L ֒→ W be a Lagrangian embedding,
and {ϕsF }, s ∈ S 1 = R/Z, be a loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms with ϕ0F = id,
generated by a 1-periodic Hamiltonian F : R × W → R. Consider the symplectic
manifold W × T ∗ S 1 with the (product) symplectic structure π1∗ ω + π2∗ (dr ∧ ds),
where (s, r) are coordinates on the factor T ∗ S 1 = S 1 × R. Then the embedding
L × S 1 ֒→ W × T ∗ S 1 that is defined by (x, s) 7→ ((ϕsF ◦ ι)(x), s, (−Fs ◦ ϕsF ◦ ι)(x)) is
again Lagrangian, called the (Lagrangian) suspension of {ϕsF ◦ ι}. See for instance
[5, Subsection 3.1.E] for a (straightforward) proof.
3.2. The coisotropic suspension construction. Let (M, ξ = ker α) and L be
as above, ι : L ֒→ M be a coisotropic embedding so that f ι∗ α is a closed one-form
on L, and {ϕsH }, s ∈ S 1 = R/Z, be a loop of contact diffeomorphisms with ϕ0H = id
and (ϕsH )∗ α = hs α, hs > 0, generated by a 1-periodic contact Hamiltonian function
H : R × M → R. Consider the cooriented contact manifold M × T ∗ S 1 with contact
form π1∗ α + π2∗ (r ds), which we frequently write as α + r ds to simplify notation.
Lemma 3.1. The embedding Φ = ΦH : L × S 1 ֒→ M × T ∗ S 1 defined by
(x, s) 7→ ((ϕsH ◦ ι)(x), s, (−Hs ◦ ϕsH ◦ ι) (x))
is coisotropic. In fact, the one-form

Φ∗ (α + r ds) on L × S 1 is closed.

Proof. Φ∗ (α+r ds) = (ϕsH ◦ι)∗ α+α( ds

Up to the obvious identification of R+ × (M × T ∗ S 1 ) with (R+ × M ) × T ∗S 1 via the
exact symplectic diffeomorphism (t, x, r, s) 7→ (t, x, tr, s), the Lagrangian lift of a
coisotropic suspension coincides with the Lagrangian suspension of the Lagrangian
lift of the same coisotropic embedding. One can extend the function f on L to a
function f on M in the sense that f = f ◦ ι. Then the (coisotropic) suspension Φ
in Lemma 3.1 (and its Lagrangian lift in Equation 3) can be considered (for each
s) as a globally defined map evaluated at ι(x).

contact Hamiltonian, define a pseudo-norm (or pseudo-length)

This quantity is not a norm since it vanishes on functions that depend only on s.
Note that if H is a contact Hamiltonian as in the previous subsection used to define
the suspension Φ, one can cut off H outside a neighborhood of the compact subset
S
s
s∈S 1 (ϕH ◦ ι)(L) without altering the definition of Φ.

3.4. The double of a path of diffeomorphisms. If a given path of contact
diffeomorphisms is not a loop, one can construct a loop of contact diffeomorphisms
as follows. Let {ϕsH }, s ∈ [0, 1], be a path of contact diffeomorphisms with ϕ0H = id,
generated by a compactly supported contact Hamiltonian H : [0, 1] × M → R. Let
ǫ > 0. After reparametrizing the function H if necessary, we may assume that
Hs = 0 for s ≤ ǫ and s ≥ 1 − ǫ, without changing the (pseudo-)length of H.
Then the contact Hamiltonian function G defined by Gs = H2s for s ∈ [0, 1/2] and
Gs = −H2(1−s) for s ∈ [1/2, 1] defines a smooth 1-periodic contact Hamiltonian on
R × M . The corresponding loop of contact diffeomorphisms {ϕsG }, s ∈ S 1 = R/Z,
2(1−s)
s
is given by ϕsG = ϕ2s
for s ∈ [1/2, 1]. Clearly
H for s ∈ [0, 1/2] and ϕG = ϕH
s
kGk = 2kHk. We call the loop {ϕG } (or its Hamiltonian G) the double of the path
{ϕsH } (or of the Hamiltonian H), and write (ϕsG )∗ α = gs α. The corresponding
double construction on a path of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms is verbatim the
same.
Remark 3.2. Throughout this paper, we make multiple estimates up to ǫ > 0. In
order to simplify notation, we use the same letter for all of these estimates, and
often combine them into a new constant, which we continue to denote by ǫ.
3.5. The Gromov figure eight trick. Let ι : L ֒→ M be a coisotropic embedding
so that f ι∗ α is a closed one-form on L, and {ϕsH }, s ∈ [0, 1], be a path of contact
diffeomorphisms that is generated by a compactly supported contact Hamiltonian
H : [0, 1] × M → R such that ϕ0H = id and (ϕ1H ◦ ι)(L) ∩ ι(L) = ∅. Let G denote the
contact Hamiltonian generating the double {ϕsG }, s ∈ S 1 = R/Z, of the path {ϕsH }
as defined in the previous subsection, and consider the (coisotropic) suspension
ΦG (x, s) = ((ϕsG ◦ ι)(x), s, (−Gs ◦ ϕsG ◦ ι) (x)) of {ϕsG ◦ ι}. Let ǫ > 0, and define
a+ (s) = − inf x∈M (Gs ◦ ϕsG )(x) + ǫ and a− (s) = − supx∈M (Gs ◦ ϕsG )(x) − ǫ. Denote
by C ⊂ T ∗ S 1 = S 1 × R the annulus {(s, r) ∈ S 1 × R | a− (s) < r < a+ (s)}. Then
ΦG (L × S 1 ) ⊂ M × C.
Now consider Gromov’s figure eight trick immersion ψ : C → R2 , see for example
[5, Section 3.3, Step 3]. This symplectic immersion takes the zero section {r = 0}
of T ∗ S 1 = S 1 × R to a figure eight curve with ears of equal area, so that the (closed)
one-form ψ ∗ (pdq)−rds = dη is exact, where (p, q) are coordinates on R2 , and where
d(pdq) = dp ∧ dq is the standard symplectic form on R2 . If µ is a smooth function
on R2 , then ψ ∗ (pdq − dµ) − rds = d(η − µ ◦ ψ). We can choose the immersion ψ and
a compactly supported smooth function µ so that (η − µ◦ ψ)(r, s) = −χ(s)rs, where

HOLOMORPHIC DISKS WITH PRE-LAGRANGIAN BOUNDARY

7

χ : R → [0, 1] is a smooth function that vanishes outside of the interval −ǫ < s < ǫ.
We replace the primitive pdq with the primitive pdq − dµ of dp ∧ dq. Since Gs = 0
for −ǫ ≤ s ≤ ǫ, the composition (id × ψ) ◦ ΦG : L × S 1 → M × R2 is a coisotropic
immersion. In fact,
f
(((id × ψ) ◦ ΦG )∗ (α + pdq − dµ)) = f ι∗ α.
gs ◦ ι
Strictly speaking, the latter is the closed one-form π1∗ (f ι∗ α) on L × S 1 . Moreover,
since (ϕ1H ◦ ι)(L) ∩ ι(L) = ∅, the immersion (id × ψ) ◦ ΦG is in fact an embedding.
The (easy) proof is verbatim the same as in the Lagrangian case in [5, Section 3.3,
Step 5] (possible double-points could have occurred only for pairs of points with
−ǫ < s < ǫ and −ǫ + 1/2 < s < ǫ + 1/2, respectively).
If kHk = l, then kGk = 2l, and one can carry out the above construction so that
the image ψ(C) ⊂ R2 is contained in a disk B of area less than 2l + 3ǫ.
Remark 3.3. In this paper, we frequently consider the projection of a product
manifold to one of its factors. In order to simplify notation, we denote all of them
by the letter π with a subscript to identify the factor to which we project.
3.6. Deforming the product contact form. In light of Equation 2 and the
relation ρ∗ λ0 = tπ2∗ α0 , we wish to replace the one-form pdq − dµ considered in the
previous subsection by the one-form 12 (pdq − qdp) = pdq − 21 d(pq).
Lemma 3.4. Let (M, ξ = ker α) be a cooriented contact manifold and (W, ω = dλ)
be an exact symplectic manifold. Let V ⊂ M be an open subset with compact
closure, and λt be a compactly supported family of closed one-forms on W with
λ0 = 0. Then there exists a compactly supported isotopy ϕt of diffeomorphisms of
M × W such that ϕ∗t (π1∗ α + π2∗ (λ + λt )) = π1∗ α + π2∗ λ on V × W .
Proof. We use a standard Gray stability argument. Suppose that ϕt is an isotopy of
diffeomorphisms with ϕ0 = id that is generated by a (time-dependent) vector field
Xt , and differentiate the desired identity ϕ∗t (π1∗ α+π2∗ (λ+λt )) = ft (π1∗ α+π2∗ λ) with
respect to t, where ft is a family of smooth functions on M ×W yet to be determined.

(π1∗ α + π2∗ (λ + λt )) = π2∗ ( dt

Since dt
∗ d
suffices to solve the equation π2 ( dt λt ) = −(π1∗ dα + π2∗ dλ)(Xt ) for a family of vector
fields Xt that are tangent to ker(π1∗ α + π2∗ (λ + λt )). Note that in this case ft is
independent of t, and thus ft = f0 = 1.
The vector fields Xt can be constructed in three steps. Since the two-form ω = dλ
is non-degenerate, there exists a smooth family Zt of vector fields on W so that
d
π2∗ ( dt
λt ) = −(π2∗ dλ)(Z t ), where Z t denotes the horizontal lift of Zt (i.e. the lift
that is tangent to W ). Then define a family of smooth vector fields Yt that are
tangent to M by (π1∗ dα)(Yt ) = 0 and (π1∗ α)(Yt ) = −(π2∗ (λ + λt ))(Z t ), or in other
words, Yt = −((π2∗ (λ + λt ))(Z t ))Rα . The only thing left to show is that the family
of vector fields Xt = Yt + Z t can be uniquely integrated for all t. This can be
achieved by replacing Z t by (π1∗ κ)Z t for a cut-off function κ on M with κ = 1 on
V and compact support in M .

where υ is a compactly supported cut-off function on the disk B with υ = 1 on
the (projection to B of the) image of the suspension (id × ψ) ◦ ΦG , and V is a
neighborhood of the image of the (projection to M of the) suspension. Note that
even in this special case the equation in the lemma can not necessarily be solved
for an isotopy that is trivial on the first factor and a Hamiltonian isotopy on the
second factor. Let Ψ = ϕ1−1 ◦ (id × ψ) ◦ ΦG , where ϕ1 is as in the lemma. Then

4. Construction of non-constant holomorphic disk

4.1. Gromov compactness and persistence principle. In this subsection we
review Gromov’s compactness theorem and the corresponding persistence principle
[1, Section 1.5]. For the sake of simplicity, we only treat the theory in the generality
necessary for the applications in this paper. A good exposition (which we mostly
follow below but which does not treat all aspects of the theory either) can be found
in [5, Chapter 4]. The standard reference for the general theory is the book [3].
Denote by D the unit disk in the complex plane C. Let L ⊂ Cn be a closed
Lagrangian submanifold, and v : D × Cn → Cn be a smooth map that is bounded
together with all of its derivatives. Fix a relative homology class β ∈ H1 (Cn , L),
and consider the problem P (L, v, β) of finding a smooth map u : (D, ∂D) → (Cn , L)
such that ∂u(ζ) = v(ζ, u(ζ)) and [u] = β. Assume that {vk } is a sequence of smooth
functions that C ∞ -converges to a smooth function v, and that uk are solutions of
the corresponding problems P (L, vk , β). Gromov’s compactness theorem states that
there exists a subsequence of {uk } that converges either to a solution of P (L, v, β) or
Gromov converges (or converges weakly) to a so-called cusp solution. In particular,
if the problem P (L, v, β) has no solution, then bubbling off takes place. That
means that there exists a decomposition β = β ′ + β1 + · · · + βm , βj 6= 0, m ≥ 1, a
solution u of P (L, v, β ′ ), and solutions wj of P (L, 0, βj ). The latter are therefore
(non-constant) holomorphic disks (D, ∂D) → (Cn , L).
For later reference, we take a closer look at the notions of cusp curve and Gromov
convergence. Consider a finite system of disjoint simple curves γν that are either
closed and lie in the interior of D or have endpoints (and their endpoints only) on the
S
boundary ∂D. Denote by D0 the surface (with boundary) obtained from D \ γν
S
by the one-point compactification at every end of D \ γν , and by D the space
obtained from D by shrinking every curve γν to a single point. Topologically, D is
a disk with spheres attached at points in its interior, and disks attached at points

on its boundary. There is an obvious map D0 → D, and the Cauchy-Riemann
operator ∂ can be defined on a cusp curve u : D → Cn by means of the composition
D0 → D → Cn . Gromov convergence now means that the following conditions
S
are met. The maps uk converge to u uniformly on compact subsets of D \ γν ,
and uniformly (on D) to the composed map D → D → Cn , where the first map
is the obvious quotient map, and the second map is u. Note that for topological
reasons there exist no non-constant holomorphic spheres in Cn and hence in the
above decomposition. Here the maps u and wj considered above are defined on the
S
(one-point compactifications of the) components of D \ γν (with the latter being
defined on the bubbles). Finally, the areas of the maps uk converge to the area
P
of the map u, which is equal to the sum area(u) + j area(wj ). Again for later
reference, recall that the area of a smooth map w : D → Cn satisfies the inequalities

In particular, the area of a holomorphic map coincides with its symplectic area.
As a consequence of his compactness theorem, Gromov proved a persistence
principle that stipulates the following. Given a generic family vs , s ∈ [0, 1], with
v0 = 0, either the problem P (L, vs , 0) has a solution for all s, or bubbling off occurs
at some s∞ ≤ 1, that is, there exists a subsequence sk → s∞ such that a sequence
of solutions of P (L, vsk , 0) converges to a cusp solution of P (L, vs∞ , 0).
4.2. A priori bounds on the size of the image of a holomorphic curve.
Gromov compactness depends on the fact that holomorphic curves into Cn (and
other non-compact symplectic manifolds that are convex at infinity) cannot leave an
appropriate compact subset, and a quantitative version of this is required below.
Let B 2n = {z ∈ Cn | |z − τ | < T } denote the ball of radius T > 0 centered at
τ ∈ Cn , and let w : D → Cn be a holomorphic disk so that w(∂D) ⊂ B. Then a
standard convexity argument shows that the image w(D) is also contained in B,
cf. the proof of Proposition 9.2.16 in [3]. In particular, the image of w is contained
in the strip {z ∈ Cn | τ1 − T < z1 < τ1 + T }, where the subscript 1 denotes the
first real coordinate of a complex vector.
4.3. Disks with boundary on coisotropic submanifolds. Let U be an open
subset of R2n−1 , and ι : L ֒→ U be a coisotropic embedding. Denote by SL the
b : L × S 1 → C(U × B) → R2n+2 , where B ⊂ R2
image of the Lagrangian lift ρ ◦ Ψ
is a disk of radius R with πR2 < 2l + 3ǫ. Identify R2n+2 with Cn+1 = Cn × C,
and consider as in subsection 4.1 the problem P (SL, v, 0) of finding a smooth map
u : (D, ∂D) → (Cn+1 , SL) such that ∂u(ζ) = v(ζ, u(ζ)) and [u] = 0. In this case,
√
the appropriate function v to consider is v(ζ, ρ(t, z, x, y, p, q)) = (0, . . . , 0, t σ)
on the cone C(R2n+1 ), where σ ∈ C is a constant. Of course the latter and its
derivative are not bounded, so that one does not have the a priori area and first
derivative bounds that are necessary for Gromov compactness. We rectify this
√
situation by replacing t by a smooth function Λ : Cn+1 → R that is bounded
√
together with all of its derivatives, and satisfies Λ(ρ(t, z, x, y, p, q)) = t on the

subset ρ([T1 , T2 ] × R2n+1 ) = {z ∈ R2n+2 | T1 < z1 < T2 }, where 0 < T1 < T2 are
constants to be specified momentarily.
Let u be a solution of P (SL, v, 0). Observe that the image u(∂D) is contained

and that the projection π1 ◦ u : D → Cn is holomorphic. Apply the a priori bound
in the previous subsection with a sufficiently large ball that is contained in the
half-space {z ∈ Cn | z1 > 0} and in turn contains (the projection to Cn ) of the
Lagrangian submanifold SL. That implies the existence of constants 0 < T1 < T2
so that the image of every solution u of P (SL, v, 0) is contained in the subset
{z ∈ Cn+1 | T1 < z1 < T2 }.
Lemma 4.1. Let σ ∈ C so that |σ| > R. Then the problem P (SL, v, 0) with v as
above has no solutions.

Proof. Suppose that u is a solution of P (SL, v, 0), and denote by φ its last complex
coordinate. Recall the projection map Π : C(R2n+1 ) → R2n+2 = Cn+1 defined in
subsection 2.1. Since σ is a planar vector, we have ∂(Π ◦ φ)/∂x + i(∂(Π ◦ φ)/∂y) =
2Π∗ ∂φ = 2σ. Moreover, |(Π◦φ)|∂D | ≤ R since u(∂D) ⊂ SL. By the same argument
as in the proof of [5, Lemma 4.3.A], we obtain the identity

Apply Gromov’s persistence principle to the family sv, s ∈ [0, 1], where v is as in
the lemma. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that bubbling off happens for the
family sv (rather than a C ∞ -small perturbation); all of the estimates below hold
up to ǫ > 0, and therefore the argument goes through without significant changes.
We then obtain a sequence sk → s∞ ≤ 1, a decomposition 0 = β ′ + β1 + · · · + βm ,
βj 6= 0, solutions uk of P (SL, sk v, 0), u of P (SL, s∞ v, β ′ ), and holomorphic disks
w1 , . . . , wm , m ≥ 1, with [wj ] = βj , such that the sequence uk Gromov converges
to a cusp solution u with the above data.
We deduce the following estimates. The area of Π ◦ uk is bounded from below
by
Z
area(Π ◦ uk ) ≤ 2

D

|∂(Π ◦ uk )|2 dxdy = 2πs2k |σ|2 ≤ 2π|σ|2 .

On the other hand, the area of (Π ◦ w1 ) is less than the area of (Π ◦ uk ) + ǫ provided
that k is sufficiently large. This follows from the convergence of the area and the
uniform convergence on compact subsets in the Gromov convergence of the sequence
uk to the cusp curve u. Finally, since [w1 ] = β1 6= 0, the curve w1 is non-constant,
and in particular has positive area. Since its boundary lies on SL, the definition of

the map Π and Equation 3 for the lift of a coisotropic suspension imply that the
area of the disk w = Π ◦ w1 is also positive. Note that the above argument holds
for any σ ∈ C with |σ| > R.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. The map w : (D, ∂D) → (R2n+1 , Ψ(L × S 1 )) constructed in
the preceding paragraphs is precisely the holomorphic disk in the statement of the
theorem. Its area a satisfies 0 < a < 4kHk + ǫ.
The map ∂D → L in the last part of the statement is given by the composition
π1 ◦ Ψ−1 ◦ (w|∂D ), where π1 : L × S 1 → L as before is the projection. This map

is unchanged if we replace w by w1 and Ψ by its Lagrangian lift ρ ◦ Ψ

and thus the map ∂D → L represents a non-trivial element of H1 (L, R).

Proof of Theorem 1.3. Let H : [0, 1] × R2n−1 → R be a Hamiltonian function whose
contact vector field XH is nowhere tangent to (L). If we cut H off outside an
arbitrary neighborhood of (L) and then multiply H by a (small) positive constant,
the resulting contact vector field is still nowhere tangent to (L). Thus we may
assume that H is compactly supported in a tubular neighborhood U of (L) so that
the closure U = K is compact, and that the inequality 4kHk < b(K) holds, where
b(K) is as in Lemma 1.2. Moreover, since (ϕ1H ◦ )(L) ∩ (L) = ∅ and L is compact,
there exists a tubular neighborhood N of (L) that is displaced by ϕ1H as well.
In order to derive a contradiction, suppose ι : L → N is a coisotropic embedding
so that the induced homomorphism ι∗ : H1 (L, R) → H1 (N, R) is injective (i.e. an
isomorphism). By Theorem 1.1, there exists ǫ > 0 and a non-constant holomorphic
disk w of area a < 4kHk + ǫ < b(K) whose boundary is non-trivial in H1 (L, R).
Since the area of w is larger than the area of π1 ◦ w, we must have a ≥ b(K), which
is the desired contradiction.

5. Rational classes and energy-capacity type inequalities
Let ι : L ֒→ U ⊂ R2n−1 be a coisotropic embedding as in Theorem 1.1, and
assume that the cohomology class z = [f ι∗ α0 ] ∈ H 1 (L, R) is rational. Recall
that this means that the subgroup z(H1 (L, Z)) ⊂ R is discrete. Note that this
definition is invariant under rescaling by a non-zero constant. Denote by γ > 0 the
positive generator of the group z(H1 (L, Z)). Then by Equation 4, the area of w1
belongs to the image z(H1 (L, Z)), and thus area(w1 ) ≥ γ > 0. In the Lagrangian
analog of Theorem 1.1, one can therefore bound the quantity 4kF k from below by
the generator γ, where F is a Hamiltonian that displaces the rational Lagrangian
embedding. (In fact, by the decomposition 0 = β ′ + β1 + · · · + βm , βj 6= 0 in the
Gromov convergence in subsection 4.3, one has either β ′ 6= 0 or m > 1, so that one
can improve the factor 4 to a factor 2.) This gives rise to an energy-capacity type
inequality bounding the norm kF k from below by the symplectic size of a subset
that is displaced by the time-one map ϕ1F , see [5, Subsection 3.2.D]. In this section
we briefly discuss the limitations of this argument for coisotropic embeddings.

The problem arises from the fact that the area of the disk w1 does not necessarily
belong to the subgroup z(H1 (L, Z)), where z = [f ι∗ α0 ] ∈ H 1 (L, R) is as above. (It
is not difficult to see that f 6= 1, see e.g. [4].) One can however bound the area of
w1 from above by C(f ) area(w), where C(f ) is a constant that depends on the C 1 norm of f , and thus derive the inequality 0 < γ/C(f ) ≤ 4kHk + ǫ. One can choose
this constant so that the ratio γ/C(f ) is invariant under rescaling f by a positive
constant. One can improve the constant C(f ) further by considering the Lagrangian
lift of ι into the symplectization and a suitable cut-off of the Hamiltonian F = π2∗ H.
In that case the constant C(f ) depends only on max(f ).
This estimate however has limited practical applications, since there is no control
over (the magnitude of) the function f so that the one-form f ι∗ α0 is closed. Indeed,
for any x0 ∈ L and ǫ > 0 an arbitrary constant, one easily constructs a compactly
supported contact diffeomorphism ψ : U → U so that ψ ∗ α0 = hα0 and h(ι(x0 )) = ǫ.
Then the embedding ψ◦ι : L ֒→ U is coisotropic, and (f /h◦ι)(ψ◦ι)∗ α0 = f ι∗ α0 = z.
If f assumes its maximum at x0 ∈ L, then max(f /h ◦ ι) ≥ max(f )/ǫ. Thus the
above estimate does not provide an obstruction to coisotropic embeddings in terms
of the positive generator γ of a rational cohomology class z ∈ H 1 (L, R).
6. Proof of Theorem 1.4
The first result of this section is a straightforward generalization of Gromov’s
theorem that there exists no exact Lagrangian embedding into standard symplectic
(R2n , ω0 = dλ0 ) [1, Corollary 2.3.B2 ].
Theorem 6.1. Let (X, ω = dλ) be an exact symplectic manifold without boundary
of dimension 2n − 2, and let W = X × R2 with the product symplectic structure
π1∗ ω + π2∗ ω0 . Let ι : L ֒→ W be a Lagrangian embedding. Then the cohomology
class [ι∗ (π1∗ λ + π2∗ λ0 )] does not belong to the image of the induced homomorphism
ι∗ : H 1 (W, R) → H 1 (L, R). In other words, if Q : H 1 (L, R) → H 1 (L, R)/Im(ι∗ )
denotes the canonical quotient map, then Q([ι∗ (π1∗ λ + π2∗ λ0 )]) 6= 0.
Proof. Gromov compactness [1, Subsection 2.3.B3 ] implies the existence of either
a non-constant J-holomorphic disk w : (D, ∂D) → (W, ι(L)) or a non-constant JX holomorphic sphere S 2 → X, where J = JX ⊕ J0 is an auxiliary almost complex
structure on W = X × R2 that is standard on the second factor. The latter
possibility however is excluded by exactness of ω. Let S 1 denote a cycle in L such
R
that ι(S 1 ) = w(∂D). Then S 1 ι∗ (λ ⊕ λ0 ) = area(w) 6= 0. On the other hand, if θ
R
R
R

is a closed one-form on W , then S 1 ι∗ θ = ι(S 1 ) θ = w(D) dθ = 0.
As a special case, we state the following theorem.
Theorem 6.2. Consider W = T ∗ S 1 × R2n with its standard symplectic structure
d(π1∗ (r ds) + π2∗ λ0 ), and suppose that ι : S 1 × L ֒→ W is a Lagrangian embedding
so that ι∗ = ι∗0 : H 1 (W, R) → H 1 (S 1 , R) ⊕ H 1(L, R), where ι0 denotes the canonical
map S 1 × L → S 1 × 0 → T ∗ S 1 × R2n . Consider the corresponding cohomology class
[ι∗ (π1∗ (r ds) + π2∗ λ0 )] = (A, Z) ∈ H 1 (S 1 , R) ⊕ H 1 (L, R). Then Z 6= 0.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Recall that αcan = dz + 21 j=1 (xj dyj − yj dxj ). We can
identify the symplectization R+ × (S 1 × R2n ) with a subset of T ∗ S 1 × R2n via a
symplectic embedding ρ that is defined verbatim as in Equation 1. The statement
then follows directly from Theorem 6.2 applied to the Lagrangian embedding ρ ◦ ι̂.
Here we use the fact from subsection 2.3 that a coisotropic embedding and its
Lagrangian lift represent the same cohomology class in H 1 (S 1 × L, R).
