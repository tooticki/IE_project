Abstract. A shadowable point for a flow is a point where the shadowing
lemma holds for pseudo-orbits passing through it. We prove that this concept
satisfies the following properties: the set of shadowable points is invariant and a
Gδ set. A flow has the pseudo-orbit tracing property if and only if every point is
shadowable. The chain recurrent and nonwandering sets coincide when every
chain recurrent point is shadowable. The chain recurrent points which are
shadowable are exactly those that can be are approximated by periodic points
when the flow is expansive. We study the relations between shadowable points
of a homeomorphism and the shadowable points of its suspension flow. We
characterize the set of forward shadowable points for transitive flows and chain
transitive flows. We prove that the geometric Lorenz attractor does not have
shadowable points. We show that in the presence of shadowable points chain
transitive flows are transitive and that transitivity is a necessary condition
for chain recurrent flows with shadowable points whenever the phase space is
connected. Finally, as an application these results we give concise proofs of
some well known theorems establishing that flows with POTP admitting some
kind of recurrence are minimal. These results extends those presented in [10].

1. Introduction
The theory of shadowing plays an important role in the qualitative theory of dynamical systems. It has been largely studied by many researchers and is well documented (see for instance [12]). It refers to the general problem of approximating
orbits obtained in the presence of noise or round-off error (for instance solutions
obtained by numerical computations). There are several ways to define the shadowing property for flows, see for instance [13] and references therein. In essence,
the central idea among the majority of definitions of shadowing for flows is the
following: even if small errors occur at each iteration, one can track the resulting
pseudo-orbit by a true orbit with a time reparametrization.
Recently, in [10] the definition of shadowing for homeomorphisms in a compact
metric space was generalized by splitting the shadowing property into pointwise
shadowings giving rise to the concept of shadowable points, which are points where
the shadowing property holds for pseudo-orbits passing through them. In [7] the
author further extends this notion by introducing the concept of quantitative shadowable points for homeomorphism and some important question made in [10] were
answered. In light of these results, it is natural to consider a notion of shadowable
points for flows and expect similar results to the homeomorphism case.

Hence we introduce the concept of shadowable points for flows and we prove
that this notion satisfies the following properties: the set of shadowable points is
invariant and a Gδ set. A flow has the pseudo-orbit tracing property if and only
if every point is shadowable. The chain recurrent and nonwandering sets coincide
when every chain recurrent point is shadowable. The chain recurrent points which
are shadowable are exactly those that can be are approximated by periodic points
when the flow is expansive. We study the relations between the set of shadowable
points of a homeomorphism and the sets of shadowable points of its suspension
flow. We characterize the set of forward shadowable points for transitive flows
and chain transitive flows and we prove that the geometric Lorenz attractor does
not have shadowable points. We show that in the presence of shadowable points
chain transitive flows are transitive and that transitivity is a necessary condition for
chain recurrent flows with shadowable points whenever the phase space is connected.
Finally, as an application these results we give a concise proof of some well known
theorems establishing that flows with POTP admitting some kind of recurrence are
minimal.
2. Statement of results
Hereafter (X, d) will denote a compact metric space. The closure operation will
be denoted by (·). A flow of X is a map φ : X × R → X satisfying φ(x, 0) = x
and φ(φ(x, s), t) = φ(x, s + t) for all t, s ∈ R and x ∈ X. A flow is continuous
if it is continuous with respect to the product metric of X × R. The time t-map
φt : X → X defined by φt (x) = φ(x, t) is a homeomorphism of X for all t ∈ R. So,
the flow φ can be interpreted as a family of homeomorphisms Φ = (φt )t∈R such
that φ0 = id and φt ◦ φs = φt+s for all t, s ∈ R. Given A ⊂ X and I ⊂ R we set
φI (A) = {φt (x) : (t, x) ∈ I × A}. If A consists of a single point x, then we write
φI (x) instead of φI ({x}). In particular, φR (x) is called the orbit of x ∈ X under
φ. By a periodic point we mean a point x ∈ X for which there is a minimal t > 0
satisfying φt (x) = x. This minimal t is the so-called period of x and is denoted by
tx . Denote by P er(φ) the set of periodic points of φ.
Given δ, T > 0, a ∈ Z ∪ {−∞}, b ∈ Z ∪ {+∞} with a ≤ b, we say that a sequence
of pairs (xi , ti )bi=a in X × R is a (δ, T )-pseudo-orbit of φ if for all integer indexes i
such that a ≤ i ≤ b − 1 we have that ti ≥ T and d(φti (xi ), xi+1 ) ≤ δ. If a, b ∈ Z
and ab ≤ 0, we say that it is a finite (δ, T )-pseudo-orbit. If a = 0 and b = ∞ we
say that it is a forward (δ, T )-pseudo-orbit and if a = 0 and b < ∞ we say that it
is a (δ, T )-chain. (see [8, 14]).

Let (xi , ti ) i∈Z be a (δ, T )-pseudo-orbit of φ and let t ∈ R, we denote by x0 ⋆ t a
point in the (δ, T )-pseudo-orbit t units from x0 [8]. More precisely,
x0 ⋆ t = φ t − si (xi ) whenever si ≤ t < si+1 .

Denote by Rep the set of surjertive strictly increasing maps h : R → R such that
h(0) = 0 which will be called the set of reparameterizations.
Next, we recall the definition of pseudo orbit tracing property for flows [14].
Definition 2.1. A flow φ on X is said to have the pseudo orbit tracing property,
POTP, if for all ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit is
ε-shadowed by an orbit of φ.
Additionally, we recall the definition of shadowable points for homeomorphisms
[10]. Let f : X → X a homeomorphism. Given δ > 0, we say that a bi-infinite
sequence (xn )n∈Z is a δ-pseudo-orbit passing through the point p ∈ X, if x0 = p
and for every integer n we have that d(f (xn ), xn+1 ) ≤ δ. We say p is shadowable
if for each ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that for every δ-pseudo-orbit (xn )n∈Z
passing through p, there is a point q ∈ X such that d(f n (q), xn ) ≤ ε for all n ∈ Z.
The set of shadowable points of f is denoted by Sh(f ).
Motivated by this we consider the notion of shadowing for pseudo orbits in flows
passing through a given point.
Definitions 2.2. Given positive numbers δ, T and ε, we say that a (δ, T )-pseudoorbit (xi , ti )i∈Z of φ passes through p if x0 = p, and we say that is ε-shadowed if
there are a point y ∈ X and a function h ∈ Rep such that
d(x0 ⋆ t, φh(t) (y)) ≤ ε, for each t ∈ R.
Now we introduce the main objects of study.
Definition 2.3. A point p ∈ X is shadowable with respect to the parameter T > 0,
if for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, T )-pseudo-orbit of φ passing
through p can be ε-shadowed. When p is shadowable with respect to the parameter
T = 1 we say that p is shadowable.
We denote by Sh(φ) the set of shadowable points of φ in X. In what follows we
will give some examples of shadowable points.
Example 2.4. If a flow φ on X has the POTP then Sh(φ) = X. The converse is
also true as we will see shortly.
Our first result deals with the basic properties of shadowable points related to the
following standard definitions. We say that a point p ∈ X is non-wandering if for
every neighborhood U of p and every T ∈ R there is t ≥ T such that φ t (U ) ∩ U 6= ∅.
Two points p and q are (δ, T )-related if there are two (δ, T )-chains (xi , ti )m
i=0 and
(yi , si )ni=0 such that p = x0 = yn and y = y0 = xm . We say that p and q are related
(written p ∼ q) if they are (δ, T )-related for every δ, T > 0. A point p is chain
recurrent if p ∼ p. Denote by Ω(φ) and CR(φ) the set of non-wandering and chain
recurrent points of φ respectively. Clearly Ω(φ) ⊆ CR(φ) and the inclusion may be
proper [1].
We say that a flow φ is expansive if for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 with the
property that if d(φt (x), φh(t) (y)) ≤ δ for all t ∈ R, for every pair of points x, y ∈ X
and some h ∈ Rep, then y ∈ φ(−ε, ε) (x).
A subset Λ of X is invariant under φ (or φ-invariant) if φt (Λ) = Λ for every
t ∈ R. An equivalence between continuous flows [14], φ on X and ψ on another
metric space Y , is an homeomorphism f : X → Y carrying orbits of φ onto orbits

4

of ψ such that for every x ∈ X there exists hx ∈ Rep depending continuously on x
and satisfying
f −1 (ψ(f (x), t)) = φ(x, hx (t)) for every t ∈ R.
In this case we say that the flows are equivalent.
With these definitions we can state our first result.
Theorem 2.5. Given a flow φ in a compact metric space (X, d), the set of shadowable points satisfies the following properties:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)

Sh(φ) is invariant possibly empty and noncompact.
The flow φ has the POTP if and only if Sh(φ) = X.
If CR(φ) ⊆ Sh(φ) then CR(φ) = Ω(φ).
If φ is expansive and CR(φ) ⊆ Sh(φ), then CR(φ) = P er(φ).
If f is an equivalence between φ and ψ, then f (Sh(φ)) = Sh(ψ).

Next, we give an example related to Theorem 2.5. We recall that a flow φ on X
is isometric if d(φt (x), φt (y)) = d(x, y) for every x, y ∈ X and each t ∈ R, and is
minimal is all of its orbits are dense in X.
Example 2.6. If φ and ψ are continuous flows on X, then it is not always true
that Sh(φ) × Sh(ψ) ⊂ Sh(φ × ψ). Indeed, if we consider φ(z, t) = e2tπi z, defined
in the unit circle S 1 , this flow has the POTP. Then Sh(φ) = S 1 by item (b) of
Theorem 2.5. If the inclusion holds then Sh(φ × φ) = S 1 × S 1 . Again, by item (b)
of Theorem 2.5, φ × φ would have the POTP. However this is not possible because
this flow is isometric and is not minimal [8].
Next, we study the relations between the set of shadowable points of a homeomorphism and the sets of shadowable points of its suspension flow.
Let f : X → X be a homeomorphism and τ : X → (0, +∞) be a continuous
function. Consider the quotient space X τ,f = {(x, t) : 0 ≤ t ≤ τ (x), x ∈ X}/ ∼,
where (x, τ (x)) ∼ (f (x), 0) for all x ∈ X. The suspension flow over f with height
function τ is the flow on X τ,f defined by φτ,f
t (x, s) = (x, s + t) whenever s + t ∈
[0, τ (x)]. Replacing d by the the equivalent metric if necessary, we can assume that
diam(X) = 1. Then, there is a natural metric dτ,f on X τ,f making it a compact
metric space (this is the so-called Bowen-Walters metric, see [3]).
Every suspension of f is conjugate to the suspension of f under the constant
function 1. A homeomorphism from X 1,f to X τ,f that conjugates the flows is given
by the map (x, t) 7→ (x, tτ (x)).
Theorem 2.7. If φτ,f is the suspension flow of a homeomorphism f on X under
a continuous map τ : X → (0, +∞), then
Sh(φτ,f ) = (Sh(f ) × [0, 1])/ ∼ .
With this theorem we have the following example of a flow whose shadowable
set is non closed.
Example 2.8. Let C be the usual ternary Cantor set in [0, 1] and X = C ∪ [1, 2]
with the usual metric of R. Let id : X → X be the identity map of X. Example
2.1 in [10] shows that Sh(id) = C \ {1}, so by Theorem 2.7 Sh(φ1,f ) = (C \ {1}) ×
[0, 1]/ ∼ which is a proper subset non closed of X 1,f .

Next, we will study the topological behavior of the shadowable points of X. We
shall use the following standard topological concept. A subset of X is a Gδ set if it
is a countable intersection of open sets of X. In [10], examples of homeomorphisms
where the set of shadowable points is a Gδ sets are given. We prove that this is
always the case in the flow context:
Theorem 2.9. The set of shadowable points of φ is a Gδ set of X.
Returning to the case of homeomorphisms, in [7] Kawaguchi proved that the
set of shadowable points of a homeomorphism is a Borel set. But what he proved
indeed is that such a set is a Fσδ set of phase space, i.e., a countable intersection
of countable union of closed sets. By making use of Theorem 2.9, we improve
Kawaguchi’s assertion by proving that the set of shadowable points is a Gδ set of
the phase space:
Corollary 2.10. The set of shadowable points of a homeomorphism f : X → X on
a compact metric space X is a Gδ set of X.
We denote by Sh+ (φ) the set of points such that given ε > 0 there exists δ > 0
such that every forward (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit (xi , ti )∞
i=0 passing through p can be
ε-shadowed. Each element of Sh+ (φ) is said forward shadowable point. Clearly, we
have the relation Sh(φ) ⊆ Sh+ (φ).
We recall that a chain transitive flow φ is one where X is a chain transitive set.
That is, for every p, q ∈ X we have p ∼ q, see [1]. The following result is a partial
analogous of Theorem 1.1 in [7] and characterizes the set of forward shadowable
points for chain transitive flows.
Theorem 2.11. If the flow φ is chain transitive then Sh+ (φ) = X or Sh+ (φ) = ∅.
As a first consequence of the previous theorem, using suspensions we obtain an
alternate proof of the following result, which follows from the fact that a map a
chain transitive if and only if its suspension flow is (see [1]):
Corollary 2.12 (Kawaguchi, N., [7]). Every chain transitive homeomorphism either has the POTP or has no shadowable points.
Recall that a transitive flow φ, see [2], is one for which there exists a point x ∈ X
such that ω(x) = X where
ω(x) = {y ∈ X : y =

lim φtn (x) for some sequence tn → +∞}.

tn →+∞

In [10] the question of whether there exists a transitive homeomorphism with nontrivial shadowable points set is posed. In [7] the author answers this question
negatively and completely classifies the sets of shadowable points for chain transitive
and transitive homeomorphisms. A well known result in topological dynamics states
that every transitive flow is chain transitive [1]. The following corollary, which is
an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.11, gives a partial negative answer to this
question in the flow case.
Corollary 2.13. If φ is a transitive flow, then Sh+ (φ) = X or Sh+ (φ) = ∅.
Corollary 2.13 can be used to obtain information about the geometric Lorenz
attractor [9, 15]. In [9], it is proved that if φ is the geometric Lorenz attractor,
then it does not have the finite forward POTP provided that its return map f

6

satisfies that f (0) 6= 0 or f (1) 6= 1. In this case we have Sh+ (φ) 6= X. It follows
that Sh+ (φ) = ∅. So we obtain the following result.
Corollary 2.14. The geometric Lorenz attractor does not have shadowable points.
We do not know if Theorem 2.11 if we substitute forward shadowables points for
shadowables points. We have, however a related result. As stated previously, every
transitive flow is chain transitive. However, it is well known the reciprocal is not
true [1]. The following theorem states that in the presence of forward shadowable
points the two notions are equivalent.
Theorem 2.15. Let X compact metric space and φ be a flow with shadowable
points. Then φ is chain transitive if and only if is transitive.
Example 2.16. In virtue of Theorem 2.15, for every chain transitive flow φ which
is not transitive we have Sh(φ) = ∅. For a concrete example, take X = S 1 and φ the
flow associated with the differential equation θ̇ = sin2 (θ) in the angular coordinates
of S 1 .
In what follows we are going to see how Theorem 2.15 can be used to prove some
interesting well known theorems.
Recall that a flow φ is distal if whenever inf t∈R d(φt (x), φt (y)) = 0 implies x = y.
Komuro showed that isometric flows with the pseudo orbit tracing property are
minimal flows [8]. Meanwhile Kato proved that equicontinuous flows with the
pseudo orbit tracing property are also minimal flows [6]. Later, He and Wang
proved that distal flows with the pseudo-orbit tracing propery are minimal too
[4]. Finally, Jiehua [5] proved that pointwise recurrent flows with the pseudo-orbit
tracing property are minimal.
In light of these results, is natural to ask if we still can conclude minimality if
the pointwise recurrence hypothesis is weakened to suppose the flow to be chain recurrent. The answer is negative as there are nonminimal chain recurrent flows with
the pseudo orbit tracing property, for instance the suspension of the usual linear
anosov map on the torus. However, there are not known examples of nontransitive
chain recurrent flows with the pseudo-orbit tracing property on connected spaces.
We are going to proof that transitivity is a necessary condition is the phase space
is assumed to be connected and we give an example that shows that this is not the
case on nonconnected phase spaces. Indeed, If X is assumed to be connected and
φ chain recurrent, then φ is necessarily chain transitive [1]. The following corollary
is immediate from Theorem 2.15:
Corollary 2.17. Let φ be a chain recurrent flow with shadowable points on a
compact connected metric space X. Then φ is transitive.
The following example shows that the conclusion of Corollary 2.17 cannot be
guaranteed if we drop the connecteness hypothesis.
Example 2.18. In [11], it is proved that an equicontinuous homeomorphism f on a
compact metric space X has the POTP if and only if X is totally disconected. So if
C is the usual ternary Cantor set in the interval [0, 1], then identity map id : C → C
has the POTP. The suspension flow of this map is then a chain recurrent flow that
has POTP [14]. But this flow is not transitive for its phase space is not connected.
The following results mentioned previously can be obtained as a consequence of
Corollary 2.17, giving thus, a more concise proof of these.

Corollary 2.19 (He, L., Wang, M., [4]). Every distal flow with POTP on a connected compact metric is minimal.
Proof. It is enough to note that every distal flow is chain recurrent and every
transitive distal flow is minimal.

A flow φ is equicontinuous if the family of t-time maps {φt }t∈R is an equicontinuous family of homeomorphisms in X.
Corollary 2.20 (Kato, K., [6]). Let M be a Riemannian manifold and φ an
equicontinuous flow with respect to the Riemannian metric of M . If φ has the
finite POTP then φ is minimal.
Proof. It is enough to note that an equicontinuous flow is distal.

Corollary 2.21 (Komuro, M., [8]). Let M be a Riemannian manifold and φ an
isometric flow with respect to the Riemannian metric of M . If φ has the finite
POTP then φ is minimal.
Proof. Simply note that isometric flows are also distal.

3. Preliminaries
Let X be a compact metric space. We say that a sequence (xn , tn )n∈Z of X × R
is through some subset K ⊆ X if x0 ∈ K (see [10]). Now we introduce the following
auxiliary definition.
Definition 3.1. We say that a flow φ : X ×R → X has the POTP through a subset
K, if given ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit passing
through K can be ε-shadowable.
Note that we do not require the entire (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit to be contained in K,
therefore the definition 3.1 is stronger than the POTP on K [13].
A sequence of pairs (xi , ti )i∈Z is a (δ, T1 , T2 )-pseudo-orbit of φ if it is a (δ, T1 )pseudo-orbit of φ and satisfies ti ≤ T2 , for all i ∈ Z.
In [14], Thomas proved that a flow satisfies the POTP with respect to the parameter T if and only if for every ε > 0 we can find δ > 0 such that every (δ, T, 2T )pseudo-orbit can be ε-shadowed. We shall use the following lemma which is essentially contained in [14]. We include its proof for the sake of completeness.
Lemma 3.2. Let a > 0, K ⊆ X and φ be a flow on a compact metric space X.
Then the following statements are equivalent:
(1) For all ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, a, 2a)-pseudo-orbit passing
through K is ε-shadowed by an orbit of φ.
(2) φ has the POTP through K with respect to the parameter a.
(3) φ has the POTP through K.
Proof. We assume that a > 1. For the other case (when a < 1) a similar argument
can be used. Suppose that for all ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, a, 2a)pseudo-orbit passing through K is ε-shadowed by an orbit of φ. First we prove that
φ has the POTP through K with respect to the parameter a and then we prove that
the flow has the POTP through K. Let (xi , ti )i∈Z be any (δ, a)-pseudo-orbit of φ
passing through K. For each n ∈ Z, there exists mn ∈ N such that tn = mn a + rn
with a ≤ rn < 2a. Let (sm
n )n∈Z the sequence of sums associated to m = (mn )n∈Z .

Denote An = sm
n + n for all n ∈ Z and define the sequence (yi )i∈Z on X such that
yi = φa(i−An ) (xn ) if An ≤ i < An+1 . In addition, we define a sequence λ = (λi )i∈Z
of real numbers in the following way, for each i ∈ Z, we set

a if An ≤ i < An+1 − 1,
λi =
rn if i = An+1 − 1.
Given i ∈ Z note that a ≤ λi < 2a and let n ∈ Z be such that An ≤ i < An+1 . We
have two cases.
Case 1: if i < An+1 − 1, then
d(φλi (yi ), yi+1 ) = d(φa (φa(i−An ) (xn )), φa(i+1−An ) (xn )) = 0.
m
Case 2: if i = An+1 −1, bearing in mind that An+1 −An = sm
n+1 −sn +1 = mn +1
we obtain

d(φrn (φamn (xn )), xn+1 )

d(φλi (yi ), yi+1 ) = d(φrn (φa(An+1 −1−An ) (xn )), xn+1 ) =

d(φtn (xn ), xn+1 ) ≤ δ.

=

That is, (yi , λi )i∈Z is a (δ, a, 2a)-pseudo-orbit of φ passing through K. Then, there
are z ∈ X and h ∈ Rep such that d(φr−sλn (yn ), φh(r) (z)) ≤ ε where sλn ≤ r < sλn+1
and (sλi ) is the sequence of sums associated to λ = (λi )i∈Z . Let w ∈ R and n ∈ Z
such that stn ≤ w < stn+1 , where (stn ) is associated to t = (ti )i∈Z . Since stn = sλAn ,
then sλAn ≤ w < sλAn+1 = sλAn +mn +1 . Hence, there is 0 ≤ j ≤ mn such that
sλAn +j ≤ w < sλAn +j+1 and then
ε ≥ d(φw−sλA

n +j

(yAn +j ), φh(w) (z)) =

d(φw−stn (φstn −sλA

(yAn +j )), φh(w) (z))

=

d(φw−stn (φstn −sλA

(φaj (xn ))), φh(w) (z))

=

d(φw−stn (xn ), φh(w) (z)).

It follows that φ has the POTP through K with respect to the parameter a. Now
we prove that the flow has the POTP through K. Fix m ∈ N such that m ≥ a.
Given ε > 0 choose δ > 0 satisfying the following conditions:
(1) Every (δ, a)-pseudo-orbit passing through K is 2ε -shadowable.
(2) For each 0 ≤ t ≤ 2m we have d(φt (x), φt (y)) < 2ε , whenever d(x, y) < δ.
Let 0 < δ ′ < δ/m and take 0 < β < δ ′ so that d(x, y) < β implies that
d(φt (x), φt (y)) < δ ′ for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2m. Let (xn , tn )n∈Z be a (β, 1)-pseudo-orbit
for φ passing through K with 1 ≤ tn P
≤ 2 for all n ∈ Z. Consider the sequence of pairs (xim , λi )i∈Z where λi = m−1
j=0 tj+im for every i ∈ Z. We denote
Pm−1
λi (k) = j=k tj+im with 0 ≤ k < m. Then
d(φλi (xim ), x(i+1)m ) ≤

m
X

d(φλi (r) (φtim+r−1 (xim+r−1 )), φλi (r) (xim+r )) ≤ mδ ′ < δ,

r=1

because a ≤ λi ≤ 2m. So, (xim , λi )i∈Z is a (δ, a)-pseudo-orbit for φ passing through
K. Hence, there are z ∈ X and h ∈ Rep such that d(φt−sλn (xnm ), φh(t) (z)) ≤ 2ε
Pk−1
where sλn ≤ t < sλn+1 . Now, for 0 ≤ k < m denote stk (r) = j=r tj we have
d(φstk (x0 ), xk ) ≤

k
X
r=1

d(φstk (r) (φtr−1 (xr−1 )), φstk (r) (xr )) < kδ ′ < δ.

Then for stk ≤ t < stk+1
d(φt−stk (xk ), φh(t) (z)) ≤ d(φt−stk (xk ), φt−stk (φstk (x0 ))) + d(φt (x0 ), φh(t) (z)) ≤ ε.
For m ≤ k < 2m, we continue in the same manner. So we will have that the orbit
(φt (z))t∈R ε-shadows the (β, 1, 2)-pseudo-orbit of φ passing through K. Applying
the above reasoning we obtain that (φt (z)), can be ε-shadowed by the (β, 1)-pseudoorbit of φ passing through K.

Hence a flow φ in a compact metric space X has POTP if and only if for all
ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, 1, 2)-pseudo-orbit is ε-shadowed by an
orbit of φ.
We denote by B[ ·, δ] the close ball operation on X.
Clearly, if a flow has the POTP through a set K then every point is K is shadowable respectively. The reciprocal is also true in the compact case as shown in the
following lemma.
Lemma 3.3. Let φ be a flow on a compact metric space X. If every point of a
compact subset K of X is shadowable, then φ has the POTP through the set K.
Proof. Assume by contradiction that there exists a nonempty compact subset K
such that every point in K is shadowable but does not have the POTP through
K. Then there is ε > 0 and a sequence (ξ k )k∈N = (ξnk , tkn )n∈Z of ( k1 , 1, 2)-pseudoorbits passing through K which cannot be 2ε-shadowed. Since K and [1, 2] are
compact, we can assume that ξ0k → p for some p ∈ K and tk0 → t0 for some time
t0 ∈ [1, 2]. We have that p is shadowable, so for ε as above, we choose δ > 0
from the shadowableness of p with δ < 3ε . Since X × [0, 2] is compact, φ|X×[1, 2] is
uniformly continuous and so our δ can also be chosen so that if d((x, t), (y, s)) ≤ δ
with 0 ≤ s, t ≤ 2 then d(φt (x), φs (y)) ≤ 3ε . We set a sequence ξ̂ k = (ξˆnk , t̂kn )n∈Z as

As φ is continuous and (ξ0k , tk0 ) → (ξ0 , p) we obtain that (ξˆnk ) is a (δ, 1, 2)-pseudoorbit for k large. Then for such k it follows that there are xk ∈ X and h ∈ Rep

We will consider the three possible cases: tk0 < t̂k0 , tk0 = t̂k0 and tk0 > t̂k0 . Note that
in every case we have |ski − ŝki | = |tk0 − t̂k0 | for all i ∈ Z. We consider only the tk0 < t̂k0
case being the other two cases analogous. Then ski < ŝki for all i ∈ Z. Let t ∈ R
and let i ∈ Z such that ski ≤ t < ski+1 . We have two cases:
Case 1: if ŝki ≤ t < ski+1 , then in particular ŝki ≤ t < ŝki+1 , so
d(φt−ski (ξik ), φh(t) (xk )) ≤ d(φt−ski (ξik ), φt−ŝki (ξˆik )) + d(φt−ŝki (ξˆik ), φh(t) (xk ))

Lemma 3.4. Given a flow φ in a compact metric space (X, d), then Sh(φ) is
invariant. So, if not empty, it is a union of orbits of φ.
Proof. Let x be a shadowable point of X. Let ε > 0 and s ∈ R given. Since φs is
uniformly continuous, so we can choose 0 < ε′ < ε such that whenever d(x, y) < ε′
we have d(φs (x), φs (y)) < ε. For ε′ , let δ > 0 such that any (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit
passing through x can be ε′ -shadowed. Similarly, φ−s is uniformly continuous so
we can choose δ ′ > 0 with the property that d(φ−s (x), φ−s (y)) ≤ δ whenever
d(x, y) < δ ′ . Now let (xi , ti )i∈Z be a (δ ′ , 1)-pseudo-orbit passing through φs (x).
Because d(φ ti (xi ), xi+1 ) ≤ δ ′ we have by the choice of δ ′ that
d(φ−s (φti (xi )), φ−s (xi+1 )) = d(φti (φ−s (xi )), φ−s (xi+1 )) ≤ δ
and hence (φ−s (xi ), ti )i∈Z is a (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit passing through x. By definition,
there are h ∈ Rep and y ∈ X such that
d(x ⋆ t, φh(t) (y)) ≤ ε′ , for every t ∈ R.

SHADOWABLE POINTS FOR FLOWS

11

Then, if si ≤ t < si+1 , it follows that d(φt−si (φ−s (xi )), φh(t) (y)) ≤ ε′ for every t ∈
R which implies d(φt−si (xi ), φh(t) (φs (y))) ≤ ε. Therefore, d(x0 ⋆ t, φh(t) (φs (y))) ≤ ε
for each t ∈ R. Thus, every (δ ′ , 1)-orbit passing through φs (x) can be ε-shadowed
by a point in X. This completes the proof.

Lemma 3.5. If φ is a flow on a compact metric space X, then Sh(φ) ∩ CR(φ) ⊆
Ω(φ).
Proof. Let p ∈ Sh(φ)∩CR(φ) and ε > 0 be given. Then there exists δ > 0 from the
shadowableness of p. Since p is a chain recurrent point, there exists a (δ, 1)-chain
(xi , ti )ki=0 with p = x0 = xk . For every integer number n we put xkn+i = xi ,
tkn+i = ti for 0 ≤ i < k. So, (xi , ti )i∈Z is a (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit for φ and therefore
there are y ∈ X and g ∈ Rep such that d(p ⋆ t, φg(t) (y)) ≤ ε for every t ∈ R. It
follows that y ∈ B[p, ε] because g(0) = 0 by definition. For every j ≥ 0 make
Pk−1
ti . Then,
mj = j i=0
d(x, φg(mj ) (y)) = d(x ⋆ mj , φg(mj ) (y))
≤ ε, ∀ j ≥ 0
and mj ≥ jk for all j ≥ 0. So mj → ∞ (j → ∞). Since g ∈ Rep, g(mj ) → ∞.
Therefore x ∈ Ω(φ), and the lemma follows.

Lemma 3.6. If φ is a expansive flow on a compact metric space X, then CR(φ) ∩
Sh(φ) ⊂ P er(φ).
Proof. Without loss of generality, by expansiveness, we can suppose that the flow
has no singularities. Let x ∈ CR(φ) ∩ Sh(φ) and ε ∈ (0, 1). We can consider
that ε satisfies Lemma 3.10 in [16] with respect to λ = 12 . Take δ > 0 satisfying
the definition of shadowing respect to ε. Since x ∈ CR(φ), there is a ( δ2 , 3)-chain
(xi , ti )ki=1 where x0 = xk = x and ti ≥ 3. Assume that δ comes from expansivity
with respect to ε. Extend the ( δ2 , 3)-chain (xi , ti )ki=1 to a ( 2δ , 3)-pseudo-orbit. Thus,
there are z ∈ X and α ∈ Rep such that d(φα(t) (z), φt−si (xi )) ≤ 2δ for si ≤ t < si+1 .
If L = t0 +. . .+tk−1 , then d(φα(t+L) (z), φt−si (xi )) ≤ 2δ for si ≤ t < si+1 . Therefore
d(φα(t+L) (z), φα(t) (z) ≤ δ for every t ∈ R.
Take u = α(t), then
d(φα(α−1 (u)+L) (z), φu (z)) = d(φα(α−1 (u)+L)−α(L) (φα(L) (z)), φu (z)) ≤ δ
for every u ∈ R, where α(α−1 (u) + L) − α(L) ∈ Rep. Hence φα(L) (z) ∈ φ(−ε,ε) (z).
Moreover since d(φα(t) (z), φt (x)) ≤ 2ε for 0 ≤ t < t0 , then 12 s ≤ α(s) for some
2 ≤ s ≤ t0 , by Lemma 3.10 in [16]. Then ε ≤ α(s) ≤ α(L) since s ≤ L. Therefore
z ∈ P er(φ).

Now we introduce another auxiliary definition.
Definition 3.7. Given ε > 0 and Z a subset of X. We say that a flow φ has the
POTP through a subset K if there exists δ > 0 such that every (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit
passing through K can be ε-shadowable.
Lemma 3.8. Let φ be a flow on the compact metric space X and let ε > 0. If the
flow φ has the POTP through a compact subset K, then there is δ > 0 so that φ
has the 2ε-POTP through B[K, δ].

12

J. APONTE AND H. VILLAVICENCIO

Proof. Suppose by contradiction that a flow φ has the POTP through a subset K
but for every δ > 0, we can find a (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit passing through B[K, δ] that
cannot be 2ε-shadowed.
Take a δ > 0 from the POTP through K with δ < ε, and let (ξ k )k∈N be a sequence
of ( k1 , 1)-pseudo-orbits passing through B[K, k1 ] which cannot be 2ε-shadowed. For
every k ∈ N we write ξ k = (ξnk , tkn )n∈Z . It follows from the definition that there
is a sequence xk ∈ K such that d(ξ0k , xk ) ≤ k1 for all k ∈ N. Since X is compact,
the flow φ is uniformly continuous in X × [−t10 , t10 ], so we can choose k with the
property that

Fix k and define a sequence ξ = (ξn , tn )n∈Z by

we see that ξ is a (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit. Since ξ0 = xk ∈ K by definition, we obtain
that ξ can be ε-shadowed by a point y ∈ X. Thus, there exists h ∈ Rep such that

d(φt0 (ξ0 ), ξ1 ) = d(φt10 (xk ), ξ1k ) ≤ d(φt10 (xk ), φt10 (ξ0k )) + d(φt10 (ξ0k ), ξ1k ) ≤

d(ξ0 ⋆ t, φh(t) (y)) < ε,

for each t ∈ R.

Note that for i 6= 0 and t such that si ≤ t < si+1 , we have
ξ0 ⋆ t = φt−si (ξi ) = φt−si (ξik ) = ξ0k ⋆ t.
Hence ξ0 ⋆ t = ξ0k ⋆ t for t 6∈ [s0 , s1 ). Furthermore, for t ∈ [s0 , s1 ),
d(ξ0k ⋆ t, φh(t) (y)) ≤ d(ξ0k ⋆ t, ξ0 ⋆ t) + d(ξ0 ⋆ t), φh(t) (y))
≤ d(φt (ξ0k ), φt (ξ0 )) + d(ξ0 ⋆ t, φh(t) (y))

Thus, d(ξ0k ⋆ t, φh(t) (y)) ≤ 2ε for all t ∈ R. It follows that ξ k is 2ε-shadowed, which
is a contradiction. This proves the result.

4. Proofs
Proof of Theorem 2.5. To prove Item (a), by Lemma 3.4 we have that Sh(φ) is
invariant, example 2.8 shows that this set can be noncompact and Corollary 2.14
shows that it can be empty. Item (b) follows by making K = X in Lemma 3.3 for
we that φ has the POTP if and only if Sh(φ) = X.

SHADOWABLE POINTS FOR FLOWS

13

Item (c) follows since Ω(φ) ⊂ CR(φ), then we have that if CR(φ) ⊆ Sh(φ), then
Ω(φ) = CR(φ) by Lemma 3.5.
Similarly, Item (d) follows since P er(φ) ⊆ CR(φ), then CR(φ) = P er(φ) by
Lemma 3.6.
To prove Item (e), let f : X → Y be an equivalence between φ and ψ on the
metric spaces (X, dx ) and (Y, dy ) respectively. Suppose that for each x ∈ X there
exists hx ∈ Rep such that
f −1 (ψ(f (x), hx (t))) = φ(x, t), for each t ∈ R.
Let a = min{hx (1) : x ∈ X}. By compactness of X such a exists and indeed
is positive. Now, given ε > 0, choose ε′ > 0 such that dy (y1 , y2 ) < ε′ implies dx (f −1 (y1 ), f −1 (y2 )) < ε for every y1 , y2 ∈ Y . Suppose p ∈ f −1 (Sh(ψ)).
By Lemma 3.2, there exists δ ′ > 0 such that each (δ ′ , a)-pseudo-orbit passing
through f (p) can be ε′ -shadowed by an orbit of ψ. Also choose δ > 0 so that
dy (f (x1 ), f (x2 )) < δ ′ whenever dx (x1 , x2 ) < δ for all x1 , x2 ∈ X. Now let (xn , tn )n∈Z
be a (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit for φ passing through p. Then dy (f (φtn (xn )), f (xn+1 )) < δ ′ .
By definition of conjugacy we have
dy (ψhxn (t) (f (xn )), f (xn+1 )) < δ ′ ,

for every n ∈ Z.

Consider the sequence (f (xn ), hxn (tn ))n∈Z . Since tn ≥ 1 it follows that hxn (tn ) ≥ a
for all n ∈ Z. So (f (xn ), hxn (tn ))n∈Z is a (δ ′ , a)-pseudo-orbit for ψ passing through
f (p). Then there are y = f (z) in Y and α ∈ Rep such that
dy (f (x0 ) ⋆ t, ψα(t) (y)) < ε′ , for all t ∈ R.
It follows that
(1)


dx f −1 (f (x0 ) ⋆ t), f −1 (ψα(t) (f (z))) < ε,

for all t ∈ R.

Fix t ∈ R and n ∈ Z such that sn ≤ t < sn+1 . Since hxn ∈ Rep we have
Pn−1
0 ≤ hxn (t − sn ) < hxn (tn ). Therefore, if we denote sbn = j=0 hxj (tj ) for n ≥ 1
P−1
and sbn = − j=n hxj (tj ) for n ≤ 0 we have sbn ≤ hxn (t − sn ) + sbn < sbn+1 . Take
b
t
t = hxn (t − sn ) + sbn , so ψbt (f (x0 )) = ψhxn (t−sn ) (f (xn )). By (1) it follows for t = b
that
−1
(ψ bt−bsn (f (xn ))), f −1 (ψα( bt ) (f (z)))) < ε.
dx (φt−sn (xn ), φh−1
t )) (z)) = dx (f
z (α( b

bn )) we have
This implies that if we define α
b(t) = h−1
z (α(hxn (t − sn ) + s
dx (x0 ⋆ t, φαb(t) (z)) < ε,

for every t ∈ R.

b ∈ Rep. Therefore, f −1 (Sh(ψ)) ⊆
Since t 7→ hxn (t − sn ) + sbn is increasing, then α
Sh(φ). The inclusion f (Sh(φ)) ⊆ Sh(ψ) is obtained analogously considering the
equivalence f −1 : Y → X. This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 2.7. We can assume without loss of generality that τ ≡ 1. Given
(z, t) ∈ Sh(φ1,f ) since Sh(φ1,f ) is invariant by φ1,f , then (z, 21 ) ∈ Sh(φ1,f ). Let
ε > 0 be given. Choose ε′ > 0 with ε′ < min{ε, 41 } so that d(f i (x), f i (y)) < ε for
i = −1, 0, 1, whenever d(x, y) < ε′ . Choose δ > 0 from the definition of shadowable
point for φ1,f with respect to ε′ . Also take 0 < δ ′ < δ so that d(x, y) < δ ′ implies

14

d(f (x), f (y)) < δ. Let {xn }n∈Z be any δ ′ -pseudo-orbit of f with x0 = z. Consider
the pair of sequences (xn , 21 )n∈Z and (tn )n∈Z such that tn = 1 for each n ∈ Z. Then

2 d(f (xn ), xn+1 )

+ 21 d(f 2 (xn ), f (xn+1 )) ≤ δ.

That is ((xn , 12 ), tn )n∈Z is a (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit of φ1,f with x0 = z. So, there are
(x, s) ∈ X 1,f and α ∈ Rep such that

implies that d(f n (x), xn ) < ε for every n ∈ Z. Therefore z ∈ Sh(f ).

Conversely, let z ∈ Sh(f ) and r ∈ [0, 1]. Given ε > 0, take 0 < ε < ε so that
d(x, y) < ε′ implies d(f i (x), f i (y)) < 21 ε for i = 0, 1, 2. Let δ, with 0 < δ < 12 ε′ , from
the definition of shadowable point for f respect to ε′ . Take 0 < δ ′ < min{ 41 , δ} as
in Lemma 2.5 in [14] and ((xk , sk ), (tk ))k∈Z a (δ ′ , 2, 4)-pseudo orbit passing through
(z, r) for the suspension flow φ1,f on X 1,f . Let wk = [sk + tk ] denote the integer
part of sk + tk . Hence
d1,f ((f wk (xk ), sk + tk − wk ), (xk+1 , sk+1 )) < δ ′

for all k ∈ Z.

Since δ ′ < 14 , by Lemma 2.4 in [14], we have that |sk + tk − wk − sk+1 | < δ ′ or
|1 + sk + tk − wk − sk+1 | < δ ′ or |1 + sk+1 + wk − tk − sk | < δ ′ . Now, let nk be a
positive integer defined as follows

if |sk + tk − wk − sk+1 | < δ ′ ,
 wk
nk =
wk − 1 if |1 + sk + tk − wk − sk+1 | < δ ′ ,

wk + 1 if |1 + sk+1 + wk − tk − sk | < δ ′ .
Then by Lemma 2.5 in [14] we obtain that d(f nk (xk ), xk+1 ) < δ for all k ∈ Z.
Define a sequence (yi )i∈Z in X as follows:
yi = f i−Nk (xk ) for Nk ≤ i < Nk+1 ,

SHADOWABLE POINTS FOR FLOWS

where (Nk )k∈Z is the sequence of sums associated to (nk )k∈Z . Obviously this sequence is a δ-pseudo orbit of f passing through z. Hence, there exists x ∈ X such
that d(f i (x), yi ) < ε′ for every i ∈ Z. Therefore we get
d(f j+Nk (x), f j (xk )) < ε′

(2)

Now, take the point (x, t) ∈ X

sk+1 + nk − sk

|α(t) − sk − Nk + s0 − (t − Tk )| < δ ′ .

Now if j is a positive integer which makes 0 ≤ sk + t − Tk − j < 1, then 0 ≤ j ≤

that A(ε0 ) is open and B(ε0 ) ⊂ Sh(φ, ε0 ) \ Sh(φ). By (4) we have

\

B(ε0 ) = ∅

ε0 >0

and
Sh(φ) =

That is, Sh(φ) is a Gδ set of X.

Proof of Corollary 2.10. By Theorem 2.9, if φ1,f is the suspension of f under the
constant function 1, then Sh(φ1,f ) is a Gδ set of X 1,f . Thus there T
is a sequence
∞
(An )n∈N of open sets in X 1,f with the following property Sh(φ1,f ) = n=1 An . So,
by Theorem 2.7 we have
p(Sh(f ) × [0, 1]) =

∞
\

An ,

n=1

where p : X × [0, 1] → X 1,f is the quotient map of X 1,f . Moreover, since Sh(f ) is
invariant with respect to f we obtain that Sh(f ) × [0, 1] = p−1 (p(Sh(f ) × [0, 1])).
Hence
∞
\

Sh(f ) × [0, 1] =

(5)

p−1 (An ).

n=1

Next, given z ∈ Sh(f ), by (5) we have that z × [0, 1] ⊂ p−1 (An ) for every n ∈ N.
Since p−1 (An ) are open sets, there exists εz,n ≤ n1 such that B(z, εz,n ) × [0, 1] ⊂
S
p−1 (An ). Finally, if Vn = z∈Sh(f ) B(z, εz,n ) it follows that
∞
\

Sh(f ) =

Vn .

n=1

This concludes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 2.11. Suppose that Sh+ (φ) 6= ∅. Let p ∈ Sh+ (φ) and q ∈ X.
Let ε > 0 and take δ > 0 from the forward shadowableness of p. Let (xi , ti )∞
i=0 a
forward (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit passing through q and let (yi , si )m
i=0 a (δ, 1)-chain such
that y0 = p and ym = q. We have that the sequence of pairs (zj , rj )∞
j=0 given by
(zj , rj ) =

if 0 ≤ j < m,
(xj−m , tj−m ) if j ≥ m.

is a forward (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit passing through p. We set

Hence there are h ∈ Rep and a point y ∈ X such that d(p ⋆ t, φh(t) (y)) ≤ ε, for
t ∈ [0, ∞). Let g(t) = h(t + r̂m ) − h(r̂m ).
Note that

So, if tˆk ≤ t < t̂k+1 with k ≥ 0, then r̂m+k ≤ t + r̂m < r̂k+m+1 and therefore
d(q ⋆ t, φg(t) (φh(r̂m ) (y))) = d(φt−t̂k (xk ), φh(t+r̂m )−h(r̂m ) (φh(r̂m ) (y)))
= d(φt+r̂m −r̂m+k (zm+k ), φh(t+r̂m ) (y))
≤ ε.
We have shown that the given forward (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit passing through q can
be ε-shadowed by the point φh(t̂m ) (y) and as this ε was arbitrary we conclude that
q forward shadowable. That is q ∈ Sh+ (φ). This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 2.15. As X is a Baire Space, it is enough to proof that for any
pairs of open sets U and V of X, there exists a non-negative T with φT (U ) ∩ V 6= ∅.
By hypothesis there exists at least one shadowable point x. Choose two points
p ∈ U and q ∈ V and let ǫ > 0 such that B(p, ε) ⊆ U and B(q, ε) ⊆ V . Let
δ > 0 from the shadowableness of x with respect to ε. By chain transitivity there
n
exists a (δ, 1)-chain (xi , ui )m
i=0 from p to x and a (δ, 1)-chain (yj , rj )j=0 from x to
q. Define a (δ, 1)-pseudo-orbit (zi , ti )i∈Z passing through x as follows:


(φk+m (x0 ), 1)

(x

k < −m,
− m ≤ k < 0,
0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1,
k ≥ n.

Then there are y ∈ X and h ∈ Rep such that
d(φt−sk (x), φh(t) (y)) ≤ ε, ∀ sk ≤ t < sk+1 ,
where (sk )k∈Z is the sequence of sums associated to (tk )k∈Z . In particular, we have
d(p, φh(s−m ) (y)) ≤ ε
and
d(q, φh(sn ) (y)) ≤ ε.
Set T = −h(s−m ) + h(sn ) which is nonnegative since h ∈ Rep. Then φh(sn ) (y) ∈
φT (U ) ∩ V . This concludes the proof.
