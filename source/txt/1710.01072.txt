Abstract. Stiebitz determined the chromatic number of generalised
Mycielski graphs using the topological method of Lovász, which invokes
the Borsuk–Ulam theorem. Van Ngoc and Tuza used elementary combinatorial arguments to prove Stiebitz’s theorem for 4-chromatic generalised Mycielski graphs, and asked if there is also an elementary combinatorial proof for higher chromatic number. We answer their question by
showing that Stiebitz’s theorem can be deduced from a version of Fan’s
combinatorial lemma. Our proof uses topological terminology, but is
otherwise completely discrete and could be rewritten to avoid topology
altogether. However, doing so would be somewhat artificial, because
we also show that Stiebitz’s theorem is equivalent to the Borsuk–Ulam
theorem.

1. Introduction
The Mycielski construction [10] is one of the earliest and arguably simplest
constructions of triangle-free graphs of arbitrary chromatic number. Given a
graph G = (V, E), we let M2 (G) be the graph with vertex set V ×{0, 1}∪{z},
where there is an edge {(u, 0), (v, 0)} and {(u, 0), (v, 1)} whenever {u, v} ∈
E, and an edge {(u, 1), z} for all u ∈ V . It is an easy exercise to show that
the chromatic number increases with each iteration of M2 (·).
The construction was generalised by Stiebitz [15] (see also [12, 5]), and
independently by Van Ngoc [16] (see also [17]), in the following way. Given
a graph G = (V, E) and an integer r ≥ 1, we define Mr (G) as the graph
with vertex set V × {0, . . . , r − 1}∪ {z}, where there is an edge {(u, 0), (v, 0)}
and {(u, i), (v, i + 1)} whenever {u, v} ∈ E, and an edge {(u, r − 1), z} for
all u ∈ V . The construction is illustrated in Figure 1.
If r > 2, it is no longer true that the chromatic number increases with each
iteration of Mr (·). For instance, it can be shown that if C7 is the complement
of the 7-cycle, then χ(M3 (C7 )) = χ(C7 ) = 4. However, Stiebitz [15] was able
to show that the chromatic does increase with each iteration of Mr (·) if we
start with an odd cycle, or some other suitably chosen graph. For every
integer k ≥ 2, let us denote by Mk the set of all ‘generalised Mycielski
graphs’ obtained from K2 by k − 2 iterations of Mr (·), where the value of r

can vary from iteration to iteration. Stiebitz [15] (see also [5, 8]) proved the
following.
Theorem 1.1 (Stiebitz [15]). If G ∈ Mk , then χ(G) ≥ k.

Stiebitz’s proof is based on Lovász’s [7] bound on the chromatic number
in terms of the connectedness of the neighbourhood complex, which Lovász
developed to prove Kneser’s conjecture (see [8] for a comprehensive account).
Lovász’s bound uses the following result of Borsuk [2], usually known in the
literature as the Borsuk–Ulam theorem.
Theorem 1.2 (Borsuk [2]). There exists no continuous antipodal mapping
f : S n → S n−1 ; that is, a continuous mapping such that f (−x) = −f (x) for
all x ∈ S n .

To this day, no combinatorial proof of Theorem 1.1 is known (see [8,
pp. 133]), except for the case k = 4 [17]. At the end of their paper, Van
Ngoc and Tuza [17] propose the following problem:
Finally, we would like to invite attention to the problem that no
elementary combinatorial proof is known so far for the general form
of Stiebitz’s theorem, yielding graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic
number and fairly large odd girth.

The answer to the problem depends on the interpretation of ‘elementary
combinatorial proof’. Does it mean a proof that is ‘discrete’ and does not
rely on continuity? Or does it mean a ‘graph theoretic’ proof which avoids
any topological concepts, such as triangulations of spheres?
In this note we will give a new discrete proof of Theorem 1.1 based on a
generalisation, due to Prescott and Su [11], of a classical lemma of Fan [4],
and on a result of Kaiser and Stehlı́k [6]. Since the proofs of both these
theorems are discrete, this provides a discrete proof of Theorem 1.1.
Triangulations of spheres are central to our proof, and rewriting the proof
so as to avoid any topological concepts (as Matoušek [9] has done for the
Lovász–Kneser theorem) is certainly possible, but seems somewhat artificial.
Indeed, we show that Theorem 1.2 follows fairly easily from Theorem 1.1.
We would like to point out that our proof of Theorem 1.1 leads to a
new proof of Schrijver’s [13] sharpening of the Lovász–Kneser theorem [7],
via the following result of Kaiser and Stehlı́k [6] (whose proof is entirely
combinatorial). For a definition of SG(n, k), we refer the reader to [6] or [8].
Theorem 1.3 (Kaiser and Stehlı́k [6]). For all integers k ≥ 1 and n > 2k,
there exists a graph G ∈ Mk homomorphic to SG(n, k).

2. Preliminaries
Our graph theoretic terminology is standard and follows [1]. For an excellent introduction to topological methods in combinatorics, and all the
topological terms used in this paper, see [8].
Prescott and Su [11] introduced flags of hemispheres to prove a slight
generalisation of Fan’s combinatorial lemma [4]. A flag of hemispheres in
S n is a sequence H0 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Hn where each Hd is homeomorphic to a d-ball,
{H0 , −H0 } are antipodal points, Hn ∪ −Hn = S n , and for 1 ≤ d ≤ n,
∂Hd = ∂(−Hd ) = Hd ∩ −Hd = Hd−1 ∪ −Hd−1 ∼
= S d−1 .

The polyhedron |K| of a simplicial complex K is defined as the union of
all of its simplices. We say that K is a triangulation of |K| (or any space
homeomorphic to it). A triangulation K of S n is (centrally or antipodally)
symmetric if σ ∈ K whenever −σ ∈ K. A symmetric triangulation K of S n
is said to be aligned with hemispheres if we can find a flag of hemispheres
such that for every d, there is a subcomplex of the d-skeleton of K that
triangulates Hd .
Given a simplicial complex K and a labelling (map) λ : V (K) → Z \
{0}, we say a d-simplex σ ∈ K is positive alternating if it has labels
{+j0 , −j1 , +j2 , . . . , (−1)d jd }, where 0 < j0 < j1 < · · · < jd . The following version of Fan’s lemma [4] is a key ingredient of our proof.
Theorem 2.1 (Prescott and Su [11]). Let K be a symmetric triangulation of
S n aligned with hemispheres, and let λ : V (K) → {±1, . . . , ±k} be a labelling
such that λ(−v) = −λ(v) for every vertex v ∈ V (K), and λ(u) + λ(v) 6= 0
for every edge {u, v} ∈ K. Then there exists an odd number of positive
alternating n-simplices. In particular, k ≥ n + 1.
We remark that the proof in [11] is constructive and discrete, and that
Fan’s original result [4] imposes a more restrictive condition on the triangulation.
Suppose K is a symmetric triangulation of S n . A 2-colouring of K is
an assignment of two colours (black and white) to the vertices of K. The
2-colouring is said to be antisymmetric if antipodal vertices receive distinct
colours, and it is proper if no n-simplex is monochromatic.
Given a symmetric triangulation K of S n and a proper antisymmetric 2-colouring κ of K, we denote by G̃(K, κ) the graph obtained from
the 1-skeleton K (1) by deleting all monochromatic edges. If ν denotes
the antipodal action on G̃(K, κ), we set G(K, κ) = G̃(K, κ)/ν, and let
p : G̃(K, κ) → G(K, κ) be the corresponding projection. Note that the
graph G̃(K, κ) is a bipartite double cover of G(K, κ).
The following theorem is an immediate consequence of [6, Lemma 3.2 and
Theorem 6.1], where the results are stated in terms of so-called quadrangulations of projective spaces.
Theorem 2.2 (Kaiser and Stehlı́k [6]). Given n ≥ 1, let K be a symmetric
triangulation of S n aligned with hemispheres, with a proper antisymmetric
2-colouring κ. For any r ≥ 1, there exists a symmetric triangulation K ′ of
S n+1 aligned with hemispheres, with a proper antisymmetric 2-colouring κ′
such that G(K ′ , κ′ ) ∼
= Mr (G(K, κ)).

3. A combinatorial proof of Theorem 1.1
Our proof of Theorem 1.1 is based on the following corollary of Theorem 2.1.
Corollary 3.1. Let K be a symmetric triangulation of S n aligned with
hemispheres, and let λ : V (K) → {±1, . . . , ±(n + 1)} be a labelling such that
λ(−v) = −λ(v) for every vertex v ∈ V (K), and every n-simplex has vertices
of both signs. Then there exists an edge {u, v} ∈ K such that λ(u)+λ(v) = 0.
Proof. Let K, λ be as in the corollary and suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that λ(u) + λ(v) 6= 0 for every edge {u, v} ∈ K. We now define a new
labelling µ : V (K) → {±1, . . . , ±(n + 1)} by µ(v) = (−1)|λ(v)| λ(v). Observe
that
µ(−v) = (−1)|λ(−v)| λ(−v) = −(−1)|λ(v)| λ(v) = −µ(v),
and if µ(u) = −µ(v), then λ(u) = −λ(v), and therefore µ(u) + µ(v) 6= 0
for every edge {u, v} ∈ K. Hence µ satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 2.1.
Therefore, there is an odd number of positive alternating n-simplices, i.e.,
simplices labelled {1, −2, . . . , (−1)n n, (−1)n+1 (n + 1)} by µ. Hence, there is
an odd number of simplices labelled {1, 2, . . . , n + 1} by λ. This contradicts
the assumption that every n-simplex in K has vertices of both signs. Hence,
there exists an edge {u, v} ∈ K such that λ(u) + λ(v) = 0.

We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.1.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. The case k = 2 (G = K2 ) and k = 3 (G is an odd
cylce) are trivial, so assume k > 3 and let G ∈ Mk . The graph G is obtained
from an odd cycle by k − 3 iterations of Mr (·), where the value of r can vary
from iteration to iteration. By repeated applications of Theorem 2.2 (k − 3
applications to be exact), there exists a symmetric triangulation K of S k−2
aligned with hemispheres, and a proper antisymmetric 2-colouring κ such
that G ∼
= G(K, κ). (To see this, observe that Mr (K2 ) is isomorphic to the
odd cycle C2r+1 , which is isomorphic to G(K, κ), where K is a symmetric
triangulation of S 1 —i.e., a graph—isomorphic to the cycle C4r+2 , and κ is
a proper 2-colouring of K. By choosing any pair of antipodal vertices of
K to be the hemispheres H0 and −H0 , it is clear that K is aligned with
hemispheres.) Let us say the colours used in κ are black and white.
Consider any (not necessarily proper) (k − 1)-colouring c : V (G) →
{1, . . . , k − 1}. By setting
(
+c(p(v)) if v is black
λ(v) =
−c(p(v)) if v is white,
we obtain an antisymmetric labelling λ : V (K) → {±1, . . . , ±(k − 1)} such
that every (k − 2)-simplex has vertices of both signs. By Corollary 3.1,
there exists an edge {u, v} ∈ K such that λ(u) + λ(v) = 0. Hence, the edge
{p(u), p(v)} ∈ E(G) satisfies c(p(u)) = |λ(u)| = |λ(v)| = c(p(v)), i.e., c is
not a proper colouring of G. This shows that χ(G) ≥ k.

4. Equivalence of the theorems of Borsuk–Ulam and Stiebitz
Let us recall the following construction due to Erdős and Hajnal [3].
The Borsuk graph BG(n, α) is defined as the (infinite) graph whose vertices
are the points of Rn+1 on S n , and the edges connect points at Euclidean
distance at least α, where 0 < α < 2. Using Theorem 1.2, it can be shown
that χ(G) ≥ n + 2 (in fact the two statements are equivalent, as noted by
Lovász [7]). Furthermore, by using the standard (n + 2)-colouring of S n
based on the central projection of a regular (n + 1)-simplex, it can be shown
that BG(n, α) is (n + 2)-chromatic for all α sufficiently large. In particular,
Simonyi and Tardos [14] p
have shown that BG(n, α) is (n + 2)-chromatic for
all α ≥ α0 , where α0 = 2 1 − 1/(n + 3).
We will need the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1. For every n ≥ 0 and every δ > 0, there exists G ∈ Mn+2
and a mapping f : V (G) → S n such that
√ kf (u) + f (v)k < δ, for every edge
{u, v} ∈ G. In particular, G ⊂ BG(n, 4 − δ2 ).

Proof. The proof is by induction on n. We take n = 1 as the base case, but
we remark that the statement is also true for n = 0, because K2 is the only
graph in M2 , and the two vertices u, v of K2 can be placed at antipodal
points of S 0 , so kf (u) + f (v)k = 0.
To see that the statement is true for n = 1, observe that M3 is the
family of odd cycles. The vertices of C2r+1 can be mapped to S 1 so that
f (u) and −f (v) are at angular distance π/(2r + 1), for every edge {u, v} ∈
E(G). Therefore, kf (u) + f (v)k = 2 sin(π/(4r + 2)). As r tends to infinity,
kf (u) + f (v)k tends to zero; in particular, for every δ > 0 there exists r such
that kf (u) + f (v)k < δ for every {u, v} ∈ E(C2r+1 ).
Now suppose the theorem is true for n ≥ 1. Fix a real number δ > 0.
By the induction hypothesis, there exists G ∈ Mn+2 and a mapping f :
V (G) → S n such that kf (u) + f (v)k < δ/2 for every {u, v} ∈ E(G). We let
r ≥ 2 be a large integer, to be specified shortly in the proof, and we define
a mapping f¯ : V (Mr (G)) → S n+1 by setting:
f¯(z) := (0, . . . , 0, (−1)r ),

f¯((v, i)) := f (v) cos(πi/2r), (−1)i sin(πi/2r) .
Fix an arbitrary edge {x, y} ∈ E(Mr (G)). We will show that kf¯(x) +
¯
f (y)k < δ. First, if x = (u, 0) and y = (v, 0), for some {u, v} ∈ E(G),
then clearly f¯(x) = (f (u), 0) and f¯(y) = (f (v), 0), so kf¯(x) + f¯(y)k =
kf (u) + f (v)k < δ/2.
Second, if {x, y} = {(u, i), (v, i + 1)}, for some {u, v} ∈ E(G), then applying the triangle inequality (twice) we get:


kf¯(x) + f¯(y)k ≤ f (u) cos(πi/2r) + f (v) cos(π(i + 1)/2r)
+ | sin(πi/2r) − sin(π(i + 1)/2r)|

≤ kf (u) + f (v)k · | cos(πi/2r)|

+ kf (v)k · | cos(πi/2r) − cos(π(i + 1)/2r)|
+ | sin(πi/2r) − sin(π(i + 1)/2r)|

≤ δ/2 + | cos(t) − cos(t + ε)| + | sin(t) − sin(t + ε)|,

where t = πi/2r, ε = π/2r. Since sin and cos are uniformly continuous,
having chosen r sufficiently large, we can assume that | cos(t) − cos(t +
ε)|, | sin(t) − sin(t + ε)| < δ/4 (for all t ∈ R in fact). So kf (x) + f (y)k < δ
as required.
Finally, if {x, y} = {(u, r − 1), z}, then we have
p
kf¯(x) + f¯(y)k = cos2 (π(r − 1)/2r) + (1 − sin(π(r − 1)/2r)))2
< δ,
where the inequality holds provided r was chosen sufficiently large, using
that cos(π(r − 1)/2r) approaches cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π(r − 1)/2r)) approaches sin(π/2) = 1 as r tends to infinity.
Thus, we have now shown that, provided r was chosen sufficiently large,
for every {x, y} ∈ E(Mr (G)) we have kf¯(x) + f¯(y)k < δ. The lemma follows
by induction.

We will now show how Theorem 1.2 can be deduced from Theorem 1.1
and Lemma 4.1.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Suppose
√ there exists a continuous antipodal map f :
S n → S n−1 . Set ε = 1/ n + 2. Since every continuous function on a
compact set is uniformly continuous, there exists δ > 0 such that if kx−yk <
δ, then kf (x) − f (y)k < 2ε.
By Lemma 4.1, there exists G ∈ Mn+2 and a mapping g : V (G) → S n
such that kg(u) + g(v)k < δ, for every edge {u, v} ∈ E(G). Therefore, the
mapping f ◦ g : V (G) → S n−1 satisfies kf (g(u)) + f (g(v))k < 2ε, for every
edge {u, v} ∈ G. Therefore, the Euclidean distance between f (g(u)) and
f (g(v)) is
p
p
kf (g(u)) − f (g(v))k > 2 1 − ε2 = 2 1 − 1/(n + 2),
so G ⊂ BG(n−1, α0 ), and thus χ(G) ≤ BG(n−1, α0 ) = n+1. On the other
hand, we have χ(G) ≥ n + 2 by Theorem 1.1. This contradiction proves that
there is no continuous antipodal map f : S n → S n−1 .
