Abstract

We are interested in situations where the Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff content of a
set are equal in the critical dimension. Our main result shows that this equality holds for any
subset of a self-similar set corresponding to a nontrivial cylinder of an irreducible subshift
of finite type, and thus also for any self-similar or graph-directed self-similar set, regardless
of separation conditions. The main tool in the proof is an exhaustion lemma for Hausdorff
measure based on the Vitali Covering Theorem.
We also give several examples showing that one cannot hope for the equality to hold
in general if one moves in a number of the natural directions away from ‘self-similar’.
For example, it fails in general for self-conformal sets, self-affine sets and Julia sets. We
also give applications of our results concerning Ahlfors regularity. Finally we consider an
analogous version of the problem for packing measure. In this case we need the strong
separation condition and can only prove that the packing measure and δ-approximate
packing pre-measure coincide for sufficiently small δ > 0.

Introduction

Hausdorff measure and dimension are among the most important notions in fractal geometry
and geometric measure theory used to quantify the size of a set. The Hausdorff content is a
concept closely related to the Hausdorff measure, but perhaps less popular in the context of
classical measure theory. That being said the Hausdorff content enjoys greater regularity than
the Hausdorff measure and still gives the Hausdorff dimension as the critical exponent. The goal
of this article is to understand further the relationship between Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff
content in the context of some well-known and popular classes of fractals sets. In particular we
are interested in when the Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff content of a set are equal in the
Hausdorff dimension. This study was motivated by a question of Michael Barnsley posed to one
of the authors.

Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff content

Let F ⊆ Rn . For s > 0 and δ > 0 the δ-approximate s-dimensional Hausdorff measure of F is
defined by

and the s-dimensional Hausdorff (outer) measure of F by Hs (F ) = limδ→0 Hδs (F ). If one does
not put any restriction on the diameters of the covering sets, then one obtains the Hausdorff
content of F , namely,

more subtle, and the case of interest. Then Hs (F ) may be zero, positive and finite, or ins (F ) must be finite if F is bounded. Moreover, if Hs (F ) = 0, then Hs (F ) = 0 also.

Sets with this property were studied by Foran [Fo], where they were called s-straight sets, and

[MM]. Another consequence is that Hδs (F ) = Hs (F ) for all δ > 0. For more details on Hausdorff
measure and dimension, see [F4, Chapter 3] and [R].

We conclude this section with a well-known observation and include the proof for completeness.

Main results: general situations where H∞
(F ) = Hs (F )

Let I = {0, . . . , M − 1} be a finite alphabet, let Σ = I N and σ : Σ → Σ be the one-sided left
shift. We will write i ∈ I, i = (i0 , . . . , ik−1 ) ∈ I k and α = (α0 , α1 , . . . ) ∈ Σ. We will also write
α|k = (α0 , . . . , αk−1 ) ∈ I k for the restriction of α to its first k coordinates. We equip Σ with the
standard metric defined by
d(α, β) = 2−n(α,β)
for α 6= β, where n(α, β) = max{n ∈ N : α|n = β|n }. We write I ∗ = ∪k∈N I k for the set of all
finite words. For i = (i0 , . . . , ik−1 ) ∈ I ∗ , we write

	
[i ] = α ∈ Σ : α|k = i

for the cylinder corresponding to i and we let |i | = k be the length of i . Also, even though the
shift is only defined on Σ, it will be convenient also to define it for i = (i0 , . . . , ik−1 ) ∈ I ∗ by

σ(i ) = σ (i0 , . . . , ik−1 ) = (i1 , . . . , ik−1 ).

Any closed σ-invariant set Λ ⊆ Σ is called a subshift. Among the most important subshifts are
subshifts of finite type which we define as follows. Let A be an M × M transition matrix indexed
by I × I with entries in {0, 1}. We define the subshift of finite type corresponding to A as
o
n
ΣA = α = (α0 α1 . . . ) ∈ Σ : Aαi ,αi+1 = 1 for all i = 0, 1, . . . .

If every entry of A is 1 then we call ΣA = Σ the full shift. We say ΣA is irreducible (or transitive)
if the matrix A is irreducible, which means that for all pairs i, j ∈ I, there exists n ∈ N such
that (An )i,j > 0. We say ΣA is aperiodic (or mixing) if the matrix A is aperiodic, which means
that there exists n ∈ N such that (An )i,j > 0 for all pairs i, j ∈ I simultaneously.
To each i ∈ I associate a similarity map Si on Rn with contraction ratio ri ∈ (0, 1)
which we assume for convenience maps [0, 1]n into itself. For i = (i0 , . . . , ik−1 ) ∈ I ∗ , write
Si = Si0 ◦ · · · ◦ Sik−1
and
ri = ri0 · · · rik−1 .

Let Π : Σ → [0, 1]n be the natural coding map given by
Π(α) =

Sα|k [0, 1]n .

For a given subshift of finite type ΣA , we are interested in the set FA := Π(ΣA ). The set
F := Π(Σ) corresponding to the full shift is called a self-similar set and is the unique non-empty
compact set satisfying
[
F =
Si (F ).
i∈I

The collection of contracting similarities {Si }i∈I is called an iterated function system (IFS), see
[F4, Chapter 9]. We will also be interested in subsets of FA corresponding to the cylinders of
ΣA . In particular, for i ∈ I ∗ , let
FAi = Π(ΣA ∩ [i ]),
which may be empty. It can be shown via the implicit theorems of Falconer [F1], [F3, Section
3.1] that if A is irreducible, then Hs (FA ) < ∞ where s = dimH FA . Moreover, if Hs (FA ) > 0,
then Hs (FAi ) > 0 for each i ∈ I ∗ for which FAi 6= ∅.
Theorem 2.1. Let A be irreducible and let s = dimH FA . For all i ∈ I ∗ we have

We will prove Theorem 2.1 in Section 6.2. It is natural to wonder if the equality is still satisfied
for the full set, and not just cylinders and unions of cylinders in the same family. We give an
example in Section 4 which shows that this is not true. Delaware [D2] proved that any set with
finite Hs measure is σs-straight, in that it can be decomposed as a countable union of s-straight
sets. This proved a conjecture of Foran [Fo]. Theorem 2.1 can be viewed as a strengthening of
this result in the very special case of subshifts of finite type for self-similar sets. In particular,
we prove that for irreducible A the set FA can be decomposed into a finite union of s-straight
sets
[
FAi .
FA =
i∈I

In this paper we only consider subshifts of finite type, but the same questions are valid for general
subshifts and we therefore ask the following natural question.

Question 2.2. Does there exists a system of similarities and a transitive subshift Λ ⊆ Σ, such
that


for some i ∈ I ∗ ?

Note that for general subshifts, being transitive means that there exists one dense orbit under
the left shift. Transitive subshifts of finite type are precisely those with irreducible A and so
Theorem 2.1 answers this question in the negative for subshifts of finite type.
Theorem 2.1 was shown for self-similar sets rather than subshifts of finite type by Bandt
and Graf [BG, Proposition 3] assuming the open set condition is satisfied. See [F4, Section 9.2]
for the definition and further properties of the open set condition. This result was generalised
by Farkas [Fa, Proposition 1.11] for self-similar sets without assuming any separation condition.
We state this result as a corollary of Theorem 2.1.
Corollary 2.3. Let F ⊆ [0, 1]n be a self-similar set and let s = dimH F . Then, regardless of
s (F ) = Hs (F ).

Proof. Since F is self-similar it is modelled by a full shift and thus for any i ∈ I
[
F =
FAj
j∈I:Ai,j =1

and so the result follows from Theorem 2.1.
We note here that if the Hausdorff measure of a set is zero in a particular dimension, then
the Hausdorff content is also zero in that dimension and so the equality is trivial. One might
initially wonder if HdimH F (F ) = 0 always holds when F is a self-similar set which cannot be
defined via a system which satisfies the open set condition, but this is false, see for example [Fa,
Example 8.6]. Thus this result provides nontrivial information even when the open set condition
is not satisfied. Recall that Schief [S] proved that Hs (F ) = 0 if F is a self-similar set defined via
a system which does not satisfy the open set condition and s is the similarity dimension but, as
the example of Farkas shows, one can obtain positive Hausdorff measure in the Hausdorff dimension if this is less than the similarity dimension, even if the open set condition cannot be satisfied.
A natural and important generalisation of self-similar sets is graph-directed self-similar
sets, which we now define. Let Γ = G(V, E) be a finite strongly connected directed multigraph
with vertices V = {1, . . . , N } and a finite multiset of edges E. Write Ei,j for the multiset of
all edges joining the vertex i to the vertex j. For each e ∈ E associate a contracting similarity
mapping Se on Rn with contraction ratio re ∈ (0, 1) which we again assume for convenience
maps [0, 1]n into itself. It is standard that there exists a unique family of non-empty compact
sets {Fi }i∈V satisfying
N [
[
Se (Fj ).
(2.1)
Fi =
j=1 e∈Ei,j

Each set in the family {Fi }i∈V is called a graph-directed self-similar set. Even though all selfsimilar sets are graph-directed self-similar sets, it was proved by Boore and Falconer [BF] that
graph-directed self-similar sets are genuinely more general than just self-similar sets. We obtain
the following generalisation of Corollary 2.3.
Corollary 2.4. Let F ⊆ [0, 1]n be a graph-directed self-similar set and let s = dimH F . Then,
s (F ) = Hs (F ).
regardless of separation conditions, H∞
Corollary 2.4 follows from Theorem 2.1 and the following proposition.
Proposition 2.5. Let {Fi }i∈V be the solution of a graph-directed self-similar iterated function
system with directed graph Γ = G(V, E). Then there exists a subshift of finite type associated
to the alphabet I = E such that every Fi is the union of 1-cylinders in the same family in the
sense of Theorem 2.1. If Γ is strongly connected then the constructed subshift of finite type is
irreducible.
Proof. Let the alphabet be indexed by the edge set E. Now, for two edges e, f ∈ E, let Ae,f = 1
if and only if f begins from the vertex where e ended, i.e., it is possible to walk along e and then
along f . If Γ is strongly connected, the matrix A is irreducible. It is now straightforward to see
that for all e ∈ Ei,j
FAe = Se (Fj )

and so for all i ∈ V we have
Fi =

[

FAe

j=1 e∈Ei,j

and, moreover, for any edge e which finishes at i
N
[

j=1

Ei,j = {f ∈ E : Ae,f = 1}

as required.
Proposition 2.5 says that the solution of every graph-directed self-similar iterated function system
is a subshift of finite type in some sense. This is a folklore result and appears for example in [LM,
Proposition 2.2.6]. The next proposition states that the converse is true which will be useful in
Section 5. Again this is a folklore result and appears for example in [LM, Proposition 2.3.9]. We
include both results and their simple proofs for completeness.
Proposition 2.6. Let ΣA be a subshift of finite type for the alphabet I where A has at least
one non-zero entry in every row. Then there exits a graph-directed self-similar iterated function
system with directed graph Γ = G(I, E) with solution {FAi }i∈I . If A is irreducible then Γ is
strongly connected.
Proof. We draw a directed edge e = ei,j from i to j if Ai,j = 1, let Se = Si and let E = {ei,j :
i, j ∈ I, Ai,j = 1}. If A is irreducible then Γ is strongly connected. We have that

and since there is a unique set of compact attractors associated to this graph-directed system,
the proposition follows.

2.1

Extension to k-block subshifts of finite type

We only consider 2-block subshifts of finite type in this paper, i.e. where the forbidden words
are of length 2, but note that our results can be extended to the more general k-block case,
where the forbidden words are of length k. This is a natural simplification to make, as one can
always reformulate a k-block subshift of finite type as a 2-block analogue over a larger alphabet,
see [LM, Theorem 2.3.2]. Moreover, this can be done so that the two systems are topologically
conjugate which means that for irreducible k-block systems the associated 2-block system remains
irreducible. The reformulation is straightforward and standard. The new alphabet is the set of
words of length (k − 1) such that there is an allowable word of length k beginning with that
word of length (k − 1). Then, the 2-word (over the new alphabet) consisting of (i0 , i1 , . . . , ik−2 )
followed by (i1 , i2 , . . . , ik−1 ) is allowed if and only if (i0 , i1 , . . . , ik−1 ) was allowed in the original
k-block system. There is a naturally induced homeomorphism which conjugates the k-block
system to the new 2-block system.

Ahlfors regularity and the weak separation property

Our results have applications in studying Ahlfors regularity of self-similar sets and related
fractals. Recall that a bounded set F ⊆ Rn with Hausdorff dimension s is called Ahlfors regular
if there exists a constant c > 1 such that for all r ∈ (0, diam(F )] and x ∈ F

c−1 r s 6 Hs F ∩ B(x, r) 6 cr s .

It is straightforward to show that for an Ahlfors regular set the Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff
content are equivalent in the Hausdorff dimension (equal up to a constant bound). It is also wellknown that a self-similar set satisfying the open set condition is Ahlfors regular. Our results
yield the following corollary.

Corollary 3.1. Let A be irreducible and let s = dimH FA . Then Hs (FA ) > 0 if and only if FA
is Ahlfors regular. Moreover, this extends to any cylinder, i.e., for all i ∈ I ∗ , Hs (FAi ) > 0 if and
only if FAi is Ahlfors regular.
Proof. We will prove the result for FA ; the result for cylinders is similar and omitted. Fix
r ∈ (0, diam(FA )] and x ∈ F . The lower bound is straightforward and follows by choosing a first
level cylinder with positive measure and then finding a copy of this cylinder inside FA ∩ B(x, r)
with diameter comparable to r and then applying the scaling property for Hausdorff measure.

completing the proof.
Observe that the above corollary also applies to any collection of cylinders in FA and in
particular to graph-directed self-similar sets. Also, no separation conditions are assumed.
Let F ⊆ Rn be a self-similar set, not contained in any affine hyperplane. Recall that
the weak separation property is satisfied if the identity map is not an accumulation point of the
set
{Si−1 ◦ Sj : i , j ∈ I ∗ }
equipped with the uniform norm, see [Z]. It was shown in [FHOR, Theorem 2.1] that if F satisfies
the weak separation property (which is weaker than the open set condition) then it is Ahlfors
regular. It was also shown [FHOR, Theorem 1.4] that if F does not satisfy the weak separation
condition then the Assouad dimension dimA F of F is greater than or equal to 1. In general the
Assouad dimension is an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension and we refer the reader to
[FHOR] for the definition. This allows us to prove the following corollary.

7

Corollary 3.2. Let F ⊆ Rn be a self-similar set with Hausdorff dimension s < 1 not contained
in any affine hyperplane. Then the following are equivalent:
(1) F satisfies the weak separation property
(2) Hs (F ) > 0
(3) 0 < Hs (F ) < ∞
(4) F is Ahlfors regular
(5) the Hausdorff and Assouad dimensions of F coincide.
Proof. Zerner [Z, Corollary after Proposition 2] proved that (1) ⇒ (2), (2) and (3) are equivalent since any self-similar set has finite Hausdorff measure in its Hausdorff dimension, see [F4,
Corollary 3.3], our result, Corollary 3.1, shows that (2) ⇔ (4), the fact that (4) ⇒ (5) is straightforward and folklore (see, for example, [T, Proposition 2.1 (viii)]), and since dimH F < 1 the
result mentioned above [FHOR, Theorem 1.4] shows that (5) ⇒ (1).
The fact that (2) ⇒ (1) provides a partial solution to a conjecture of Zerner, see the discussion
following Proposition 2 in [Z]. We note that Corollary 3.2 also shows that for self-similar sets
with Hausdorff dimension strictly less than 1, the weak separation property can be formulated
in a way which only depends on the set itself and not the defining iterated function system.
The additional assumption dimH F < 1 required in the above corollary seems a little strange
at first. However, it turns out that this condition is sharp. Firstly consider F in the line.
It is straightforward to construct a self-similar set F ⊆ [0, 1] which fails the weak separation
property, but for which H1 (F ) > 0. For example, use the contractions x 7→ x/2, x 7→ x/3 and
x 7→ x/2+1/2 and apply the argument from [Fr, Example 3.1] using the fact that log 2/ log 3 ∈
/ Q.
We use a variation of this example to prove the following proposition demonstrating the (almost)
sharpness of Corollary 3.2.
Proposition 3.3. For all n ∈ N \ {1} and all s ∈ (1, n], there exists a self-similar set F ⊆ [0, 1]n
not contained in any affine hyperplane such that
(1) F fails the weak separation property
(2) dimH F = s
(3) Hs (F ) > 0
Proof. Let r ∈ (0, 1/2] be chosen such that
s−1
log 2
=
=: t
− log r
n−1
and let F1 = [0, 1] be viewed as a self-similar attractor of an iterated function system which fails
the weak separation property and all of the maps have contraction ratio r. Such an iterated
function system can be constructed by modifying [BG, Section 2 (v)]. Also, let E ⊆ [0, 1]
be the self-similar set defined by the maps x 7→ rx and x 7→ rx + (1 − r), and observe that
dimH E = t and Ht (E) > 0 since the open set condition is satisfied, see [F4, Corollary 3.3].
Now let F = F1 × E n−1 ⊆ [0, 1]n be the product of F1 with n − 1 copies of E. It is easy to
see that F is not contained in any affine hyperplane and that it is a self-similar set defined via
the natural product iterated function system. It follows from [M, Theorem 8.10] that dimH F =
8

1 + (n − 1)t = s and that Hs (F ) > 0. Note that to compute the dimension of F here we used the
fact that the Hausdorff and packing dimensions coincide for any self-similar set [F3, Corollary
3.3]. Finally it is easy to see that the weak separation property fails by virtue of it failing in the
first coordinate.
For s = n in the above proposition our set F is just [0, 1]n , which is not very interesting. We
point out that it is possible to construct a set with the desired properties but which has empty
interior. For example, it was shown in [CJPPS] that there exists a self-similar set in the plane
with positive H2 measure, but empty interior, and by [Z, Theorem 3] such a set must fail the
weak separation property. We end this section by asking the natural question, an answer to
which would complete the study.
Question 3.4. Is it true that for all n ∈ N \ {1} there exists a self-similar set F ⊆ [0, 1]n not
contained in any affine hyperplane such that F fails the weak separation property, dimH F = 1
and H1 (F ) > 0?

Examples where H∞

In this section we give examples which show that equality of Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff
content in the critical dimension is actually a rather special property. In particular, we give
several examples falling into natural classes of set for which one might hope to be able to extend
Theorem 2.1, but for which equality does not hold. A natural situation to consider is attractors
of more general iterated function systems. In general an iterated function system (IFS) is a finite
collection of contractions {Si }i∈I on a compact metric space. The attractor of this system is the
unique non-empty compact set F satisfying
[
Si (F ).
F =
i∈I

See [F4, Chapter 9] and [Hu] for more details on iterated function systems. Two of the most
standard and important generalisations of self-similar sets are self-affine sets, where the defining
maps are affine maps on some Euclidean space, and self-conformal sets, where the defining maps
are conformal. We note that similarities are both affine and conformal. It is evident that for any
compact set F ⊂ Rn with Hausdorff dimension equal to 1, we have
1
H∞
(F ) 6 diam(F ).

However, if F is connected and not contained in a straight line, then
H1 (F ) > diam(F ).
This phenomenon provides us with several simple counter examples.
Self-affine sets: It was shown in [BK] that there exist self-affine curves C in the plane
which are differentiable at all but countably many points. In particular, these curves can have
finite length but not lie in a straight line (see [BK, Example 10] and [KV, Example 6.2]). Such
sets have Hausdorff dimension 1 and by the above argument satisfy
1

(C) < H1 (C) < ∞.

set and has

The maps in the defining IFS for A are z 7→ z and z 7→ i z, defined on a suitable open
domain containing A.
Julia sets: the unit circle S 1 is the Julia set for the complex map z 7→ z 2 and satisfies
1
H∞
(S 1 ) = 2 < 2π = H1 (S 1 ).
Sub-self-similar sets: Sub-self-similar sets, introduced by Falconer in [F2], are compact sets
F satisfying

for some IFS of similarities. For any such IFS with the unit square as its attractor, the boundary
of the unit square Q = ∂[0, 1]2 is a sub-self-similar set and satisfies

Finally we give two simple examples which show that Theorem 2.1 is sharp, in some sense.

Non-irreducible subshift of finite type: Consider the subshift of finite type on the
alphabet {0, 1, 2} given by the matrix

and associate any iterated function system consisting of three similarities on [0, 1] which map
[0, 1] to three disjoint intervals. Here A is not irreducible
and so does not fall into the class

A possible direction for further study on this topic would be to consider the classes of sets
studied in this section, namely, self-conformal, self-affine, sub-self-similar, or Julia sets, and try
to prove that the Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff content agree in some interesting subclass.
Alternatively, one could look for negative results, which prove that the Hausdorff measure and
Hausdorff content are always distinct in certain subclasses. Also, all of our counter examples in
these classes were using sets with dimension 1. Could there be different phenomena at work for
non-integral dimensions? We suspect not, but have not investigated this further. Note that we
s (F ) < Hs (F ) apart from for connected sets F
cannot give a simple condition guaranteeing H∞
not lying in a straight line with Hausdorff dimension s = 1. This is because such sets may be
s-straight by the result of Delaware mentioned previously [D2].

The question of packing measure

In this section we address the question of whether analogous results can be obtained for packing
measure and a suitably defined ‘packing content’. First we recall the definition of the packing
measure. Packing measure, defined in terms of packings, is a natural dual to Hausdorff measure,
which was defined in terms of covers. For s > 0 and δ > 0 the δ-approximate s-dimensional
packing pre-measure of F is defined by
X
∞
s
Pδ (F ) = sup
diam(Uk )s : {Uk }∞
k=1 is a countable collection of pairwise disjoint
k=1

closed balls centered in F with diam(Uk ) 6 δ for all k



and the s-dimensional packing pre-measure of F by P0s (F ) = limδ→0 Pδs (F ). To ensure countable
subadditivity, the packing (outer) measure of F is defined by
X
[ 

Fi .
P0 (Fi ) : F ⊆
P (F ) = inf

It follows from the definition that
P s (F ) 6 P0s (F ) 6 Pδs (F ).
Similar to the Hausdorff dimension, the packing dimension of F is defined to be
n
o
dimP F = inf s > 0 : P s (F ) = 0 .
11

(5.1)

The extra step in the definition of packing measure makes it often more difficult to handle than
the Hausdorff measure. However, in our setting there is a useful simplification due to Feng-HuaWen [FHW] and Haase [H].
Proposition 5.1. Let F be a compact subset of Rn with the property that for every open ball B
centered in F , there exists a bi-Lipschitz map S on Rn such that S(F ) ⊆ B ∩ F . Then for all
s > 0 we have
P s (F ) = P0s (F ).
Proof. For any compact set F ⊂ Rn , if P0s (F ) < ∞, then P s (F ) = P0s (F ), by the main result
in [FHW]. In the case when P0s (F ) = ∞, the additional assumption implies that P0s (B ∩ F ) = ∞
for all open balls intersecting F , which by [H, Lemma 4], implies that P s (F ) = ∞.

For this reason we can concern ourselves only with the packing pre-measure, which is easier to
understand. The first question is, how should we define the packing (pre) content? If we naively
define it by just removing the bounds on the diameters of the balls in the packing, then the answer is always infinity, as long as s > 0 and F 6= ∅. This is because one can just take a packing by
a single ball with unbounded diameter. Possible alternatives would be either to insist that there
are at least two balls in every packing, or to bound the radii by something concrete, such as the
diameter of F itself. However, it might be more natural to try to prove that for sufficiently small
δ, the equality P0s (F ) = Pδs (F ) is satisfied. We adopt this third approach. The next question
is, do we expect this to be true in the same setting as Theorem 2.1? An archetypal question being:
“If F is self-similar, then does there exists a δ0 > 0 such that for all δ ∈ (0, δ0 ) we
have
P s (F ) = P0s (F ) = Pδs (F )?”

One strange consequence of this would be that for such sets the packing measure is always strictly
positive. In the same way that Hδs (F ) is always finite for bounded sets, we have that Pδs (F ) is
always positive for arbitrary non-empty sets. Interestingly enough it was an important question
for about 15 years whether or not it was possible for a self-similar set to have zero packing
measure in its dimension, see [PS], but this was recently resolved by Orponen [O], who provided
a family of self-similar sets for whose elements F (of course not satisfying the open set condition)
P dimP F (F ) = 0. Thus the answer to the above question is immediately ‘no’. We have managed
to prove a weaker result, however, which we state after briefly recalling the strong separation
condition. This is a strictly stronger condition than the open set condition and is satisfied if the
images of the attractor under the maps in the defining system are pairwise disjoint. We also
recall that for any self-similar set, the packing measure must be finite in the packing dimension,
see [F3, Exercise 3.2].
Theorem 5.2. Let F ⊆ Rn be a self-similar set which satisfies the strong separation condition
and let s = dimP F . Then, there exists a δ0 > 0 such that for all δ ∈ (0, δ0 ) we have
0 < P s (F ) = P0s (F ) = Pδs (F ) < ∞.
We will prove Theorem 5.2 in Section 6.3. By the above discussion, this result does not extend to
F which do not satisfy the open set condition. It is also easy to see that it does not extend to the
open set condition case either. For example, the unit interval I is a self-similar set satisfying the
open set condition but not the strong separation condition. Elementary calculations yield that
P 1 (I) = 1, but that Pδ1 (I) = 1 + δ for all δ. We pose the question of whether the appropriate
converse of Theorem 5.2 is true.
12

Question 5.3. Does there exists a self-similar set F satisfying the open set condition, but for
which there is no IFS of similarities satisfying the strong separation condition with F as the
attractor, for which there exists a δ0 > 0 such that for all δ ∈ (0, δ0 ) we have
0 < P s (F ) = P0s (F ) = Pδs (F ) < ∞?
We generalise Theorem 5.2 for graph-directed self-similar sets and subshifts of finite type. A
graph-directed self-similar iterated function system satisfies the strong separation condition if
(2.1) is a disjoint union for every i.
Theorem 5.4. Let {Fi }i∈V be the solution of a graph-directed self-similar iterated function system which satisfies the strong separation condition and let s be the common packing dimension
of the sets {Fi }i∈V . Then, there exists a δ0 > 0 such that for all δ ∈ (0, δ0 ) and all i ∈ V we have
0 < P s (Fi ) = P0s (Fi ) = Pδs (Fi ) < ∞.
We will prove Theorem 5.4 in Section 6.3. Due to Proposition 2.6 it follows that this result
generalises to subshift of finite types.
Theorem 5.5. Let ΣA be an irreducible subshift of finite type on the alphabet I and let s =
dimP FA . Assume that
{FAj }j∈I:Ai,j =1

(5.2)

are disjoint for every i ∈ I. Then, there exists a δ0 > 0 such that for all δ ∈ (0, δ0 ) and all i ∈ I
we have



0 < P s FAi = P0s FAi = Pδs FAi < ∞.

Theorem 5.5 follows from Theorem 5.4 and Proposition 2.6 since (5.2) ensures that the strong
separation condition is satisfied for the graph-directed system in Proposition 2.6.

Proofs
A useful exhaustion lemma

In this section we prove an exhaustion lemma for Hausdorff measure, similar to [Fa, Proposition
1.9], which may be of interest in its own right. It shows that we can exhaust the Hausdorff
measure of a (potentially overlapping) subset of a self-similar set modelled by a subshift of finite
type by infinitely many, disjoint, images of first level cylinders. First we state a version of Vitali’s
covering theorem. Let H ⊂ Rn . A collection of sets A is called a Vitali cover of H if for each
x ∈ H and δ > 0 there exist A ∈ A with x ∈ A and 0 < diam(A) < δ.
Proposition 6.1. Let H ⊂ Rn be a Hs -measurable set with Hs (H) < ∞ and B1 , . . . , Bm ⊂ Rn
be closed sets with 0 < diam(Bi ) < ∞ and 0 < Hs (Bi ) < ∞ for all i ∈ {1, . . . , m}. Let A be a
Vitali cover of H such that every element of A is similar to Bi for some i ∈ {1, . . . , m} and every
element of A is a subset of H. Then
S there exists a disjoint sequence of sets (finite or countable)
A1 , A2 , . . . ∈ A such that Hs (H \ ( ∞
i=1 Ai )) = 0.

13

Proof. Assume that A1 , A2 , . . . ∈ A is a disjoint sequence of sets. Let M = max16i6m
If Ai is similar to Bj then
diam(Ai )s = Hs (Ai )
Hence

Thus the proposition follows from a version of Vitali’s covering theorem [F5, Theorem 1.10].

Proof of Theorem 5.2 and Theorem 5.4

Proof of Theorem 5.2. Let F ⊆ Rn be the self-similar attractor of the IFS {Si }i∈I and assume
F satisfies the strong separation
S condition. This implies that we can find a bounded open set
O ⊆ Rn such that F ⊂ O and i∈I Si (O) ⊆ O is a disjoint union. Let
δ0 =

1
inf inf |x − y|
2 x∈F y∈Rn \O

which is strictly positive since F is closed.
First assume that Pδs (F ) < ∞ for every δ ∈ (0, δ0 ). Later we will see that Pδs (F ) = ∞
is impossible for δ ∈ (0, δ0 ). Let ε > 0, let δ ∈ (0, δ0 ) and let {Bk }k∈K be a countable collection
of disjoint closed balls centered in F with diameter less than or equal to δ which satisfies

by the Hutchinson-Moran formula for (packing) dimension [Hu]. Taking the limit as η → 0 and
noting that ε > 0 was arbitrary, yields P s (F ) = P0s (F ) > Pδs (F ). The reverse inequality is
always satisfied by (5.1), which completes the proof.
Now assume that Pδs (F ) = ∞ for some δ ∈ (0, δ0 ). Via a similar argument to the one
above, this implies that Pηs (F ) > K for every K > 0 and hence P0s (F ) = ∞ but this is a
contradiction since every self-similar set has finite packing measure (and pre-measure) in the
packing dimension, see [F3, Exercise 3.2].
The reason this proof cannot be extended to the open set condition case is because in
that case the number δ0 may be zero and iterations of packings may no longer be packings.
This is one of the reasons packings are sometimes more difficult to control than covers. The
proof of Theorem 5.4 is similar and we just provide a sketch. First we prove a simple lemma.
We say v 6 v ′ for vectors v, v ′ ∈ RN if each entry in v is less than or equal to the corresponding
entry in v ′ . We say that v is non-negative if 0 6 v. Similar notations apply to matrices.
Lemma 6.3. Let A be a non-negative irreducible matrix of spectral radius 1 and x be a nonnegative vector such that Am x 6 x for large enough m. Then Ax = x.
Proof. Observe that Am is also an irreducible matrix with spectral radius 1. Hence it follows from
[BP, Theorem 1.3.28] that Am x = x and therefore Ax = x by the Perron-Frobenius theorem.
Proof of Theorem 5.4. Let As be the matrix with (i, j)th entry given by
X
Asi,j =
res .
e∈Ei,j

Let s be the unique value for which the spectral radius of the matrix As is 1. Let u⊺ =
(P s (F1 ), ..., P s (FN )). If Γ is strongly connected then As is irreducible. If further the strong
19

separation condition is satisfied then 0 < P s (Fi ) < ∞ for every i and As u = u (see [F3, Corollary 3.5]. Let u⊺δ = (Pδs (F1 ), ..., Pδs (FN )). Since the strong separation condition is satisfied there
exists a collection of open sets {Oi }i∈V such that Fi ⊆ Oi and
N [
[

j=1 e∈Ei,j

Se (Oj ) ⊆ Oi

is a disjoint union for every i. Let
δ0 =

1
min inf
inf |x − y|.
2 i∈V x∈Fi y∈Rn \Oi

A similar argument to the proof of Theorem 5.2 shows that for large enough m depending on η
we have that
(As )m uδ 6 uη 6 uδ
(6.8)
for δ ∈ (0, δ0 ) and 0 < η < δ. It follows by Lemma 6.3 that equality holds in (6.8). Hence
uδ = uη = u for 0 < η < δ < δ0 .
