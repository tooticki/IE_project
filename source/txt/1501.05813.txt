Abstract
A number of landmark existence theorems of nonlinear functional analysis follow in a simple and direct way from the basic separation of convex
closed sets in finite dimension via elementary versions of the KnasterKuratowski-Mazurkiewicz principle - which we extend to arbitrary topological vector spaces - and a coincidence property for so-called von Neumann relations. The method avoids the use of deeper results of topological
essence such as the Brouwer fixed point theorem or the Sperner’s lemma
and underlines the crucial role played by convexity. It turns out that the
convex KKM principle is equivalent to the Hahn-Banach theorem, the
Markov-Kakutani fixed point theorem, and the Sion-von Neumann minimax principle.

Introduction

The aim of this expository paper is to show that a number of landmark results of
nonlinear functional analysis can be quickly obtained from a particular version
of the KKM principle at little cost. This ”elementary KKM principle” is due to
A. Granas and M. Lassonde in the framework of super-reflexive Banach spaces
[10]. It is extended to arbitrary topological vector spaces, under a more general
compactness hypothesis, with a simpler proof based on the separation of closed
convex subsets in a Euclidean space (a result usually discussed in a first course
of continuous optimization) and an intersection theorem of V. L. Klee [17]. A
similar approach is followed to formulate a coincidence theorem for so-called
von Neumann relations.
The methods outlined here allow for a shorter and simpler alternative treatment of existence results of functional analysis that avoids involved and deeper
principles that require sophistication and investment in time. The KKM principle is a striking example of such fundamental results. Indeed, using the Sperner
lemma as a starting point, three of the greatest topologists of all times, Polish academician S. Mazurkiewicz and two of his former doctoral students, B.
Knaster and K. Kuratowski published in 1929 the celebrated KKM lemma: a
remarkable intersection theorem for closed covers of a Euclidean simplex [18].
They used the KKM lemma to provide a combinatorial proof of the Brouwer
fixed point theorem (the two results being in fact equivalent). In 1961, Ky Fan
extended the KKM Lemma to vector spaces of arbitrary dimensions in what be-

2

came known as the KKM principle [12]. The KKM principle inspired countless
mathematicians, yielding a formidable body of work in nonlinear and convex
analysis; a production known today as the KKM theory. The reader is referred
to Dugundji-Granas [7], Park [20] and Yuan [22] for surveys of results, methods,
and applications of the KKM theory.
The particular version of the KKM principle discussed here, which we call
the convex KKM principle, is more than sufficient to prove in a direct and
economical way, such fundamental results as the Stampacchia Theorem on variational inequalities, the Mazur-Schauder theorem on the minimization of lower
semicontinuous quasiconvex and coercive functionals, and the Markov-Kakutani
fixed point theorem for commuting families of affine transformations (see e.g.,
Brézis [6]). It is well-known, since Kakutani [16], that the Hahn-Banach theorem can be derived from the Markov-Kakutani fixed point theorem. Thus, the
equivalence between the Hahn-Banach theorem, Klee’s intersection theorem, the
convex KKM principle, and the Markov-Kakutani fixed point theorem is thus
established.

Preliminaries

The fundamental tool for our proof of the convex KKM theorem is the separation
of a point and a closed convex set in a finite dimensional space. For the sake
of completeness, we include the basic separation properties in finite dimensions
with the simplest of proofs (see e.g., Magill and Quinzii [19])

Lemma 1 Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of Rn and let x ∈
/ C.
Denote by y = PC (x) the projection of x onto C. Then the hyperplane HCx

3

orthogonal to u = x − y passing through y strictly separates x and C, namely:

hu, zi ≤ hu, yi < hu, xi, ∀z ∈ C

Proof. Since C is closed and convex, the projection y = PC (x) of x onto C is
unique. Define, for any given z ∈ C, a functional ϕz : [0, 1] −→ R by:
ϕz (t) := kx − (tz + (1 − t)yk2 .
As y is closest to x, ϕz (t) achieves its minimum on [0, 1] at t = 0, thus ϕ′z (0) ≥ 0.
Since ϕ′z (t) = 2tky − zk2 + 2hx − y, y − zi, it follows ϕ′z (0) = 2hx − y, y − zi =
2hu, y−zi ≥ 0, i.e., hu, zi ≤ hu, yi. On the other hand, 0 < kx−yk2 = hu, x−yi =
hu, xi − hu, yi. Thus, hu, zi ≤ hu, yi < hu, xi.
Proposition 2 Let K and C be disjoint convex subsets of Rn with K compact
and C closed. Then, C and K are strictly separated by a hyperplane H, i.e.,
there exists u ∈ Rn , u 6= 0, with sup hu, xi < min
hu, x′ i.
′
x∈C

x ∈K

Proof. Since C is closed and K is compact, the set C − K := {y ∈ Rn : y =
x − x′ , x ∈ C, x′ ∈ K} is also closed. It is, moreover, convex as the difference of
convex sets. Since C ∩ K = ∅, then 0 ∈
/ C − K. Lemma 1 applies, yielding for
u = 0 − PC−K (0), the inequalities: hu, zi ≤ hu, −ui < hu, 0i = 0, ∀z ∈ C − K.
Thus, as z = x − x′ , x ∈ C, x′ ∈ K,
hu, xi ≤ hu, x′ i − kuk2 < hu, x′ i, ∀x ∈ C, ∀x′ ∈ K.

A refinement of a fundamental intersection theorem of V. L. Klee for families
of closed convex subsets of Rn (see Klee [17] and Berge [5]) plays a crucial role
in our proof. We provide here a simple proof based on Proposition 2.
Topological vector spaces (t.v.s. for short), as well as topological spaces, are
assumed to be Hausdorff (T2 ). Vector spaces are assumed real (or complex)
and the convex hull of a subset A of a vector space is denoted by conv(A).
Proposition 3 ([11]) Let C1 , . . . , Cn , be non empty closed convex sets in a
t.v.s. E such that:
Sn
(i) C = i=1 Ci is convex, and
(ii) each k of them, 1 ≤ k < n, have a common point.
Tn
Then i=1 Ci 6= ∅.
Proof. The proof goes along the lines of Klee’s proof [17]. One may assume
with no loss of generality that the sets Ci , i = 1, . . . , n, are compact convex
subsets of a finite dimensional space. Indeed, one could consider the convex
finite polytope Ĉ := Conv({yj : j = 1, . . . , n}), where, for each j = 1, · · · , n,
T
the points yj ∈ ni=1,i6=j Ci are provided by (ii), and define Ĉi := Ci ∩ Ĉ.
S
Clearly, all the sets Ĉ1 , . . . , Ĉn , Ĉ = ni=1 Ĉi are compact convex sets in a finite
Tn
Tn
dimensional subspace of E and i=1 Ci 6= ∅ ⇐⇒ i=1 Ĉi 6= ∅.
If n = 1, the thesis clearly holds. Assume, for a contradiction that for n ≥ 2,
Tn

i=1

Ci = ∅ and let us show that (i) must fail if (ii) holds true. The proof is by

induction on n.
If n = 2, (ii) asserts that both C1 and C2 are nonempty and, while they are
disjoint, their union C = C1 ∪ C2 cannot be convex and thus (i) fails.
Tk−1
Tk−1
Suppose that for n = k − 1, it holds ( i=1 Ci = ∅ and i=1,i6=j Ci 6= ∅) =⇒
Sk−1
i=1 Ci is not convex.
Let n = k, and let {Ci }ki=1 be a collection of compact convex sets such
Tk−1
Tk
that Ck ∩ i=1 Ci = ∅ and ∀j = 1, ..., k, i=1,i6=j Ci 6= ∅. By Proposition
5

2, the disjoint compact convex sets Ck and

Tk−1
i=1

Ci can be strictly separated

by a hyperplane H. Putting, for each i = 1, . . . , k, Ci′ := H ∩ Ci , it follows
Tk−1
that Ck′ and i=1 Ci′ are empty. Moreover, for a given arbitrarily chosen j0 ∈
Tk−1
T
Ci be
{1, . . . , k − 1}, let y0 ∈ ki=1,i6=j0 Ci , thus y0 ∈ Ck , and let yk ∈ i=1
arbitrarily chosen. Clearly, the points y0 and yk are both in the larger convex
Tk−1
set i=1,i6
=j0 Ci and are also strictly separated by H. The intersection z̄ of the
Tk−1
line segment [y0 , yk ] with H belongs to i=1,i6=j0 Ci ∩ H. j0 being arbitrary,
Tk−1
k−1
hypothesis (ii) is verified for the collection {Ci′ }i=1
and i=1 Ci′ = ∅. By the
Sk−1
Sk−1
induction hypothesis, i=1 Ci′ = i=1 (Ci ∩H) is not convex. Since H ∩Ck = ∅,
Sk−1
Sk
it follows that i=1 (Ci ∩ H) = i=1 (Ci ∩ H) is not convex and the proof is
complete.

Remark 4 Proposition 3 is due to A. Ghouila-Houri [11] and slightly extends
the following result of V. L. Klee (see also C. Berge [6]):
Klee’s Theorem [17]: Let C and C1 , . . . , Cn be closed convex sets in a
Sn
Tn
Euclidean space satisfying: (i) C ⊆ i=1 Ci and (ii) C ∩ i=1,i6=j Ci 6= ∅ for any
Tn
Tn
j = 1, 2, ..., n. Then C ∩ i=1 Ci 6= ∅. This can be restated: (C ∩ i=1,i6=j Ci 6= ∅
Tn
Sn
and C ∩ i=1 Ci = ∅) =⇒ C * i=1 Ci .

The Convex KKM Theorem

We use the following terminology of Dugundji-Granas (see [7]):

Definition 5 Given an arbitrary subset X be of a vector space E, a set-valued
map Γ : X −→ 2E is said to be a KKM map if for every finite subset {x1 , . . . , xn } ⊆
X it holds:
conv({x1 , . . . , xn }) ⊂

6

[n

i=1

Γ(xi ).

Theorem 6 (Convex KKM Theorem) Let E be a t.v.s., ∅ =
6 X ⊆ Y ⊆ E with
Y convex. If Γ : X −→ 2Y is a set-valued map verifying:
(i) Γ is a KKM map;
(ii) all values of Γ are non-empty, closed and convex.
Then, the family {Γ(x)}x∈X has the finite intersection property.
If in addition, there exists a non-empty subset X0 of X contained in a convex
T
T
compact subset D of Y such that x∈X0 Γ(x) is compact, then x∈X Γ(x) 6= ∅.
Proof. We prove that Proposition 3 is equivalent to Theorem 6.
(=⇒) Let Γ : X −→ 2Y be a KKM map with closed convex values. We
T
show by induction on n that conv({x1 , . . . , xn }) ∩ ni=1 Γ(xi ) 6= ∅, for any finite
subset {x1 , . . . , xn } of X.
When n = 1, x1 = conv({x1 }) ⊂ Γ(x1 ).
Assume that the conclusion holds true for any set with n = k elements, and
let n = k + 1. Put C = conv({x1 , . . . , xn }) and Ci = Γ(xi ) ∩ C. Since Γ is KKM,
Sn
Sn
Sn
C ⊆ i=1 Γ(xi ) which implies C = i=1 (Γ(xi ) ∩ C) = i=1 Ci , a convex set.
By the induction hypothesis, for each i, we have conv({x1 , . . . , x̂i , . . . , xn }) ∩
Tn
Tn
i=1 (Γ(xi ) ∩ C) 6= ∅, i.e.,
j=1,j6=i Γ(xj ) 6= ∅. Proposition 4 implies that
Tn
i=1 Γ(xi ) 6= ∅.
(⇐=) Assume C1 , . . . , Cn , C =

Sn

i=1

C are closed convex sets in a topological

vector space satisfying hypotheses (i) and (ii) of Proposition 3 above.
Tn
For each j, let xj ∈ i=1,i6=j Ci and consider X = {xj }nj=1 . The set C
being convex, conv(X) ⊆ C and for all j, i with j 6= i, xj ∈ Ci , which implies that Ai = conv({xj }nj=1,j6=i ) ⊂ Ci . Define Γ : X −→ 2C by Γ(xi ) := Ci
for each i = 1, ..., n. The values of Γ are clearly closed and convex. Also,
Sn
Sn
conv(X) ⊆ C = i=1 (Ci ∩ C) = i=1 Γ(xi ), and for each {xi1 , . . . , xik } ⊂ X,
we have conv({xi1 , . . . , xik }) ⊂ Aij ⊂ Cij = Γ(xij ) for some j 6= 1, . . . , k. Hence
7

Sk
conv({xi1 , . . . , xik }) ⊂ j=1 Γ(xij ), i.e., Γ is a KKM map. By the convex KKM
Tn
Tn
theorem, i=1 Γ(xi ) 6= ∅, thus i=1 Ci 6= ∅.
T
Assuming for a moment that x∈X Γ(x) is contained in a compact subset
T
K of Y, then the conclusion x∈X Γ(x) 6= ∅ would follow at once from the
characterization of compactness in terms of families of closed subsets having
the finite intersection property.
Observe now that the restriction/compression map Γ0 : X0 −→ 2D defined by Γ0 (x) := Γ(x) ∩ D, x ∈ X0 , has compact convex values and is also a
KKM map. Indeed, for any subset {x1 , . . . , xn } ⊆ X0 , conv({x1 , . . . , xn }) ⊂
Sn
Sn
T
T
( i=1 Γ(xi )) ∩ D = i=1 Γ0 (xi ). Therefore, x∈X0 Γ(x) ⊇ x∈X0 Γ0 (x) 6= ∅.
T
T
The conclusion follows immediately from the fact that x∈X Γ(x) ⊆ x∈X0 Γ(x)
is compact and non-empty.
Remark 7 (i) Theorem 6 is an extension to topological vector spaces of the
elementary KKM theorem of Granas-Lassonde, stated in the context of superreflexive Banach spaces [10].
(ii) Theorem 6 obviously follows from the KKM principle of Ky Fan [12]
where the values of Γ are not assumed to be convex. The latter requires, however,
much more involved analytical or topological results. Indeed, the Ky Fan KKM
principle is equivalent to Sperner’s lemma, to the Brouwer fixed point theorem,
and to the Browder-Ky Fan fixed point theorem (see e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
(iii) In this generality, the compactness condition in the KKM principle is
due to Ky Fan [14]. It obviously extends the earlier compactness conditions:
Y is also compact, or all values of Γ are compact, or a single value Γ(x0 ) is
Tn
compact, or i=1 Γ(xi ) is compact for some finite subset {x1 , . . . , xn ) of X.
Naturally, the convex KKM theorem can be expressed as an equivalent fixed
point property for what we call a von Neumann relation. Given a subset A of a

8

cartesian product of two sets X × Y, denote by A(x) and A−1 (y) the respective
sections {y ∈ Y : (x, y) ∈ A} and {x ∈ X : (x, y) ∈ A}; denote by A−1 the
subset {(y, x) : (x, y) ∈ A}.
Definition 8 A von Neumann relation is a subset A of a cartesian product
X × Y, where X and Y are subsets of topological vector spaces, satisfying:
(i) for every x ∈ X, the section A(x) is convex and non-empty;
(ii) for every y ∈ Y, the section A−1 (y) is open in X and X \ A−1 (y) is
convex.
Denote by N (X, Y ) the class of von Neumann relations in X × Y and by
N −1 (X, Y ) := {A : X −→ 2Y : A−1 ∈ N (Y, X)}.
Note that von Neumann relations are particular cases of F ∗ −maps (applications de Ky Fan) introduced in [3].
Theorem 9 (Fixed Point for N −maps) Let E be a t.v.s., ∅ 6= Y ⊆ X ⊆ E with
X convex, and let A ∈ N (X, Y ). If there exist a compact subset K of X and a
compact convex subset D of Y such that for every x ∈ X \ K, A(x) ∩ D 6= ∅,
then A has a fixed point, i.e., (x̂, x̂) ∈ A for some x̂ ∈ X.
Proof. Define Γ : Y −→ 2X as Γ(y) := Y \ A−1 (y), y ∈ Y. Clearly, Γ has closed
and convex values. Also, obviously, A(x) = Y \ Γ−1 (x), for any x ∈ X.
One readily verifies that the compactness condition in Theorem 9 is equivalent to the compactness condition in Theorem 6. Indeed, (x ∈
/ K =⇒ ∃y ∈
T
A(x) ∩ D) ⇐⇒ ((∀y ∈ D, y ∈
/ A(x)) =⇒ x ∈ K) ⇐⇒ ( y∈D Γ(y) ⊆ K). The
T
intersection y∈D Γ(y) being closed in K which is compact, is also compact.
T
For any subset Y0 of D, it also holds y∈Y0 Γ(y) is a compact subset of K.
The fact that all sections A(x), x ∈ X, are non-empty rules out the theT
sis of Theorem 6 (indeed, (A(x) 6= ∅, ∀x ∈ X) ⇐⇒ y∈Y Γ(y) = ∅). Therefore Γ cannot be a KKM map, i.e., there exist {y1 , . . . , yn } ⊆ Y and ŷ ∈
9

Sn
conv({y1 , . . . , yn }) with ŷ ∈
/ i=1 Γ(yi ), which (by DeMorgan’s law) is equivTn
alent to ŷ ∈ i=1 A−1 (yi ) ⇐⇒ {y1 , . . . , yn } ⊆ A(ŷ). Since A(ŷ) is convex,
ŷ ∈ A(ŷ) and the proof is complete.
Remark 10 (i) The proof of Theorem 9 clearly establishes its equivalence with
Theorem 6.
(ii) Theorem 9 is a particular instance of the Browder-Ky Fan fixed point
theorem (where the convexity of X \ A−1 (y) in Definition 8 is dispensed with;
see e.g., [2, 3, 4]).
(iii) Note that if X is compact, the compactness condition in Theorem 9 is
vacuously satisfied with K = X. To the best of our knowledge, in this generality
and in the context of the Browder-Ky Fan fixed point theorem, this condition
was first introduced in [2, 3] in 1982. It builds on the so-called Karamardian
coercivity condition for complementarity problems (early seventies), taken up in
1977 by Allen in the context of fixed point theorems for set-valued maps (case
where K = C); see [2, 3, 9] for references and details.
We end this section with a coincidence theorem between N and N −1 maps
with a direct proof based on Proposition 3. We shall make use of a well-known
selection property enjoyed by F ∗ −maps of [2], thus by N −maps (see [2, 3]).
Lemma 11 Let A ∈ N (X, Y ) with Y convex. For any compact subset K of
X, there exist a continuous (single-valued) mapping s : K −→ Y and a convex
compact finite polytope P ⊆ Y such that s(x) ∈ A(x) ∩ P for all x ∈ K.
S
Proof. Since ∀x ∈ X, A(x) 6= ∅, then X = y∈Y A−1 (y), a union of open subSn
sets of X. By compactness, K ⊆ i=1 A−1 (yi ) for some finite subset {y1 , . . . , yn } ⊂
Y. Let {λi : K −→ [0, 1]}ni=1 be a continuous partition of unity subordinated to
the open cover {A−1 (yi )}ni=1 , and define s : K −→ P = conv({y1 , . . . , yn }) ⊂ Y
Pn
by putting s(x) := i=1 λi (x)yi , x ∈ K. Clearly, for a given x ∈ K, λi (x) 6=
10

0 =⇒ x ∈ A−1 (yi ) ⇐⇒ yi ∈ A(x). The section A(x) being convex, the convex
combination s(x) ∈ A(x) ∩ P.
Theorem 12 (Coincidence (N , N −1 )) Let X and Y be two non-empty convex
subsets in topological vector spaces, and let A ∈ N (X, Y ), B ∈ N −1 (X, Y ).
If one of the following compactness conditions holds: (i) Y is compact; or
(ii) X is compact; or (iii) there exist a compact subset K of X and a compact
convex subset C of Y with A(x) ∩ C 6= ∅, ∀x ∈ X \ K; then A ∩ B 6= ∅.
Proof. Let it be made clear, first, that (i) =⇒ (iii) and (ii) =⇒ (iii). Indeed, if
Y is compact, take C = Y and K = ∅ in (iii). If X is compact, take K = X and
(iii) is vacuously satisfied. Moreover, due to Lemma 11, (iii) can be reduced
to (i). Indeed, assume that (iii) holds. Lemma 11 implies the existence of a
convex finite polytope P ⊂ Y and a continuous mapping s : K −→ Y with
s(x) ∈ A(x) ∩ P for all x ∈ K. Now, if x ∈ X \ K, A(x) ∩ C 6= ∅ where C ⊂ Y
is convex and compact. Consider the convex hull Ŷ = conv(P ∪ C), a compact
subset of Y (the convex envelope of two compact convex sets in a topological
vector space is also compact convex). It is clear that the map Â : X −→ 2Ŷ given
by Â(x) := A(x)∩ Ŷ , x ∈ X, defines a von Neumann relation, i.e., Â ∈ N (X, Ŷ ).
Also, the mapping B̂ : X −→ 2Ŷ given by B̂(x) := B(x) ∩ Ŷ , x ∈ X, verifies
B̂ ∈ N −1 (X, Ŷ ). A coincidence for the pair (Â, B̂) is also a coincidence for
(A, B).
It suffices, thus, to show that A ∩ B 6= ∅ under hypothesis (i), i.e., when Y is
compact. Since ∀y ∈ Y, B −1 (y) 6= ∅, it follows that {B(x)}x∈X forms an open
cover of Y. Similarly, {A−1 (y)}y∈Y is an open cover of X. Let {B(xi )}ni=1 be a
finite subcover of Y, let D := conv({x1 , . . . , xn }), a convex compact subset of X,
and let {A−1 (yj )}m
j=1 be an open subcover of D. Consider the convex compact
subset M := conv({y1 , . . . , ym }) of Y. M can be covered by a subfamily of
{B(xi )}ni=1 , which, for simplicity we also denote {B(xi )}ni=1 . We can assume
11

with no loss of generality that {B(xi )}ni=1 and {A−1 (yj )}m
j=1 are minimal covers
Sn
of M and D respectively. That is, for any k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, M * i=1,i6=k B(xi ),
Sm
and for any l ∈ {1, . . . , m}, D * j=1,j6=l A−1 (yj ). Consider the compact convex
sets Mi = M \ B(xi ) for for i = 1, . . . , n, and Dj = D \ A−1 (yj ) for j =
S
T
1, . . . , m. The fact that M ⊆ ni=1 B(xi ) is equivalent to ni=1 Mi = ∅, and
S
T
−1
D⊆ m
(yj ) is equivalent to m
j=1 A
j=1 Dj = ∅. The minimality of the covers
Tn
{B(xi )}ni=1 and {A−1 (yj )}m
j=1 amounts to M ∩
i=1,i6=k Mi 6= ∅ for any k ∈
Tm
{1, . . . , n}, and D ∩ j=1,j6=l Dj 6= ∅ for any l ∈ {1, . . . , m}. All conditions of
Klee’s theorem (see Remark 4) are thus satisfied for both families of compact
Sn
convex sets {M, M1 , . . . , Mn } and {D, D1 , . . . , Dm }. Hence, M * i=1 Mi and
Sm
/ Mi for all i = 1, . . . , n, and let x0 ∈ D
D * j=1 Dj . Let y0 ∈ M but y0 ∈
but x0 ∈
/ Dj for all j = 1, . . . , m. Clearly, y0 ∈ B(xi ) ⇐⇒ xi ∈ B −1 (y0 ) for
all i = 1, . . . , n, and x0 ∈ A−1 (yj ) ⇐⇒ yj ∈ A(x0 ) for all for all j = 1, . . . , m.
The sections B −1 (y0 ) and A(x0 ) being convex sets, it follows that x0 ∈ D =
conv({x1 , . . . , xn }) ⊂ B −1 (y0 ) and y0 ∈ M = conv({y1 , . . . , ym }) ⊂ A(x0 ). The
proof is finished as (x0 , y0 ) ∈ A ∩ B.

Analytic Formulations and Applications

This section illustrates how the geometric results in the preceding section, Theorems 6, 9, and 12, are key in deriving a number of landmark results in functional
analysis. Intersection theorems as well as fixed point and coincidence theorems
have analytical formulations as solvability theorems for systems of nonlinear
inequalities (see [1, 2, 3, 4, 9]). These analytical formulations are often more
practical when it comes to applications. We start with the analytical formulation of the convex KKM principle (equivalently, the fixed point theorem for von
Neumann relations) and we derive from it, in a simple and straightforward way,
two fundamental results.

4.1

Alternatives for Systems of Nonlinear Inequalities and
Applications

Theorems 6 and 9 can be expressed in terms of an alternative for nonlinear
systems of inequalities à la Ky Fan.
Recall first the basic concepts of semicontinuity and quasiconvexity for real
functions.

Definition 13 A real function f : X −→ R defined on a subset X of a t.v.s is:
(i) quasiconvex if ∀λ ∈ R, the level set {x ∈ X; f (x) ≤ λ} is a convex subset
of X;
(ii) quasiconcave if −f is quasiconvex;
(iii) lower semicontinuous (l.s.c.) if ∀λ ∈ R, the level set {x ∈ X; f (x) ≤ λ}
is a closed subset of X;
(iv) upper semicontinuous (u.s.c.) if −f is l.s.c..

Naturally, every convex functional is quasiconvex and the converse is false.
Also, a real function on a topological space is continuous if and only if it is both
upper and lower semicontinuous.
Theorem 14 Let X be a convex subset of a t.v.s. E, Y a non-empty subset of
X, and f : X × Y −→ R a function satisfying:
(i) x 7→ f (x, y) is l.s.c. and quasiconvex on X, for each fixed y ∈ Y.
(ii) y 7→ f (x, y) quasiconcave on Y, for each fixed x ∈ X;
Assume that for a given λ ∈ R, there exist a compact subset K of X and a
convex compact subset D of Y
such that ∀x ∈ X \ K, ∃y ∈ D with f (x, y) > λ.
Then the following alternative holds:
(A) there exists x0 ∈ X such that f (x0 , x0 ) > λ, or
13

(B) there exists x̄ ∈ Y such that f (x̄, y) ≤ λ, for all y ∈ Y.
Consequently, when λ = supx∈X f (x, x), (A) is impossible and

inf sup f (x, y) ≤ sup f (x, x).

x∈X y∈Y

x∈X

Proof. Let A(x) := {y ∈ Y : f (x, y) > λ}, x ∈ X. All hypotheses of Theorem
9 are satisfied except, possibly, the non-emptiness of the sections A(x). Thus,
either A(x) 6= ∅, ∀x ∈ X, hence A is a von Neumann relation, and therefore
has a fixed point ((A) holds), or A(x̄) = ∅ for some x̄ ∈ X, i.e., A is not a von
Neumann relation and (B) is satisfied.
This is a particular instance of the celebrated Infsup Inequality of Ky Fan
with a weaker compactness condition.
Landmark theorems of nonlinear functional analysis follow immediately from
Theorem 14; therefore, indirectly, from the separation of closed convex sets in
finite dimension (Proposition 2). We refer to H. Brézis [6] for an account and
applications of the next two fundamental results.
Corollary 15 (Mazur-Schauder Theorem) Let X be a non-empty closed convex
subset of a reflexive Banach space E and let ϕ : X −→ R be a lower semicontinuous, quasiconvex and coercive (i.e. lim||x||→∞ ϕ(x) = ∞) functional. Then
ϕ achieves its minimum on X.
Proof. Let λ = 0, Y = X, and f (x, y) = ϕ(x) − ϕ(y) in Theorem 14. Let K be
the intersection of X with a closed ball with radius M > 0 centered at the origin
of E and such that if x ∈ X with kxk > M then ϕ(x) > ϕ(y) for some y ∈ K.
Such a non-empty set K exists due to the coercivity of ϕ. Since E is reflexive,
K is weakly compact. One readily verifies that the hypotheses of Theorem 14
with X, Y, f, K, D = K, and λ = 0 all hold: f is l.s.c. and quasiconvex in x, and
quasiconcave in y. Clearly, possibility (A) of Theorem 14 cannot hold. Hence

14

(B) is true: there exists x̄ ∈ X such that f (x̄, y) = ϕ(x̄) − ϕ(y) ≤ 0, for all
y ∈ X.
We now derive from the nonlinear alternative in Theorem 14 the celebrated
theorem of Stampacchia for variational inequalities. Recall that given a normed
space E, a form a : E × E −→ R is said to be (i) bilinear if it linear in
each of its arguments; (ii) continuous if there exists a constant C > 0 with
|a(x, y)| ≤ C||x||||y|| for all x, y ∈ E; and (iii) coercive if there exists a constant
α > 0 with a(x, x) ≥ α||x||2 for all x ∈ E.
Corollary 16 (Stampacchia Theorem) Let E be a reflexive Banach space, a :
E × E −→ R be a continuous and coercive bilinear form, and let ℓ : E −→ R
be a bounded linear functional. Given a non-empty closed and convex subset X
in E, there exists a unique x̄ ∈ X such that a(x̄, x̄ − y) ≤ ℓ(x̄) − ℓ(y) for all
y ∈ X.
Proof. For the existence, we apply Theorem 14 to f : X × X −→ R defined
by f (x, y) := a(x, x − y) − ℓ(x − y), (x, y) ∈ X × X, λ = 0, D = {y0 } with
0 6= y0 ∈ X arbitrary, and K := {x ∈ X : kxk ≤ M } where

M :=

1
(β +
2

q
β 2 + 4γ),

β = (C||y0 || + ||ℓ||)/α and γ = ||ℓ||||y0 ||/α.
Indeed, first note that if E is equipped with the weak topology, then f (x, y)
is l.s.c. and quasiconvex in x and quasiconcave in y (it is in fact linear and
continuous for the norm topology in both arguments). Since X is closed and
convex, it follows that K is a closed, convex and bounded, hence weakly compact, subset of X. D is obviously a weakly compact subset of X. Note now that
if f (x, y0 ) ≤ 0 for any given x ∈ X, i.e., a(x, x) ≤ a(x, y0 ) + ℓ(x − y0 ), then kxk

15

satisfies a quadratic inequality and is bounded above by M :
α||x||2 ≤ a(x, x) ≤ Ckxkky0 k + kℓkkxk + kℓkky0k
=⇒

α||x||2 − (Cky0 k + kℓk)kxk − kℓkky0k ≤ 0

⇐⇒

||x||2 − βkxk − γ ≤ 0
p
kxk ≤ 21 (β + β 2 + 4γ) = M.

=⇒

Consequently, if x ∈ X, kxk > M, then f (x, y0 ) > 0 and the compactness
condition in Theorem 14 is satisfied. Since f (x, x) = 0 for any x ∈ X, (A) of
Theorem 14 is impossible, and (B) holds, i.e., f (x̄, y) = a(x̄, x̄−y)−ℓ(x̄)+ℓ(y) ≤
0 for some x̄ ∈ X and all y ∈ X and the proof of the existence is complete.
The uniqueness follows at once from the bilinearity and the coercivity of
the form a as follows: if a(x̄i , x̄i − y) − ℓ(x̄i ) + ℓ(y) ≤ 0 for two elements
x̄i ∈ X, i = 1, 2, and all y ∈ X, then adding a(x̄1 , x̄1 − x̄2 ) ≤ ℓ(x̄1 ) − ℓ(x̄2 ) to
a(x̄2 , x̄2 − x̄1 ) ≤ ℓ(x̄2 ) − ℓ(x̄1 ) gives 0 ≤ αkx̄1 − x̄2 k2 ≤ a(x̄1 − x̄2 , x̄1 − x̄2 ) ≤ 0,
i.e., x̄1 = x̄2 .
The coincidence (N , N −1 ) (Theorem 12) can be expressed in analytical
terms as a second alternative for nonlinear systems of inequalities as follows:
Theorem 17 Let X and Y be two convex subsets of topological vector spaces
and let f, g : X × Y −→ R be two functions satisfying:
(i) f (x, y) ≤ g(x, y) for all (x, y) ∈ X × Y ;
(ii) x 7→ f (x, y) is quasiconcave on X, for each fixed y ∈ Y ;
(iii) y 7→ f (x, y) is l.s.c. and quasiconvex on Y, for each fixed x ∈ X;
(iv) x 7→ g(x, y) is u.s.c. and quasiconcave on X, for each fixed x ∈ X;
(v) y 7→ g(x, y) is quasiconvex on Y, for each fixed x ∈ X.
(vi) Given λ ∈ R arbitrary, assume that either Y is compact, or X is compact, or there exist a compact subset K of X and a convex compact subset C of
Y such that for any x ∈ X \ K there exists y ∈ C with g(x, y) < λ.

16

Then one of the following statements holds:
(A) there exists x̄ ∈ X such that g(x̄, y) ≥ λ, for all y ∈ Y ; or
(B) there exists ȳ ∈ Y such that f (x, ȳ) ≤ λ, for all x ∈ X.
Proof. Simply apply Theorem 12 to A, B ⊂ X × Y defined as:

A := {(x, y) : g(x, y) < λ} and B := {(x, y) : f (x, y) > λ}.

Note that in view of (i) a coincidence between A and B is impossible as it
yields λ < λ. Since all hypotheses of Theorem 12 are satisfied save for A(x) 6= ∅
for all x ∈ X and B −1 (y) 6= ∅ for all y ∈ Y, it follows that either A(x̄) = ∅ for
some x̄ ∈ X (thesis (A)) or B −1 (ȳ) = ∅ for some ȳ ∈ Y (thesis (B)).
Remark 18 Theorem 17 implies α = supX inf Y g(x, y) ≥ inf Y supX f (x, y) =
β.
Indeed, assuming that α < β < ∞, let λ be an arbitrary but fixed real number
strictly between α and β. By Theorem 17, either there exists ȳ ∈ Y such that
f (x, ȳ) ≤ λ, for all x ∈ X thus β ≤ λ < β which is impossible, or there exists
x̄ ∈ X such that g(x̄, y) ≥ λ, for all y ∈ Y thus α ≥ λ > α which is absurd.
Hence α ≥ β.
Maurice Sion’s formulation of the von Neumann Minimax Theorem follows
immediately with f = g (see [1]):
Corollary 19 (Sion-von Neumann Minimax Theorem) Let X and Y be convex
subsets of topological vector spaces and let f be a real function on X × Y such
that:
(i) x 7→ f (x, y) is quasiconcave and u.s.c. on X for each fixed y ∈ Y ;
(ii) y 7→ f (x, y) is quasiconvex and l.s.c. on Y for each fixed x ∈ X;

17

Assume that either X is compact or Y is compact. Then:

α = sup inf f (x, y) = inf sup f (x, y) = β
X

Y

Y

X

Proof. The inequality α ≤ β is always true and α ≥ β follows from Remark
18.
Remark 20 If both X and Y are compact, the infsup equality in Corollary 19
is a minmax equality and is equivalent to the existence of a saddle point (x0 , y0 )
for the function f (x, y), i.e., f (x, y0 ) ≤ f (x0 , y), ∀(x, y) ∈ X × Y.
We end this section with a short proof of the Markov-Kakutani fixed point
theorem for abelian families of continuous affine mappings in linear topological
spaces having separating duals1 .
Recall that a mapping φ from a convex set X into a vector space is said to be
Pn
Pn
affine if and only if φ( i=1 λi xi ) = i=1 λi φ(xi ) for any convex combination
Pn
Pn
i=1 λi xi , λi ≥ 0,
i=1 λi = 1, in X. The key ingredient is the following fixed
point property for continuous affine transformations of a compact convex set.
Corollary 21 Let X be a non-empty compact convex subset of a t.v.s. E with
separating dual E ′ and let φ : X −→ X be a continuous affine mapping. Then
φ has a fixed point.
Proof. The proof is a simplification of the treatment in [9]. Define f : X ×
E ′ −→ R by f (x, ℓ) = ℓ(φ(x) − x), (x, ℓ) ∈ X × E ′ . It suffices to prove the
existence of x0 ∈ X such that f (x0 , ℓ) ≤ 0, ∀ℓ ∈ E ′ , for this would imply
ℓ(φ(x0 ) − x0 ) = 0, ∀ℓ ∈ E ′ , i.e., φ(x0 ) − x0 = 0 and the proof is complete.
1 A t.v.s. E has separating dual if for each x ∈ E, x 6= 0, there exists a bounded linear form
ℓ ∈ E ′ , the topological dual of E, such that ℓ(x) 6= 0. Locally convex topological vector spaces
have separating duals. Sequence spaces ℓp , 0 < p < 1, and Hardy spaces H p , 0 < p < 1, are
instances of non-locally convex spaces with separating duals.

18

This amounts to showing that

T

ℓ∈E ′

A(ℓ) 6= ∅ for the relation A := {(ℓ, x) ∈

E ′ × X : f (x, ℓ) ≤ 0}.
Since for each fixed ℓ ∈ E ′ , the function f (x, ℓ) is l.s.c. in x, then each A(ℓ)
is a closed, hence compact, subset of X. It suffices, therefore, to show that the
collection {A(ℓ) : ℓ ∈ E ′ } has the finite intersection property. Consider, to this
aim, a finite collection of bounded linear functionals L := {ℓ1 , . . . , ℓn } ⊂ E ′ ,
and let Y = conv(L), a convex compact subset of E ′ . The restriction of f (x, ℓ)
to X × Y is obviously u.s.c. and quasiconcave in x and l.s.c. and quasiconvex
in ℓ. Since both X and Y are compact and convex, it follows from Remark 20
that there exists (x0 , ℓ0 ) ∈ X × Y with f (x0 , ℓ) ≤ f (x, ℓ0 ) for all (x, ℓ) ∈ X × Y,
i.e., ℓ(φ(x0 ) − x0 ) ≤ ℓ0 (φ(x) − x) for all (x, ℓ) ∈ X × Y. Let x̂ be such that
ℓ0 (x̂) = maxx∈X ℓ0 (x). Since φ(x̂) ∈ X, it follows that ℓ0 (φ(x̂) − x̂) ≤ 0 and,
consequently, ℓ(φ(x0 ) − x0 ) ≤ 0, for all ℓ ∈ Y, in particular, ℓi (φ(x0 ) − x0 ) =
f (x0 , ℓi ) ≤ 0 for all ℓi ∈ L, and the proof is complete.
The Markov-Kakutani follows by a standard compactness argument. Recall
that a family F = {φ} of mappings is said to be abelian if φ1 φ2 = φ2 φ1 for all
φ1 , φ2 ∈ F.
Corollary 22 (Theorem of Markov-Kakutani) Let X be a non-empty compact
convex subset of a t.v.s. E with separating dual E ′ and let F be an abelian
family of continuous affine transformations from X into itself. Then, there exists
x0 ∈ X such that φ(x0 ) = x0 for every φ ∈ F.
Proof. For any given φ ∈ F, let F ix(φ) be the set of its fixed points. We
T
show that φ∈F F ix(φ) 6= ∅. Clearly, for each φ ∈ F, F ix(φ) is non-empty (by
Corollary 21), convex (as φ is affine), and closed hence compact in X. It suffices
to show that the family {F ix(φ) : φ ∈ F } has the finite intersection property,
Tn
i.e., i=1 F ix(φi ) 6= ∅ for any {φ1 , . . . , φn } ⊂ F . The proof is by induction on
n. For n = 1, clearly F ix(φ1 ) 6= ∅ (Corollary 21). Assume that the statement is
19

true for any family {φ1 , . . . , φk } ⊂ F with k = n − 1 and let {φ1 , . . . , φn } ⊂ F
Tn−1
be arbitrary. For any x ∈ i=1 F ix(φi ), φn (x) = φn (φi (x)) = φi (φn (x)) for
Tn−1
all i = 1, . . . , n − 1, i.e., φn (x) ∈ i=1 F ix(φi ). Thus φn maps the non-empty
Tn−1
compact convex set i=1
F ix(φi ) into itself. By Corollary 21 again, it has a
Tn−1
T
fixed point x̄ = φn (x̄) ∩ i=1 F ix(φi ), i.e., x̄ ∈ ni=1 F ix(φi ).

Concluding Remarks

It is well established that the Markov-Kakutani fixed point theorem implies the
Hahn-Banach theorem (Kakutani [16]). The two results are indeed equivalent
(for a short and elegant proof of the converse, see D. Werner [21]). Since we
derived here the convex KKM theorem from the theorem on the separation
of convex sets, we have thus established the equivalence of the Hahn-Banach
theorem, Klee’s intersection theorem, the convex KKM theorem, the fixed point
theorem for von Neumann relations, the Sion-von Neumann minimax theorem,
and the Markov-Kakutani fixed point theorem.
Although the convex KKM theorem is a particular instance of the KKM
principle of Ky Fan, and since the fixed point and coincidence properties in
Theorems 9 and 12 are special cases of similar results for so-called F and F ∗
maps (see [2, 3, 4]), the interest here resides in the use of simple arguments
of convexity rather than the Brouwer fixed point theorem or Sperner’s lemma.
It would be most interesting to know if the Ky Fan KKM principle (or any of
its equivalent results) can be derived directly from the convex KKM theorem.
In other words, can any of the question marks below be settled? (The smaller
arrows are established; FPT stands for Fixed Point Theorem.)

Here, the ”topological Klee theorem” [15] reads:
A family of n closed convex sets in a topological vector space has a nonempty intersection if and only if the union of the n sets is (n − 2)-connected
and the intersection of every n − 1 of them is non-empty.
This topological version of Klee’s theorem yields the equivalent formulation
of the Brouwer fixed point theorem:
The n-sphere S n is not n-connected.
Indeed, the n−dimensional faces of the (n + 1)−simplex ∆n+1 form a family
of n + 2 closed convex sets in Rn+2 . Moreover, every intersection of n + 1 of
them is non-empty, but the whole intersection is empty. Hence, their union which consists of the boundary ∂∆n+1 - is not n−connected. Since ∂∆n+1 is
homeomorphic to S n , it follows that S n is not n−connected. This establishes

21



the implication: topological Klee theorem =⇒ Brouwer FPT. The equivalence
Brouwer FPT ⇐⇒ Ky Fan KKM principle is well-established (see e.g., [9]).
Also, since every convex set in a topological vector space is contractible,
hence n−connected for every n ≥ 0, the topological Klee theorem implies Proposition 3. Does the converse hold true?
