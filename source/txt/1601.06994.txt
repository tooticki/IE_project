Abstract
In this paper, we present a new argument (see Lemma 3.4) that allows us to simplify the proof of
stability of peakons established in Lin and Liu (2009) (Theorem 1.1).

Introduction

In this paper, we consider the Degasperis-Procesi equation (DP)
ut − utxx + 4uux = 3ux uxx + uuxxx, (t, x) ∈ R+ × R,

(1.1)

with u(0) = u0 ∈ L2 (R) and (1 − ∂x2 )u0 ∈ M+ (R).
The DP equation is completely integrable (see [3]) and has been proved to be physically relevant for
water waves (see [1]). It possesses, among others, the following conservation laws

In this form, the DP equation admits explicit solitary waves called peakons (see [3]) that are defined by
u(t, x) = ϕc (x − ct) = cϕ(x − ct) = ce−|x−ct|, c ∈ R∗ , (t, x) ∈ R+ × R.

(1.6)

Our goal is to simplify the proof given in [7] of the stability of a single peakon for the DP equation.
Recall that the proof of the stability for the Camassa-Holm equation (CH) in [2] follows from two integral
relations between two conservation laws of CH, maxR u and functions related to u. In [7] the proof is
more complicated, since all the local maxima and minima of v = (4 − ∂x2 )−1 u are involved in the relations.
In this paper we present a simplification of this proof, where only the maximum of v is involved in the
relations. Our proof is thus closer to the proof for CH in [2]. The main idea is the following: since u is
L2 -close to the peakon ϕc (· − ξ), for some ξ ∈ R, and (1 − ∂x2 )u ∈ M+ (R), it is easy to check that u is
actually C 0 -close to the peakon, and thus v is C 2 -close to the smooth-peakon:
ρc (x − ξ) = (4 − ∂x2 )−1 ϕc (x − ξ) =

c −|x−ξ| c −2|x−ξ|

(1.7)

First, since ρc , ρ′c and ρ′′c are very small with respect to the amplitude c outside of the interval Θ0 =
′′
[−6.7, 6.7], we can restrict ourself to study v on
√ [ξ − 6.7, ′ξ + 6.7]. Now we observe that√ρc has
√ Θξ =
strictly negative values in the
√ interval V0 = [−ln 2, ln 2], with ρc strictly positive on [−6.7, −ln 2] and
ρ′c strictly negative on [ln 2, 6.7]. This forces vx to change sign only one time on Θξ , and thus v has
only one local extremum (which is a maximum) on Θξ . This fact will considerably simplify the proof of
the stability.

Preliminaries

In this section, we briefly recall the global well-posedness results for the Cauchy problem of the DP
equation (see [5] and [8]), and its consequences. For I a finite or infinite time interval of R+ , we denote
by X (I) the function space 1

(2.1)
X (I) = u ∈ C I; H 1 (R) ∩ L∞ I; W 1,1 (R) , ux ∈ L∞ (I; BV (R)) .

Theorem 2.1 (Global Weak Solution; See [5] and [8]). Assume that u0 ∈ L2 (R) with y0 = (1 − ∂x2 )u0 ∈
M+ (R). Then the DP equation has a unique global weak solution u ∈ X (R+ ) such that
y(t, ·) = (1 − ∂x2 )u(t, ·) ∈ M+ (R), ∀t ∈ R+

(2.2)

|ux (t, x)| ≤ u(t, x), ∀(t, x) ∈ R+ × R.

(2.3)

and
Moreover E(·) and F (·) are conserved by the flow.
Remark 2.1 (Control of L∞ Norm by L2 Norm). (2.3) and the well-known Sobolev embedding of H 1 (R)

Stability of peakons

In this section, we present our simplification of the proof of stability of peakons for the DP equation.
Theorem 3.1 (Stability of Peakons). Let u ∈ X ([0, T [), with 0 < T ≤ +∞, be a solution of the DP
equation and ϕc be the peakon defined in (1.6), traveling to the right at the speed c > 0. There exist C > 0
and ε0 > 0 only depending on the speed c, such that if
y0 = (1 − ∂x2 )u0 ∈ M+ (R)

(3.1)

1 W 1,1 (R) is the space of L1 (R) functions with derivatives in L1 (R) and BV (R) is the space of function with bounded
variation.

and
then

ku0 − ϕc kH ≤ ε2 , with 0 < ε < ε0 ,

(3.2)

√
ku(t, ·) − ϕc (· − ξ(t))kH ≤ C ε, ∀t ∈ [0, T [,

(3.3)

where ξ(t) ∈ R is the only point where the function v(t, ·) = (4 − ∂x2 )−1 u(t, ·) attains its maximum.
We first recall that E(u) ∼ E(ϕc ) and F (u) ∼ F (ϕc ) in R, if u ∼ ϕc in L2 (R), with y ∈ M+ (R) (see
for instance [7] or [6]).
Lemma 3.1 (Control of Distances Between Energies; See [6]). Let u ∈ L2 (R) with y = (1 − ∂x2 )u ∈
M+ (R). If ku − ϕc kH ≤ ε2 , then
|E(u) − E(ϕc )| ≤ O(ε2 )
(3.4)
and
|F (u) − F (ϕc )| ≤ O(ε2 ),

(3.5)

where O(·) only depends on the speed c.
To prove Theorem 3.1, by the conservation of E(·), F (·) and the continuity of the map t 7→ u(t) from
[0, T [ to H (since H ≃ L2 ), it suffices to prove that for any function u ∈ L2 (R) satisfying y = (1 − ∂x2 )u ∈
M+ (R), (3.4) and (3.5), if
inf ku − ϕc (· − z)kH ≤ ε1/4 ,
(3.6)
z∈R

then

√
ku − ϕc (· − ξ)kH ≤ C ε,

(3.7)

where ξ ∈ R is the only point of maximum of v.
Let us present some important properties of smooth-peakons, defined in (1.7), which will play a crucial
role in the proof of Theorem 3.1. The smooth-peakon ρc belongs to H 3 (R) ֒→ C 2 (R) (by the Sobolev
embedding) since ϕc belongs to H 1 (R) (defined in (1.6)). It is a positive even function, which admits
a single maximum c/6 at point 0, and decays at infinity to 0 (see Fig. 1a). Its derivative ρ′c belongs
to H 2 (R) ֒→ C 1 (R), it is an odd function, which vanishes only at the origin and has negative values on
[0, +∞[. It admits a a single minimum −c/12 at point ln2 and tends at infinity to 0 (see Fig. 1b). Its
second derivative ρ′′c belongs to H 1 (R) ֒→ C 0 (R), it is an even function, which vanishes at ±ln2, takes
positive values on ] − ∞, −ln2[∪]ln2, +∞[ and negative values on [−ln2, ln2]. It admits a single minimum
−c/3 at point 0 and two maxima c/24 at points ±ln4, and decays at infinity to 0 (see Fig. 1c).
Next, we will need the following estimates.
Lemma 3.2 (C 0 , C 1 and C 2 Approximations). Let u ∈ L2 (R) with y = (1 − ∂x2 )u ∈ M+ (R). If
ku − ϕc kH ≤ ε1/4 , then
ku − ϕc kC 0 (R) + kv − ρc kC 2 (R) ≤ O(ε1/8 )
(3.8)
and
kv − ρc kC 1 (R) ≤ O(ε1/4 ).

(3.9)

Proof. Let us begin with the second estimate. From the definition of E(·) and H (see respectively (1.2)
and (1.4)), one can see that kukH is equivalent to kvkH 2 (R) , since kvkH 2 (R) ≤ kukH ≤ 5kvkH 2 (R) . Then,
assumption u is H-close to ϕc implies that v is H 2 -close to ρc . Now, using the Sobolev embedding of
H 2 (R) into C 1 (R), we deduce (3.9).
For the first estimate, note that the assumption y = (1 − ∂x2 )u ≥ 0 implies that u = (1 − ∂x2 )−1 y ≥ 0
and satisfies |ux | ≤ u on R (see (2.3)). Then, applying triangular inequality, and using that |ϕ′c | = ϕc on
3

R and (2.4), we have
ku − ϕc kH 1 (R) ≤ kukH 1 (R) + kϕc kH 1 (R)

≤ 2kukL2 (R) + 2kϕc kL2 (R)
≤ 2ku − ϕc kL2 (R) + 4kϕc kL2 (R)

≤ O(ε1/4 ) + O(1),

where kϕc kL2 (R) = c. Therefore, applying the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality and using that ku−ϕckH ≤
ε1/4 (with H ≃ L2 ), we obtain
1/2

ku − ϕc kC 0 (R) ≤ ku − ϕc kL2 (R) ku − ϕc kH 1 (R)


≤ O(ε1/8 ) O(ε1/8 ) + O(1)
≤ O(ε1/8 ) .

Finally to estimate the second term of the left-hand side of (3.8), we first notice that the continuity
of (4 − ∂x2 )−1 (·) from H s (R) to H s+2 (R) and the above estimates ensure that kv − ρc kH 3 = O(1) and
kv − ρc kH 2 = O(ε1/4 ) . These last estimates combined with the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality yield the
result as above.

The following lemma specifies the distance to minimize for stability.
Lemma 3.3 (Quadratic Identity; See [7]). For any u ∈ L2 (R) and ξ ∈ R, it holds

Proof. We follow the idea of Constantin and Strauss with the CH equation (see [2], Lemma 1). We
compute

Now we will study carefully the local extrema of v = (4 − ∂x2 )−1 u. Let u ∈ L2 (R) with y = (1 − ∂x2 )u ∈

One can clearly see that V0 is a subset of Θ0 (since 20/(20 − 399) > 2). We chose the values ±6.7
such that ρc (±6.7) ≃ c/2400 ≃ 4.1 × 10−4 c as in [6]. Also, we have ρ′c (−6.7) = −ρ′c (6.7) ≃ 4.1 × 10−4 c
and ρ′′c (±6.7) ≃ 4.1 × 10−4c. Then ρc , ρ′c and ρ′′c are very small with respect to the amplitude c on R \ Θ0 .
We claim the following result.
Lemma 3.4 (Uniqueness of the Local Maximum). Let u ∈ L2 (R) with y = (1 − ∂x2 )u ∈ M+ (R), that
satisfies (3.6) for some z ∈ R. There exists ε0 > 0 only depending on the speed c, such that if 0 < ε < ε0 ,
5

then the function v = (4 − ∂x2 )−1 u admits a unique local extremum on Θz . This extremum is a maximum,

Proof. The key is to study the impact of the assumption y ∈ M+ (R) on v. First, let us show that
|vx | ≤ 2v on R. We recall that from the assumption y ≥ 0, we have u ≥ 0 and v ≥ 0 on R. According to
the definition of v, we have for all x ∈ R,

Second, let us show that u ≤ 6v on R. Using the Fourier transform, one can check that

and that ρ′c (x) ≥ 10−4 c for all x ∈ [−6.7, −ln 2]. Then using

we have vx (x) ≥ 4 × 10−5 c > 0 for all x ∈

√
vx (x) ≤ −4 × 10−5 c < 0 for all x ∈ [z + ln 2, z + 6.7]. Since vx is strictly decreasing on Vz and changes
sign, vx vanishes once on Vz and thus on Θz . Hence, v admits a single local extremum on Θz , which is a
maximum since vxx < 0 on Vz .
Now, using that ρc is increasing on R− , (3.9) and taking 0 < ε < ε0 with ε0 ≪ 1, it holds for all

Combining (3.8), (3.21) and proceeding as for the estimate (3.16), we get (3.17). Note that ϕc (±6.7) ≃
1.2 × 10−3 c. This completes the proof of the lemma.

Under the assumptions of Lemma 3.4, v has got a unique point of global maximum on R. In the sequel
of this section, we will denote by ξ this point of global maximum and we set M = v(ξ) = maxx∈R v(x).
The next two lemmas can be directly deduced from the similar lemmas established in [7] (see also [6]).
Lemma 3.5 (Connection Between E(·) and M 2 ; See [7]). Let u ∈ L2 (R) and v = (4 − ∂x2 )−1 u ∈ H 2 (R).
Define the function g by
(
2v + vxx − 3vx , x < ξ,
g(x) =
(3.24)
2v + vxx + 3vx , x > ξ.
Then it holds

(3.25)

Lemma 3.6 (Connection Between F (·) and M 3 ; See [7]). Let u ∈ L2 (R) and v = (4 − ∂x2 )−1 u ∈ H 2 (R).
Define the function h by
(
− vxx − 6vx + 16v, x < ξ,
h(x) =
(3.26)
− vxx + 6vx + 16v, x > ξ.
Then it holds

R

h(x)g 2 (x)dx = F (u) − 144M 3.

(3.27)

Sketch of proof. The proof of Lemmas 3.5-3.6 follows by direct computation, using integration
by parts, with vx (ξ) = 0 and v(±∞) = vx (±∞) = vxx (±∞) = 0. See [7] (also [6]) to undersand the
technique.

We can now connect the conservation laws.
Lemma 3.7 (Connection Between E(·) and F (·)). Let u ∈ L2 (R), with y = (1 − ∂x2 )u ∈ M+ (R), that
satisfies (3.6) for some z ∈ R. There exists ε0 > 0 only depending on the speed c, such that if 0 < ε < ε0 ,
then it holds
1
1
(3.28)
M 3 − E(u)M + F (u) ≤ 0.
4
72
Proof. The key is to show that h ≤ 18M on R. Note that by (3.9) we know that 18M ≥ c/4 and that
Lemma 3.4 ensures that ξ ∈ Θz for ε0 small enough. Let us set λ = z − 6.7, µ = z + 6.7, and rewrite the
function h as

− vxx − 6vx + 16v, x < λ,



7

If x ∈ R \ Θz , using that vxx = 4v − u, (3.16) and (3.17), it holds
h ≤ |vxx | + 6|vx | + 16v ≤ u + 32v ≤

c
≤ 18M.
9

If λ < x < ξ, then vx ≥ 0, and using that u ≤ 6v on R, we have
h = u − 6vx + 12v ≤ 18v.
If ξ < x < µ, then vx ≤ 0, and similarly using that u ≤ 6v on R, we get
h = u + 6vx + 12v ≤ 18v.
Therefore, it holds
h(x) ≤ 18 max v(x) = 18M, ∀x ∈ R.

(3.29)

Now, combining (3.25), (3.27) and (3.29), we get

Proof of Theorem 3.1. We argue as El Dika and Molinet in [4]. As noticed after the statement of the
theorem, it suffices to prove (3.7) assuming that u ∈ L2 (R) satisfies (3.1), (3.2) and (3.6). We recall that
M = v(ξ) = maxx∈R v(x) and we set δ = c/6 − M . We first remark that if δ ≤ 0, combining (3.4) and
(3.10), it holds
ku − ϕc (· − ξ)kH ≤ |E(u0 ) − E(ϕc )|1/2 ≤ O(ε),
that yields the desired result. Now suppose that δ > 0, that is the maximum of the function v is less
than the maximum of ρc . Combining (3.4), (3.5) and (3.28), we get

M 3 − E(ϕc )M + F (ϕc ) ≤ O(ε2 ).

Using that E(ϕc ) = c2 /3 and F (ϕc ) = 2c3 /3, our inequality becomes

≤ O(ε2 ).

Next, substituting M by c/6 − δ and using that [M + c/3]−1 < 3/c, we obtain
δ 2 ≤ O(ε2 ) ⇒ δ ≤ O(ε).

Finally, combining (3.4), (3.10) and (3.30), we infer that
√
ku − ϕc (· − ξ)kH ≤ C ε,
where C > 0 only depends on the speed c. This completes the proof of the stability of peakons.
