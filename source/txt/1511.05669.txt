1. Introduction
A symplectic toric manifold is a symplectic manifold on which a half dimensional torus
T acts in an effective Hamiltonian way. A famous theorem of Delzant [6] says that there

manifolds and the set of simple polytopes called Delzant polytopes (see [13]) via moment
maps. Therefore, several properties of symplectic toric manifolds, such as the symplectic
volume and the ring structure of the (equivariant) cohomology and so on, can be detected
from the Delzant polytopes. In view of the geometric quantization of symplectic manifolds
we are interested in the Riemann-Roch numbers. The Riemann-Roch number RR(M, L)
is an invariant of a compact symplectic manifold (M, ω) with a pre-quantizing line bundle
(L, ∇), a pair consisting of a Hermitian
line bundle L and a Hermitian connection ∇ whose
√
curvature form is equal to − −1ω, which is defined as follows. We fix an ω-compatible
almost complex structure and then it determines a spinc -structure of M and we have a
spinc -Dirac operator D with coefficients in L. We define an integer RR(M, L) as the
analytic index of the spinc -Dirac operator:
RR(M, L) := ind(D).
If a compact Lie group G acts on M preserving all the data, ω, (L, ∇) and D, then
the index becomes a virtual representation of G, an element of the character ring R(G).
In this case the Riemann-Roch number is called the Riemann-Roch character or the Gequivariant Riemann-Roch number and is denoted by RRG (M, L). Such a procedure is
called spinc -quantization ([4][7][19]) nowadays and considered as a quantization of spinc manifolds. When (X, ω) is a symplectic toric manifold with the action a torus T we
can choose an almost complex structure so that it is integrable and invariant under the
action of the torus T . Then L has a structure of a holomorphic line bundle and the
Riemann-Roch number is equal to the dimension of H 0 (X, L), the space of holomorphic
sections of L. Moreover when we consider a lift of the torus action to the pre-quantizing
line bundle, RRT (X, L) = H 0 (X, L) becomes a representation of the torus T . Classical
theorem of Danilov [5] says that the representation RRT (X, L) can be described in terms
of the integral points in the Delzant polytope. Precisely we have
M
C(ξ) ,
(1.1)
RRT (X, L) =
ξ∈µ(M )∩t∗Z

where µ is the moment map, t∗Z is the integral weight lattice in the dual of the Lie algebra
of T and C(ξ) is the representation of the torus associated with the integral weight ξ ∈ t∗Z .
Though Danilov’s original proof was based on an algebraic geometric setting, a proof in
the symplectic geometric setting is also known. See [14] for example.
A folded symplectic manifold introduced by Cannas da Silva, Guillemin and Woodward
in [3] is a pair consisting of an even-dimensional smooth manifold and a closed 2-form
which may degenerate in a transverse way and it is called the folded symplectic form. When
the degenerate locus (which becomes a hypersurface and called the fold) has a structure
of a circle bundle whose vertical tangent bundle coincides with the degenerate direction of
the folded symplectic form, the folded symplectic manifold is called an origami manifold.
By definition a folded symplectic manifold (resp. origami manifold) is a generalization
of a symplectic manifold, and several notions and studies in symplectic geometry are
generalized to the folded symplectic (resp. origami) case, such as pre-quantizing line
bundle, Hamiltonian group action, moment map, convexity property and so on. It is
known that a folded symplectic manifold is not orientable in general, and hence it does
not admit an almost complex structure, however, if it is orientable, then it admits a
stable almost complex structure as shown in [3, Theorem 2]. Since the stable almost
complex structure determines a spinc -structure, we can define its spinc -quantization by

the index of spinc -Dirac operator. If the folded symplectic manifold is equipped with a
Hamiltonian group action, then it becomes a virtual representation and is also called the
Riemann-Roch character. In particular the spinc -quantization of a toric origami manifold
is a virtual representation of the torus.
In this paper we give a proof of the following generalization of Danilov’s formula (1.1)
for spinc -quantization of toric origami manifolds by making use of the localization theorem
of index developed in [10, 11].
Theorem (Theorem 5.9). Let (M, ω) be an oriented toric origami manifold with the
action of a torus T and a T -equivariant pre-quantizing line bundle (L, ∇). Then we have
M
M
C(ξ)
C(ξ) −
RRT (M, L) =
ξ∈µ(M + )∩t∗Z

ξ∈µ(M − )∩t∗Z

as elements in the character ring of T .
Precise statement and notations are explained in the subsequent sections. The formula
itself can be obtained as a consequence of the cobordism theorem [2, Theorem 4.1] and
Danilov’s formula (1.1) for symplectic toric manifolds. There is an another possible approach which uses the theory of multi-fans introduced by Hattori and Masuda [15]. Masuda and Park showed in [18] that one can associate a multi-fan for each oriented toric
origami manifold. In view of the theory of multi-fans the above formula can be considered
as a special case of the equivariant index formula [15, Theorem 11.1], which is based on
the fixed point formula. In contrast to these proofs, our proof is direct and geometric,
which detects the contribution of each lattice point directly. Once we construct a geometric structure which we call an acyclic compatible system on an open subset of the
manifold, then the index of Dirac operator is localized at the complement of the open
subset by the localization formula in [11]. In this paper we construct an acyclic compatible system on the complement of the inverse image of the lattice points and the fold
for toric origami manifolds. It implies that the Riemann-Roch character is equal to the
sum of contributions of the lattice points and the fold. We show that the contribution
of the lattice point ξ is equal to C(ξ) with sign determined by the orientation and the
contribution of the fold is zero. Our proof does not rely on neither the original Danilov’s
formula nor the fixed point formula. In fact, as a special case, our proof gives a new direct
proof of Danilov’s formula for symplectic toric manifolds. Note that there is an another
generalization of the formula (1.1) by Karshon and Tolman [17]. They gave a formula for
toric manifolds with a torus invariant presymplectic form. Though their proof is based on
the holomorphic structure of toric manifolds, our proof does not use such rigid structure
and it is topological and flexible.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we summarize several known facts
about folded symplectic manifolds, origami manifolds and toric origami manifolds, which
we use in this paper. The convexity theorem for toric origami manifolds (Theorem 2.5)
is essential for us. In Section 3 we discuss stable almost complex structures on folded
symplectic manifolds. We construct a Z/2-graded Clifford module bundle in terms of the
stable almost complex structure. In Section 4 we construct a structure of (good) compatible
fibration on toric origami manifolds, which is a family of torus fibrations (foliations) with
specific compatibility condition introduced in [11]. The construction is based on an open
covering of the convex polytope associated with the natural stratification of the polytope
with respect to the dimension of the faces. Strictly speaking there exist cracks on which

4

HAJIME FUJITA

we can not extend the compatible fibration keeping the compatibility condition. Though
the crack causes an extra contribution to the Riemann-Roch character, we show that it is
equal to 0. In Section 5 we construct a compatible system on the compatible fibration of
the toric origami manifolds, which is a family of Dirac-type operators along the fibers of
the compatible fibration with specific anti-commutativity. In [11] the authors had already
constructed compatible system for Hamiltonian torus manifolds, and our construction for
the complement of the fold is based on that. On the other hand a neighbourhood of
the fold has a structure of a quotient of the product of the fold and the cylinder with
the standard folded symplectic structure by a natural S 1 -action. We use this structure
to define the Dirac-type operator along fibers near the fold. To discuss the localization
it is essential to investigate the acyclicity of the compatible system. The fundamental
property of the moment map says that it is acyclic outside the lattice points and the
fold. In Section 5.2 we explain the localization formula of the Riemann-Roch character
by making use of the acyclic compatible system. In Section 6 we compute the local
contribution of the crack, lattice points and the fold. We first consider the symplectic
toric case, i.e., origami manifolds with the empty fold, and compute the local contribution.
We use a decomposition of a neighbourhood of the fiber, the inverse image of the lattice
point, into the product of the cotangent bundle of the fiber and the normal direction
of the symplectic submanifold containing the fiber. We apply the product formula ([11,
Theorem 8.8]) to the neighbourhood of the fiber. The vanishing of the contribution from
the fold follows from the product structure of a neighbourhood of the fold. The last three
sections are appendixes. In Appendix A we give a brief summary of the theory of local
index following [11, 12] and [9]. In Appendix B we show a useful formula of local indices
of vector spaces, which will be essential in the proof of Lemma 6.2 and Lemma 6.3. In
Appendix C we give a direct computation of the local index of the folded cylinder and
show that it is equal to 0. We use this result to show that vanishing of the contribution
from the fold.
2. Folded symplectic forms and toric origami manifolds
2.1. Folded symplectic forms and origami manifolds. In this section we recall basic
definitions and facts on folded symplectic manifolds and origami manifolds. Details can
be found in [2], [3], [16] and [18].
A folded symplectic form ω on a smooth 2n-dimensional manifold M is a closed 2-form
whose top power ω n vanishes transversally on a submanifold Z and whose restriction
to Z has maximal rank. In this case Z is a hypersurface in M and is called the folding
hypersurface or fold. The pair (M, ω) is called a folded symplectic manifold and the 2-form
ω is called a folded symplectic form. Let iZ : Z ֒→ M be the inclusion of Z into M. The
restriction i∗Z ω determines a line field on Z, called the null foliation, whose fiber at z ∈ Z
is ker(i∗Z ωz ).
Suppose that (M, ω) is an oriented folded symplectic manifold with non-empty fold Z.
Then M r Z is not connected and has a decomposition M r Z = M+ ⊔ M− , where M+
(resp. M− ) is the union of connected components such that ω n |M+ agrees (resp. disagrees)
with the given orientation of M.
Definition 2.1. A folded symplectic manifold (M, ω) is called an origami manifold if the
null foliation ker(i∗Z ω) is the vertical tangent bundle of a principal S 1 -bundle structure
π : Z → B over Z with a compact base B.

Note that since B is compact the total space Z is also compact. As in the symplectic
reduction procedure, there is the unique symplectic form ωB on B satisfying π ∗ ωB = i∗Z ω.
An analogue of Darboux’s theorem for folded symplectic forms says that near any point
p ∈ Z there exists a coordinate chart centered at p where the folded symplectic form ω
can be written as
x1 dx1 ∧ dy1 + dx2 ∧ dy2 + · · · + dxn ∧ dyn .
In this local description, the fold Z is given by the equation x1 = 0 and the null foliation
is the line field spanned by ∂y∂ 1 . This local description has a global variant.
Theorem 2.2 (Theorem 1 in [3] ). Let (M, ω) be an oriented origami manifold with fold
Z → B. Fix a connection 1-form α of Z → B. Then there exists a neighbourhood U of
Z and an orientation preserving diffeomorphism ϕ : Z × (−ε, ε) → U such that
and

ϕ ◦ ι0 = ιZ

ϕ∗ ω = p∗Z ι∗Z ω + d(t2 p∗Z α),
where ι0 : Z → Z × (−ε, ε) is the inclusion z 7→ (z, 0) and pZ : Z × (−ε, ε) → Z is the
natural projection.
Example 2.3. For a positive integer n let S 2n be the unit sphere in R2n ⊕ R = Cn ⊕ R
with coordinates x1 , y1 , · · · , xn , yn , h. Let ω be the restriction to S 2n of the 2-form dx1 ∧
dy1 + · · · + dxn ∧ dyn on R2n ⊕ R. Then ω is a folded symplectic form on S 2n with the
fold S 2n−1 , the equator sphere given by h = 0. The Hopf fibration S 1 ֒→ S 2n−1 → CPn−1
gives a structure of origami manifold on (S 2n , ω).
2.2. Hamiltonian torus actions and toric origami manifolds. The action of a compact Lie group G on an origami manifold (M, ω) is called Hamiltonian if it admits a
moment map µ, that is, a map µ : M → g∗ = Lie(G)∗ satisfying the conditions :
• µ is equivariant with respect to the given action of G on M and the coadjoint action of
G on g∗ .
• for any v ∈ g we have dhµ, vi = ι(v M )ω, where h·, ·i is the pairing between g∗ and g and
ι(v M )ω is the contraction of ω by the induced fundamental vector field v M .
Definition 2.4. A Hamiltonian torus origami manifold (M, ω, T, µ) (or M for short) is
a connected origami manifold (M, ω) equipped with an effective Hamiltonian action of a
torus T with a choice of a corresponding moment map µ. If the dimension of the torus T
is half of that of M, then we call (M, ω, T, µ) a toric origami manifold.
If the fold Z is empty, a Hamiltonian torus origami manifold is a Hamiltonian torus
manifold in the usual sense. The following is an origami analogue of the famous convexity
theorem for Hamiltonian torus manifolds.
Theorem 2.5 (Theorem 3.2 in [2]). Let (M, ω, T, µ) be a connected compact origami
manifold with null fibration π : Z → B and a Hamiltonian torus action of a torus T with
moment map µ. Then :
(a) The image µ(M) is the union of a finite number of convex polytopes ∆1 , · · · , ∆N in
the dual of the Lie algebra t∗ , each of which is the image of the moment map restricted to
the closure of a connected component of M r Z.
(b) Over each connected component Z ′ of Z, the null fibration is given by a subgroup of
T if and only if µ(Z ′ ) is a facet of each of the one or two polytopes corresponding to the

6

neighbourhood(s) of M r Z, and when those are two polytopes ∆1 and ∆2 there exists an
e Z ′ ∩ ∆2 .
e Z ′ ∩ ∆1 = ∆
e Z ′ containing µ(Z ′ ) such that ∆
open subset ∆
We call such images µ(M) origami polytopes.

Example 2.6. Consider the origami manifold (S 2n , ω) given in Example 2.3. Let T :=
(S 1 )n be the n-dimensional torus. Then the action of T on S 2n given by
(t1 , . . . , tn ) · (z1 , . . . , z1 , h) := (t1 z1 , . . . , tn zn , h)

for (t1 , . . . , tn ) ∈ T and (z1 , . . . , z1 , h) ∈ S 2n ⊂ Cn ⊕ R is Hamiltonian (in fact, toric)
action with the moment map µ : S 2n → Rn ,
1
µ(z1 , . . . , zn , h) := (|z1 |2 , . . . , |zn |2 ).
2
The image of µ is the union of two copies of the n-simplex, ξ1 , · · · , ξn ≥ 0, ξ1 + · · · + ξn ≤
1/2, and the image of fold S 2n−1 is the “hypotenuse”, ξ1 + · · · + ξn = 1/2. See Figure 1
for the case of n = 2.

3. Stable almost complex structure and Clifford module bundle
Let (M, ω) be a 2n-dimensional oriented folded symplectic manifold with fold Z and
U an open neighbourhood of Z as in Theorem 2.2. Let M+ (resp. M− ) be the union of
connected components of M r Z such that ω n |M+ agrees (resp. disagrees) with the given
orientation of M. In [3], it was shown that M has a stable almost complex structure.
More precisely the following holds.
Theorem 3.1 (Theorem 2 in [3]). There exixts an almost complex structure Je on the real
(2n + 2)-dimensional vector bundle T M ⊕ R2 , and a C-linear isomorphism
(T M ⊕ R2 )|M rU ∼
= T (M r U) ⊕ C.

Moreover, T M ⊕ R2 has a symplectic structure ω
e which is canonical up to homotopy, and
the homotopy class of Je is unique provided Je is compatible with the natural symplectic
structure on T M ⊕ R2 .
Remark 3.2. One can see in the proof of [3, Theorem 2] that the above Je has the
following properties.
(1) Let J be an almost complex structure on M r Z which is compatible with ω|M rZ .
Then one can construct Je so that the following equality holds.

(2) By using a connection of the principal S 1 -bundle Z → B we have the splitting of
the tangent bundle T Z ∼
= π ∗ T B ⊕Tπ Z, where Tπ Z is the tangent bundle along the
fiber, which is a real line bundle over Z. Since T U is oriented, and hence, T Z is also
oriented, the fact that B is a symplectic manifold implies that Tπ Z is an orientable.
In particular, Tπ Z is trivial real line bundle. Under these identifications the almost
e U in Theorem 3.1 on T U ⊕ R2 ∼
complex structure J|
= π ∗ T B ⊕ Tπ Z ⊕ R ⊕ R2 can
be taken as the direct sum of almost complex structures on the symplectic vector
bundle π ∗ T B and the trivial bundle Tπ Z ⊕ R ⊕ R2 of real rank 4.
(3) If a compact Lie group G acts on (M, ω), then we can take Je to be G-invariant.
In fact we will use such an invariant Je in the subsequent sections.

By using Je and ω
e , we have a Riemannian metric on T M ⊕R2 , and T M is equipped with
the metric as a subbundle of T M ⊕ R2 . Moreover the stable almost complex structure
induces a spinc -structure on M. Now we construct a Clifford module bundle over T M in
terms of this stable almost complex structure.
We first explain the construction for the vector space case. Let E be an even dimensional
e := E ⊕ Re which
Euclidean vector space. Suppose that a complex structure JEe on E
e is given for a non-negative (even) integer e. By using J e we

wedge product and the interior product. We define WE as the set of all linear maps
from an irreducible representation We of the Clifford algebra Cle := Cl(Re ) to WEe which
commute with the Clifford action of Cle ,
WE := HomCle (We , WEe ),
where Cle acts on WEe by using the inclusion Cle ֒→ Cl(E⊕Re ). Note that WE is equipped
with the Clifford action of Cl(E) by
α · φ : v 7→ αφ(v)

for α ∈ Cl(E) and v ∈ We using the inclusion Cl(E) ֒→ Cl(E ⊕ Re ).
Lemma 3.3. WE is an irreducible Z/2-graded Cl(E)-module.
Proof. Suppose that E is equipped with an almost complex
structure JE and JEe is the

direct sum of JE and the standard complex structure −1 on Re = Ce/2 (for a specific
e = ∧• E ⊗ ∧• Re and
order of the basis of Re ). In this case, one can see that ∧•C E

It implies that WE is an irreducible √

is homotopic to the direct sum JE ⊕ −1 and the irreducible representation of Cl(E) is

By applying the above construction for an almost complex structure on T M ⊕ R2 we
have the Z/2-graded Cl(T M)-module bundle
W := HomCl2 (W2 , ∧•C (T M ⊕ R2 ))
over M. Note that we have W |M± rU ∼
= ∧•C T (M± r U) by (3.1), which is the standard
Cl(T (M± r U))-module bundle of M± r U. For any Hermitian line bundle L we have an
another Z/2-graded Cl(E)-module bundle WL := W ⊗ L.

Definition 3.4. For a compact oriented origami manifold (M, ω) without boundary and
a Hermitian line bundle L over M the Riemann-Roch number RR(M, L) is defined as the
index of spinc -Dirac operator which acts on the smooth sections of the Clifford module
bundle WL :
RR(M, L) := ind(WL ).
Remark 3.5. Since any two Dirac-type operators can be joined in the space of Dirac-type
operators the index RR(M, L) = ind(WL ) does not depend on the choice of the Dirac-type
operators by the homotopy invariance of the analytic index.
4. Compatible fibration on toric origami manifolds
In this section we construct a structure of good compatible fibration on toric origami
manifolds. The notion of good compatible fibration is a family of torus fibrations (or
more generally foliations) over an open covering of the manifold with some compatibility
condition and is introduced in [11]. See also Definition A.2.
Assumption 4.1. In this section we consider a toric origami manifold (M, ω, T, µ) satisfying the following assumptions.
• M is connected, oriented, and compact without boundary.
• (M, ω, T, µ) satisfies the condition (b) in Theorem 2.5. Namely, the null foliation
is given by a subgroup of T .

be the stratification of ∆i , where we put1 ∆Z := µ(Z) and {∆i,1 , · · · , ∆i,mj } is the set of

U := Z × (−ε, ε) of Z in M as in Theorem 2.2 for some small ε > 0, and we may assume
e Z in Theorem 2.5(b) has the form
that U = Z × [−ε, ε, ] and an open neighbourhood ∆
e Z = µ(U).
∆
The construction of the good compatible fibration is divided into two parts, fibrations
near the fold and fibrations outside the fold.
4.1. Torus actions near the fold. We set U ′ := Z × (− 2ε , 2ε ). We take ε > 0 small
enough so that the S 1 -aciton on Z can be extended to a free S 1 -action on U ′ . By using
this S 1 -action we have an S 1 -bundle structure on U ′ with the base space B × (− 2ε , 2ε ).
4.2. Torus actions outside the fold. We construct a family of torus actions on M r U.
We put ∆′i,Z := ∆i r µ(U) and we first construct an open covering

5. Compatible system on toric origami manifolds
In this section we construct a compatible system (of Dirac-type operators) on toric
origami manifolds. The notion of compatible system is introduced in [11], which is a
family of Dirac-type operators along leaves of compatible fibration and satisfies some
anti-commutativity. See also Definition A.4.
Assumption 5.1. In this section we consider a toric origami manifold (M, ω, T, µ) satisfying the following assumption.
• (M, ω, T, µ) satisfies Assumption 4.1.
• The de Rham cohomology class [ω] has an integral lift in H 2 (M, Z).
• A T -equivariant pre-quantizing line bundle (L, ∇) is fixed. Namely, L is a T equivariant Hermitian line bundle over M and
√ ∇ is a T -invariant Hermitian connection whose curvature form is equal to − −1ω.

Together with the assumptions we may choose a stable almost complex structure Je as
(j)
in Theorem 3.1 so that the tangent bundle of each symplectic submanifold µ−1 (int(∆i,k ))
is preserved by Je for all i, j and k. Under the above assumption we use the Z/2-graded
Clifford module bundle WL as in the end of Section 3. As it is shown in Section 4,

(j)
system {Di,k }i,j,k on it as in [11, Theorem 5.1]. Namely for each i, j, k we have the
following.

Now we construct a differential operator DZ along the S 1 -orbits on U. We first study
the product structure of W |U . Hereafter we use the identification U = Z × (−ε, ε) ∼
=
(Z × S 1 × (−ε, ε))/S 1 with respect to the diagonal S 1 -action. According to Remark 3.2(2)
e U in Theorem 3.1 on T U ⊕ R2 ∼
we may assume that the almost complex structure J|

2
π T B ⊕ Tπ Z ⊕ R ⊕ R is the direct sum of almost complex structures on the symplectic
vector bundle π ∗ T B and the trivial bundle Tπ Z ⊕ R ⊕ R2 of real rank 4. Then we have
W |U = HomCl2 (W2 , ∧•C (T U ⊕ R2 )) = π ∗ (∧•C T B) ⊗ HomCl2 (W2 , ∧•C (Tπ Z ⊕ R3 )).

On the other hand we have the commutative diagram of bundle maps

S ×(−ε, ε))/S can be obtained as a quotient bundle of p (T S ) ⊕R → Z ×S ×(−ε, ε).
In particular HomCl2 (W2 , ∧•C (Tπ Z ⊕ R3 )) → U can be obtained as a quotient bundle of
HomCl2 (W2 , ∧•C (T S 1 ⊕R3 )) → Z 1 ×S 1 ×(−ε, ε), where the complex structure on T S 1 ⊕R3
is given by the same formula for Bt as in the proof of [3, Theorem 2] under a trivialization.
Note that HomCl2 (W2 , ∧•C (T S 1 ⊕ R3 )) has a structure of Z/2-graded Cl(T S 1 ⊕ R)-module
bundle over S 1 × (−ε, ε).
Now we decompose the line bundle L over U. Let (L0 , ∇) → S 1 × (−ε, ε) be the
pre-quantizing line bundle over the folded cylinder as in Appendix C.

Proposition 5.2. If we take ε small enough, then the diffeomorphism ϕ : U → Z ×(−ε, ε)
as in Theorem 2.2 can be lifted to an isomorphism between L|U → U and (L|Z ⊠L0 )/S 1 →
(Z × S 1 × (−ε, ε))/S 1 = Z × (−ε, ε).
Proof. Note that there exists the canonical isomorphism ϕ
e0 between ι∗Z L and ι∗0 ((L|Z ⊠ L0 )/S 1 ).
Fix a Hermitian connection of (L|Z ⊠L0 )/S 1 . Then the we have the required isomorphism
by using ϕ
e0 and the parallel transport.

Summarising we have the following.

Proposition 5.3. Let WB,LB := ∧•C T B ⊗ (L|Z /S 1 ) be a Z/2-graded Cl(T B)-module
bundle over B. Let W0,L0 := HomCl2 (W2 , ∧•C (T S 1 ⊕R3 ))⊗L0 be a Z/2-graded Cl(T S 1 ⊕R)module bundle over S 1 × (−ε, ε) as in the above construction. The Z/2-graded Clifford
module bundle WL |U → U is isomorphic to the quotient bundle of the tensor product
π ∗ WB,LB ⊗ p∗ W0,L0 → Z × S 1 × (−ε, ε) with respect to the diagonal S 1 -action, where
π : Z × S 1 × (−ε, ε) → B and p : Z × S 1 × (−ε, ε) → S 1 × (−ε, ε) are natural projections.

Let DS 1 be a Dirac-type operator along the S 1 -orbits in S 1 × (−ε, ε), which acts on the
space of smooth sections of W0,L0 . See Appendix C for the explicit description of DS 1 .
Let ǫB be the map representing the Z/2-grading of WB,LB , i.e., ǫB (v) = (−1)deg(v) (v)
for v ∈ WB,LB . The product of operators ǫB ⊗ DS 1 is S 1 -invariant, and it induces a
differential operator DZ acting on the smooth sections of W |U through the isomorphism
in Proposition 5.2. Since the S 1 -action on Z is given by a subgroup of T , DZ is a
differential operator along the S 1 -orbits and satisfies the anti-commutativity as in (5.1).

Example 5.10. Consider the toric origami manifold (S 2n , ω), the unit sphere, with the
moment map µ : S 2n → Rn as in Example 2.6, whose origami polytope is the union of two
copies of the n-simplex, µ(S 2n ) = ∆ = ∆1 ∪ ∆2 . Since µ((S 2n )+ ) ∩ t∗Z = µ((S 2n )− ) ∩ t∗Z ,
one has RRT (S 2n , L) = 0 for any T -equivariant pre-quantizing line bundle L.
Note that if we use the folded symplectic form kω for any positive constant k, then the
origami polytope for (S 2n , kω) is the similar extension with ratio k of the original origami
polytope. In this case one also has RRT (S 2n , Lk ) = 0 for any T -equivariant pre-quantizing
line bundle Lk .
5.3. Comments on another possible approaches. The formula (5.2) in Theorem 5.9
itself can be obtained as a consequence of the cobordism theorem [2, Theorem 4.1] and
Danilov’s theorem for symplectic toric manifolds.
There is an another possible approach which uses the theory of multi-fans introduced
in [15]. The equivariant index formula [15, Theorem 11.1], which is based on the fixed
point formula, would be available to the left hand side of (5.2). In fact as it is shown in
[18] one can associate a multi-fan for each oriented toric origami manifold.
It would be possible to show the formula (5.2) by using the theory of transverse index in
[1][20]. In [1] it was shown that the Riemann-Roch character RRT (M, L) can be realized as
a perturbation of Dirac operator by the Clliford multiplication of the Kirwan vector field
of the moment map. By considering the perturbation RRT (M, L) is localized at the zero
locus of the Kirwan vector field, i.e., the fixed point set M T . Under Assumption 4.1, the
fold has a free S 1 -action, and hence, there are no contributions of the fold to RRT (M, L).
In particular RRT (M, L) is the sum of contributions of the vertices of the image of the
moment map µ(M r Z). As in [21, Example 13] the contribution from a fixed point is
infinite sum of one dimensional representations of T in general. It implies that RRT (M, L)
is expressed as a cancellation of infinite sum of one dimensional representations. See also
[8] for the infinite dimensional nature of the transverse index and the finite dimensional
nature of the index theory in [10, 11].
In contrast to these approaches our proof is direct and geometric, which detects the
contribution of each lattice point directly and contains a new proof of original Danilov’s
theorem as a special case.
6. Computation of the local contribution
6.1. Toric case. In this subsection we consider the symplectic toric case, i.e., toric
origami manifolds with empty fold. We first summarize the set-up and notations.
Let X be a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold equipped with a Hamiltonian torus
action of an n-dimensional torus G. We assume that there exists a G-equivariant prequantizing line bundle LX → X. Let µX : X → g∗ = Lie(G)∗ and ∆X = µX (X) be the
corresponding moment map and the Delzant polytope. We take and fix an m-dimensional
face ∆′ of ∆X and a point ξ in the relative interior int(∆′ ). Let F := µ−1
X (ξ) be the m−1
′
′
dimensional isotropic torus in X and X := µX (∆ ) be the 2m-dimensional symplectic

16

HAJIME FUJITA

submanifold of X. We take and fix a point x ∈ F ⊂ X ′ . Let H be the stabilizer subgroup
at x with respect to G-action and H ⊥ the complementary orthogonal subtorus of H in G
with respect to a rational metric of g. Note that H (resp. H ⊥ ) is an n − m-dimensional
(resp. m-dimensional) subtorus of G. We denote the inclusion map of Lie-algebra and its
dual by ιH : Lie(H) = h → g and ι∗H : g∗ → h∗ respectively.
We first give following comments.
• Since the computation is purely local, we do not need the compactness of ∆X . In
fact we only use a part of the Delzant condition near ξ.
• We fix a G-invariant ω-compatible almost complex structure on X so that it also
induces a G-invariant ω-compatible almost complex structure on the inverse image
of each face of ∆X .
• F is a Lagrangian torus in the symplectic submanifold X ′ .
• F can be described as the orbit F = G · x = H ⊥ · x.
• The intersection H ∩ H ⊥ is a finite Abelian group.
• Since x is a fixed point with respect the H-action, the moment map image (ι∗H ◦
µ)(x) = ι∗H (ξ) of x with respect to the H-action is an element in the weight lattice
h∗Z .
• The argument below still holds when there exists a finite subgroup of G which
acts trivially on X. In fact in the proof of Lemma 6.2 we deal with the symplectic
toric manifold X1 for which such a subgroup H ∩ H1 ∩ H1⊥ may exist.
If Y is a smooth manifold and Y ′ is its smooth submanifold, then we denote the normal
bundle of Y ′ in Y by νY (Y ′ ). We also denote the fiber at y ∈ Y ′ by νY (Y ′ )y . There exists
a G-invariant tubular neighbourhood NF of F and G-equivariant diffeomorphism
NF ∼
= (νX (F )x × G)/H = (νX (F )x × H ⊥ )/H ∩ H ⊥ ,

where we use the G-action on the right hand side through the identification G = H ·H ⊥ =
(H × H ⊥ )/H ∩ H ⊥ arising from the exact sequence
H ∩ H⊥ → H × H⊥ → H · H⊥ = G

h 7→ (h, h−1 ), (h1 , h2 ) 7→ h1 h2 .

Since F is a Lagrangian torus in X ′ we have

νX (F )x ×H ⊥ = νX (X ′ )x ×νX ′ (F )x ×H ⊥ = νX (X ′ )x ×Tx∗ (H ⊥ ·x)×H ⊥ = νX (X ′ )x ×T ∗ H ⊥ ,

and hence, we have a G-equivariant isomorphism
(6.1)
NF ∼
= (νX (X ′ )x × T ∗ H ⊥ )/H ∩ H ⊥ .

Now we describe the restriction LX |NF . We first define an H-equivariant line bundle
L1 := νX (X ′ )x × LX |x → νX (X ′ )x , where we regarded LX |x as a representation of H.
Note that νX (X ′ )x has a natural symplectic structure and L1 is equipped with a structure
of pre-quantizing line bundle with respect to the symplectic structure. Let L2 be the pullback of LX |NF with respect to the natural map T ∗ H ⊥ → (νX (X ′ )x × T ∗ H ⊥ )/H ∩ H ⊥ ,
which is an H × H ⊥ -equivariant line bundle over T ∗ H ⊥ . Note that though H-action on
T ∗ H ⊥ is trivial, the action on L2 is non-trivial in general. We define an H ⊥ -equivariant
line bundle L̂2 → T ∗ H ⊥ by L̂2 := Hom(LX |x , L2 ). Then L̂2 is isomorphic to L2 as H ⊥ equivariant line bundle and the induced H-action on L̂2 is trivial. We have two line
bundles with connection (L1 ⊠ L̂2 )/H ∩ H ⊥ and LX |NF over (νX (X ′ )x × T ∗ H ⊥ )/H ∩
H ⊥ = NF . The restrictions of these two line bundles to the zero-section F in NF are

A DANILOV-TYPE FORMULA FOR TORIC ORIGAMI MANIFOLDS

17

isomorphic to each other as line bundles with connection. The Darboux type theorem
([12, Proposition 7.11]) implies that the G-equivariant isomorphism can be extended to a
G-invariant neighbourhood of F .
Remark 6.1. Strictly speaking we have to consider the data on sufficiently small neighbourhoods of the origin in νX (X ′ )x and the zero section H ⊥ in T ∗ H ⊥ as a Lagrangian
torus to consider the above isomorphisms and the local indices in the subsequent argument, though, we use the same notations νX (X ′ ) and T ∗ H ⊥ to simplify the notations.
Let ∆1 , . . . , ∆n−m be codimension one faces of ∆X such that ∆′ is the intersection of
them, ∆′ = ∆1 ∩· · ·∩∆n−m . For each l = 1, 2, . . . , n−m, let Hl be the circle subgroup of H
⊥
which acts trivially on the symplectic submanifold Xl := µ−1
X (∆l ) and Hl the orthogonal
complement of Hl . If we choose any members ∆l1 , . . . , ∆lα , then we have a locally free
action of the intersection Hl⊥1 ∩· · ·∩Hl⊥α = (Hl1 ·· · ··Hlα )⊥ on a small neighbourhood of the
inverse image of the complement of a neighbourhood of the boundary ∂(∆l1 ∩ · · · ∩ ∆lα )
in ∆l1 ∩ · · · ∩ ∆lα . Such a family of torus actions determines a good compatible fibration
as in Section 4.3. For each Hl we have the decomposition Hl⊥ = (H ∩ Hl⊥ ) · H ⊥ . On
the other hand there exists a natural action of the product H × H ⊥ on NF under the
identification (6.1). Then the above good compatible fibration is induced from the action
of the subgroup (H ∩ Hl⊥ ) × H ⊥ in H × H ⊥ .
The G-equivariant local index indG (NF , NF r F ) is defined by using these structures
and it is equal to the H ∩ H ⊥ -invariant part of the H × H ⊥ -equivariant local index
indH×H ⊥ (νX (X ′ )x × T ∗ H ⊥ , νX (X ′ )x × T ∗ H ⊥ r {0} × H ⊥ ). For simplicity we use the
following type of notations for the equivariant local indices:
RRH (νX (X ′ )x ) := indH (νX (X ′ )x , νX (X ′ )x r {0})

and

RRH ⊥ (T ∗ H ⊥ ) := indH ⊥ (T ∗ H ⊥ , T ∗ H ⊥ r H ⊥ ).
Lemma 6.2. RRH (νX (X ′ )x ) = C(ι∗H (ξ)) = LX |x ∈ R(H).
Proof. The second equality follows from the property of the moment map and the Kostant
formula. We show the first equality by induction on n−m = dim(νX (X ′ )x )/2. If n−m = 1,
then the equality follows from the direct computation. See [22, Example 2.3] for example.
Suppose that n − m is grater than 1 and the statement holds for any situation with
codimension n − m − 1. We consider the decomposition νX (X ′ ) = νX (X1 ) ⊕ νX1 (X ′ ) and
H = H1 · (H ∩ H1⊥ ). According to the decomposition the H-action on νX (X ′ ) factors
the action of the product of H1 -action on νX (X1 ) and H ∩ H1⊥ -action on νX1 (X ′ ). By
Proposition B.2 we have that RRH (νX (X ′ )x ) is equal to the H1 ∩ (H ∩ H1⊥ )-invariant part
of the product RRH1 (νX (X1 )x ) ⊗ RRH∩H1⊥ (νX1 (X ′ )x ). Note that H1⊥ -action on X1 gives
a structure of a symplectic toric manifold whose momentum polytope is ι∗H ⊥ (∆1 ). By the
1
assumption of the induction we have RRH1⊥ (νX1 (X ′ )x ) = C(ι∗ ⊥ (ξ)) . By considering the
H

subgroup H ∩ H1⊥ we have RRH∩H1⊥ (νX1 (X ′ )x ) = C(ι∗

is H1 ∩ H ∩ H1⊥ -invariant, and we complete the proof.

Let ιH ⊥ : h⊥ → g be the inclusion and ι∗H ⊥ its dual. We may assume that the moment
map image (ι∗H ⊥ ◦ µ)(x) = ι∗H ⊥ (ξ) of x with respect to the H ⊥ -action is an element in the
weight lattice (h⊥ )∗Z . Otherwise the compatible system on T ∗ H is acyclic, and hence, the
local index RRH ⊥ (T ∗ H ⊥ ) is zero.
Lemma 6.3. RRH ⊥ (T ∗ H ⊥ ) = C(ι∗ ⊥ (ξ)) ∈ R(H ⊥ ).

Proof. Since the H -action on T H ⊥ is free, the induced good compatible fibration(system)
on T H ⊥ consists of two open subsets, a small open neighbourhood of the zero-section H ⊥
and its complement. On the other hand by fixing a decomposition H ⊥ = (S 1 )m , we
have a product structure of compatible fibration and compatible system, where the S 1 equivariant data is determined by the inclusion ιi : S 1 ֒→ (S 1 )m = H ⊥ to the ith fator for
i = 1, · · · , m. By applying Proposition B.2 the local index RRH ⊥ (T ∗ H ⊥ ) is equal to the
product of RRS 1 (T ∗ S 1 ) defined the structure induced form ιi ’s. Then the lemma follows

from the computation of RRS 1 (T ∗ S 1 ) (See [12, Proposition 5.3] for example.).
Together with the product formula, Lemma 6.2 and Lemma 6.3 imply the following.
Proposition 6.4. We have the equality
RRH×H ⊥ (νX (X ′ )x × T ∗ H ⊥ ) = C(ι∗H (ξ)⊕ι∗ ⊥ (ξ)) ∈ R(H × H ⊥ ).
H

Theorem 6.5. indG (NF , NF r F ) 6= 0 if and only if ξ ∈ g∗Z , and if ξ ∈ g∗Z , then we have
indG (NF , NF r F ) = C(ξ) .
Proof. As we explained, indG (NF , NF r F ) is equal to the H ∩ H ⊥ -invariant part of
RRH×H ⊥ (νX (X ′ )x × T ∗ H ⊥ ) which is represented by a one-dimensional representation
of H × H ⊥ . Suppose that the invariant part is non-zero. Then the one-dimensional
representation RRH×H ⊥ (νX (X ′ )x × T ∗ H ⊥ ) descends to a representation of G. Since h∗ ⊕
h⊥∗ is isomorphic to g∗ by ι∗H ⊕ ι∗H ⊥ , the invariant part is equal to the point ι∗H (ξ) ⊕
ι∗H ⊥ (ξ) = ξ ∈ g∗Z by Proposition 6.4. Conversely if ξ ∈ g∗Z , then RRH×H ⊥ (νX (X ′ )x ×
T ∗ H ⊥ ) represents a point in g∗Z , and hence, a representation of G. In particular we have
indG (NF , NF r F ) 6= 0 as the H ∩ H ⊥ -invariant part.

Definition 6.6. A G-orbit F is called a Bohr-Sommerfeld orbit (BS-orbit for short) if
there exists a non-trivial global parallel section on the restriction (LX , ∇)|F .
Proposition 6.7. A G-orbit F is BS-orbit if and only if indG (NF , NF r F ) 6= 0.

Proof. We fix the decomposition H ⊥ = (S 1 )m as in the proof of Lemma 6.3. The computation in [10, Remark 6.10] says that RRS 1 (T ∗ S 1 ) is isomorphic to the space of parallel
sectoins Γpar (S 1 , ι∗i L̂2 |S 1 ) for each i = 1, · · · , m. By the product structure of (T H ⊥ , L̂2 )
near the zero section, the space of parallel sections Γpar (H ⊥ , L̂2 |H ⊥ ) is generated by a
constant section and isomorphic to the product of Γpar (S 1 , ι∗i L̂2 |S 1 ) ∼
= RRS 1 (T ∗ S 1 ). It
implies that Γpar (H ⊥ , L̂2 |H ⊥ ) is isomorphic to RRH ⊥ (T ∗ H ⊥ ) as H ⊥ -representation. Similarly by considering the restriction to the origin, we have that the one-dimensional representation RRH (νX (X ′ )x ) is isomorphic to LX |x as H-representation. Then we have

A DANILOV-TYPE FORMULA FOR TORIC ORIGAMI MANIFOLDS

19

that RRH (νX (X ′ )x ) ⊗ RRH ⊥ (T ∗ H ⊥ ) is isomorphic to Γpar ({0} × H ⊥ , LX |x ⊗ L̂2 |H ⊥ ) as
H × H ⊥ -representation.
If F is a BS-orbit, then there exists a non-trivial global parallel section sF : F → L|F .
By considering the pull-back we have a non-trivial global parallel section seF : H ⊥ →
LX |x ⊗ L̂2 |H ⊥ , which is H ∩ H ⊥ -invariant, and hence, it implies indG (NF , NF r F ) 6= 0.
Conversely suppose that indG (NF , NF rF ) 6= 0. Then by the isomorphism RRH (νX (X ′ )x )⊗
RRH ⊥ (T ∗ H ⊥ ) ∼
= Γpar ({0} × H ⊥ , LX |x ⊗ L̂2 |H ⊥ ) there exists an H ∩ H ⊥ -invariant nontrivial global parallel sections of LX |x ⊗ L̂2 |H ⊥ . It induces a non-trivial global parallel
section sF of LX |F by the natural map H ⊥ → H ⊥ · x = F .

6.2. Contribution from the fold. In the subsequent subsections we consider the toric

Theorem 6.9. We have
as a T -equivariant index.

indT (U ′ , U ′ r Z) = 0

Proof. As it is showed in Proposition 5.3 and by definition of DZ , the acyclic compatible
system on U ′ rZ has a natural product structure between them on B and S 1 ×(−ε/2, ε/2),
and hence, its local index indT (U ′ , U ′ r Z) is equal to the product of them in the sense
of the product formula [11, Theorem 8.8]. On the other hand the compatible system on
S 1 × (−ε/2, ε/2) is the one associated with the natural folded structure on it, and it will
be shown in Appendix C that its local index is equal to 0. See Proposition C.2. These
facts imply indT (U ′ , U ′ r Z) = 0.

Z/2-grading in the negative case is opposite to the positive case, and hence, the resulting
index has the opposite sign. The proof of the following theorem can be shown by the
similar way for the proof of Theorem 6.10.

Appendix A. Acyclic compatible systems and their local indices
In this appendix we give a brief summary of some definitions of compatible fibration,
acyclic compatible system and their local indices following [11, 12] and [9]. We adopt
combinations of definitions in [11] and [12]. Let V be a smooth manifold.
Definition A.1. A compatible fibration on V is a collection of the data {Vα , Fα }α∈A
consisting of an open covering {Vα }α∈A of V and a foliation Fα on Vα with compact
leaves which satisfies the following properties.
(1) The holonomy group of each leaf of Fα is finite.
(2) For each α and β, if a leaf L ∈ Fα has non-empty intersection L ∩ Vβ 6= ∅, then,
L ⊂ Vβ .

A DANILOV-TYPE FORMULA FOR TORIC ORIGAMI MANIFOLDS

21

Definition A.2. A compatible fibration {Vα , Fα }α∈A on V is called good if for all α and
β with Vα ∩ Vβ 6= ∅ the following condition (i) or (ii) holds.
(i) For each leaf Lα ∈ Fα , there exists a leaf Lβ ∈ Fβ such that Lα ⊂ Lβ .
(ii) For each leaf Lβ ∈ Fβ , there exists a leaf Lα ∈ Fα such that Lβ ⊂ Lα .
Let (V, g) be a Riemannian manifold, W a Cl(T V )-module bundle over V . Suppose
that V is equipped with a compatible fibration {Vα , Fα }α∈A . We impose the following
conditions on the Riemannian metric g.
Assumption A.3. Let να = {u ∈ T Vα | g(u, v) = 0 for all v ∈ T Fα } be the normal
bundle of Fα . Then, g|να is invariant under holonomy, and gives a transverse invariant
metric on να .
Definition A.4. A compatible system on ({Vα , Fα }, W ) is a data {Dα }α∈A satisfying the
following properties.
(1) Dα : Γ(W |Vα ) → Γ(W |Vα ) is an order-one formally self-adjoint differential operator.
(2) Dα contains only the derivatives along leaves of Fα .
(3) Dα is a Dirac-type operator along leaves. Namely the principal symbol of Dα is
given by the composition of the dual of the natural inclusion ια : T Fα → T Vα and
the Clifford multiplication c : T ∗ Fα ∼
= T Fα ⊂ T Vα → End(W |Vα ) .
(4) For a leaf L ∈ Fα let u
e ∈ Γ(να |L ) be a section of να |L parallel along L. u
e acts
on W |L by the Clifford multiplication c(e
u). Then Dα and c(e
u) anti-commute each
other, i.e.
0 = {Dα , c(e
u)} := Dα ◦ c(e
u) + c(e
u) ◦ Dα
as an operator on W |L .
As in [11, Lemma 3.4] for each leaf L ∈ Fα we have a small open tubular neighbourhood
VL of L and the finite covering qL : VeL → VL such that the induced foliation on VeL is a
eL .
bundle foliation with the projection πL : VeL → U

Definition A.5. A compatible system {Dα }α∈A on ({Vα , Fα }, W ) is said to be acyclic if
it satisfies the following conditions.
(1) The Dirac-type operator qL∗ Dα |π−1 (eb) has zero kernel for each α ∈ A, leaf L ∈ Fα
L
e
e
and b ∈ UL .
(2) If Vα ∩ Vβ 6= ∅, then the anti-commutator {Dα , Dβ } := Dα Dβ + Dβ Dα is a nonnegative operator on Vα ∩ Vβ .
As in [11, Section 5] we can construct such structures, good compatible fibration and
compatible system, on Hamiltonian torus manifolds. Though the good compatible fibrations form a nice class, we have to generalize it to treat the product of such structures.
Definition A.6. Suppose that a compact Lie group G acts on a Riemannian manifold
V in an isometric way. Let {Vα , Fα }α∈A be a compatible fibration on V . If the following
conditions are satisfied, then we call the compatible fibration a G-tangential compatible
fibration (or tangential compatible fibration for short).
• {Vα }α∈A is a G-invariant open covering of V .
• Each leaf L of Fα has positive dimension for all α ∈ A.
• For each leaf L of Fα there exists some x ∈ Vα such that L is contained in the
G-orbit G · x.

A compatible system on a G-tangential compatible fibration is called G-tangential compatible system (or tangential compatible system for short).
Any non-trivial torus action induces a good compatible fibration, which is a tangential
compatible fibration. Moreover the product of two such good compatible fibrations is a
tangential compatible fibration which is not good in general.
Theorem A.7 (Theorem 7.2 and Proposition 7.3 in [11],Theorem 3.7 in [9]). Suppose
that V is an open subset of M whose complement is compact. If V is equipped with
a G-tangential acyclic compatible system {Vα , Fα , Dα }α∈A , then we can define the local
index
ind(M, {Vα , Fα , Dα }α∈A , W ) = ind(M, V, W ) = ind(M, V ) ∈ Z,
which satisfies the excision formula, sum formula and product formula.
Let us briefly recall the definition of the local index ind(M, V, W ). LetP
D : Γ(W ) →
Γ(W ) be a Dirac-type operator. We consider the perturbation Dt := D + t α∈A ρα Dα ρα
for t ≫ 1, where {ρα }α∈A is a family of smooth cut-off functions which is constant along
leaves of Fα and satisfies some estimates as in [11, Subection 4.1]. Such a perturbation Dt
gives a Fredholm operator on the space of L2 -sections of W . The local index ind(M, V ) is
defined as the analytic index of Dt for t ≫ 1. The excision formula implies the following
localization formula of Dirac-type operator.
Theorem A.8. Suppose that M is compact without boundary and an open subset V of
M is equipped with a G-tangential acyclic compatible system. Then the index of any
Dirac-type operator ind(W ) is localized at the complement M r V . Namely we have
ind(W ) = ind(M, V ).
Appendix B. A formula of local indices of vector spaces
In this appendix we give a formula of equivariant local indices of vector spaces. For
l = 1, 2 let Gl be an ml -dimensional torus and Rl an ml -dimensional Hermitian vector
space on which Gl acts unitary and effective way. We put the following assumptions for
l = 1, 2.
Assumption B.1. (1) A Gl -tangential equivariant compatible fibration (Definition A.6)
on Rl× := Rl r {0} is given.
(2) For the compatible fibration in (1), a Gl -tangential equivariant acyclic compatible
system on Rl× is given.
By the assumption we have two equivariant local indices indG1 (R1 , R1× ) and indG2 (R2 , R2× ).
Now we fix ε > 0 small enough and define two compatible fibrations and acyclic compatible systems on the product R := R1 × R2 .
Define two subsets R′ and R′′ of R by
and

R′ := {(v1 , v2 ) ∈ R | |v1 | > ε, |v2 | < ε},

R′′ := {(v1 , v2 ) ∈ R | |v1 | < ε, |v2 | > ε}.
We consider a structure of G1 -tangential (resp. G2 -tangential) compatible fibration on R′
(resp. R′′ ) induced from the first (resp. second) factor. We also define a subset R∞ of R
by
R∞ := {(v1 , v2 ) ∈ R | |v1 | > ε/2, |v2 | > ε/2},

which is also equipped with a compatible fibration and compatible system arising from
e∞ := R′ ∪ R′′ ∪ R∞ gives an open covering of the
the product structure. Then the union R
complement of a compact neighbourhood of the origin of R. Note that the above compatible fibration and compatible system define a G1 × G2 -tangential equivariant compatible

product of these structures induces a G1 × G2 -tangential equivariant compatible fibration

Appendix C. Local index of folded cylinder
In this appendix we consider a natural folded symplectic structure on the cylinder
and several geometric structures on it, which plays important role in the study of local
property of the neighbourhood of the fold in a folded symplectic manifold. We consider
a perturbation of the Dirac operator and give the direct computation of the L2 -kernel of
the perturbed Dirac operator. We show that the L2 -kernel is trivial, in particular, the
local index is equal to 0.
For any ε > 0, a folded symplectic structure on a cylinder (of finite length) Mε :=
(−ε, ε) × S 1 is given by a closed 2-form 2rdr ∧ dθ, where (r, θ) is a coordinate function
on Mε . Here we use the opposite orientation of the cylinder as that in Section 5 and
subsequent argument for conventional reason. The standard S 1 -action on the S 1 -factor is
Hamiltonian (in fact it is toric origami) with√the moment map (r, θ) 7→ r 2 . Moreover the
trivial line bundle L0 with connection d − 2π −1r 2 dθ and the trivial lift of the S 1 -action
to the fiber direction gives an S 1 -equivariant pre-quantizing line bundle over Mε . To give
a computation of the local index of this toric origami manifold, we need a Clifford module
bundle, Dirac-type operator along the S 1 -orbits over a completion of Mε as a Riemannian
manifold. We summarize the set-up as follows.

Remark C.1. When we consider the restriction to an S 1 -invariant small open neighbourhood Mε of {0} × S 1 = S 1 in M, the closed 2-form ω is the folded symplectic form
on Mε and the Z/2-graded Clifford module bundle W is the one associated with√the prequantizing line bundle L0 , the trivial line bundle with the connection d − 2π −1ρdθ.
Note that Mε has a unique spinc -structure and the Clifford module bundle W which is
isomorphic to W0,L0 := HomCl2 (W2 , ∧•C (T S 1 ⊕ R3 )) ⊗ L0 as in Proposition 5.3.
By using this data we have a compatible system on Mε and can define the S 1 -equivariant
local index indS 1 (S 1 × (−ε, ε), S 1 × (−ε, ε) r S 1 ). The index is defined by the following
perturbation of the Dirac operator:

and

Dt = Dt+ + Dt− , Dt+ := D + + tDS+1 , Dt− := D − + tDS−1 ,

√
Dt+ = (1 + t)(∂θ − 2π −1ρ) − −1∂r ,
√
√
Dt− = −(1 + t)(∂θ − 2π −1ρ) − −1∂r .

Proposition C.2. We have kerL2 (Dt+ ) = kerL2 (Dt− ) = 0 for any t ≥ 0. In particular we
have indS 1 (S 1 × (−ε, ε), S 1 × (−ε, ε) r S 1 ) = 0, for any ε > 0.

Proof. By using the Fourier expansion φ(r, θ) =
am (r)e2π −1mθ for smooth section φ
m∈Z

of W + , the equation Dt+ φ = 0 can be rewritten as a series of differential equations
a′m (r) = 2π(1 + t)(m − ρ(r))am (r) (m ∈ Z).

Each of these equations has solutions

where αm ∈ C is constant. Suppose that the solution φ is an L2 -section. Since ρ ≡ 1/2
on ±r ≫ 0 we have αm = 0 for all m ∈ Z. In particular there are no non-trivial

Remark C.3. The vanishing of the index can be deduced from the existence of an
orientation reversing isomorphism of S 1 × (−ε, ε) defined by (θ, t) 7→ (θ, −t).
