FUNCTIONAL INEQUALITIES INVOLVING
NUMERICAL DIFFERENTIATION FORMULAS OF
ORDER TWO
TOMASZ SZOSTOK
Abstract. We write expressions connected with numerical differentiation formulas of order 2 in the form of Stieltjes integral, then
we use Ohlin lemma and Levin-Stechkin theorem to study inequalities connected with these expressions. In particular, we present a
new proof of the inequality

satisfied by every convex function f : R → R and we obtain extensions of (1). Then we deal with nonsymmetric inequalities of a
similar form.

we can see that (2) is, in fact, an inequality involving two very simple quadrature operators and a very simple differentiation formula. In
papers [11] and [12] the quadrature operators occurring in (2) were replaced by more general ones whereas in [9] the middle term from (2)
was replaced by more general formulas used in numerical differentiation. Thus inequalities involving expressions of the form

(where Φ′′ = f )which are used to approximate the second order derivative of F and, surprisingly, we discover a connection between our
approach and the inequality (1).
First we make the following simple observation.

Remark 1. Let f, F, Φ : [x, y] → R be such that Φ′ = F, F ′ = f, let
ni , mi ∈ N ∪ {0}, i = 1, 2, 3 ai,j ∈ R, αi,j , βi,j ∈ [0, 1], αi,j + βi.j =
1, i = 1, 2, 3; j = 1, . . . , ni bi,j ∈ R, γi,j , δi,j ∈ [0, 1], γi,j + δi,j = 1, i =
1, 2, 3; j = 1, . . . , mi . If the inequality

is satisfied for for x = 0, y = 1 and for all continuous and convex functions f : [0, 1] → R then it is satisfied for all x, y ∈ R, x < y and for each
continuous and convex function f : [x, y] → R. To see this it is enough
to observe that expressions from (5) remain unchanged if we replace
f : [x, y] → R by ϕ : [0, 1] → R given by ϕ(t) := f (x + t(y − x)) .
The simplest expression used to approximate the second order derivative of f is of the form

In this paper we shall obtain some inequalities for convex functions
which do not follow from numerical differentiation results.
In order to get such results we shall use Stieltjes integral. In paper
[10] it was observed that the classical Hermite-Hadamard inequality
(2) easily follows from the following Ohlin lemma
Lemma 1. (Ohlin [8]) Let X1 , X2 be two random variables such that
EX1 = EX2 and let F1 , F2 be their distribution functions. If F1 , F2
satisfy for some x0 the following inequalities
then

F1 (x) ≤ F2 (x) if x < x0 and F1 (x) ≥ F2 (x) if x > x0

(6)

Ef (X1 ) ≤ Ef (X2 )

for all continuous and convex functions f : R → R.
Ohlin lemma was used also in paper [11]. However in the present
approach (similarly as in [9] and [12]) we are going to use a more
general result from [6], (see also [7] Theorem 4.2.7). In this theorem
we use the notations from [7].
Theorem 1. (Levin, Stechkin) Let F1 , F2 : [a, b] → R be two functions
with bounded variation such that F1 (a) = F2 (a). Then, in order that
Z b
Z b
f (x)dF1 (x) ≤
f (x)dF2 (x)

for all continuous and convex functions f : [a, b] → R it is necessary
and sufficient that F1 and F2 verify the following three conditions:

(8)

F1 (b) = F2 (b),

Remark 3. As it easy to see, if measures occurring in Ohlin lemma
are concentrated on the interval [x, y] then this lemma is an easy consequence of Theorem 1. However Theorem 1 is more general for two
reasons: it allows functions F1 , F2 to have more crossing points than
one and functions F1 , F2 do not have to be cumulative distribution
functions. Therefore we shall use this theorem even if functions F1 , F2
have exactly one crossing point.

Let now f : [x, y] → R be any function and let F, Φ : [x, y] → R be
such that F ′ = f and Φ′ = F. We need to write the expression

for some F1 . In the next proposition we show that it is possible – here
for the sake of simplicity we shall work on the interval [0, 1].
Proposition 1. Let f : [0, 1] → R be any function and let Φ : [0, 1] →
R be such that Φ′′ = f. Then we have

Proof. Let F : [0, 1] → R be such that Φ′ = F. Now, to prove this
proposition it is enough to do the following calculations

As we already know (Remark 2) the first one of the above inequalities
may be obtained using the numerical analysis results.
Now the inequalities from the Dragomir’s paper easily follow from
Ohlin lemma but there are many possibilities of generalizations and
modifications of inequalities (12). These generalizations will be discussed in the following chapters.
2. The symmetric case
We start with the following remark.
Remark 5. Let F∗ (t) = at2 + bt + c for some
R ya, b, c ∈ R, a 6= 0. It
is impossible to obtain inequalities involving x f dF∗ and any of the
Ry
 f (x)+f (y)

,
which were satisfied for all
f (t)dt, f x+y
expressions: y−x
2

convex functions f : [x, y] → R. Indeed, suppose for example that we
have
Z y
Z y
1
f dF∗ ≤
f (t)dt
y−x x
x
for all convex f : [x, y] → R. Without loss of generality we may assume
that F∗ (x) = 0, then from Theorem 1 we have F∗ (y) = 1 Also from
Theorem 1 we get

y

F∗ (t)dt =

x

t−x
, t ∈ [x, y] which is impossible, since F∗ is either
where F0 (t) = y−x
strictly convex or concave.

This remark means that in order to get some new inequalities of the
Hermite-Hadamard type we have to integrate with respect to functions
constructed with use of (at least) two quadratic functions, as it was
the case in Proposition 1 Now we may present the main result of this
section.
Theorem 2. Let x, y be some real numbers such that x < y and let
a ∈ R. Let f, F, Φ : [x, y] → R be any functions such that F ′ = f and
Φ′ = F and let Ta f (x, y) be defined by the formula

Then the following inequalities hold for all convex functions f :

Proof. In view of Remark 1 we may restrict ourselves to the case x =
0, y = 1. Take a ∈ R, let f : [0, 1] :→ R be any convex function and let
F, Φ : [0, 1] → R be such that F ′ = f, Φ′ = F. Define F1 : [0, 1] → R by

and F1 (t) ≤ F3 (t) for t ∈ 2 , 1 and this means that from Ohlin lemma

Suppose that a > 2. Then there are three crossing points of functions

F1 (t) ≤ F4 (t) for t ∈ 21 , 1 i.e. there is only one crossing point of these
functions and (17) is obvious. However, for a ∈ (−2, −6] we have

and therefore, in view of Theorem 1 we still have (17). In the case
a < −6 inequality (22) is no longer true which means that expres(y)
sions Ta f (x, y) and f (x)+f
are not comparable in the class of convex
2
functions.

This theorem provides us with a full description of inequalities which
may be obtained using Stieltjes integral with respect to a function of
the form (18). Some of the obtained inequalities are already known.
For example from (13) and (14) we obtain the inequality

3. The non-symmetric case
In this part of the paper we shall obtain inequalities for f (αx + (1 −
α)y) and for αf (x) + (1 − α)f (y) where α is not necessarily equal to 12 .
Now, in contrast to the symmetric case (Remark 5), it is possible
to prove inequalities using just one quadratic function but before we

10

do this we shall present a nonsymmetric version of Hermite-Hadamard
inequality involving only the primitive function of f.
Proposition 2. Let x, y be some real numbers such that x < y and let
α ∈ [0, 1]. Let f : [x, y] → R, be a convex function, let F : [x, y] → R
be such that F ′ = f. If Sα1 f (x, y) is defined by

then the following inequality is satisfied:
(27)

f (αx + (1 − α)y) ≤ Sα1 f (x, y) ≤ αf (x) + (1 − α)f (y).

Proof. As usually, the proof will be done on the interval [0, 1]. Define
functions F6 , F7 , F8 : [0, 1] → R by the following formulas:

0 t ≤ 1 − α,
,
(28)
F6 (t) :=
1 t > 1 − α,

Moreover both of the pairs (F6 , F8 ) and (F8 , F7 ) has only one crossing

α ∈ [0, 1]. Let f : [x, y] → R, be a convex functions, let F be such that
F ′ = f and let Φ satisfy Φ′ = F. If Sα2 f (x, y) is defined by

Proof. Take

It is easy to see that functions F9 , F7 have exactly one crossing point

Now, assume that α ∈ 31 , 23 then function F9 is increasing and,
consequently,
F9 (t) ≥ F6 (t), t ∈ [0, 1 − α], and F9 (t) ≤ F6 (t), t ∈ (1 − α, 1].

Thus for every convex function f we have

Let now α < 31 Then function F9 is decreasing on some interval [0, d]
and increasing on [d, 1]. Observe that from the equality,
Z 1
Z 1
F9 (t)dt =
F6 (t)dt

we know that functions F9 , F6 must have a crossing point in the interval
(0, 1 − α), further these functions cross also at the point 1 − α. Thus
there are two crossing points of F9 , F6 in view of Lemma 2 from [9] this
means that expressions
Z 1
Z 1
f dF6 ,

are incomparable in the class of convex functions (as claimed). The
reasoning in the case α > 32 is similar.

Now we shall prove the inequality (33). If α ∈ 0, 13 ∪ [ 32 , 1) then
α
F9′ (0) ≤ 1−α
and F9′ (1) ≤ 1−α
this means that functions F9 and F8
α
have only one crossing point and, therefore we have (33).
α
If on the other hand α ∈ ( 31 , 12 ) then F9′ (0) < 1−α
and F9′ (1) > 1−α
α
and, consequently functions F9 , F8 have two crossing points.
Similarly

as before from Lemma 2, [9] we know that for α ∈ 31 , 21 , Sα1 f (x, y) and
Sα2 f (x, y) are incomparable in the class of convex functions, as claimed.
It is easy to see that in the case α ∈ 21 , 32 functions F9 , F8 have again
two crossing points which finishes the proof.

4. Concluding remarks and examples
In the previous sections we made an exhaustive study of two types
of inequalities. Now we briefly describe the possible extensions of our
results.
Remark 8. In order to obtain inequalities involving expressions of the
3 Φ(y)
form a1 Φ(x)+a2 Φ(αx+(1−α)y)+a
functions of the form
(y−x)2

where c = − 1−α
must be used. Since the description of all possible
cases in Theorem 2 was already quite complicated, we shall not present
these inequalities in details here.
Remark 9. It is possible to use methods developed in this paper to get
inequalities involving longer expressions of the form (4). In order to

do that it is necessary to use more than two quadratic functions. For

functions F9 , F6 have in this case two crossing points. This means that,

Remark 11. It is easy to see that all inequalities obtained in this paper
in fact characterize convex functions (or 2−convex functions). This is
a consequence of results contained in paper [1].
