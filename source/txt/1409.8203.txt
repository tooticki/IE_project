Abstract. We show that there exists a Banach space E such that:
‚Ä¢ the Banach algebra B(E) of bounded, linear operators on E has a singular extension
which splits algebraically, but it does not split strongly;
‚Ä¢ the homological bidimension of B(E) is at least two.
The first of these conclusions solves a natural problem left open by Bade, Dales, and Lykova
(Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 1999), while the second answers a question of Helemskii. The
Banach space E that we use was originally introduced by Read (J. London Math. Soc. 1989).

‚Ä¢ la bidimension homologique de B(E) est au moins deux.
La premi√®re de ces conclusions compl√®te les r√©sultats de Bade, Dales et Lykova (Mem. Amer.
Math. Soc. 1999), et la seconde r√©pond √† une question de Helemskii. L‚Äôespace de Banach E

1. Introduction and statement of results
By an extension of a Banach algebra B, we understand a short-exact sequence of the form
{0}

/ ker œï

/A

œï

/B

/ {0},

(1.1)

where A is a Banach algebra and œï : A ‚Üí B is a continuous, surjective algebra homomorphism. The extension splits algebraically (respectively, splits strongly) if there is an algebra
homomorphism (respectively, a continuous algebra homomorphism) œÅ : B ‚Üí A which is a
right inverse of œï, in the sense that œï ‚ó¶ œÅ is the identity map on B. We say that (1.1) is
admissible if œï has a right inverse which is bounded and linear, or, equivalently, if ker œï is
complemented in A as a Banach space. Every extension which splits strongly is obviously
admissible. The extension (1.1) is singular if ker œï has trivial multiplication, in the sense that
ab = 0 whenever a, b ‚àà ker œï.
Bade, Dales, and Lykova [1] carried out a comprehensive study of extensions of Banach
algebras, focusing in particular on the following question:
For which (classes of) Banach algebras B is it true that every extension of the
form (1.1) which splits algebraically also splits strongly?

This question can be viewed as a variation on the theme of automatic continuity. Of course,
its answer is positive whenever the Banach algebra B has the property that every algebra
homomorphism from B into a Banach algebra is continuous. A classical theorem of Johnson [5]
states that the Banach algebra B = B(E) of all bounded operators on a Banach space E has
this property whenever E is isomorphic to its Cartesian square E ‚äï E.
Johnson‚Äôs result, however, does not extend to all Banach spaces because Read [9] has constructed a Banach space ER such that there exists a discontinuous derivation (and hence a
discontinuous algebra homomorphism) from B(ER ). Dales, Loy, and Willis [2] have subsequently given an example of a Banach space EDLW such that all derivations from B(EDLW )
are continuous, but under the assumption of the Continuum Hypothesis, B(EDLW ) admits a
discontinuous algebra homomorphism into a Banach algebra.
These results still leave open the above question of Bade, Dales, and Lykova in the case
of B(E) for a general Banach space E: is it true that every extension of B(E) which splits
algebraically also splits strongly? Our first result answers this question in the negative.
Theorem 1.1. There exists a continuous, surjective algebra homomorphism œï from a unital
Banach algebra A onto B(ER ), where ER denotes the above-mentioned Banach space of Read,
such that the extension
œï /
/A
/ {0}
/ ker œï
B(ER )
{0}
is singular and splits algebraically, but it is not admissible, and so it does not split strongly.
We do not know whether Read‚Äôs Banach space ER is essential for this result. Due to the
dearth of examples of Banach spaces E for which B(E) admits a discontinuous homomorphism
into a Banach algebra, E = ER was the most obvious place to start our investigations, and it
led to the answer that we were looking for.
Before we can state our second result, we require some more terminology. Let n ‚àà N0 .
A Banach algebra B has homological bidimension at least n if there exists a Banach B-bimodule X such that the nth continuous Hochschild cohomology group H n (B, X) of B with
coefficients in X is non-zero. This notion is the topological counterpart of a long established
notion in pure algebra. It was introduced by Helemskii, who, together with his students, has
studied it for many classes of Banach algebras; see [3] for an overview.
A Banach algebra B which has homological bidimension zero (so that H 1 (B, X) = {0}
for every Banach B-bimodule X) is contractible. It is conjectured that a Banach algebra is
contractible (if and) only if it is finite-dimensional and semisimple.
If true, this conjecture would imply that the Banach algebra B(E) has homological bidimension at least one for every infinite-dimensional Banach space E; see [7, Proposition 5.1]
for a strong partial result in this direction. It appears to be unknown if a Banach algebra of
the form B(E) for a (necessarily infinite-dimensional) Banach space E can have homological
bidimension at least two, a problem that goes back to Helemskii‚Äôs seminar at Moscow State
University. In the case where E is a Hilbert space, this problem is stated explicitly as [4,
Problem 21]; see also [1, p. 27]. We shall show that the homological bidimension of B(E) can
be two or greater, again using the above-mentioned Banach space ER of Read.
Theorem 1.2. There exist a one-dimensional Banach B(ER )-bimodule X and a linear injection from the Banach algebra B(‚Ñì2 (N)) of bounded operators on the Hilbert space ‚Ñì2 (N)
into the second continuous Hochschild cohomology group of B(ER ) with coefficients in X.
Hence B(ER ) has homological bidimension at least two.

2. Proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2
The proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 both rely on a strengthening of the main technical result
in Read‚Äôs paper, as it is stated in [9, Section 4]. This strengthening involves two further pieces
of notation. First, we denote by W (ER ) the ideal of weakly compact operators on the Banach
space ER . Second, we endow the Hilbert space ‚Ñì2 (N) with the trivial multiplication and write
‚Ñì2 (N)‚àº for its unitization; that is, ‚Ñì2 (N)‚àº = ‚Ñì2 (N) ‚äï K1 as a vector space (where K denotes
the scalar field, either R or C, and 1 is the formal identity that we adjoin), while the product
and the norm on ‚Ñì2 (N)‚àº are given by
(x + Œª1)(y + ¬µ1) = Œªy + ¬µx + Œª¬µ1 and kx + Œª1k = kxk + |Œª|

(x, y ‚àà ‚Ñì2 (N), Œª, ¬µ ‚àà K).

Theorem 2.1. There exists a continuous, surjective algebra homomorphism œà from B(ER )
onto ‚Ñì2 (N)‚àº with ker œà = W (ER ) such that the extension
{0}

/ W (ER )

/ B(ER )

œà

/ ‚Ñì2 (N)‚àº

/ {0}

splits strongly.
The proof of this result relies on a careful analysis of Read‚Äôs construction; full details will
appear in [8].
In order to prove Theorem 1.1, we require another tool, namely the pullback of a diagram
of the form
Œ± / o Œ≤
C
B,
(2.1)
A
where A , B, and C are Banach algebras, and Œ± : A ‚Üí C and Œ≤ : B ‚Üí C are continuous
algebra homomorphisms. We can define the pullback of this diagram explicitly by the formula
(2.2)

D = {(a, b) ‚àà A ‚äï B : Œ±(a) = Œ≤(b)},

where A ‚äï B denotes the direct sum of the Banach algebras A and B. Being a closed
subalgebra of A ‚äï B, D is a Banach algebra in its own right. Let
Œ≥ : (a, b) 7‚Üí a,

D ‚ÜíA,

and

Œ¥ : (a, b) 7‚Üí b,

D ‚Üí B,

(2.3)

be the restrictions to D of the coordinate projections. Then Œ± ‚ó¶ Œ≥ = Œ≤ ‚ó¶ Œ¥, and it can
be shown that D, together with the continuous algebra homomorphisms Œ≥ and Œ¥, has the
following universal property, so that they form a pullback of (2.1) in the categorical sense:
for every Banach algebra E and each pair Œæ : E ‚Üí A and Œ∑ : E ‚Üí B of continuous algebra
homomorphisms satisfying Œ± ‚ó¶ Œæ = Œ≤ ‚ó¶ Œ∑, there is a unique continuous algebra homomorphism
Œ∏ : E ‚Üí D such that the diagram

We now come to our key result, which establishes a connection between extensions and
pullbacks.
Proposition 2.2. Let A , B, and C be Banach algebras such that there are extensions
{0}

/ ker Œ±

/A

{0}

/ ker Œ≤

/B

Œ±

/C

/ {0}

(2.4)

/C

/ {0},

(2.5)

and
Œ≤

and define D, Œ≥, and Œ¥ by (2.2) and (2.3), above. Then Œ¥ is surjective, and the following
statements concerning the extension
{0}

/ ker Œ¥

/D

Œ¥

/B

/ {0}

(2.6)

hold true:
(i) (2.6) is singular if and only if (2.4) is singular.
(ii) Suppose that (2.5) splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible). Then
(2.6) splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible) if and only if (2.4)
splits strongly (respectively, splits algebraically, is admissible).
Proof. The surjectivity of Œ± implies that Œ¥ is surjective, so that (2.6) is indeed an extension.
(i). The restriction of Œ≥ to ker Œ¥ is an isomorphism onto ker Œ±, and the conclusion follows.
(ii). Let œÅ : C ‚Üí B be a continuous algebra homomorphism which is a right inverse of Œ≤.
‚áí. Suppose that œÑ : B ‚Üí D is a continuous algebra homomorphism which is a right inverse
of Œ¥. Then a direct calculation shows that the continuous algebra homomorphism Œ≥ ‚ó¶ œÑ ‚ó¶ œÅ is
a right inverse of Œ±, so that (2.4) splits strongly.
‚áê. Suppose that œÉ : C ‚Üí A is a continuous algebra homomorphism which is a right
inverse of Œ±. Then, setting œÑ (b) = (œÉ(Œ≤(b)), b) for each b ‚àà B, we obtain a continuous algebra
homomorphism œÑ : B ‚Üí D. The definition of Œ¥ implies that œÑ is a right inverse of Œ¥, and
hence (2.6) splits strongly.
The proof just given applies equally to establish the other two cases.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Our aim is to apply Proposition 2.2 with B = B(ER ), C = ‚Ñì2 (N)‚àº ,
and Œ≤ = œà. Theorem 2.1 shows that, for these choices, we have an extension of the form (2.5)
which splits strongly.
Let q : ‚Ñì1 (N) ‚Üí ‚Ñì2 (N) be a bounded, linear surjection. Then ker q is not complemented
in ‚Ñì1 (N) because no (complemented) subspace of ‚Ñì1 (N) is isomorphic to ‚Ñì2 (N). Equip ‚Ñì1 (N)
with the trivial product, let A = ‚Ñì1 (N) ‚äï K1 be its unitization (defined analogously to the
unitization of ‚Ñì2 (N), above), and define Œ± : A ‚Üí C by Œ±(x+ Œª1) = q(x)+ Œª1 for x ‚àà ‚Ñì1 (N) and
Œª ‚àà K. Then Œ± is a continuous, surjective algebra homomorphism with kernel ker q, which
is uncomplemented in ‚Ñì1 (N) and hence in A , so that we have a singular, non-admissible
extension of the form (2.4).
Being surjective, q has a linear right inverse œÅ : ‚Ñì2 (N) ‚Üí ‚Ñì1 (N), which is multiplicative because ‚Ñì1 (N) and ‚Ñì2 (N) both have the trivial product. Extend œÅ to a linear map between the
unitizations C and A by making it unital. Then it is an algebra homomorphism which is
a right inverse of Œ±, so that the extension (2.4) splits algebraically. Hence Proposition 2.2
produces a singular extension (2.6) of B = B(ER ) which splits algebraically, but is not
admissible.

Before we proceed to prove Theorem 1.2, let us recall the formal definition of the second
continuous Hochschild cohomology group of a Banach algebra B with coefficients in a Banach
B-bimodule X. A 2-cocycle is a bilinear map Œ• : B √ó B ‚Üí X which satisfies
a ¬∑ Œ•(b, c) ‚àí Œ•(ab, c) + Œ•(a, bc) ‚àí Œ•(a, b) ¬∑ c = 0

(a, b, c ‚àà B).

The set Z 2 (B, X) of continuous 2-cocycles forms a closed subspace of the Banach space of
continuous, bilinear maps from B √ó B into X. Each bounded, linear map ‚Ñ¶ : B ‚Üí X induces
a continuous 2-cocycle by the definition
Œ¥1 ‚Ñ¶ : (a, b) 7‚Üí a ¬∑ (‚Ñ¶b) ‚àí ‚Ñ¶(ab) + (‚Ñ¶a) ¬∑ b,

(2.7)

B √ó B ‚Üí X.

The 2-cocyles of this form are called 2-coboundaries; they form a (not necessarily closed)
subspace N 2 (B, X) of Z 2 (B, X), and so the quotient
H 2 (B, X) := Z 2 (B, X)/N 2 (B, X)
is a vector space, which is the second continuous Hochschild cohomology group of B with
coefficients in X.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. By Theorem 2.1, there are continuous algebra homomorphisms
œà : B(ER ) ‚Üí ‚Ñì2 (N)‚àº

and

œÅ : ‚Ñì2 (N)‚àº ‚Üí B(ER )

such that œÅ is a right inverse of œà. The definition of the unitization implies that we can find
maps œà0 : B(ER ) ‚Üí ‚Ñì2 (N) and Œ∏ : B(ER ) ‚Üí K such that
œà(T ) = œà0 (T ) + Œ∏(T )1

(T ‚àà B(ER )).

We see that Œ∏ is a continuous algebra homomorphism, and X = K is a one-dimensional Banach
B(ER )-bimodule with respect to the operations
T ¬∑ Œª = Œ∏(T )Œª

and

Œª ¬∑ T = Œ∏(T )Œª

(2.8)

(T ‚àà B(ER ), Œª ‚àà X).

Moreover, œà0 is bounded and linear. Consequently, for each U ‚àà B(‚Ñì2 (N)), we can define a
continuous, bilinear map Œ•U : B(ER ) √ó B(ER ) ‚Üí X by
Œ•U (S, T ) = hU (œà0 (S)), œà0 (T )i

(2.9)

(S, T ‚àà B(ER )),
≈ô‚àû

where h¬∑, ¬∑i denotes the usual Banach-space duality bracket on ‚Ñì2 (N), that is, hx, yi = n=1 xn yn
for x = (xn ) and y = (yn ) in ‚Ñì2 (N). The map œà0 is not multiplicative; more precisely,
since ‚Ñì2 (N) has trivial multiplication, we have
œà0 (ST ) = Œ∏(S)œà0 (T ) + Œ∏(T )œà0 (S)

(S, T ‚àà B(ER )).

A straightforward verification based on this identity shows that Œ•U is a 2-cocycle. Hence we
have a map Œ• : U 7‚Üí Œ•U , B(‚Ñì2 (N)) ‚Üí Z 2 (B(ER ), X), which is clearly linear.
Suppose that Œ•U is a 2-coboundary for some U ‚àà B(‚Ñì2 (N)), so that Œ•U = Œ¥1 ‚Ñ¶ for some
bounded, linear map ‚Ñ¶ : B(ER ) ‚Üí X. Since œÅ is a right inverse of œà, we see that œà0 (œÅ(x)) = x
and Œ∏(œÅ(x)) = 0 for each x ‚àà ‚Ñì2 (N). Combining these identities with the definitions (2.7)‚Äì(2.9),
we obtain
hU x, yi = (Œ¥1 ‚Ñ¶)(œÅ(x), œÅ(y)) = Œ∏(œÅ(x))‚Ñ¶(œÅ(y)) ‚àí ‚Ñ¶(œÅ(x)œÅ(y)) + Œ∏(œÅ(y))‚Ñ¶(œÅ(x)) = 0
for each x, y ‚àà ‚Ñì2 (N) because œÅ(x)œÅ(y) = œÅ(xy) = 0. This shows that U = 0, so that 0
is the only 2-coboundary in the image of Œ•. Hence the composition of Œ• with the quotient map from Z 2 (B(ER ), X) onto H 2 (B(ER ), X) is a linear injection from B(‚Ñì2 (N))
into H 2 (B(ER ), X), and the result follows.

Remark 2.3. There is an underlying connection between Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. To explain
it, consider two extensions (2.4) and (2.5) of a Banach algebra C , where the former extension
is singular and admissible, but does not split strongly, while the latter splits strongly. Then, by
Proposition 2.2, we obtain a singular, admissible extension (2.6) of the Banach algebra B, and
this extension does not split strongly. Hence a classical result of Johnson (see [6, Theorem 2.1],
or [3, Corollary I.1.11] for an exposition) implies that ker Œ¥ is a Banach B-bimodule and
H 2 (B, ker Œ¥) is non-zero, so that B has homological bidimension at least two.
To apply this result to B = B(ER ), we take C = ‚Ñì2 (N)‚àº and Œ≤ = œà as in the proof
of Theorem 1.1, so that we have an extension of the form (2.5) which splits strongly by
Theorem 2.1. Choose U ‚àà B(‚Ñì2 (N)) with kU k 6 1, and turn the vector space K ‚äï ‚Ñì2 (N) into
a Banach algebra by endowing it with the product and the norm
(Œª, x)(¬µ, y) = (hU x, yi, 0)

and

k(Œª, x)k = |Œª| + kxk

(x, y ‚àà ‚Ñì2 (N), Œª, ¬µ ‚àà K).

Denote by A the unitization of this Banach algebra, and let Œ± : A ‚Üí C be the natural unital
projection. Then Œ± is a continuous, surjective algebra homomorphism, and we have a singular,
admissible extension of the form (2.4), which can be shown to split algebraically if and only if
it splits strongly, if and only if U = 0. Thus, choosing U non-zero, we conclude that B(ER )
has homological bidimension at least two.
A similar argument shows that B(EDLW ) has homological bidimension at least two, where
EDLW denotes the Banach space of Dales, Loy, and Willis studied in [2]. To see this, take
B = B(EDLW ) and C = ‚Ñì‚àû (Z), and apply [1, Theorem 3.11(i)] to obtain a singular, admissible
extension of ‚Ñì‚àû (Z) which does not split strongly.
Acknowledgements. We are grateful to Garth Dales (Lancaster) and Zinaida Lykova (Newcastle) for having drawn our attention to the questions of whether every extension of B(E)
which splits algebraically also splits strongly, and whether B(E) may have homological bidimension at least two, respectively, and for their comments on preliminary versions of our work.
We would also like to thank Yemon Choi (Lancaster) for several helpful discussions.
