Abstract
In this follow-up of our earlier two works D(11.1) (arXiv:1406.0929 [math.DG]) and
D(11.2) (arXiv:1412.0771 [hep-th]) in the D-project, we study further the notion of a ‘differentiable map from an Azumaya/matrix manifold to a real manifold’. A conjecture is
made that the notion of differentiable maps from Azumaya/matrix manifolds as defined in
D(11.1) is equivalent to one defined through the contravariant ring-homomorphisms alone.
A proof of this conjecture for the smooth (i.e. C ∞ ) case is given in this note. Thus, at
least in the smooth case, our setting for D-branes in the realm of differential geometry is
completely parallel to that in the realm of algebraic geometry, cf. arXiv:0709.1515 [math.AG]
and arXiv:0809.2121 [math.AG]. A related conjecture on such maps to Rn , as a C k -manifold,
and its proof in the C ∞ case is also given. As a by-product, a conjecture on a division lemma
in the finitely differentiable case that generalizes the division lemma in the smooth case from
Malgrange is given in the end, as well as other comments on the conjectures in the general
C k case. We remark that there are similar conjectures in general and theorems in the smooth
case for the fermionic/super generalization of the notion.

Chien-Hao Liu dedicates this note to the memory of
Beina Yao (1981–2015).

(From C.H.L.) Playing the flute, as well as other woodwind instruments, is really meant to sing through the
piece of metal (or wood). This is why when Beina’s singing came across my world by accident in late 2014, it
immediately attracted and touched me. Her voice has a rich and solid timbre with the flexibility to cover a wide
range usually only a mechanical musical instrument can reach without losing its elegance, cleanness, and fullness.
Despite years of rigorous conservatory training in Chinese traditional folk music, her voice remains so natural
and her singing looks so effortless. (An over-trained voice tends to become unhuman, which I never liked.) But
she won’t be that unique if this is all she got. What’s truly inspiring and respectable is her brave twist of her
path in music to follow her own heart and avoid a safe but otherwise mediocre life, her courage to battle with
her cancer, and her noble and philanthropic legacy in the end of her life, donating what her body could offer to
enable other people to see the world again. At this moment of another return-to-zero/origin in both the project
and my life, her example rings particularly deep in my heart. Last but not the least, my respect and consolation
to her parents, who reminded me of a musical family that influenced me forever. The major part of the current
note was typed with the company of her songs.

Notion of Differentiable Maps from Azumaya/Matrix Manifolds I: Smooth Case

0. Introduction and outline
The notion of differentiable maps from an Azumaya/matrix manifold (with a fundamental module) to a real manifold was developed in [L-Y2] (D(11.1)) as a natural mathematical language
to describe D-branes as a dynamical/fundamental object in string theory. (See [Liu] for a review.) Its fermionic/super generalization was given in [L-Y3] (D(11.2)). At the first sight and
in comparison with the setting in [L-Y1] (D(1)), the mathematical setting for D-branes in the
realm of differential geometry look more involved/constrained. The core notion behind is the notion of ‘C k -admissible ring-homomorphisms’ from the C k -function ring of a C k -manifold to the
Azumaya/matrix-function ring of an Azumaya/matrix C k -manifold; ([L-Y2: Definition 5.1.2]
(D(11.1), reviewed in Definition 1.2, Sec. 1 of the current note). The setup of this notion
meant to deal with the technical issue that a noncommutative ring cannot be made a C k -ring
and was guided by the principle that any good notion of a ‘map’ should be accompanied by a
corresponding natural notion of the ‘graph’ of the map.
In this follow-up of [L-Y2] (D(11.1)) and [L-Y3] (D(11.2)), we examine further the notion of
a ‘differentiable map from an Azumaya/matrix manifold to a real manifold’. A conjecture is
made that the notion of differentiable maps from Azumaya/matrix manifolds as defined in [LY2] (D(11.1)) is equivalent to one defined through the contravariant ring-homomorphisms alone.
A proof of this conjecture for the smooth (i.e. C ∞ ) case is given in this note. Thus, at least
in the smooth case, our setting for D-branes in the realm of differential geometry is completely
parallel to that in the realm of algebraic geometry, cf. [L-Y1] (D(1)) and [L-L-S-Y] (D(2)). A
related conjecture on such maps to Rn , as a C k -manifold, and its proof in the C ∞ case is also
given. As a by-product, a conjecture on a division lemma in the finitely differentiable case that
generalizes the division lemma in the smooth case from Malgrange is given in the end, as well
as other comments on the conjectures in the general C k case.
We remark that there are similar conjectures in general and theorems in the smooth case for
the fermionic/super generalization of the notion.

Let

X, Y be C k -manifolds, k ∈ Z≥0 ∪ {∞}, with their C k -function ring denoted C k (X) and
C k (Y ) respectively; (and their structure sheaf OX and OY respectively);

·

E be a complex C k vector bundle on X of rank r;
and C k (End C (E)) be its endomorphism algebra.

Note that if an R-subalgebra S ⊂ C k (End C (E)) admits a C k -ring structure, that structure
is unique up to C k -ring isomorphisms.
Definition 1.1. [weakly C k -admissible ring-homomorphism]. A ring-homomorphism

a C k -ring structure with respect to which ϕ] is a C k -ring-homomorphism.

Clearly, for a correspondence ϕ] : C k (Y ) → C k (End C (E)),
ϕ] is a C k -admissible ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C
=⇒ ϕ] is a weakly C k -admissible ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C
=⇒ ϕ] is a ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C .
And ϕ] in Definition 1.2 is what we employed in [L-Y2] to define the notion of a C k -map
ϕ : (XAz , E) −→ Y ,
following the spirit of Grothendieck’s setting for modern (commutative) Algebraic Geometry. It
resolves the issue that C k (End C (E)), r ≥ 2, can never be made a C k -ring and at the same time
C
makes the notion of the ‘graph’ of ϕ, a OX×Y
-module Ẽϕ , naturally built into the definition of
the differentiable map ϕ.
Conjecture 1.3. [C k -map vs. ring-homomorphism]. Let X and Y be C k -manifolds and E
be a complex C k vector bundle of rank r on X. Given a correspondence
ϕ] : C k (Y ) −→ C k (End C (E)) .
Then, the following three statements are equivalent:
(1) ϕ] is a ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C.
(2) ϕ] is a weakly C k -admissible ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C.
(3) ϕ] is a C k -admissible ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C.
Thus, if justified, any of the ϕ] in Statements (1), (2), or (3) above can be used to define the
notion of a C k -map ϕ : (XAz , E) → Y ; cf. [L-Y2: Sec. 5] (D(11.1)). The resulting notions are
the same/equivalent.
Next, we recall the notion of ‘nilpotency’ in three situations and then bring forth the second
conjecture of the current note.
Definition 1.4. [nilpotency]. We define the notion of nilpotency in three situations.
(1) Let a ∈ R be a nilpotent element of a ring (commutative or not). We say a has nilpotency
≤ l ∈ Z≥1 if al = 0. The minimal such l is called the nilpotency of a.
(2) Let R be a ring. We say that R has nilpotency ≤ l if al = 0 for all nilpotent elements of
R. The minimal such l is called the nilpotency of R.
(3) Let m ∈ Mr×r (C) be an r × r-matrix with entries in C. We say that m has nilpotency ≤ l
if each elementary Jordan block of m

with all entries not on the diagonal nor on the first upper off-diagonal being equal to zero,

Conjecture 1.5. [C k -map to Rn ]. Let X be a C k -manifold and E be a complex C k vector
bundle of rank r on X. Let (y 1 , · · · , y n ) be a global coordinate system on Rn , as a C k -manifold,
and
η : y i 7−→ mi ∈ C k (End C (E)) , i = 1, . . . , n ,
be an assignment such that
(1) mi mj = mj mi , for all i, j ;
(2) for every p ∈ X, the eigenvalues of the restriction mi (p) ∈ End C (E|p ) ' Mr×r (C) are all
real;
(3) for every p ∈ X, the nilpotency of mi (p) ≤ k + 1.
Then, η extends to a unique C k -admissible ring-homomorphism
ϕ]η : C k (Rn ) −→ C k (End C (E))
over R ,→ C and. hence, defines a C k -map ϕη : (XAz , E) → Y .
Note that the set of conditions (1), (2), and (3) are necessary for η to be extendable to a
ring-homomorphism C k (Y ) → C k (End C (E)); cf. [L-Y2: Sec. 3] (D(11.1)). This conjecture rings
with the fact that any C k -map f : Z → Rk from a C k -manifold Z to Rn is specified by the
component maps fi := pri ◦ f : Z → R, where pri : Rn → R is the projection map to the i-th
coordinate of Rn , 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Similarly, there are also the fermionic/super version of these conjectures, which would give,
in particular, equivalent notions of C k -maps from an Azumaya/matrix super C k -manifold to a
C k -manifold or super C k -manifold to that defined in [L-Y3: Sec. 4] (D(11.2)).
The goal of the current note is to prove Conjecture 1.3 and Conjecture 1.5 in the case k = ∞.
Their fermionic/super version hold similarly. Before that, let us take a look at the preliminary
case when X is a point.

2

Preliminaries: When X is a point

For general k ∈ Z≥0 ∪ {∞}, we examine and prove Conjecture 1.3 and Conjecture 1.5 for the
special case that X is a point. For simplicity of notation, some of the explicit expressions in the
discussion are meant for k being finite; for example, Taylor polynomials at a point or infinitesimal
neighborhoods around a point. They can be readily converted to the case k = ∞ (by restricting
the Taylor polynomial to degree r or the nilpotency of the infinitesimal neighborhood to r).
The canonical C k -ring structure on a commutative finite-dimensional R-algebra
Lemma 2.1. [canonical C k -ring structure on finite-dimensional R-algebra]. Let A be
a commutative finite-dimensional R-algebra of nilpotency ≤ l. Then, for all k ≥ l − 1, A admits
a canonical C k -ring structure that is compatible with the underlying ring structure of A.

5

Proof. Since A factorizes into a product
A = A1 × · · · × As
of Weil algebras (i.e. commutative finite-dimensional R-algebra with a unique maximal ideal)
that is unique up to a permutation of the factors and a product of C k -rings admits a canonical
C k -ring structure from the factors, without loss of generality we may assume that A is a Weil
algebra.
In this case, there is a built-in R-algebra quotient
α : A −→ R
whose kernel is the maximal ideal m of A. Together with the built-in inclusion R ,→ A for any
R-algebra, one has a sequence of R-algebra homomorphisms

R

/ A

α

/ R

with the composition the identity homomorphism on R. This gives a canonical splitting
A = R⊕m
as R-vector spaces, with m identical with the nil-ideal of A of nilpotency ≤ l.
Let h ∈ C k (Rn ) for any n ∈ Z≥1 . Then, for any a1 , · · · , an ∈ A, define h(a1 , · · · , an ) by
setting

ai = bi + ci , i = 1, . . . , n, is the decomposition of ai according to A = R ⊕ m;
∂1d1 · · · ∂ndn h is the partial derivative of h with respect to the first variable d1 -times, the
second variable d2 -times, ..., and the n-th variable dn -times.

Notice that (b1 , · · · , bn ) ∈ Rn . Thus, while
∂1d1 · · · ∂ndn h ,

d1 , · · · , dn ∈ Z≥0 , d1 + · · · + dn = s ,

in general lie only in C k−s (Rn ), the evaluation ∂1d1 · · · ∂ndn h(b1 , · · · , bn ) remains well-defined,
as is required for h ∈ C k (Rn ).
This defines the canonical C k -ring structure on A. Clearly, it is compatible with the underlying ring structure of A.

The following two lemmas follow by construction. They are indications that the canonical
C k -ring structure on a finite-dimensional R-algebra, when exists, is functorial/natural.
Lemma 2.2. [R-algebra homomorphism vs. C k -ring homomorphism, I]. Let A and B
be commutative finite-dimensional R-algebras with both of nilpotency ≤ k + 1. Then
Hom R-Algebras (B, A) = Hom C k -Rings (B, A)
with respect to the canonical C k -ring structure on A and B respectively.
6

Lemma 2.3. [R-algebra homomorphism vs. C k -ring homomorphism, II]. Let A be a
commutative finite-dimensional R-algebra of nilpotency ≤ k + 1 and Y be a C k -manifold. Then
Hom R-Algebras (C k (Y ), A) = Hom C k -Rings (C k (Y ), A)
with respect to the canonical C k -ring structure on A.

Validity of Conjecture 1.3 when X is a point
The following lemma follows from [L-Y2: Sec. 3] (D(11.1)):
Lemma 2.4. [ring-homomorphism to matrix algebra]. Given a C k -manifold Y , let
ϕ] : C k (Y ) −→ Mr×r (C)
be a ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C. Then
(1) For all f ∈ C k (Y ), ϕ] (f ) ∈ Mr×r (C) has only real eigenvalues.
(2) ϕ] factors through a finite-Taylor-expansion map at a finite set {q1 , · · · , qs } of Y

of this, both ring-homomorphisms ⊕sj=1 Tqj and ϕ] , regarded now as a ring-morphism to Aϕ ,
are also C k -ring homomorphisms. Thus,
Corollary 2.5. [ϕ] C k -admissible]. As a ring-homomorphism to Aϕ , ϕ] : C k (Y ) → Aϕ is a
C k -ring homomorphism. Thus, as a ring-homomorphism to Mr×r (C), ϕ] : C k (Y ) → Mr×r (C)
is C k -admissible.

of the image scheme Im ϕ in Y is bounded by min{k + 1, r}. In the figure, the
push-forward of the fundamental module in each example is also indicated.

This proves Conjecture 1.3 when X is a point.

Validity of Conjecture 1.5 when X is a point
Given Rn , as a C k -manifold, with coordinate (y 1 · · · , y n ) and an assignment
η : y i 7−→ mi ∈ Mr×r (C) , i = 1, . . . , n ,
that satisfies
(1) mi mj = mj mi , for all i, j ;
(2) the eigenvalues of mi are all real;
(3) the nilpotency of mi ≤ k + 1, for all i.
Then Properties (1) and (2) together imply that the collection {m1 , · · · , mn } of matrices are

Then, after removing repetitive copies and relabelling, the finite set of points q1 , · · · , qs , for
some s ≤ r, in Rn is an invariant of the commuting tuple (m1 , · · · , mn ) of matrices in Mr×r (C).
Furthermore, the fundamental representation C⊕n of Mr×r (C) decomposes into the direct sum
C⊕n = V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vs
of s-many common invariant subspaces of m1 , · · · , mn such that the Jordan form of
mi |Vj : Vj −→ Vj
has diagonal entries all equal to λij . After a change of basis of C⊕n and for simplicity of notation,
we may assume that the decomposition is given by
C⊕n = C⊕r1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ C⊕rs ,
with the j-th summand C⊕rj being associated to (λ1j , · · · , λnj ). In terms of this decomposition,
one can re-express η as an assignment
η : y i 7−→ (mi,1 , , · · · , mi,s ) ∈ Mr1 ×r1 (C) × · · · × Mrs ×rs (C) ⊂ Mr×r (C) .

Proof of Conjectures in the C ∞ case

Conjecture 1.3 and Conjecture 1.5 in the C ∞ case are examined in this section for general X.

Proof of Conjecture 1.3 in the C ∞ case

3.1

We prove in this subsection Conjecture 1.3 in the C ∞ case:
Theorem 3.1.1. [C ∞ -map vs. ring-homomorphism]. Let X and Y be C ∞ -manifolds and
E be a complex C ∞ vector bundle of rank r on X. Given a correspondence
ϕ] : C ∞ (Y ) −→ C ∞ (End C (E)) .
Then, the following three statements are equivalent:
(1) ϕ] is a ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C.
(2) ϕ] is a weakly C ∞ -admissible ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C.
(3) ϕ] is a C ∞ -admissible ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C.
Proof. Since Statement(3) ⇒ Statement (2) ⇒ Statement (1), one only needs to show that
Statement (1) ⇒ Statement (3).
Step (a) : The only natural candidate extension
Let ϕ] : C ∞ (Y ) → C ∞ (End C (E)) be a ring-homomorphism over R ,→ C. Consider the Calgebra C −∞ (End C (E)) of sections of the endomorphism bundle End C (E) → X as a map
between sets. Then ϕ] extends canonically to a ring-homomorphism

Which produces a section of End C (E) → X as a map between sets:

where prX : X × Y → X and prY : X × Y → Y are the projection maps and C ∞ (X) ,→
C ∞ (End C (E)) follows form the inclusion of the center C ∞ (X)C of C ∞ (End C (E)). (Cf. The construction in [L-Y2: Sec. 5.1, theme ‘A generalization to ring-homomorphisms to Azumaya/matrix
algebras’] (D(11.1)).) Notice that ϕ̃] is the only extension of ϕ] to C ∞ (X × Y ) that satisfies the
above commutative diagram and the natural condition that
ϕ̃] |p×Y = ϕ] |p : C ∞ (Y ) −→ End C (E|p ) ,
for all p ∈ X.
Step (b) : From the aspect of germs over X
To understand whether ϕ̃] takes its values in C ∞ (End C (E)), one needs to know how ϕ̃] |p×Y :
C ∞ (Y ) → End C (E|p ) varies as p varies along X. This leads us to studying the germs-over-X
aspect of ϕ̃] , which we now proceed.
Definition 3.1.1.1. [spectral locus/subscheme ϕ] ]. Let Iϕ ⊂ C ∞ (X × Y ) be the ideal of
C ∞ (X × Y ) generated by the set
{ det (f · Id r×r − ϕ] (f )) | f ∈ C ∞ (Y ) }
of elements in C ∞ (X × Y ), where Id r×r is the r × r identity matrix. Iϕ defines a C ∞ -subscheme
Σϕ of X × Y , called interchangeably the spectral locus or the spectral subscheme of ϕ] in X × Y .
Notice that while the local matrix presentation of ϕ] (f ) depends on the local trivialization of E
chosen, the determinant det (f · Id r×r − ϕ] (f )) does not and, hence, is well-defined.
Some properties of Σϕ that follow immediately from the defining ideal Iϕ are listed below:

·

Σϕ is finite over X in the sense that, for all p ∈ X, the preimage pr−1
X (p) of the morphism
prX : Σϕ → X from the restriction of the projection map X ×Y → Y are all 0-dimensional
C ∞ -scheme with the function-ring given by a (commutative) finite-dimensional R-algebra.

·

A comparison with the study of ring-homomorphisms from C ∞ (Rn ) to Mr×r (C) in [L-Y2:
Sec. 3.2] (D(11.1)) implies that
- ϕ̃] (Iϕ ) = 0 .
- for all f ∈ C ∞ (X × Y ), ϕ̃] (f ) ∈ C −∞ (End C (E)) depends only on the restriction of
f on the C ∞ -subscheme Σϕ ⊂ X × Y .

We emphasize that, being a C ∞ -scheme defined by an ideal of C ∞ (X × Y ), the spectral locus
Σϕ of ϕ is more than just a closed subset of X × Y ; cf. Figure 3-1-1-1.
Recall the morphism prX : Σϕ → X. Let p ∈ X. Then since pr−1
X (p) is 0-dimensional, there
exists an open neighborhood U of p such that pr−1
(U
)
is
contained
in an open subset U × V of
X
X × Y , where V is an open subset of Y that is diffeomorphic to Rn with n = dim Y . Under the
diffeomorphism V ' Rn , let (y 1 , · · · , y n ) be coordinates on V and let
(pr−1
X (p))red = {q1 , · · · , qs }
1
n
be the set of closed points in pr−1
X (p) ⊂ Σϕ . (For notation, qj = (p; qj , · · · , qj ) ∈ U × V in the
coordinate system (y 1 , · · · , y n ) on V .) Consider the auxiliary C ∞ -subscheme

Σ(y1 , ··· , yn ) ⊂ U × V
defined by the ideal
I(y1 , ··· , yn ) := (g1 , · · · , gn ) ⊂ C ∞ (U × V ) , where gi := det (y i · Id r×r − ϕ] (y i )) .

Then,
Σϕ ∩ U × V ⊂ Σ(y1 , ··· , yn )
and, again, one has
ϕ̃] (I(y1 , ··· , yn ) ) = 0 .

ϕ̃] (h) = h · Id E for all h ∈ C ∞ (X), where Id E is the identity map on E.

Since smoothness is a local (indeed, infinitely infinitesimal) property, smoothness of ϕ̃] (f ) for
all f ∈ C ∞ (X × Y ) follows. This shows that Im (ϕ̃] ) ⊂ C ∞ (End C (E)).
Step (c) : Conclusion
Let Aϕ := Im (ϕ̃] ), which is identical to the C ∞ (X)-subalgebra C ∞ hIm (ϕ] )i of C ∞ (End C (E))
generated by C ∞ (X) and Im (ϕ] ) in C ∞ (End C (E)). Then, in the C ∞ case, as a consequence
of the Hadamard’s Lemma, the C ∞ -ring structure on C ∞ (X × Y ) always descends, via ϕ̃] , to
a C ∞ -ring structure on Aϕ that is compatible with the underlying ring-structure of Aϕ . In this

Proof of Conjecture 1.5 in the C ∞ case

We prove in this subsection Conjecture 1.5 in the C ∞ case:
Theorem 3.2.1. [C ∞ -map to Rn ]. Let X be a C ∞ -manifold and E be a complex C ∞ vector
bundle of rank r on X. Let (y 1 , · · · , y n ) be a global coordinate system on Rn , as a C ∞ -manifold,
and
η : y i 7−→ mi ∈ C ∞ (End C (E)) , i = 1, . . . , n ,
be an assignment such that
(1) mi mj = mj mi , for all i, j ;
(2) for every p ∈ X, the eigenvalues of the restriction mi (p) ∈ End C (E|p ) ' Mr×r (C) are all
real.
Then, η extends to a unique C ∞ -admissible ring-homomorphism
ϕ]η : C ∞ (Rn ) −→ C ∞ (End C (E))
over R ,→ C and, hence, defines a C ∞ -map ϕη : (XAz , E) → Rn .
Notice that Condition (3): for every p ∈ X, the nilpotency of mi (p) ≤ k + 1 in the statement
of Conjecture 1.5 is automatically satisfied in the C ∞ case.

13

Proof. Given η in the statement of the theorem, it follows from Sec. 2 that for all p ∈ X, the
assignment from restriction
ηp : y i 7−→ mi (p) ∈ End C (E|p ) , i = 1, . . . , n ,
extends uniquely to a ring-homomorphism
ϕ]ηp : C ∞ (Rn ) −→ End C (E|p )
over R ,→ C that is C ∞ -admissible over p. As p varies, η extends uniquely to a ring-homomorphism
ϕ]η : C ∞ (Rn ) −→ C −∞ (End C (E))
over R ,→ C. The same construction as Step (a) in the proof of Theorem 3.1.1 extends ϕ]η
further and uniquely to a ring-homomorphism
ϕ̃]η : C ∞ (X × Rn ) −→ C −∞ (End C (E))
over R ,→ C that fits into the following commutative diagram

The same argument as Step (b) in the proof of Theorem 3.1.1 implies that indeed ϕ̃]η takes
values in C ∞ (End C (E)). Thus, so does ϕ]η . As in Step (c) there, one thus has the following

Remarks on the general C k case

Even if not conceptually, technically the finitely differentiable case seems to be more difficult
than the smooth (i.e. infinitely differentiable) case. Some remarks are collected here as a guide
to verify Conjecture 1.3 and Conjecture 1.5 in full (or to correct them, taking the statements as
the reference starting point and see how things could break).
Reflections on C ∞ - vs. general C k -algebraic geometry, and the proof
(1) From the construction of the canonical C k -ring structure on a commutative finite-dimensional
R-algebra in Sec. 2, one learns that while C ∞ -algebraic geometry is self-contained (in the sense
∞
l
that only elements in ∪∞
C k -algebraic geometry with k finite may not
l=0 C (R ) are involved),
0
k
l
(in the sense that elements in ∪k0 <k ∪∞
l=0 C (R ) that come from partial derivatives of elements
∞
∞
l
in ∪l=0 C (R ) are involved as well when the C k -scheme considered is not reduced).
(2) The proof of Conjecture 1.5 in the smooth case (Theorem 3.2.1) by first constructing
and ϕ̃]η with values in C −∞ (End C (E)) and then proving that they actually take values
in C ∞ (End C (E)) reminds one of wall-crossing phenomena in string theory1 in which some
quantities (e.g. soliton numbers; here, canonical-form-rendering automorphisms/frames) jump
cell by cell in order that a related geometric quantity (e.g. flat sections from solutions to a
differential system; here, endomorphisms of a complex vector bundle) can be kept continuous
(here even differentiable). A simple example serves to illuminate this:

ϕ]η

Example 4.1. [wall-crossing of frames vs. smoothness of endomorphism]. Let XAz
be the Azumaya/matrix smooth line (R1,Az , E), where E is a complex vector bundle of rank 2
on X = R1 with coordinate x, and Y = R1 be the smooth real line with coordinate y. For
convenience, we assume that E is trivialized. Consider the assignment

To extend η to a C ∞ -admissible ring-homomorphism

consider the following chamber structure on X and Jordan-form-of-m-rendering frames (e1 , e2 )

value at 0 equal to f 0 (0). Thus, while the Jordan form Jm of m, Jordan-form-of-m-rendering S,
and, hence, all the factors in the product S f (Jm ) S −1 are discontinuous at x = 0, the product
S f (Jm ) S −1 , which gives f (m), remains continuous, even smooth, over all X.

A conjecture on a division lemma in the finitely differentiable case
In the proof of Theorem 3.1.1 and Theorem 3.2.1, though differentiability of ϕ̃] (f ) or ϕ̃]η (f ) ∈
C −∞ (End C (E)) at a point p ∈ X is an issue that involves only an infinitesimal neighborhood
of p ∈ X, technically it looks very difficult to prove it without employing consequences from the
Malgrange Division Theorem, which is a theorem at the level of germs on a small neighborhood
of p ∈ X. (Cf. Readers may try to prove directly that (f (x) − f (−x))/(2x) for f ∈ C ∞ (R1 )
in Example 4.1 is smooth at x = 0 without employing the Malgrange Division Theorem or
its similar construction or argument.) While such theorem looks more than we need, if it is
indispensable, then one would expect a version of it in the finitely differentiable case would
prove both Conjecture 1.3 and Conjecture 1.5 since all other part of the proof of Theorem 3.1.1
and Theorem 3.2.1 works also for finite k. The following conjecture is guided by the Taylor
expansion of a C k -function in the normal direction to a codimension-1 C k subscheme:
Conjecture 4.2. [generalized division lemma in finitely differentiable case]. Let

0 be the origin of Rm+1 (and same notation also for the origin of Rm , if necessary),

while

∂ys h(0) 6= 0

for some s ≤ k.
Denote by C k (Rm+1 )(0) the germs of C k -functions on Rm+1 at 0; and similarly for C s (Rm )(0) .
Then, for all f ∈ C k (Rm+1 )(0) , there exists g ∈ C k (Rm+1 )(0) (or some sensible subset of
