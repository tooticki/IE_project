BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS
ONDŘEJ F.K. KALENDA AND JIŘÍ SPURNÝ
Abstract. We investigate Baire classes of strongly affine mappings with values in Fréchet spaces. We show, in particular, that the validity of the vectorvalued Mokobodzki’s result on affine functions of the first Baire class is related
to the approximation property of the range space. We further extend several
results known for scalar functions on Choquet simplices or on dual balls of L1 preduals to the vector-valued case. This concerns, in particular, affine classes
of strongly affine Baire mappings, the abstract Dirichlet problem and the weak
Dirichlet problem for Baire mappings. Some of these results have weaker conclusions than their scalar versions. We also establish an affine version of the
Jayne-Rogers selection theorem.

1. Introduction
Investigation of Baire hierarchy of affine functions on compact convex set forms
an important part of the Choquet theory. The abstract Dirichlet problem for Baire
functions on Choquet simplices was studied for example in [25, 60, 61, 66, 63],
descriptive properties of affine functions for example in [40, 39, 38, 67]. Large
number of results valid for simplices were proved in a more general framework of L1 preduals. Recall that a Banach space X is called an L1 -predual (or a Lindenstrauss
space) if its dual X ∗ is isometric to a space L1 (X, S, µ) for a measure space (X, S, µ).
There are two types of L1 -preduals – the real and complex ones. Unlike in most
areas, there is a difference between the real and complex theories. More precisely,
there are some results known in the real case and unknown in the complex case
and, moreover, proofs in the complex setting are often more involved. However,
our results hold in both cases in the same form.
Real L1 -preduals were in depth investigated in papers [11, 15, 16, 2, 33, 44, 17,
45, 9, 21, 6, 40]. Complex L1 -preduals were studied for example in [74, 48, 75, 57,
53, 37, 54, 7, 72, 46, 10]. It has turned out that both real and complex L1 -preduals
can be characterized by a “simplex-like” property of the dual unit ball BX ∗ (see
[34, 12]). This result was used to investigate variants of the abstract Dirichlet
problem for L1 -preduals in [41, 39, 38].
In the present paper we study vector-valued affine functions, more precisely
mappings with values in a Fréchet space. We show that some results remain valid
in the same form, some results are true in a weaker form and some results cannot
be transferred at all. Main results are contained in Section 2. In the rest of the
introductory section we collect some definitions and basic facts on compact convex

sets, Baire mappings and vector integration needed in the sequel. In Section 3 we
give auxiliary results needed to prove the main theorems. Some of them are known
and we just collect them, some of them are up to our knowledge new and may be
of an independent interest. Several following sections are devoted to proofs of the
main results. In the last section we discuss sharpness of our results and formulate
related open problems.
1.1. Compact convex sets, simplices and L1 -preduals. We will deal both
with real and complex spaces. To shorten the notation we will use the symbol F to
denote the respective field R or C.
If X is a compact Hausdorff space, we denote by C(X, F) the Banach space of
all F-valued continuous functions on X equipped with the sup-norm. The dual of
C(X, F) will be identified (by the Riesz representation theorem) with M(X, F), the
space of F-valued Radon measures on X equipped with the total variation norm
and the respective weak∗ topology.
Let X be a convex subset of a (real or complex) vector space E and F be another
(real or complex) vector space. Recall that a mapping f : X → F is said to be affine
if f (tx + (1 − t)y) = tf (x) + (1 − t)f (y) whenever x, y ∈ X and t ∈ [0, 1]. We stress
that the notion of an affine function uses only the underlying structure of real vector
spaces.
Let X be a compact convex set in a Hausdorff locally convex topological vector
space. We write A(X, F) for the space of all F-valued continuous affine functions on
X. This space is a closed subspace of C(X, F) and is equipped with the inherited
sup-norm. Given a Radon probability measure µ on X, we write
R r(µ) for the
barycenter of µ, i.e., the unique point x ∈ X satisfying a(x) = X a dµ for each
affine continuous function on X (see [1, Proposition I.2.1] or [32, Chapter 7, § 20];
note that it does not matter whether we consider real or complex affine functions).
Conversely, for a point x ∈ X, we denote by Mx (X) the set of all Radon probability
measures on X with barycenter x (i.e., of probabilities representing x).
The usual dilation order ≺ on the set M1 (X) of Radon probability measures
on X is defined as µ ≺ ν if and only if µ(f ) ≤ ν(f ) for any Rreal-valued convex
continuous function f on X. (Recall that µ(f ) is a shortcut for f dµ.) A measure
µ ∈ M1 (X) is said to be maximal if it is maximal with respect to the dilation
order. In case X is metrizable, maximal measures are exactly the probabilities
carried by the Gδ set ext X of extreme points of X (see, e.g., [1, p. 35] or [43,
Corollary 3.62]). By the Choquet representation theorem, for any x ∈ X there
exists a maximal representing measure (see [32, p. 192, Corollary] or [1, Theorem
I.4.8]). The set X is termed simplex if this measure is uniquely determined for
each x ∈ X (see [32, §20, Theorem 3]). We write δx for this uniquely determined
measure.
A measure µ ∈ M(X, F) is called boundary if either µ = 0 or the probability
|µ|
is maximal. If X is metrizable, boundary measures are exactly the
measure kµk
measures carried by ext X.
If X is a simplex, the space A(X, F) is an example of an L1 -predual (see [18,
Proposition 3.23] for the real case; the complex case follows from the real one and
[32, §23, Theorem 6]). Moreover, L1 -preduals can be characterized using a simplexlike property of the dual unit ball:

Fact 1.1. Let E be a Banach space over F and X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ). Then E is an
L1 -predual if and only if for each x∗ ∈ X there is a unique F-valued Radon measure
µ on X with the properties:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

kµk ≤ 1,
µ(αA) = αµ(A) for any Borel set A ⊂ X and any α ∈ F with |α| = 1,
µ is a boundary
measure,
R
x∗ (x) = X y ∗ (x) dµ(y ∗ ) for any x ∈ E.

This fact is proved below at the end of Section 3.4. It is a variant of the characterizations given in [34] for the real case and in [12] for the complex case. The
unique measure µ provided by the previous fact will be denoted by T (x∗ ).
The measures satisfying the condition (b) are called odd in the real case and
anti-homogeneous in the complex case (we will sometimes use the unified term Fanti-homogeneous). The condition (d) means that µ represents x∗ in a way. Notice
that for a function f : X → F the following assertions are equivalent:
(i) There is x ∈ E with f (y ∗ ) = y ∗ (x) for y ∗ ∈ X.
(ii) The function f is affine, continuous and satisfies f (αy ∗ ) = αf (y ∗ ) for each
y ∗ ∈ X and any α ∈ F with |α| = 1.
Functions with the third property from the assertion (ii) are called odd in the real
case and homogeneous in the complex case (or F-homogeneous in both cases).
1.2. Baire hierarchies of mappings. Given a set K, a topological space L and
a family of mappings F from K to L, we define the Baire classes of mappings as
follows. Let (F )0 = F . Assuming that α ∈ [1, ω1 ) is given and that (F )β have been
already defined for each β < α, we set
[
(F )α = {f : K → L; there exists a sequence (fn ) in
(F )β
β<α

such that fn → f pointwise}.

We will use several hierarchies matching this pattern:
• If K and L are topological spaces, by Cα (K, L) we denote the set (C(K, L))α ,
where C(K, L) is the set of all continuous functions from K to L.
• If K is a compact convex set and L is a convex subset of a locally convex
space, by Aα (K, L) we denote (A(K, L))α , where A(K, L) is the set of all
affine continuous functions defined on K with values in L.
• If K = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a real Banach space and L is a convex
symmetric subset of a locally convex space, by Aodd,α (K, L) we denote
(Aodd (K, L))α , where Aodd (K, L) is the set of all odd affine continuous
functions defined on K with values in L.
• If K = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a complex Banach space and L is an absolutely convex subset of a complex locally convex space, by Ahom,α (K, L)
we denote (Ahom (K, L))α , where Ahom (K, L) is the set of all homogeneous
affine continuous functions defined on K with values in L.
1.3. Vector integration and strongly affine mappings. We will investigate
vector-valued strongly affine mappings. To be able to do that we need some vector
integral. We will use the Pettis approach. Our vector-valued mappings will mostly
have values in Fréchet spaces, but sometimes in general Hausdorff locally convex

4

spaces. Since we will deal only with Hausdorff spaces, by a space we mean always
a Hausdorff space. Let us continue with the definitions.
Let µ be an F-valued σ-additive measure defined on an abstract measurable
space (X, A) (i.e., X is a set and A is a σ-algebra of subsets of X) and F a locally
convex space over F. (To avoid confusion we stress that we will consider only finite
measures.) A mapping f : X → F is said to be µ-measurable if f −1 (U ) is µmeasurable for any U ⊂ F open. The map f is called weakly µ-measurable if τ ◦ f
is µ-measurable for each τ ∈ F ∗ .
A mapping f : X → F is said to be µ-integrable over a µ-measurable set A ⊂ X
if
• τ ◦ f ∈ L1 (|µ|) for each τ ∈ F ∗ ,
• for each B ⊂ A µ-measurable there exists an element xB ∈ F such that
Z
τ ◦ f dµ, τ ∈ F ∗ .
τ (xB ) =
B
R
It is clear that the element xB is uniquely determined, we denote it as B f dµ. If
µ is clearly determined, we say only that f is integrable.
Any µ-integrable mapping is necessarily weakly µ-measurable but not necessarily
µ-measurable (cf. the discussion after Question 10.4 below).
If X is a compact convex set, a mapping f : X →R F is called strongly affine if,
for any measure µ ∈ M1 (X), f is µ-integrable and X f dµ = f (r(µ)). Note that
this is a strengthening of the notion of an affine mapping. Indeed, f is affine if and
only if the formula holds for any finitely supported probability µ.
The notion of a strongly affine mapping is also a straightforward generalization of
the scalar case and, in fact, the following easy observation shows a close connection
with the scalar case.
Fact 1.2. Let X be a compact convex set and F a locally convex space. A mapping
f : X → F is strongly affine if and only if τ ◦ f is strongly affine for each τ ∈ F ∗ .
Proof. The ‘only if’ part follows immediately from definitions. Let us show the ‘if’
part. Suppose that τ ◦ f is strongly affine for each τ ∈ F ∗ . Given any µ ∈ M1 (X),
A ⊂ X µ-measurable and τ ∈ F ∗ , we have

Hence f is µ-integrable and X f dµ = f (r(µ)).
2. Main results

In this section we collect our main results. We start by results on affine Baireone maps on general compact convex sets. It turns out that the situation is quite
different from the scalar case. We continue by several positive result which are
generalizations of theorems known in the scalar case. Sometimes we are able to
generalize only weaker variants of those results. These theorems are formulated
and proved in three versions – for simplices, for dual balls of real L1 -preduals and
for dual balls of complex L1 -preduals.
Let us start by considering affine Baire-one mappings. If X is a compact convex
set and f : X → F is an affine function on X which is of the first Baire class (i.e., f ∈
C1 (X, F)), it is strongly affine by a result of Choquet (see, e.g., [1, Theorem I.2.6],

BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

[52, Section 14], [59] or [43, Corollary 4.22]) and, moreover, f ∈ A1 (X, F) by a
result of Mokobodzki (see, e.g., [55, Théorème 80] or [43, Theorem 4.24]).
If F = R, X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ) for a real Banach space E and f is moreover odd, then
f ∈ Aodd,1 (X, R). This follows easily from the general case since an affine function
on X is odd if and only if it vanishes at the origin. If F = C, X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ) for a
complex Banach space E and f is moreover homogeneous, then f ∈ Ahom,1 (X, C).
This is a bit more difficult, it follows from Lemma 3.14(c) below.
The situation for vector-valued functions is different. Firstly, the following analogue of the Choquet result follows immediately from Fact 1.2.
Theorem 2.1. Let X be a compact convex set, F a locally convex space and f :
X → F be an affine mapping which is of the first Baire class. Then f is strongly
affine.
The vector version of the Mokobodzki theorem is not valid in general but it is
valid under additional assumptions on the range space. This is illustrated by the
following two results.
Theorem 2.2. Let X be a compact convex set and E be a Banach space with
the bounded approximation property. Then any affine f ∈ C1 (X, E) belongs to
A1 (X, E). If, moreover, f (X) ⊂ BE and E has the λ-bounded approximation
property for some λ ≥ 1, then f ∈ A1 (X, λBE ).
Example 2.3. Let E be a separable reflexive Banach space which fails the compact
approximation property. Let X = (BE , w) and letSf : X → E be the identity
embedding. Then f is affine, f ∈ C1 (X, E) and f ∈
/ α<ω1 Aα (X, E).

This example is a strengthening of [47, Example 2.22]. A Banach space satisfying
the assumptions exists due to [5, Proposition 2.12]. Theorem 2.2 is a generalization
and strengthening of [47, Theorem 2.12]. We point out that the proof of the quoted
theorem contains a gap. We provide a correct proof of a stronger version of the
result. The two preceding results are proved in Section 4 below, where also the
definitions of approximation properties are recalled and the gap in the proof in [47]
is commented.
For affine functions of higher Baire classes the situation is different even in the
scalar case. Firstly, an affine function of the second Baire class need not be strongly
affine even if X is simplex (the example is due to Choquet, see, e.g., [1, Example I.2.10], [52, Section 14] or [43, Proposition 2.63]). Further, by [70] there is a
compact convex set X and a strongly
affine function f : X → R of the second Baire
S
class which does not belong to α<ω1 Aα (X, R). Nonetheless, some positive results
hold for strongly affine functions on simplices and on dual balls of L1 -preduals.
We begin by the following theorem on the quality of the dilation mapping in the
three cases. Let us explain the notation used in the theorem. By Modd (X, R) we
denote the space of odd real-valued Radon measures on X, by Mahom (X, C) the
space of all anti-homogeneous complex Radon measures on X (see Section 1.1 for
definitions). All the range spaces in the theorem are considered with the weak∗
topology. The operator T in cases (R) and (C) was defined in Section 1.1 using
Fact 1.1.
Theorem 2.4.
(S) Let X be a metrizable simplex. Then the map T : x 7→ δx belongs to
A1 (X, M1 (X)).

6

(R) Let E be a real separable L1 -predual and X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ). Then the map T
belongs to Aodd,1 (X, BModd (X,R) ).
(C) Let E be a complex separable L1 -predual and X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ). Then the
map T belongs to Ahom,1 (X, BMahom (X,C) ).
The above theorem is proved in Section 5. The case (S) is essentially known,
see [42, Theorem 6.6]. The formulation of the quoted result is weaker, but the
construction in fact gives the case (S). Let us point out that this result is formulated
and proved only for metrizable X. However, in some special cases metrizability is
not necessary as formulated in the following remark which will be discussed also in
Section 5.
Remark 2.5. The following assertions hold even without the metrizability (separability) assumption:
• T is strongly affine.
• If ext X is closed, the mapping T is continuous.
We include also Example 5.4 showing that T need not be a Baire mapping even
if ext X is Lindelöf.
We continue by a result on affine Baire classes of strongly affine Baire mappings.
The scalar version of the assertion (S) is proved in [4, Theorem 2], the scalar version
of the assertion (R) follows easily from [40, Theorem 1.4]. The scalar version of the
assertion (C) is claimed to be unknown in [40]. The theorem is proved in Section 6.
Theorem 2.6. Let X be a compact convex set, F be a Fréchet space, 1 ≤ α < ω1
and f ∈ Cα (X, F ) be strongly affine.
(S) If X is a simplex, then f ∈ A1+α (X, F ).
(R) If X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a real L1 -predual, then f ∈ A1+α (X, F ). If
f is moreover odd, then f ∈ Aodd,1+α (X, F ).
(C) If X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a complex L1 -predual, then f ∈ A1+α (X, F ).
If F is moreover complex and f is homogeneous, then f ∈ Ahom,1+α (X, F ).
If, moreover, α = 1, then 1 + α can be replaced by α. I.e., if f belongs to the
class C1 , it belongs to the class A1 .
In case ext X is an Fσ -set, 1 + α can be replaced by α for each α.
The next theorem is devoted to the abstract Dirichlet problem for vector-valued
Baire mappings. The scalar version of the case (S) follows from [25], the scalar
version of the case (R) follows from [41, Theorem 2.14], the scalar version of the
case (C) follows from [38, Theorem 2.22]. The scalar versions of all the three cases
hold also for α = 0, our proof of the vector version requires α ≥ 1. The Lindelöf
property is quite natural assumption. It surely cannot be dropped as witnessed,
for example, by the simplex from [1, Proposition I.4.15] (or [43, Example 3.82]).
However, it is still an open problem whether the Lindelöf property is a necessary
condition for the validity of the scalar case for α = 0 (i.e., for continuous functions,
see Question 10.9 below).
Theorem 2.7. Let X be a compact convex set with ext X being Lindelöf, α ≥ 1,
F a Fréchet space and f : ext X → F a bounded mapping from Cα (ext X, F ).
(S) If X is a simplex, then f can be extended to a mapping from A1+α (X, F ).
(R) If X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a real L1 -predual and f is odd, then f can
be extended to a mapping from Aodd,1+α (X, F ).

(C) If X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a complex L1 -predual, F is complex and f is
homogeneous, then f can be extended to a mapping from Ahom,1+α (X, F ).
If ext X is moreover Fσ , then 1 + α can be replaced by α in all the cases.
If ext X is even closed and f is continuous, we can find a continuous affine
extension.
The next theorem is devoted to the so-called ‘weak Dirichlet problem’. The
scalar version of the case (S) is known – for continuous functions it is proved in [1,
Theorem II.3.12], for Baire functions it is due to [62]. The cases (R) and (C) are
up to our knowledge new even in the scalar case. The result is proved in Section 8
using a simplified and generalized variant of the method of [62].
Theorem 2.8. Let X be a compact convex set, K ⊂ ext X a compact subset, F a
Fréchet space and f a bounded mapping in Cα (K, F ).
(S) If X is a simplex, f can be extended to a mapping from Aα (X, cof (K)).
(R) If X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a real L1 -predual, K is symmetric and f is
odd, then f can be extended to a mapping from Aodd,α (X, acof (K)).
(C) If X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a complex L1 -predual, F is complex, K is
homogeneous and f is homogeneous, then f can be extended to a mapping
from Ahom,α (X, acof (K)).
As a consequence of this theorem we get a result on extending Baire mappings
from compact subsets of completely regular spaces, see Theorem 8.1.
Finally, the following result can be viewed as an affine version of the JayneRogers selection theorem. Let us recall that a set-valued mapping Φ is said to be
upper semicontinuous if {x ∈ X; Φ(x) ⊂ U } is open in X for any open set U ⊂ F
(or, equivalently {x ∈ X; Φ(x) ∩ H 6= ∅} is closed in X for any closed set H ⊂ F ).
Theorem 2.9. Let X be a compact convex set, F a Fréchet space and Φ : X → F an
upper semicontinuous set-valued mapping with nonempty closed values and bounded
range.
(S) If X is a metrizable simplex and the graph of Φ is convex, Φ admits a
selection in A2 (X, F ).
(R) If X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a separable real L1 -predual and the graph of
Φ is convex and symmetric, Φ admits a selection in Aodd,2 (X, F ).
(C) If X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a separable complex L1 -predual, F is complex
and the graph of Φ is absolutely convex, Φ admits a selection in Ahom,2 (X, F ).
We point out that the Jayne-Rogers selection theorem provides a selection of the
first class, while we obtain a selection of the second class. This is the best we can
achieve, due to Example 9.2. In the same example we show that the metrizability
assumption is essential.
3. Some auxiliary results
Below we collect auxiliary results which we will need to prove the main results.
These results are divided into four sections. First we need the relationship between
Baire hierarchy of mappings and Baire measurability. These results are known
but it was necessary to collect them from the literature. The only exception is
Lemma 3.4 which is a generalization of a result of [47]. Further we establish some
results on Pettis integration, especially a dominated convergence theorem. In the

8

next section we collect properties of odd and homogeneous mappings and of the
associated operators odd and hom. The respective results are either easy or vectorvalued variants of the results from [38]. Finally, we investigate adjoint operators
to odd and hom and odd and antihomogeneous measures. We think that some of
these results are new and of an independent interest. In particular, we prove there
Fact 1.1 which is a simplex-like characterization of L1 -preduals.
3.1. Baire hierarchy of sets and Baire mappings. In this section we formulate the exact relationship between Baire mappings and mappings measurable with
respect to the Baire σ-algebra.
If X is a topological space, a zero set in X is the inverse image of a closed set
in R under a continuous function f : X → R. The complement of a zero set is a
cozero set. If X is normal, it follows from Tietze’s theorem that a closed set is a
zero set if and only if it is also a Gδ set. We recall that Baire sets are members of
the σ-algebra generated by the family of all cozero sets in X.
We will need a precise hierarchy of Baire sets. We define additive and multiplicative Baire classes of sets as follows: Let Σb1 (X) be the family of all cozero sets
and Πb1 (X) the family of all zero sets. For α ∈ (1, ω1 ), let
S
• Σbα (X) be the family of countable unions of sets from β<α Πbβ (X), and
S
• Πbα (X) be the family of countable intersections of sets from β<α Σbβ (X).

The family Σbα (X) is termed the sets of Baire additive class α, the family Πbα (X)
is called the sets of Baire multiplicative class α.
The following two lemmata collect some properties of Baire measurable mappings
useful for our investigation.
Lemma 3.1. Let X be a topological space and F be a metrizable separable space.
Let f : X → F be a Baire measurable mapping. Then the following assertions hold.
S
S
(a) The σ-algebra of Baire subsets of X equals α<ω1 Σbα (X) = α<ω1 Πbα (X).
(b) There exists α < ω1 such that f is Σbα (X)-measurable.
(c) If X is normal, F is a convex subset of a Fréchet space and α ∈ [0, ω1 ),
then f ∈ Cα (X, F ) if and only if f is Σbα+1 (X)-measurable.
Proof. The assertion (a) is obvious.
(b) Since separable metric spaces have countable basis, the assertion easily follows.
(c) For α = 0 the assertion is trivial. For α = 1 it follows from [73, Theorem
3.7(i)].
The assertion for α > 1 follows from [65, Theorem 2.7]. Indeed, if F denotes the
algebra generated by zero sets, then the families Σα (F ) and Πα (F ) from the quoted
paper are exactly Σbα (X) and Πbα (X) for α ≥ 2. Further, the family denoted by Φα
in the quoted paper is exactly Cα (X, F ) for α ≥ 1. For α = 1 it follows from the
previous paragraph, the validity for larger ordinals follows from the definitions. 
An immediate consequence of the assertion (c) of the previous lemma is the
following statement.
Corollary 3.2. Let X be a normal space, F a separable Fréchet space, α < ω1 and
f ∈ Cα (X, F ). Then f ∈ Cα (X, co f (X)).

Lemma 3.3. Let X be a Baire subset of a compact space and F be a metrizable
space. Let f : X → F be a Baire measurable mapping. Then the following assertions
hold.
(a) The image f (X) is separable.
(b) There exists α < ω1 such that f is Σbα (X)-measurable.
(c) If F is a convex subset of a Fréchet space and α ∈ [0, ω1 ), then f ∈ Cα (X, F )
if and only if f is Σbα+1 (X)-measurable.
Proof. The assertion (a) follows from [19, Theorem 1]. Indeed, the space X, being
a Baire subset of a compact space, is K-analytic by [19, Proposition β on p.1113]
(spaces which are now called K-analytic are called analytic in the quoted paper).
Thus X satisfies the assumption on the domain space in [19, Theorem 1]. Further,
f is Baire measurable. It should be noted, that in [19] this notion has a different
meaning – it means that the preimage of any Baire set is a Baire set. Since F is
assumed to be metrizable, this notion coincides with our notion of Baire measurability. The conclusion is that f (X) is K-analytic, hence Lindelöf (by [19, Proposition
α on p.1113]) and therefore separable (by metrizability).
(b) By (a) we can suppose without loss of generality that F is separable. Hence
the assertion follows from Lemma 3.1(b).
(c) By (a) we can suppose without loss of generality that F is separable. Since X
is normal (being regular and Lindelöf), the assertion follows from Lemma 3.1(c). 
Let us point out that the assertion (a) of the previous lemma is not valid in
general. It is valid (by the same proof) under a weaker assumption that X is
K-analytic (but we do not need it), but it fails if X is, say, a general separable
metric space. An example under Martin’s axiom and negation of the continuum
hypothesis is described in [29, Example 2.4(3)].
We continue by the following technical lemma which is a variant of [47, Proposition 2.8]. In the quoted paper the authors deal with mappings with values in a
Banach space. Our proof essentially follows the proof in [47] with necessary modifications due to the assumption that F is a Fréchet space, not necessarily a Banach
space.
Lemma 3.4. Let X be a compact space, F a Fréchet space over F, fn,m , fn , f
(m, n ∈ N) be mappings defined on X with values in F satisfying the following
conditions:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

fn,m is continuous on X for each n, m ∈ N;
m
fn,m (x) −→ fn (x) weakly in F for each n ∈ N and each x ∈ X;
n
fn (x) −→ f (x) weakly in F for each x ∈ X;
the family of functions (fn,m ) is uniformly bounded;
f ∈ C1 (X, F ).

Then there is a sequence (gk ) of convex combinations of functions fn,m , n, m ∈ N,
such that gk (x) → f (x) in F for each x ∈ X.
Proof. Fix a closed absolutely convex bounded set L ⊂ F containing the ranges
of all the functions fn,m , n, m ∈ N. Since closed convex sets are weakly closed, it
contains also ranges of fn , n ∈ N, and that of f . Hence by Corollary 3.2 we have
f ∈ C1 (X, L) (note that L can be chosen to be separable). Fix a sequence (hk ) in
C(X, L) pointwise converging to f .

Since F is a Fréchet space, its topology is generated by a sequence of seminorms
(pk ). Without loss of generality we can suppose that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ . . . . For each k ∈ N
denote by Kk the polar of the set {y ∈ F ; pk (y) < 1}. By the Alaoglu theorem Kk
is weak∗ compact.
Given any function u : X → F denote by u
b the scalar function on X × F ∗ defined
by
u
b(x, x∗ ) = x∗ (u(x)),
(x, x∗ ) ∈ X × F ∗ .

It is easy to observe that

• If u is continuous, then u
b is continuous on X × Kk for each k ∈ N. (Kk is
equipped with the weak∗ topology.)
Indeed, the first assertion is obvious. Let us show the second one. Suppose u is
continuous and k ∈ N. Fix any (x, x∗ ) ∈ X × Kk and ε > 0. For (y, y ∗ ) ∈ X × Kk
we have
|b
u(y, y ∗ ) − u
b(x, x∗ )| = |y ∗ (u(y)) − x∗ (u(x))|

Moreover, fn → f and fd

is uniformly bounded in C(X × Kk , F), it converges weakly to zero in C(X × Kk , F).
By the Mazur theorem there is vk ∈ co{ukn − hn ; n ≥ k} such that kvbk |X×Kk k < k1 .
The function vk can be expressed as vk = gk − wk , where gk ∈ co{fn,m ; n, m ∈ N}
and wk ∈ co{hn ; n ≥ k}.
We claim that gn (x) → f (x) for each x ∈ X. So, fix x ∈ X and k ∈ N. We

An immediate consequence of the previous lemma is the following statement.
Corollary 3.5. Let X be a compact convex space and F be a bounded convex subset
of a Fréchet space. If f ∈ C1 (X, F ) and f ∈ A2 (X, F ), then f ∈ A1 (X, F ).

3.2. Integrable vector-valued functions. We collect several results on vector
integration needed in the sequel. We start by two lemmata on the relationship
between measurability and weak measurability.
Lemma 3.6. Let F be a separable metrizable locally convex space. Then each open
subset of F is Fσ in the weak topology.
Proof. Let U be an open subset of F . For each x ∈ U there is a convex open
neighborhood Vx of zero such that x+Vx ⊂ U . Since F is metrizable and separable,
there is a countable set C ⊂ U such that x + Vx , x ∈ C, cover U . Then U =
S
x∈C x+Vx . Since closed convex sets are weakly closed, the proof is completed. 
Lemma 3.7. Let µ be an F-valued measure defined on a measurable space (X, A)
and F be a separable metrizable locally convex space. Then any weakly µ-measurable
function f : X → F is µ-measurable.

Proof. Suppose that f is weakly measurable, i.e., τ ◦ f is µ-measurable for any
τ ∈ F ∗ . It follows that f −1 (U ) is µ-measurable for any set U from the canonical
basis of the weak topology on F . Since F is separable and metrizable, the weak
topology is hereditarily Lindelöf, thus f −1 (U ) is µ-measurable for any weakly open
set U . By Lemma 3.6 we conclude that f −1 (U ) is µ-measurable for any set U open
in the original topology of F . This completes the proof.

Lemma 3.8. Let µ be an F-valued measure defined on a measurable space (X, A)
and F be a Fréchet space over F. Suppose that f : X → F is a bounded weakly
µ-measurable mapping with (essentially) separable range. Then the following assertions hold.
(a) The mapping f is µ-integrable.
(b) If µ is moreover a probability and L ⊂ F is a closed convex set such that
f (X) ⊂ L, then µ(f ) ∈ L.
(c) If kµk ≤ 1 and L ⊂ F is a closed absolutely convex set such that f (X) ⊂ L,
then µ(f ) ∈ L.
(d) If Rρ is any
seminorm on F , then ρ ◦ f is µ-integrable and
 continuous
R
ρ X f dµ ≤ X ρ ◦ f d |µ|.

Proof. We can without loss of generality suppose that F is separable.
The assertion (a) for nonnegative measures then follows immediately from [71,
Corollary 3.1]. The general case is an easy consequence.
(b) Assuming µ(f ) ∈
/ L, we can by the Hahn-Banach separation argument find
an element τ ∈ F ∗ and c ∈ R such that Re τ (µ(f )) > c > sup{Re τ (l); l ∈ L}.
Then

Hence the assertion follows.

To show (d), let ρ be any continuous seminorm on F . Since f is µ-measurable
by Lemma 3.7, it is clear that ρ ◦ f is µ-measurable and bounded, hence it is
µ-integrable. Set V = {x ∈ F ; ρ(x) ≤ 1} and let
V 0 = {τ ∈ F ∗ ; |τ (x)| ≤ 1 for x ∈ V }
denote the absolute polar of V . Then the Bipolar Theorem implies that

An important class of integrable functions are Baire measurable functions.
Lemma 3.9. Let X be a compact space, µ an F-valued Radon measure on X and
f : X → F be a bounded Baire measurable mapping from X to a Fréchet space F
over F. Then the mapping f is µ-integrable.
Proof. By Lemma 3.3(a) the image f (X) is separable. Hence the conclusion follows
from Lemma 3.8(a).

We will use also the following version of the Dominated Convergence Theorem.
Theorem 3.10 (Dominated Convergence Theorem). Let µ be an F-valued measure defined on a measurable space (X, A) and F be a Fréchet space over F. Let
fn , f : X → F be mappings such that
• fn are weakly µ-measurable and have separable
S∞ range,
• the sequence {fn } is bounded in F (i.e., n=1 fn (X) is bounded in F ),
• fn (x) → f (x) in F for x ∈ X.
Then f is bounded
Moreover, all the involved functions are
R
R and µ-measurable.
µ-integrable and X fn dµ → X f dµ in F .

Proof. Set L = {fn (x); n ∈ N, x ∈ X}. Then L is a separable closed bounded set
and clearly f (X) ⊂ L. Thus f is bounded and has separable range. Moreover,
it is weakly µ-measurable as measurability is preserved by pointwise limits of sequences. By Lemma 3.7, all the involved mappings are even µ-measurable. Their
µ-integrability now follows from Lemma 3.8(a). It remains to prove the convergence
of integrals.
To do that, let ρ be any continuous seminorm on F . By Lemma 3.8(c) we get

Since ρ is an arbitrary continuous seminorm, the convergence of the integrals follows.

3.3. Odd and homogeneous mappings. Let E be a vector space over F. A
set A ⊂ E is called F-homogeneous if αx ∈ A whenever x ∈ A and α ∈ F satisfies |α| = 1. R-homogeneous sets are called symmetric, C-homogeneous sets just
homogeneous.
If A ⊂ E is F-homogeneous, F is another vector space over F, then a mapping
f : A → F is called F-homogeneous if f (αx) = αf (x) whenever x ∈ A and α ∈ F
satisfies |α| = 1. R-homogeneous maps are called odd, C-homogeneous maps just
homogeneous.
The following lemma shows that there is a close connection between F-homogeneous affine maps and linear operators.
Lemma 3.11. Let E be a Banach space over F and let f : BE → F be an Fhomogeneous affine mapping from BE to a vector space F over F. Then there
exists a unique linear operator L : E → F extending f .
Proof. We define the required extension L : E → F by the formula
(
x
), kxk > 1,
kxk f ( kxk
Lx =
f (x),
kxk ≤ 1.
Then L is a well defined linear extension of f which is obviously unique.



We are now going to describe a procedure of “homogenization” of functions.
This procedure is easier in the real case.
Let E, F be real vector spaces and B ⊂ E a symmetric set. For any function
f : B → F we define a function odd f by the formula
1
(odd f )(x) = (f (x) − f (−x)), x ∈ B.
2
It is clear that odd f is an odd function and that f is odd if and only if f = odd f .
The complex procedure is a bit more involved. Again, we suppose that E and
F are complex vector spaces, B ⊂ E is a homogeneous set and f : B → F is a
mapping. We would like to define a function hom f by the formula
Z 2π
1
(hom f )(x) =
e−it f (eit x) dt, x ∈ B.
2π 0
The difference from the real case is that a vector integral is involved in the formula
and it need not have a sense. Therefore we restrict the assumptions – we will assume
that F is locally convex space and that the respective integral is well defined (in the
Pettis sense defined in Section 1.3) for each x ∈ B. These assumptions are satisfied,
in particular, if E is a locally convex space, F is a Fréchet space and f is a bounded
Borel function. Indeed, then for each x ∈ B the mapping t 7→ e−it f (eit x) is a
bounded Borel mapping from [0, 2π] to F . Since for compact metric spaces Baire
and Borel σ-algebras coincide, we can conclude by Lemma 3.9. It is clear that
hom f is homogeneous whenever it has a sense.
The following lemma sums up basic properties of the operator odd.
Lemma 3.12. Let E, F be real locally convex spaces and A ⊂ E, B ⊂ F be
symmetric sets.
(a) The function odd f is continuous for each f : A → F continuous.

(b) If f ∈ Cα (A, B) for some α < ω1 , then odd f ∈ Codd,α (A, B) where
Codd,α (A, B) = (Codd (A, B))α and Codd (A, B) is the space of all odd continuous mappings of A into B.
(c) If A and B are moreover convex and f ∈ Aα (A, B) for some α < ω1 , then
odd f ∈ Aodd,α (A, B).
(d) If A and B are moreover convex, then each odd function from Aα (A, B)
belongs to Aodd,α (A, B).
Proof. The assertion (a) is obvious. The assertion (b) follows from (a) by transfinite
induction. The assertion (c) is obvious for α = 0, the general case follows by
transfinite induction. Finally, (d) is an immediate consequence of (c).

We continue by basic properties of the operator hom. The scalar version is
proved in [38, Lemma 2.2].
Lemma 3.13. Let E be a complex locally convex space, F a complex Fréchet space,
A ⊂ E a homogeneous set and B ⊂ F a closed absolutely convex bounded set. Then
the following assertions hold.
(a) The function hom f is continuous for each f : A → B continuous.
(b) Let fn : A → B be a Borel function for each n ∈ N. Suppose that the
sequence (fn ) pointwise converges to a function f . Then the sequence
(hom fn ) pointwise converges to hom f .
(c) If f ∈ Cα (A, B) for some α < ω1 , then hom f ∈ Chom,α (A, B) where
Chom,α (A, B) = (Chom (A, B))α and Chom (A, B) is the space of all homogeneous continuous mappings of A into B.
Proof. (a) Let x ∈ A be arbitrary. Fix any continuous seminorm ρ on F and any
ε > 0. We will find a neighborhood U of zero in E such that for any y ∈ (x + U ) ∩ A
one has ρ(hom f (y) − hom f (x)) ≤ ε.
To do that first observe that the mapping h : A × R → B defined by h(y, t) =
e−it f (eit y) is continuous. Therefore for any t ∈ R there is Vt , an absolutely convex
neighborhood of zero in E, and δt > 0 such that whenever s ∈ (t − δt , t + δt ) and
y ∈ (x + Vt ) ∩ A, then ρ(h(y, s) − h(x, t)) < 2ε . Fix a finite
T set J ⊂ [0, 2π] such that
the intervals (t − δt , t + δt ), t ∈ J, cover [0, 2π]. Let U = t∈J Vt . Given s ∈ [0, 2π],
choose t ∈ J with s ∈ (t − δt , t + δt ). Then for each y ∈ (x + U ) ∩ A we have
ρ(h(y, s) − h(x, s)) ≤ ρ(h(y, s) − h(x, t)) + ρ(h(x, t) − h(x, s)) < ε.

Hence, for each y ∈ (x + U ) ∩ A we have

The assertion (b) follows immediately from Theorem 3.10. The assertion (c)
follows from (a) using (b) and transfinite induction.

In case f is affine, hom f is always well defined and no further measurability
assumptions on f are needed. Indeed, given x ∈ E, the set {eit x; t ∈ [0, 2π]} is
contained in a finite-dimensional subspace of E (more precisely, in a subspace of
complex dimension one, hence of real dimension two). Moreover, f is continuous

on this finite-dimensional space and maps it into a finite-dimensional subspace of
F . The properties of the “homogenization” of affine mappings are summed up in
the following lemma.
Lemma 3.14. Let E, F be complex locally convex spaces, A ⊂ E an absolutely
convex set and B ⊂ F a closed absolutely convex set.
(a) If f : A → F is affine, then
1

hom f (x) = (f (x) − if (ix)) −

Moreover, there are unique homogeneous affine functions u, v : A → F such
that f (x) = f (0) + u(x) + v(x) for x ∈ A. In this formula u = hom f .
(b) If f ∈ Aα (A, B) for some α < ω1 , then hom f ∈ Ahom,α (A, B).
(c) Each homogeneous function from Aα (A, B) belongs to Ahom,α (A, B) as well.
Proof. (a) Set h = f − f (0). Then h is odd, hence h(αx + βy) = αh(x) + βh(y)
whenever α, β ∈ R and x, y, αx + βy ∈ A. Indeed, this is clear in case β = 0. If
β 6= 0, we have

v(x) = (f (x) − f (0)) + i(f (ix) − f (0)), x ∈ A.

Hence v(ix) = iv(x) for x ∈ A, so v is homogeneous. The uniqueness is clear.
The assertion (b) follows from (a) by transfinite induction. The assertion (c)

3.4. Odd and anti-homogeneous measures. Let E be a Banach space over F
and X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ). Then X is a compact convex set. Odd and anti-homogeneous
measures on X were defined in Section 1.1. In this section we will elaborate these
notions and, in particular, provide a proof of Fact 1.1.
There are two points of view on a Radon measure on X – we can view it as a set
function or as a functional on C(X, F). In the previous section we defined operators

odd and hom on the space C(X, F). We use the same symbols to denote the adjoint
operator on C(X, F)∗ . Let µ be an F-valued Radon measure on X.
• If F = R, we define odd µ ∈ C(X, R)∗ by (odd µ)(f ) = µ(odd f ), f ∈
C(X, R).
• If F = C, we define hom µ ∈ C(X, C)∗ by (hom µ)(f ) = µ(hom f ), f ∈
C(X, C).
The following lemma sums up basic properties of the operator odd on measures.
Lemma 3.15. Let E be a real Banach space, X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ) and µ be a signed
Radon measure on X. Then the following assertions hold.
odd µ(A) = 21 (µ(A) − µ(−A)) for any Borel set A ⊂ X.
odd µ is an odd measure.
µ is odd if and only if µ = odd µ.

Indeed, set σ(x∗ ) = −x∗ for x∗ ∈ X. Then, given f ∈ C(X, R), we have

It follows that ν = odd µ.
The assertions (b) and (c) follow immediately from (a). The assertion (d) follows
from (a) by repeating the above computation. The assertion (e) follows easily from
the characterization of boundary measures given in [1, p. 34–35].

We continue by the following lemma on odd measures and their relationship to
probabilities.
Lemma 3.16. Let E be a real Banach space, X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ) and µ be an odd
Radon measure on X with kµk ≤ 1. Then the following assertions hold.
(a) There is a Borel set A ⊂ X with A ∩ (−A) = ∅ such that µ+ is supported
by A and µ− is supported by −A.
(b) There
x∗ ∈ X such that for each x ∈ E one has x∗ (x) =
R ∗ is a unique
∗
y (x) dµ(y ).
(c) There is a probability ν on X such that odd ν = µ and r(ν) = x∗ (where
x∗ is provided by (b)). If µ is boundary, ν can be chosen maximal.
Proof. (a) Let us fix two disjoint Borel sets A+ and A− such that µ+ is supported
by A+ and µ− is supported by A− . It is enough to Rtake A = A+ \ (−A+ ).
To show (b) it is enough to observe that x 7→ y ∗ (x) dµ(y ∗ ) defines a linear
functional on E of norm not greater than kµk.
(c) If µ = 0, take ν = 21 (εy∗ + ε−y∗ ) where y ∗ is an extreme point of X. If µ 6= 0,
1−2kµ+ k
one can take ν = 2µ+ + kµk |µ|. Indeed, let A be the set provided by (a). Then
kµ+ k = µ+ (A) = µ(A) = −µ(−A) = µ− (−A) = kµ− k, thus kµ+ k ≤ 12 . It follows

BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

17

that ν is a probability measure. Moreover, given B ⊂ X Borel, we have
1
1−2kµ+ k
odd ν(B) = (ν(B) − ν(−B)) = µ+ (B) − µ+ (−B) + 2kµk (|µ| (B) − |µ| (−B))

1−2kµ+ k
2kµk (µ(B

∩ A) − µ(B ∩ (−A)) − µ((−B) ∩ A) + µ((−B) ∩ (−A)))

= µ(B ∩ A) + µ(B ∩ (−A)) + 0 = µ(B),
thus odd ν = µ.
Let f : X → R be a continuous affine function. Then f − f (0) is odd, thus there
is x ∈ E such that f (x∗ ) − f (0) = x∗ (x) for each x∗ ∈ X. Hence
ν(f ) = ν(f (0)) + ν(f − f (0)) = f (0) + µ(f − f (0)) = f (0) + x∗ (x) = f (x∗ ),
therefore ν represents x∗ .
Finally, if µ is boundary, then both |µ| and µ+ are boundary, hence ν is maximal.

The next lemma sums up the properties of the operator hom on complex measures. It is analogous to Lemma 3.15 but the proof is more involved due to the
more complicated definition in the complex case.

complex Radon measure on X. Then the following assertions hold.

Borel function. Then B f d hom µ = B hom f dµ.
(e) If µ is boundary, then hom µ is boundary.
Proof. (a) Let λ denote the normalized Lebesgue measure on [0, 2π] and λ × µ the
product measure on [0, 2π]× X. Set h(t, x) = e−it . Then h is a bounded continuous
function on [0, 2π] × X, hence we can set ν1 = h · (λ × µ) to be the measure on
[0, 2π] × X with the density h with respect to λ × µ. Further, consider the mapping
ϕ : [0, 2π] × X → X defined by ϕ(t, x) = eit x. This mapping is clearly continuous,
thus the image of the product measure ν2 = ϕ(ν1 ) is a well-defined Radon measure
on X. Then for any A ⊂ X Borel we have
ν2 (A) = ν1 (ϕ−1 (A)) = ν1 ({(t, x); eit x ∈ A}) = ν1 ({(t, e−it x); t ∈ [0, 2π], x ∈ A})

The assertions (b) and (c) follow immediately from the formula in (a). The
assertion (d) follows from the formula in (a) since the computation of µ(hom f ) can
be repeated for any bounded Borel function f .
(e) For the proof see [12, Lemma 4.2] or [32, § 23, Lemma 10].

We continue with the complex analogue of Lemma 3.16. The proof is again more
involved than in the real case.
Lemma 3.18. Let E be a complex Banach space, X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ) and µ be an antihomogeneous Radon measure on X with kµk ≤ 1. Then the following assertions
hold.
(a) Re µ and Im µ are odd measures.
(b) Im µ(A) = Re µ(iA) for A ⊂ X Borel.
(c) RThere is a unique x∗ ∈ X such that for each x ∈ E one has x∗ (x) =
y ∗ (x) dµ(y ∗ ).
(d) There is a Radon probability ν on X such that hom ν = µ and r(ν) = x∗ .
If µ is boundary, ν can be chosen maximal.
Proof. The
R assertions (a) and (b) are obvious. To show (c) it is enough to observe
that x 7→ y ∗ (x) dµ(y ∗ ) defines a linear functional on E of norm at most equal to
kµk.
(d) If µ = 0 take ν = 12 (εy∗ + ε−y∗ ) where y ∗ is an extreme point of X.
Let µ 6= 0. Then the absolute variation |µ| is invariant with respect to rotations,
i.e., |µ| (αA) = |µ| (A) for any A ⊂ X Borel and α ∈ C with |α| = 1. Let h0 be a
Borel function on X such that µ = h0 |µ| (i.e., h0 is the density of µ with respect to
|µ|). Then |h0 | = 1 |µ|-almost everywhere. Observe that without loss of generality
we may suppose that h0 is Baire measurable. Indeed, by the Luzin theorem there
is a sequence (fn ) of continuous functions converging |µ|-almost everywhere to h0 .
Then the function h1 defined by
(
lim fn (y ∗ ) if the limit exists,
h1 (y ∗ ) =
0
otherwise,
is a Baire measurable function which equals h0 |µ|-almost everywhere. Further,
define the function h by the formula

h(y ) =
e−it h1 (e−it y ∗ ) dt, y ∗ ∈ X.

Then h is also Baire measurable (by Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.13(c)). Moreover,
h(αy ∗ ) = αh(y ∗ ) for any y ∗ ∈ X and any complex unit α. Finally, h = h1 |µ|almost everywhere since h is also a density of µ with respect to |µ|. Indeed, for any
Borel set A ⊂ X we have

Set X1 = {y ∗ ∈ X; |h(y ∗ )| = 1} and X0 = X \ X1 . Then X0 and X1 are Baire
subsets of X, 0 ∈ X0 (since h(0) = 0) and X0 has |µ|-measure zero. Further,
set P = {y ∗ ∈ X; h(y ∗ ) = 1}. Then P is a Baire subset of X and the mapping
Φ : [0, 2π) × P → X1 defined by Φ(t, y ∗ ) = eit y ∗ is a continuous bijection. Since the
product space Z = [0, 2π) × P is a Baire subset of the compact space [0, 2π] × X,
Φ maps Baire sets in Z to Baire sets of X1 . (Indeed, let A ⊂ Z be a Baire set.
Then both A and Z \ A are K-analytic, hence Φ(A) and Φ(Z \ A) are two disjoint
K-analytic subsets of X1 covering X1 , hence they are Baire sets, see [20, Theorems
4.10 and 5.8].)
Therefore we can define measure ν1 as ν1 = Φ−1 (|µ|). Then ν1 is a positive
measure defined on the Baire σ-algebra of Z. Further, define ν2 = π2 (ν1 ), where
π2 is the projection of Z = [0, 2π) × P onto the second coordinate. Then ν2 is a
positive measure defined on the Baire σ-algebra of P . Since P is a Baire subset of
X, we can consider ν2 to be defined on the Baire σ-algebra of X (and supported
by P ). Therefore ν2 generates a positive functional on C(X, C). Since
kν2 k = ν2 (1) = ν2 (P ) = ν1 (Z) = |µ| (X1 ) = kµk ,
we have kν2 k ≤ 1. Moreover, if f ∈ C(X, C) is homogeneous, then

The first equality holds because ν2 is supported by P , the second one follows from
the fact that ν2 = π2 (ν1 ). The third is valid since f is homogeneous. In the fourth
one we used the properties of h: h(eit y ∗ ) = e−it h(y ∗ ) = e−it for y ∗ ∈ P . The fifth
inequality follows from the fact that ν1 = Φ−1 (|µ|), in the sixth one we used that
|µ| is supported by X1 and, finally, the last one follows from the choice of h. Hence,
for any f ∈ C(X, C) we have
hom ν2 (f ) = ν2 (hom f ) = µ(hom f ) = µ(f ),
hence hom ν2 = µ.
2k
Set ν = ν2 + 1−kν
kµk |µ|. Then ν is a probability measure and hom ν = µ (since
hom |µ| = 0). We continue by showing that ν represents x∗ . Let f be an affine
continuous function on X. By Lemma 3.14, there are u, v homogeneous affine
continuous functions from X to C such that f = f (0) + u + v. Since u and v are
given by evaluation at some points of E, we get
ν(f ) = ν(f (0) + u + v) = f (0) + ν(u) + ν(v) = f (0) + u(x∗ ) + v(x∗ ) = f (x∗ ).

It remains to show that ν is maximal whenever µ is boundary. Since ν is a
probability and |µ| is a boundary measure, it is enough to check that ν2 is boundary.
We will do that by the test using convex continuous functions. For a real-valued
continuous convex function f on X set
fˆ(y ∗ ) = sup{σ(f ); σ ∈ M1 (X), r(σ) = y ∗ }, y ∗ ∈ X,
and
B(f ) = {y ∗ ∈ X; f (y ∗ ) = fˆ(y ∗ )}.

20

ONDŘEJ F.K. KALENDA AND JIŘÍ SPURNÝ

Then boundary measures are exactly the measures supported by each B(f ) (see [1,
p. 34–35]). So, let f be any real-valued continuous convex function on X. Set
Z 2π
1
∗
g(y ) =
f (eit y ∗ ) dt, y ∗ ∈ X.
2π 0
Then g is again a continuous convex function and, moreover, B(g) ⊂ B(f ) by [12,
Lemma 4.1]. Hence |µ| (X \ B(g)) = 0. Since X \ B(g) is homogeneous, by the
definition of ν2 we get ν2 (X \ B(g)) = |µ| (X \ B(g)) = 0. Hence ν2 is supported
by B(g) and, a fortiori, by B(f ). This completes the proof.

Now we are ready to provide the proof of Fact 1.1:
Proof of Fact 1.1. The real case: By [32, §21, Theorem 7], E is an L1 -predual if
and only if for any two maximal probability measures µ,ν on X with the same
barycenter we have odd µ = odd ν.
Thus the sufficiency is clear: If µ and ν are two maximal probability measures
with the same barycenter x∗ , then odd µ and odd ν satisfy the conditions (a)–(d)
(by Lemma 3.15). So, by the uniqueness assumption we have odd µ = odd ν.
To show the necessity suppose that E is an L1 -predual. Let x∗ ∈ X be arbitrary.
Then there is a maximal probability ν representing x∗ . Set µ = odd ν. Then µ
satisfies (a)–(d) by Lemma 3.15. To prove the uniqueness suppose that µ1 is any
measure satisfying (a)–(d). By Lemma 3.16 there is a maximal probability measure
ν1 with the barycenter x∗ such that odd ν1 = µ1 . Thus µ = µ1 .
The complex case is completely analogous. By [12, Theorem 4.3] or [32, §23,
Theorem 5], E is an L1 -predual if and only if for any two maximal probability
measures µ,ν on X with the same barycenter we have hom µ = hom ν. Thus the
sufficiency is again clear and the necessity can be proved in the same way, only
using Lemma 3.18.

4. Affine maps of the first class and approximation properties
The aim of this section is to prove Theorem 2.2 and Example 2.3. To do that
we first give the following observation on strongly affine maps.
Lemma 4.1. Let f : K → F be a strongly affine mapping from a compact convex
set K to a locally convex space F over F. Then f is bounded.
Proof. Let τ ∈ F ∗ be arbitrary. By Fact 1.2 the mapping τ ◦ f is strongly affine.
By [1, Theorem I.2.6] (or [52, Section 14], [58] or [43, Lemma 4.5]) we get that τ ◦ f
is bounded. Hence f is bounded by [22, Theorem 4 on p. 151].

We continue by recalling definitions of some approximation properties of Banach
spaces.
A Banach space E is said to have
• the approximation property if for every ε > 0 and every compact set K ⊂ E
there exists a finite-rank operator L on E such that supx∈K kLx − xk ≤ ε.
• the compact approximation property if for every ε > 0 and every compact set
K ⊂ E there is a compact operator L on E such that supx∈K kLx − xk ≤ ε.
In other words, E has the (compact) approximation property if and only if the
identity operator on E is in the closure of finite-rank (compact) operators in the
topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of E. If the identity can be

BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

21

approximated by the operators of the respective type with norm at most λ, E is said
to have the λ-bounded approximation property (λ-bounded compact approximation
property). Further, E is said to have the bounded approximation property if it has
the λ-bounded approximation property for some λ ≥ 1.
Now we give the proof of Example 2.3. It is a strengthening of [47, Example
2.22] which follows from [47, Proposition 2.21]. In the quoted paper the authors
prove that f ∈
/ A1 (X, E), we prove that it is not in any affine Baire class.
Proof of Example 2.3. Since E is reflexive, the unit ball BE is weakly compact.
By the Namioka theorem (see e.g. [14, Corollary 14.4]), the function f (which is
the identity from X = (BE , w) to E equipped with the norm) has a dense (in
fact residual) set of continuity points. The same is true for the restriction of f to
any closed subset of X. Since E is separable, X is moreover metrizable, thus f is
Fσ -measurable by [30, §31, X, Theorem 2]. This implies that f ∈ C1 (X, BE ) by
Lemma 3.3(c).
S
Suppose that f ∈ α<ω1 Aα (X, E). Since f is odd (homogeneous), we get f ∈

the pattern from the Secα

tion 1.2. (Indeed, a linear operator L : E → E is weak-to-norm continuous on BE
if and only if it is compact.)
To finish the argument it is enough to check that all
S
the operators from α<ω1 (K(E))α are bounded and are contained in the closure of
K(E) in the topology of uniform convergence on norm compact subsets of E. This
will be done by transfinite induction. For α = 0Sit is clear. Let α > 0 and suppose
that the assertion is valid for each operator in β<α (K(E))β . Fix L ∈ (K(E))α .
S
Then there is a sequence (Ln ) in β<α (K(E))β pointwise converging to L. By
the induction hypothesis the operators Ln are bounded, hence the uniform boundedness principle shows that the sequence (Ln ) is uniformly bounded. Thus L is
bounded and, moreover, Ln → L uniformly on compact sets.

To prove Theorem 2.2 we need some lemmata. Let us first introduce some
notation.
Let E, F be Banach spaces such that F has dimension n ∈ N. Fix a basis
y1 , . . . , yn of F and denote by y1∗ , . . . , yn∗ the dual basis of F ∗ . For an n-tuple
∗∗
∗∗ n
∗∗
∗
∗∗
x∗∗ = (x∗∗

Ψ(x∗∗ )(y ∗ ) =

x∗ ∈ F ∗ .

i=1

It is clear that Φ is an isomorphism of (E ∗∗ )n onto L(E ∗ , F ) and Ψ is an isomorphism of (E ∗∗ )n onto L(F ∗ , E ∗∗ ).
Lemma 4.2. Under the above notation the following assertions hold.
(i) kΦ(x∗∗ )k = kΨ(x∗∗ )k for each x∗∗ ∈ (E ∗∗ )n .
(ii) Φ restricted to E n is an isomorphism of E n onto the subspace of L(E ∗ , F )
formed by weak∗ continuous operators.
(iii) Ψ restricted to E n is an isomorphism of E n onto L(F ∗ , E).

22

ONDŘEJ F.K. KALENDA AND JIŘÍ SPURNÝ

(iv) If we define on E n a norm k·k by the formula kxk = kΦ(x)k, then the
bidual norm on (E ∗∗ )n coming from the canonical duality of E n , (E ∗ )n
and (E ∗∗ )n is given by the formula kx∗∗ k = kΦ(x∗∗ )k.
Proof. (i) Let x∗∗ ∈ (E ∗∗ )n . Then
kΦ(x∗∗ )k = sup{kΦ(x∗∗ )(x∗ )kF ; x∗ ∈ BE ∗ }
= sup{|y ∗ (Φ(x∗∗ )(x∗ ))| ; x∗ ∈ BE ∗ , y ∗ ∈ BF ∗ }

The assertion (ii) follows from the fact that the weak∗ continuous functionals on
E ∗ are exactly those which come from E. The assertion (iii) is obvious.
(iv) Due to (i) it is enough to prove this assertion with Ψ instead of Φ. But this
one is proved for example in [8, Section 3].

Lemma 4.3. Let X be a compact convex set, F be a finite-dimensional Banach
space and f : X → F be an affine function which belongs to C1 (X, F ) and satisfies
kf (x)kF ≤ 1 for each x ∈ X. Then f ∈ A1 (X, BF ).
Proof. Without loss of generality we may suppose that F is a real space. Since F has
finite dimension, it easily follows from the Mokobodzki theorem that f ∈ A1 (X, F ).
Let E = A(X). For any x ∈ X let εx ∈ E ∗ be the respective evaluation functional.
By [26, Lemma 2.2] there is a unique linear operator Lf : E ∗ → F such that
Lf (εx ) = f (x) for each x ∈ X. If follows from [26, Lemma 2.3] that kLf k ≤ 1 and
Lf |BE∗ ∈ A1 ((BE ∗ , w∗ ), F ). The Banach-Dieudonné theorem easily yields that
Lf ∈ A1 ((E ∗ , w∗ ), F ).
Let H denote the subspace of L(E ∗ , F ) formed by the weak∗ continuous operators. By Lemma 4.2(iv) the bidual H ∗∗ can be canonically identified with L(E ∗ , F ).
Hence, in this identification we have Lf ∈ H ∗∗ and, moreover, Lf is the weak∗ limit of a sequence from H. Since kLf k ≤ 1, it follows from [49, Remark on
p. 379] that Lf is the weak∗ -limit of a sequence from BH . But this means that
Lf ∈ A1 ((E ∗ , w∗ ), BF ), hence f ∈ A1 (X, BF ).

Proof of Theorem 2.2. It is enough to prove the ‘moreover’ part since any affine
mapping f ∈ C1 (X, E) is bounded by Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 4.1.
Suppose that E has the λ-bounded approximation property for some λ ≥ 1. Let
f : X → E be an affine mapping of the first Baire class such that f (X) ⊂ BE .
Observe that f (X) is separable and fix a countable dense subset C ⊂ f (X). The
λ-bounded approximation property yields a sequence (Ln ) of finite-rank operators
pointwise converging to the identity on C such that kLn k ≤ λ for each n. It
follows that Ln converge to the identity also pointwise on f (X). Then Ln ◦ f
is also affine and of the first Baire class. Moreover, since the range has finite
dimension and (Ln ◦f )(X) ⊂ λBE , Lemma 4.3 yields Ln ◦f ∈ A1 (X, λBE ). Finally,
Ln ◦ f → f pointwise, we get f ∈ A2 (X, λBE ). Finally, Corollary 3.5 yields
f ∈ A1 (X, λBE ).

Remark 4.4. Similar problems are investigated in [47]. In particular, Theorem
2.12 in the quoted paper is a weaker variant of our Theorem 2.2. However, the

BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

23

proof given in [47] contains a gap. The authors confuse a projection on a onedimensional space with a coordinate functional. Therefore, it is not clear why the
family of operators (Tn,m ) defined on p. 25 should be uniformly bounded. The
correct estimate is kTn,m k ≤ 2Kn kT k which is not a uniform bound. The same
type of a gap is in Remark 2.18.1 and in the proof of Theorem 2.19. These results
can be repaired and improved using our Lemma 4.3.
5. The affine class of the dilation mapping
The aim of this section is to prove Theorem 2.4 and Remark 2.5. We start by
proving Remark 2.5. First we prove that the dilation mapping is always strongly
affine. It is the content of the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1.
(S) Let X be a simplex. Then the mapping T : x 7→ δx is strongly affine.
(R,C) Let X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ) for an L1 -predual E. Then T is strongly affine.
Proof. (S) It is clear that the mapping is affine. (Indeed, if x, y ∈ X and t ∈ [0, 1],
then tδx + (1 − t)δy is a probability measure with barycenter tx + (1 − t)y. Since
maximal probabilities form a convex set (by [43, Theorem 3.70]), necessarily tδx +
(1 − t)δy = δtx+(1−t)y .) To prove that it is strongly affine, by Fact 1.2 it is enough
to prove that x 7→ δx (f ) is strongly affine for each f : X → R continuous. Since
differences of convex continuous functions are norm-dense in C(X, R) by the StoneWeierstrass theorem, it is enough to prove it for convex continuous functions. But if
f is convex and continuous, then the mapping x 7→ δx (f ) is upper semicontinuous
by [1, Theorem II.3.7], hence it is strongly affine by [43, Proposition A.122 and
Theorem 4.21].
(R) The proof in this case is completely analogous to the case (S), we only need
to use [32, Chapter 7, §21, Theorem 7] to show that T f is a difference of two upper
semicontinuous functions whenever f is continuous and convex.
(C) The assertion for complex L1 -preduals is proved in [51, Lemma 4.12].

Lemma 5.2. If ext X is closed, then T is continuous.
Proof. (S) The mapping r : M1 (X) → X which assigns to each µ ∈ M1 (X)
its barycenter r(µ) is clearly continuous (see, e.g., [43, Proposition 3.40]). Since
ext X is compact, M1 (ext X) is a compact subset of M1 (X). Moreover, maximal
probabilities are exactly those supported by ext X (see, e.g., [1, p. 35] or [43,
Proposition 3.80]). By the simpliciality the operator r restricted to M1 (ext X) is
one-to-one, hence it is a homeomorphism. The operator T is its inverse.
(R) The proof is similar. Let Y denote the set of all odd measures from BM(X,R)
and Yb the set of all boundary measures from Y . For any µ ∈ Y let u(µ) denotes the
point of X provided by Lemma 3.16(b). It is clear that the operator u is continuous
and, by Fact 1.1, the restriction of u to Yb is one-to-one. The operator T is the
inverse of u|Yb . To prove that T is continuous it is enough to check that Yb is
compact. But Yb is the image of the set of all maximal probabilities on X under
the continuous operator odd (by Lemma 3.16(c)) and maximal probabilities on X
are exactly the probabilities from the compact set M1 (ext X) (by [43, Proposition
3.80]).
(C) The complex case is completely analogous to the real one. We just consider
anti-homogeneous measures instead of odd ones and use Lemma 3.18 instead of
Lemma 3.16.

Now we proceed with the proof of Theorem 2.4. It is based on the following
selection result, which can be viewed as an affine version of the Michael selection
theorem. We recall that a set-valued mapping Φ : X → F is said to be lower
semicontinuous if {x ∈ X; Φ(x) ∩ U 6= ∅} is open in X for any open set U ⊂ F .
Theorem 5.3. Let X be a compact convex set, F a Fréchet space and Φ : X → F
a lower semicontinuous set-valued mapping with nonempty closed values.
(S) If X is a simplex and the graph of Φ is convex, Φ admits a continuous
affine selection.
(R) If X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a real L1 -predual and the graph of Φ is convex
and symmetric, Φ admits an odd continuous affine selection.
(C) If X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a complex L1 -predual, F is complex and the
graph of Φ is absolutely convex, Φ admits a homogeneous continuous affine
selection.
The case (S) is due to [35, Theorem 3.1] (see also [43, Theorem 11.6]), the case
(R) is proved in [36, Theorem 2.2] or [32, Chapter 7, §22, Theorem 2] and the case
(C) in [50, Theorem 4.2]. More precisely, the assumptions of the quoted results are
formulated in a bit different way. Instead of assuming that the graph of Φ is convex,
it is assumed that Φ is affine (sometimes called convex), i.e., λΦ(x1 )+(1−λ)Φ(x2 ) ⊂
Φ(λx1 + (1 − λ)x2 ) whenever x1 , x2 ∈ X and λ ∈ [0, 1]. But these two assumptions
are indeed equivalent.
Proof of Theorem 2.4. (S) This case is essentially due to [42, Theorem 6.6] (or [43,
Theorem 11.26]). However, the formulation of these results is weaker and hence we
give a complete proof here. Since X is metrizable, A(X, R) is separable, hence we
can choose a countable set {en ; n ∈ N} dense in A(X, R).
Let n ∈ N be fixed. We define a multivalued mapping Γn : X → M1 (X) by the
formula
1
Γn (x) = {µ ∈ M1 (X); |µ(ei ) − ei (x)| < , i = 1, . . . , n}, x ∈ X.
n
We claim that Γn is a nonempty valued lower semicontinuous mapping with convex
graph. First, Γn (x) 6= ∅ as εx ∈ Γn (x). Further, the graph of Γn is equal to

{(x, µ) ∈ X × M1 (X); |µ(ei ) − ei (x)| < , i = 1, . . . , n},
n
hence it is convex.
We continue by showing that Γn is lower semicontinuous. Let V ⊂ M1 (X)
be a nonempty open set and let Γn (x) ∩ V 6= ∅ for some x ∈ X. We select
µ ∈ V satisfying |µ(ei ) − ei (x)| < n1 for each i = 1, . . . , n. By the continuity of the
functions ei , i = 1, . . . , n, there exists an open neighborhood U of x satisfying
1
|µ(ei ) − ei (y)| < , y ∈ U, i = 1, . . . , n.
n
Hence µ ∈ Γn (y) ∩ V for y ∈ U , and thus the set
{x ∈ X; Γn (x) ∩ V 6= ∅}
is open. This implies that Γn is lower semicontinuous.
Next we modify the mapping Γn to have closed values. To this end we define a
mapping Γn : X → M1 (X) as
Γn (x) = Γn (x),

x ∈ X.

Since, for an open set V ⊂ M1 (X) and x ∈ X, Γn (x) intersects V if and only if
Γn (x) intersects V , Γn is also lower semicontinuous. Moreover, it is clear that the
graph of Γn convex.
Now we want to use the selection result contained in Theorem 5.3. This is possible since M1 (X), being a compact convex metrizable set, is affinely homeomorphic
to a subset of ℓ2 . Hence there exists a continuous affine selection Tn from Γn .
We continue by showing that Tn → T on ext X. Fix x ∈ ext X. Let µ be any
cluster point of the sequence (Tn (x)) in M1 (X). By the very definition of Γn and
Γn , µ(ei ) = ei (x) for i ∈ N. By the density of the sequence (ei ) in A(X, R) we get
that µ(e) = e(x) for all e ∈ A(X, R), i.e., r(µ) = x. Since x is an extreme point of
X, necessarily µ = εx = δx . It follows that Tn (x) → δx .
Finally, we will prove that Tn → T on X. Fix any x ∈ X and f ∈ C(X, R).
Then

The first equality follows by the strong affinity of T (see Lemma 5.1). To verify
the second one we use that δx is maximal, hence supported by ext X , the already
proved fact that Tn → T on ext X and Theorem 3.10. The last one uses the fact
that Tn is affine and continuous.
(R) The construction of the sequence (Tn ) is analogous, we indicate the differences. First, {en ; n ∈ N} will be a dense subset of E. Further, M1 (X) will be
everywhere replaced by the set Y = {µ ∈ M(X); µ is odd and kµk ≤ 1}. Then Y
is a compact convex symmetric set. The mappings Γn and Γn will be defined in
the same way. They are lower semicontinuous for the same reason and, moreover,
their graphs are convex and symmetric. Using Theorem 5.3 we obtain a continuous
odd affine selection Tn from Γn .
We continue by showing that Tn → T on ext X. Fix x ∈ ext X. Let µ be any
cluster point of the sequence (Tn (x)) in Y . By the very definition of Γn and Γn ,
µ(ei ) = x(ei ) for i ∈ N. By density of the sequence (ei ) in E we get that µ(e) = x(e)
for all e ∈ E. It follows from Lemma 3.16 that there is a probability measure ν
representing x such that odd ν = µ. Since x is an extreme point of X, necessarily
ν = εx and it is maximal, thus µ = T (x). It follows that Tn (x) → T (x).
Finally, we will prove that Tn → T on X. Fix any x ∈ X and f ∈ C(X, R). Let
σ be a maximal probability representing x. Then

T (x)(f ) =
T (y)(f ) dσ(y) = lim

The first equality follows by the strong affinity of T (see Lemma 5.1). To verify
the second one we use that σ is maximal, hence supported by ext X, the already
proved fact that Tn → T on ext X and Theorem 3.10. The last one uses the fact
that Tn is affine and continuous.
(C) The proof in the complex case is completely analogous to the real case. Instead of the set of odd measures we consider the set of anti-homogeneous measures.
If we define Γn and Γn by the same formula, their graphs are clearly absolutely
convex and we can find a homogeneous affine continuous selection Tn of Γn . The
proof that Tn → T is analogous to the real case, we just use Lemma 3.18.

We remark that the metrizability assumption was used in the previous proof in
an essential way. First, we used the existence of a countable dense set in A(X) (or

26

in E) and secondly, we used the selection theorem Theorem 5.3 which works for
mappings with values in a Fréchet space, hence we need the metrizability of the
respective set of measures. However, as we know by Lemma 5.2, if ext X is moreover
closed, T is even continuous and no metrizability assumption is needed. So, it is
natural to ask how far one can go in this direction. It follows from Lemma 6.1(iii)
below that if T is of class A1 , necessarily T f is Baire-one for any scalar continuous
function f on X. This is the case if ext X is Lindelöf (by [25, 41, 38]) but not only
in this case (see [27, Theorem 4]). The following example shows, in particular, that
the Lindelöf property of ext X is not a sufficient condition for T being of class A1 .
Example 5.4. There are simplices X1 and X2 with the following properties.
(a) ext X1 is Lindelöf and ext X2 is an uncountable discrete set.
(b) The function x 7→ δx (f ) is Baire-one
S for continuous f : Xi → R (i = 1, 2).
(c) The mapping T : x 7→ δx is not in α<ω1 Cα (Xi , M1 (Xi )) (i = 1, 2).

Proof. We will use the well-known construction of ‘porcupine simplices’ which was
used for example in [27]. Let A ⊂ [0, 1] be an uncountable set. Let
K = ([0, 1] × {0}) ∪ (A × {−1, 1})

equipped with the following topology. The points from A × {−1, 1} are isolated
and a basis of neighborhoods of a point (x, 0) ∈ [0, 1] × {0} is formed by the sets of
the form
(U × {−1, 0, 1}) ∩ K \ {(x, 1), (x, −1)},
where U is a standard neighborhood of x in [0, 1]. Then K is a compact space. Let
1
A = {f ∈ C(K, R); f (x, 0) = (f (x, −1) + f (x, 1)) for each x ∈ A}
2
and let X = {ξ ∈ A∗ ; kξk = 1 & ξ(1) = 1} be equipped with the weak∗ topology.
Then X is a simplex. Moreover, K canonically homeomorphically embeds into X
(as evaluation mappings), in this way ext X is identified with ((K \ A) × {0}) ∪
(A × {−1, 1}) .
The assertion (b) is valid for any such X by [27, Theorem 1]. If we take A =
[0, 1], then ext X is uncountable discrete (see [27, Theorem 4]); and there is an
uncountable A such that ext X is Lindelöf (by [27, Theorem 2] it is enough if A
contains no uncountable compact subset, cf. [27, p. 69]).
Finally, we will prove that (c) is valid for any X of the described form. We
consider K canonically embedded in X. For any a ∈ A set fa = χ{(a,1)} − χ{(a,−1)} .
Then fa ∈ A. Let us define two sets in X by the formula:
1
U = {ξ ∈ X; ∃a ∈ A : ξ(fa ) > },
2
1
H = {ξ ∈ X; ∀a ∈ A : ξ(fa ) ≥ − }.
2
Then U is open and H is closed. Moreover, clearly A×{1} ⊂ U and H∩(A×{−1}) =
∅. Further, U ⊂ H. Indeed, pick any ξ ∈ U and fix a ∈ A such that ξ(fa ) > 12 . Fix
any b ∈ A. We will show that ξ(fb ) ≥ − 21 . If b = a the inequality is obvious. So,
suppose b 6= a. Since the function fa − fb belongs to A and has norm one, we have
1
1 ≥ ξ(fa − fb ) = ξ(fa ) − ξ(fb ) > − ξ(fb )
2
and the inequality follows.

Now consider the following system of mappings
F = {S : X → M1 (X); {a ∈ A; S(a, −1)(H) < S(a, 0)(U )} is countable}.
First observe that F contains all continuous mappings. Indeed, suppose that S
is continuous. Fix any q ∈ Q and set
Mq = {a ∈ A; S(a, −1)(H) < q < S(a, 0)(U )}.
Given a ∈ Mq , we have S(a, 0)(U ) > q. Since U is open, the mapping µ 7→
µ(U ) is lower semicontinuous on M1 (X), hence the set {µ ∈ M1 (X); µ(U ) > q}
is open. Therefore there is a neighborhood W of a in [0, 1] such that for any
x ∈ (W × {−1, 0, 1}) ∩ K \ {(a, −1), (a, 1)} we have S(x)(U ) > q. In particular,
W ∩ Mq = {a} (recall that H ⊃ U and so S(b, −1)(H) > q for b ∈ W \S{a}). It
follows that each point of Mq is isolated, hence Mq is countable. Therefore q∈Q Mq
is countable as well, hence S ∈ F .
Further observe that F is closed with respect to pointwise limits of sequences. Let
(Sn ) be a sequence in F pointwise converging to a mapping S. By the definition of
the system F there is a countable set C ⊂ A such that Sn (a, −1)(H) ≥ Sn (a, 0)(U )
for each n ∈ N and each a ∈ A \ C. We will show that S(a, −1)(H) ≥ S(a, 0)(U ) for
a ∈ A\C as well. So, fix a ∈ A\C and suppose that S(a, −1)(H) < S(a, 0)(U ). Fix
a number q such that S(a, −1)(H) < q < S(a, 0)(U ). Since Sn (a, 0) → S(a, 0) and
U is open, we can find n0 ∈ N such that for each n ≥ n0 we have Sn (a, 0)(U ) > q.
Since a ∈ A \ C, we get (for n ≥ n0 ) Sn (a, −1)(H) ≥ Sn (a, 0) > q. Since H is
closed and Sn (a, −1) S
→ S(a, −1), we get S(a, −1)(H) ≥ q, a contradiction.
We conclude that α<ω1 Cα (X, M1 (X)) ⊂ F . Finally, the mapping T does not
belong to F , since for any a ∈ A we have

(ε(a,1) (U ) + ε(a,−1) (U )) = ,

T (a, −1)(H) = δ(a,−1) (H) = ε(a,−1) (H) = 0.

6. Strongly affine Baire mappings
The aim of this section is to prove Theorem 2.6. The proof will be done in two
steps. Firstly, we give the proof in case X is metrizable with the use of Theorem 2.4.
Secondly, we reduce the general case to the metrizable case.
In the proof of the metrizable case we will need the following notation. Let
X be a compact convex set, F a Fréchet space over F, U : X → BM(X,F) be a
mapping and f : X → F be a bounded Baire mapping. Then we define a mapping
U f : X → F by
Z
U f (x) =

f dU (x),

x ∈ X.

X

The mapping U f is well defined due to Lemma 3.9.

Lemma 6.1. Using the above notation, the following assertions hold.
(i) If U and f are continuous, then U f is continuous as well.
(ii) If U is strongly affine, then U f is strongly affine as well.
(iii) If U ∈ Aα (X, BM(X,F) ) and f ∈ Cβ (X, F ) is a bounded mapping, then
U f ∈ Aα+β (X, acof (X)).

28

Proof. (i) Since f is continuous, f (X) is a compact subset of F . Thus L = acof (X)
is an absolutely convex compact subset of F (see, e.g., [22, Proposition 6.7.2]). By
Lemma 3.8(c), U f (X) ⊂ L. We need to show that U f is continuous. To this end,
let τ ∈ F ∗ be given. Then
Z
 Z
τ (U f (x)) = τ
f dU (x) =
τ ◦ f dU (x) = U (x)(τ ◦ f ), x ∈ X.
X

X

Since U is continuous and τ ◦ f ∈ C(X, F), the mapping x 7→ U (x)(τ ◦ f ) is a
continuous function on X. Thus U f : X → (L, weak) is continuous. Since L is
compact, the original topology of F coincides on L with the weak topology. Hence
U f ∈ C(X, L).
(ii) Let us first suppose that f is continuous. Let µ be any Radon probability
on X. Then for any τ ∈ F ∗ we have

= τ (U f (r(µ))).

Thus τ ◦ U f is strongly affine for each τ ∈ F ∗ , so U f is strongly affine by Fact 1.2.
The general case follows by transfinite induction on the class using Corollary 3.2
and the following observation: If (fn ) is a bounded sequence of Baire mappings
pointwise converging to a mapping f , then for each x ∈ X and each τ ∈ F ∗ we
have
Z
Z
τ (U fn (x)) =
τ ◦ fn dU (x) →
τ ◦ f dU (x) = τ (U f (x)).

X

(iii) Set L = acof (X). By Lemma 3.8(c) we have U f (X) ⊂ L.
Let us give the proof first for β = 0, i.e., in case f is continuous. The case α = 0
follows from (i) and (ii). We continue by transfinite induction. To proceed it is
enough to observe that Un → U pointwise on X implies Un f → U f pointwise on X.
So, suppose that Un → U pointwise on X. Fix any x ∈ X. Then Un (x) → U (x).
For any τ ∈ F ∗ we have
τ (Un f (x)) = Un (x)(τ ◦ f ) → U (x)(τ ◦ f ) = τ (U f (x)).
Thus Un f (x) → U f (x) weakly in F . But since the sequence is contained in the
compact set L, we deduce that Un f (x) → U f (x) in F . This completes the proof
for β = 0.
Suppose that γ > 0 is given such that the assertion is valid for any β < γ. Suppose that f ∈ Cγ (X, F ) is bounded. Then L = aco(F
S ) is bounded and f ∈ Cγ (X, L)
due to Corollary 3.2. So, fix a sequence (fn ) in β<γ Cβ (X, L) pointwise convergS
ing to f . Then U fn ∈ β<γ Aα+β (X, L) by the induction hypothesis. Further,
U fn → U f pointwise by Theorem 3.10, hence U f ∈ Aα+γ (X, L). This completes
the proof.

Now we are ready to complete the first step:
Proof of Theorem 2.6 in case X is metrizable. (S) Let f be strongly affine and f ∈
Cα (X, F ). Then f (x) = δx (f ) for each x ∈ X. Since the mapping x 7→ δx
belongs to A1 (X, M1 (X)) by Theorem 2.4, by Lemma 6.1(iii) we conclude that
f ∈ A1+α (X, F ).

BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

29

(R) If f is odd and strongly affine, then f = T f . Since T ∈ A1 (X, BModd (X,R) )
by Theorem 2.4, we conclude by Lemma 6.1(iii) and Lemma 3.12(c). If f is not odd,
then f = f (0)+ (f − f (0)). Since f − f (0) is odd, we get f − f (0) ∈ Aodd,1+α (X, F ),
thus f ∈ A1+α (X, F ).
(C) If F is complex and f is homogeneous and strongly affine, then f = T f .
Since T ∈ A1 (X, BMahom (X,C) ) by Theorem 2.4, we conclude by Lemma 6.1(iii) and
Lemma 3.14(b). If F is complex and f is not homogeneous, then we can write
f (x) = f (0) + u(x) + v(x),

x ∈ X,

where u and v are homogeneous and strongly affine and, moreover, u = hom f
(see Lemma 3.14(a)). Then u, v ∈ Cα (X, F ) by Lemma 3.13(c), hence u, v ∈
Ahom,1+α (X, F ). It follows that f ∈ A1+α (X, F ). Finally, if F is a real Fréchet
space, denote by FC its complexification. Then F is a real-linear subspace of FC ,
thus f ∈ Cα (X, FC ), so f ∈ A1+α (X, FC ). Since the canonical projection of FC onto
F is continuous and real-linear (hence affine), it is clear that f ∈ A1+α (X, F ).
Finally, consider the case α = 1. In all the cases we get as above by the use
of Lemma 6.1(iii) that f ∈ A2 (X, aco f (X)). Hence, Corollary 3.5 yields f ∈

A1 (X, aco f (X)).
To prove the general statement we need a reduction to the metrizable case. The
first step is the following lemma.
Lemma 6.2. Let E be a Banach space, X ⊂ BE ∗ a weak∗ compact convex set and
L be a convex subset of a Fréchet space F . Let f : X → L be a mapping of type
Cα (X, L) for some α ∈ [0, ω1 ). Then there exist a closed separable subspace E1 ⊂ E
and g : π(X) → L such that g ∈ Cα (π(X), L) and f = g ◦ π. (Here π : E ∗ → E1∗
denotes the restriction mapping.)
Proof. Assume first that α = 0, i.e., that f is continuous. Then f (X) is a compact
subset of F , hence it is a compact metrizable space. It follows that there is a
homeomorphic injection p : f (X) → RN . Further, since X is equipped with the
weak∗ -topology, it can be canonically embedded into the cartesian product FE .
The continuous mapping p ◦ f : X → RN can be extended to a continuous mapping
g : FE → RN (by [13, Theorem 3.1.7]). Further, by [56, Theorem 4] (see also [13,
Problem 2.7.12(d)]) there is a countable set C ⊂ E such that
u, v ∈ FE , u|C = v|C ⇒ g(u) = g(v).
Hence we can take E1 to be the closed linear span of C. Then E1 is a closed
separable subspace of E and, moreover, π(x∗1 ) = π(x∗2 ) for some x∗1 , x∗2 ∈ X implies
(p◦f )(x∗1 ) = (p◦f )(x∗2 ), and so f (x∗1 ) = f (x∗2 ). Thus there is a mapping g : π(X) →
L with f = g ◦ π. Since f is continuous and π is a closed continuous mapping, g is
continuous.
Assume now that α ∈ (0, ω1 ) and f : X → L of type Cα (X, L) is given. We
select a countable family F = {fn ; n ∈ N} in C(X, L) such that f ∈ Fα . For each
n ∈ N we find using the previous step a countable set Cn ⊂ E such that for any
x∗1 , x∗2 ∈ X we have
x∗1 |Cn = x∗2 |Cn ⇒ fn (x∗1 ) = fn (x∗2 ).
S
Let E1 be the closed linear span of n Cn . Then there are mappings g : π(X) → L
and gn : π(X) → L for n ∈ N such that f = g ◦ π and fn = gn ◦ π. Similarly as

30

above gn are continuous and, moreover, it is easy to check by transfinite induction
that g ∈ ({gn : n ∈ N})α , thus g ∈ Cα (π(X), L).

The next step is the following lemma on cofinality.
Lemma 6.3.
(S) Let X be a simplex and f : X → X1 an affine continuous surjection of X
onto a metrizable compact convex set. Then there is a metrizable simplex
X2 and affine continuous surjections f1 : X2 → X1 and f2 : X → X2 such
that f = f1 ◦ f2 .
(R,C) Let E be an L1 -predual over F and E1 be its separable subspace. Then there
exists a separable L1 -predual E2 satisfying E1 ⊂ E2 ⊂ E.
Proof. (S) In this proof we will denote by A(X) the space A(X, R) and similarly for
other compact convex sets. Let f ∗ : A(X1 ) → A(X) denote the canonical isometric
embedding defined by f ∗ (u) = u◦f for u ∈ A(X1 ). Let E be a (for a while arbitrary)
closed subspace of A(X) containing f ∗ (A(X1 )). Denote by π2 : A(X)∗ → E ∗ the
canonical restriction map. Define π1 : E ∗ → A(X1 )∗ by π1 (x∗ )(u) = x∗ (f ∗ (u)),
x∗ ∈ E ∗ , u ∈ A(X1 ). Further, let κX : X → A(X)∗ be the canonical evaluation
mapping, i.e., κX (x)(u) = u(x) for x ∈ X and u ∈ A(X). Similarly, κX1 denotes the
analogous mapping for X1 . Set X2 = π2 (κX (X)), f2 = π2 ◦ κX and f1 = (κX1 )−1 ◦
π1 |X2 . Then X2 is a compact convex set, and f1 : X2 → X1 and f2 : X → X2 are
affine continuous surjections satisfying f = f1 ◦ f2 . So, to complete the proof it is
enough to choose E in such a way that X2 is a metrizable simplex.
Observe that E is canonically isometric to A(X2 ). More precisely, if we consider
the isometric embedding f2∗ : A(X2 ) → A(X) defined by f2∗ (u) = u ◦ f2 for u ∈
A(X2 ), then E = f2∗ (A(X2 )). Indeed, if v ∈ E, we define u ∈ A(X2 ) by u(x∗ ) =
x∗ (v) for x∗ ∈ X2 . Then for each x ∈ X we have
f2∗ (u)(x) = u(f2 (x)) = f2 (x)(v) = π2 (κX (x))(v) = κX (x)(v) = v(x),
thus v ∈ f2∗ (A(X2 )). Conversely, let u ∈ A(X2 ). Then f2∗ (u) = u ◦ f2 ∈ A(X).
If u ◦ f2 ∈
/ E, by the Hahn-Banach separation theorem there is x∗ ∈ A(X)∗ such
∗
that x |E = 0 and x∗ (u ◦ f2 ) 6= 0. By [43, Proposition 4.31(a,b)] we have x∗ =
c1 κX (x1 ) − c2 κX (x2 ) for some x1 , x2 ∈ X and c1 , c2 nonnegative real numbers.
Since the space E contains the constant functions, we get c1 = c2 . Hence without
loss of generality c1 = c2 = 1. Then we get v(x1 ) = v(x2 ) for each v ∈ E. It follows
that π2 ◦ κX (x1 ) = π2 ◦ κX (x2 ), thus f2 (x1 ) = f2 (x2 ). So,
x∗ (u ◦ f2 ) = (u ◦ f2 )(x1 ) − (u ◦ f2 )(x2 ) = 0,
a contradiction.
Hence, X2 is metrizable provided E is separable, and X2 is a simplex provided
E satisfies the weak Riesz interpolation property (see [1, Corollary II.3.11]). Recall
that E has the weak Riesz interpolation property if, whenever u1 , u2 , v1 , v2 ∈ E are
such that max{u1 , u2 } < min{v1 , v2 }, then there is w ∈ E with max{u1 , u2 } < w <
min{v1 , v2 }. The inequalities are considered in the pointwise meaning. Further, it
is clear that it is enough to check this property for u1 , u2 , v1 , v2 belonging to a normdense subset of E. Thus we can construct E by a standard inductive procedure:
We construct countable sets A0 ⊂ B1 ⊂ A1 ⊂ B2 ⊂ · · · A(X) as follows:
• A0 is a countable dense subset of f ∗ (A(X1 )).

BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

• Whenever u1 , u2 , v1 , v2 ∈ An−1 are such that max{u1 , u2 } < min{v1 , v2 },
then there is w ∈ Bn with max{u1 , u2 } < w < min{v1 , v2 }.
• An is the Q-linear span of Bn .
S
Then we can set E = n An .
(R,C) This is proved in [32, §23, Lemma 1].

The final ingredient is the following lemma.
Lemma 6.4. Let π : K → L be an affine continuous surjection of a compact convex
set K onto a compact convex set L. Let g : L → F be a universally measurable
mapping from L to a Fréchet space F . Then g is strongly affine if and only if g ◦ π
is strongly affine.
Proof. In case F = F it is proved in [43, Proposition 5.29]. The vector-valued case
then follows immediately from Fact 1.2.

Now we can complete the proof:
Proof of Theorem 2.6 in the general case. (S) Let f ∈ Cα (X, F ) be strongly affine.
Set E = A(X, R) and κX : X → E ∗ be the canonical embedding. If we apply
Lemma 6.2 to κX (X) in place of X and f ◦ κ−1
X in place of f , we get a separable
∗
∗
space E1 ⊂ E and g ∈ Cα (π(κX (X)), F ) with f ◦ κ−1
X = g ◦ π (where π : E → E1
is the restriction mapping). Set X1 = π(κX (X)) and h = π ◦ κX . Then X1 is a
metrizable compact convex set and h is an affine continuous surjection of X onto X1 .
By Lemma 6.3 there is a metrizable simplex X2 and affine continuous surjections
h1 : X2 → X1 and h2 : X → X2 with h = h1 ◦h2 . Then g ◦h1 ∈ Cα (X2 , F ) and g ◦h1
is strongly affine by Lemma 6.4. Thus by the metrizable case, g ◦ h1 ∈ A1+α (X2 , F )
It follows that f = g ◦ h1 ◦ h2 ∈ A1+α (X, F ).
(R), (C) Given f as in the premise, we use Lemma 6.2 to find a separable
subspace E1 ⊂ E and g : BE1∗ → F in Cα (BE1∗ , F ) satisfying f = g ◦ π (π : E ∗ → E1∗
is again the restriction mapping). By Lemma 6.3 we can find a separable L1 predual E2 satisfying E1 ⊂ E2 ⊂ E. Denote π1 : E2∗ → E1∗ and π2 : E ∗ → E2∗
the restriction maps. Then g ◦ π1 ∈ Cα (BE2∗ , F ). Moreover, g ◦ π1 is strongly affine
by Lemma 6.4. Hence by the metrizable case we get g ◦ π1 ∈ A1+α (BE2∗ , F ) (or
g ◦ π1 ∈ Aodd,1+α (BE2∗ , F ) or g ◦ π1 ∈ Ahom,1+α (BE2∗ , F ) in the special cases). Since
f = g ◦ π1 ◦ π2 , the proof is complete.
If α = 1 we obtain by the same procedure that f ∈ A1 (X, F ).

Finally, let us settle the remaining special case:
Proof of Theorem 2.6 in case ext X is an Fσ -set. If ext X is Fσ , the result follows
from Theorem 2.7 proved below. More precisely:
(S) Let f ∈ Cα (X, F ) be strongly affine. Then f |ext X ∈ Cα (ext X, F ), hence
by Theorem 2.7 this function can be extended to a function g ∈ Aα (X, F ). Since
f = g on ext X, both functions are strongly affine and each maximal measure is
supported by ext X we conclude that f = g on X, i.e., f ∈ Aα (X, F ).
(R) Let f ∈ Cα (X, F ) be strongly affine. Then f = f (0) + (f − f (0)) and the
function f −f (0) is odd, strongly affine and belongs to Cα (X, F ). Using Theorem 2.7
as in the case (S) we get f − f (0) ∈ Aα (X, F ), thus f ∈ Aα (X, F ).
(C) Let f ∈ Cα (X, F ) be strongly affine. Then f = f (0)+u+v, where u = hom f
and v are homogeneous, affine and belong to Cα (X, F ) (see Lemma 3.14(a)). Using
Theorem 2.7 as in the case (S) we get u, v ∈ Aα (X, F ), thus f ∈ Aα (X, F ).

7. Extensions of Baire mappings
In this section we will prove Theorem 2.7. We will proceed in several steps,
imitating, generalizing and simplifying the approach of [41]. The strategy is the
following:
• Given a bounded Baire function f : ext X → F , we extend it to a bounded
Baire function h : X → F . (We do not require affinity and we do not
control the class of h.)
R
• We take the function T h(x) = X h d T (x), x ∈ X, used in the previous
section, and we prove that it is the unique strongly affine extension of f .
• We show that T h is of the right affine class.
The first step is made by the following lemma which is a vector-valued variant
of [41, Lemma 2.8] with a simplified proof.
Lemma 7.1. Let X be a compact convex set with ext X Lindelöf. Let F be a
Fréchet space over F, and f be a bounded function in Cα (ext X, F ) for some α < ω1 .
Let L = cof (ext X). Then there exists a Baire measurable function h : X → L
extending f .
If f ∈ C1 (ext X, F ), h may be chosen from C1 (X, L).
Proof. We will prove the result by transfinite induction on α. Suppose first that
α = 1, i.e., that f ∈ C1 (ext X, F ). Since L is separable and completely metrizable,
by [28, Theorem 30 and Proposition 28] there is an extension h : X → L which is
Σb2 (X)-measurable. Lemma 3.1 now implies that h ∈ C1 (X, L).
Assume now that α > 1 and the assertion is valid for all β < α. Suppose that f ∈
Cα (ext X, F ) is a bounded mapping and let L be as above. Then f ∈ Cα (ext X, L)
by Corollary 3.2 (note thatSext X is normal, being Lindelöf and regular), and thus
there exist mappings fn ∈ β<α Cβ (ext X, L) converging pointwise to f on ext X.
Let hn : X → L be their Baire measurable extensions and let
C = {x ∈ X; (hn (x)) converges}.

Let ρ be a compatible complete metric on F . Then

},
k
which gives that C is a Baire subset of X. Let z be an arbitrary element of L.
Then the function
(

h(x) =
z,
x ∈ X \ C,
C = {x ∈ X; ∀k ∈ N ∃l ∈ N ∀m1 , m2 ≥ l : ρ(hm1 (x), hm2 (x)) <

is the required extension.



The next lemma enables us to deduce the vector-valued version from the scalar
one.
Lemma 7.2. Let K be a compact space and L be a separable convex subset of a
Fréchet space F . Let f : K → L satisfy τ ◦ f ∈ Cα (K, L) for each τ ∈ F ∗ . Then
f ∈ Cα+1 (K, L).
Proof. Without loss of generality we can suppose that F is separable. Let f satisfy
the assumptions. By Lemma 3.1, the composition τ ◦ f is Σbα+1 (K)-measurable
for each τ ∈ F ∗ . Since (τ ◦ f )−1 (U ) = f −1 (τ −1 (U )) for any U ⊂ F and F , being

BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

33

separable, is hereditarily Lindelöf in the weak topology, we get that f is Σbα+1 measurable as a mapping from K to the weak topology of F . It follows from
Lemma 3.6 that it is Σbα+2 (K)-measurable as a mapping from K to the original
topology of F . Thus f ∈ Cα+1 (K, L) by Lemma 3.1.

Lemma 7.3. Let X be a compact convex set with ext X Lindelöf, F a Fréchet
space and h : X → F a bounded Baire mapping. Suppose moreover that one of the
following conditions is satisfied.
(S) X is simplex.
(R) X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a real L1 -predual and h|ext X is odd.
(C) X = (BE ∗ , w∗ ), where E is a complex L1 -predual and h|ext X is homogeneous.
Then T h is the unique strongly affine mapping which coincides with h on ext X.
Moreover, T h is a Baire mapping and it is odd in case (R) and homogeneous in
case (C).
Proof. Let us show first the uniqueness. Suppose that g1 , g2 are two strongly affine
mappings which coincide with h on ext X. Fix any τ ∈ F ∗ . Then, for each i = 1, 2
the function τ ◦gi is strongly affine and τ ◦gi |ext X is a Baire mapping (as it coincides
with h|ext X ), hence τ ◦ gi is a Baire mapping by [40, Theorem 5.2]. In particular,
the set {x ∈ X; τ (g1 (x)) = τ (g2 (x))} is a Baire set containing ext X. Given any
x ∈ X let µ be a maximal probability representing x. Then µ is carried by any
Baire set containing ext X, hence τ (g1 (x)) = µ(τ ◦ g1 ) = µ(τ ◦ g2 ) = τ (g2 (x)).
Hence τ ◦ g1 = τ ◦ g2 . Since τ ∈ F ∗ is arbitrary, we conclude g1 = g2 .
Further, observe that any strongly affine mapping coinciding with h on ext X is
a Baire mapping. Indeed, let g be such a mapping and suppose that h ∈ Cα (X, F ).
Using [40, Theorem 5.2] as in the previous paragraph we get τ ◦ g ∈ C1+α (X, F) for
each τ ∈ F ∗ , hence g ∈ C1+α+1 (X, F ) by Lemma 7.2. In particular, g is a Baire
mapping.
Finally, T h is strongly affine by Lemma 5.1 and Lemma 6.1(ii). To finish the
proof it is enough to show that T h coincides with h on ext X and that it enjoys the
appropriate symmetry in cases (R) and (C). The fact that T h is a Baire mapping
then follows from the previous paragraph. Hence distinguish the three cases:
(S) For x ∈ ext X we have T h(x) = δx (h) = h(x) since δx is the Dirac measure
supported at x.
(R) To show that g is odd it is enough to observe that T is odd (if x∗ ∈ X, then
−T (x∗ ) satisfies the conditions (a)–(d) from Fact 1.1 for −x∗ ). Further, for any
x∗ ∈ ext X we have T (x∗ ) = odd εx∗ , hence
Z
Z
odd h dεx∗ = odd h(x∗ ) = h(x∗ ).
T h(x∗ ) =
h d odd εx∗ =

X

(C) This case is completely analogous to the case (R).



The final ingredient is the following easy lemma:
Lemma 7.4. Let X be a compact convex set, F a Fréchet space and f , fn , n ∈ N,
strongly affine Baire mappings defined on X with values in F . If the sequence
(fn ) is uniformly bounded and converges to f pointwise on ext X, it converges to f
pointwise on X.

34

Proof. Let A = {x ∈ X; fn (x) → f (x)}. By the assumption we have A ⊃ ext X
and, moreover, A is a Baire set (as the functions in question are Baire functions, cf.
the proof of Lemma 7.1). Therefore any maximal probability measure is carried by
A. Fix any x ∈ X and a maximal probability µ representing x. Using Theorem 3.10
we have
f (x) = µ(f ) = lim µ(fn ) = lim fn (x).

Now we are prepared to complete the proof:
Proof of Theorem 2.7. Let us first prove the theorem for α = 1. So, suppose that
f ∈ C1 (ext X, F ) is a bounded mapping. Let L = acof (ext X). By Lemma 7.1
there is h ∈ C1 (X, L) extending f . Set g = T h. By Lemma 7.3 we know that g is
a strongly affine Baire mapping extending f . Now let us distinguish the cases:
(S) In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 2.6 we find (using Lemmata 6.2
and 6.3) a metrizable simplex Y , an affine continuous surjection π : X → Y , h̃ ∈
C1 (Y, L) and a Baire mapping g̃ : Y → L such that h = h̃ ◦ π and g = g̃ ◦ π. By
Lemma 6.4 the mapping g̃ is strongly affine. Moreover, since π(ext X) ⊃ ext Y , g̃
coincide with h̃ on ext Y . Lemma 7.3 then yields g̃ = T h̃. By Theorem 2.4 and
Lemma 6.1(iii) we get g̃ ∈ A2 (Y, L). Hence g ∈ A2 (X, L).
The cases (R) and (C) are analogous.
Let us continue with the general case. Lemmata 7.1 and 7.3 imply that for any
(odd, homogeneous) bounded F -valued map f on ext X there is a unique strongly
affine map Sf extending f . By Lemma 7.4 we know that Sfn → Sf pointwise
whenever (fn ) is a bounded sequence converging to f pointwise on ext X. The
already proved case α = 1 shows that Sf ∈ A2 (X, F ) whenever f ∈ C1 (ext X, F ).
Hence the result follows by transfinite induction.
The case of ext X being Fσ is proved in the next section using Theorem 2.8.
Finally, suppose that ext X is closed. For each bounded f ∈ Cα (ext X, F ) (odd,
homogeneous) we construct the extension g by the same method as above. We will
prove that g ∈ Aα (ext X, F ). Since boundary measures are supported by ext X, we
have
Z
f dT (x), x ∈ X.
g(x) =
ext X

Suppose first that α = 0, i.e., f is continuous. Then we can prove that g is
continuous by a minor modification of the proof of Lemma 6.1(i) with the help of
Lemma 5.2. The general case then follows by transfinite induction using Lemma 7.4.

8. The weak Dirichlet problem for Baire mappings
In this section we will prove Theorem 2.8. The proof will be a simplified and
generalized version of the proof of the main result of [62].
Proof of Theorem 2.8. (S) Suppose that X, K, F and f satisfy the assumptions.
Set H = co(K) and L = co(f (K)). By Corollary 3.2 we have f ∈ Cα (K, L). Fix a
countable family F = {fn ; n ∈ N} ⊂ C(K, L) such that f ∈ (F )α .
We define ϕ : K → F N by
ϕ(x) = (fn (x))∞
n=1 ,

x ∈ K.

BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

35

Then ϕ is a continuous mapping of K into F N . Further we set
(
{ϕ(x)}, x ∈ K,
Γ(x) =
co ϕ(K), x ∈ X \ K.
Then Γ is a lower semicontinuous mapping with closed values. Moreover, the graph
of Γ is convex. By Theorem 5.3 there exists a continuous affine selection γ : X → F N
of Γ.
Let hn = πn ◦ γ, n ∈ N, where πn : F N → F is the n-th projection mapping.
Then hn are continuous affine mappings of X into F such that
hn (x) = πn (γ(x)) = πn (ϕ(x)) = fn (x),

x ∈ K.

Further, for each x ∈ X we choose some r(x) ∈ H such that hn (x) = hn (r(x)) for
each n ∈ N. If x ∈ H we set r(x) = x. If x ∈ X \ H, then γ(x) ∈ co ϕ(K) =
co γ(K) = γ(H), thus there exists an element r(x) ∈ H such that γ(x) = γ(r(x)).
Finally, we can construct the required extension by
(
δx (f ),
x ∈ H,
ˆ
(8.1)
f (x) = ˆ
f (r(x)), x ∈ X \ H.
First, if x ∈ H, then δx is supported by K, thus fˆ is well defined on H. Subsequently, fˆ is extended to X using the mapping r fixed above. It is clear that fˆ is
an extension of f . Moreover,
(8.2)

fˆ ∈ ({hn ; n ∈ N})α ⊂ Aα (X, L).

Indeed, the formula (8.1) enables us to assign to each Borel function g : K → L its
extension ĝ : X → L. Note that
fˆn = hn for n ∈ N.
Further, it follows from Theorem 3.10 that
gk → g pointwise on K ⇒ gˆk → ĝ pointwise on X.
Hence it is easy to prove by transfinite induction on β that
g ∈ ({fn ; n ∈ N})β ⇒ ĝ ∈ ({hn ; n ∈ N})β ,
so, in particular, (8.2) holds.
(R) We assume that K is moreover symmetric and f is odd. We proceed in the
same way. The sets H and L are convex and symmetric. The family F may consist
of odd functions by Lemma 3.12. Then ϕ is moreover odd and the graph of Γ is
convex and symmetric. Thus the selection γ may be chosen to be moreover odd
and the functions hn are odd as well. The formula for the extension is similar:
(
T (x)(f ), x ∈ H,
ˆ
f (x) = ˆ
f (r(x)), x ∈ X \ H.
The rest of the proof is the same, we use the fact that T (x) is supported by K
whenever x ∈ H.
(C) The proof is completely analogous to the real case.

Now we give the proof of the missing part from Theorem 2.7.

36

ONDŘEJ F.K. KALENDA AND JIŘÍ SPURNÝ

Proof of Theorem 2.7 in case ext X is Fσ . (S) It is enough to prove that x 7→ δx (f )
is in A1 (X, F ) for any bounded f ∈ C1 (ext X, F ). Hence choose any bounded
f ∈ C1 (ext X, F ). Fix a bounded sequence of continuous functions fn : ext X
S→F
pointwise converging to f (this can be done by Corollary 3.2). Let ext X = n Kn ,
where (Kn ) is an increasing sequence of compact sets. By Theorem 2.8 there are
affine continuous maps hn extending fn |Kn . Then hn converge to f pointwise on
ext X, thus for each x ∈ X we have
δx (f ) = lim δx (hn ) = lim hn (x).
n→∞

n→∞

This completes the proof.
(R) The proof is analogous. Assume that f is moreover odd. We can choose fn
to be odd (Lemma 3.12) and Kn to be symmetric. In the final computation we use
T (x) instead of δx .
(C) If f is homogeneous, we can choose fn to be homogeneous by Lemma 3.13.
Moreover,
Kn can be chosen to be homogeneous as well. Indeed, if K is compact,
S
then {αK; α ∈ C, |α| = 1} is compact as a continuous image of the compact set
K × {α ∈ C; |α| = 1}.

As an another consequence of Theorem 2.8 we get the following extension theorem.
Theorem 8.1. Let K be a compact subset of a completely regular space Z, F be a
Fréchet space and f : K → F be a bounded mapping in Cα (K, F ). Then there exists
a mapping h : Z → F in Cα (Z, F ) extending f such that h(Z) ⊂ cof (K).
Proof. Let L = acof (K). Let βZ be the Čech-Stone compactification of Z and
X = M1 (βZ). Then X is a simplex and ext X is canonically identified with
βZ. Hence K is a compact subset of ext X. Therefore the result follows from
Theorem 2.8.

9. Affine version of the Jayne-Rogers selection theorem
The aim of this section is to prove Theorem 2.9. To this end we need the following
lemma on ‘measure-convexity’:
Lemma 9.1. Let X be a compact convex set, F be a Fréchet space over F and
Γ : X → F be an upper or lower semicontinuous mapping with closed values and
convex graph, such that Γ(X) is bounded. Let f : X → F be a Baire measurable
selection from Γ. If µ ∈ M1 (X), then
µ(f ) ∈ Γ(r(µ)).
Proof. Since f is Baire measurable, µ(f ) is well defined by Lemma 3.9. Set x =
r(µ). Assuming µ(f ) ∈
/ Γ(x), Γ(x), as a convex closed set, can by separated from
µ(f ) by some element from F ∗ , i.e., there exists τ ∈ F ∗ and c ∈ R such that
(Re τ )(µ(f )) > c > sup(Re τ )(Γ(x)).
Let
ϕ(y) = sup(Re τ )(Γ(y)),

y ∈ X.

Since the graph of Γ is convex, ϕ is a concave function on X. Moreover, if Γ is upper
semicontinuous, then ϕ is upper semicontinuous; and if Γ is lower semicontinuous,

BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

37

then ϕ is lower semicontinuous. In both case we get by [43, Proposition 4.7]
Z
Z
ϕ(y) dµ(y) ≤ ϕ(x) < c.
(Re τ )(f (y)) dµ(y) ≤
c < (Re τ )(µ(f )) =
X

X

This contradiction finishes the proof.



Now we can give the proof:
Proof of Theorem 2.9. (S) By [24, Theorem] (which is an improved version of [23,
Theorem 2]) and Lemma 3.3(c) there is a selection f from Γ which belongs to
C1 (X, F ). Set g(x) = δx (f ) for x ∈ X. By Theorem 2.4 and Lemma 6.1(iii) we
have g ∈ A2 (X, F ) and by Lemma 9.1, g is a selection of Γ.
(R) We proceed in the same way. We find a selection f in C1 (X, F ) and set
f1 = odd f . Observe that f1 is still a selection from Γ. Indeed, if x ∈ X,
then (x, f (x)) and (−x, f (−x)) belong to the graph of Γ. Since the graph of
Γ is symmetric, (x, −f (−x)) belongs there, too. By convexity we conclude that
(x, f1 (x)) = (x, odd f (x)) belongs there as well. Further, set g = T f1 . By Theorem 2.4 and Lemma 6.1(iii) we have g ∈ A2 (X, F ). Moreover, let x ∈ X be
arbitrary. Fix a maximal representing measure µ of x. Then
g(x) = T (x)(f1 ) = odd µ(f1 ) = µ(f1 ) ∈ Γ(x)
by Lemmata 9.1 and 3.15(d), hence g is a selection from Γ. It remains to observe
that g is odd since T is odd.
(C) This case is analogous to the case (R). We find a selection f in C1 (X, F )
and set f1 = hom f . Observe that f1 is still a selection of Γ. Indeed, if x ∈ X
and t ∈ [0, 2π], then (eit x, f (eit x)) belongs to the graph of Γ. Since the graph
is homogeneous, it contains also (x, e−it f (eit x)), hence e−it f (eit x) ∈ Γ(x). Since
Γ(x) is closed and convex, we get f1 (x) = hom f (x) ∈ Γ(x). The rest of the proof
is the same as in case (R).

It is natural to ask whether we can obtain a nice affine selection even in case X
is not metrizable. We stress that the Jayne-Rogers theorem requires metrizability
both of the domain space and of the range space. However, if F is separable, it
easily follows from the Kuratowski–Ryll-Nardzewski selection theorem (see [31] or
[68, Theorem 5.2.1]) that F admits a Borel measurable selection, in fact a selection
of the first Borel class in the sense of [65]. However, an affine Borel selection need
not exist even in the scalar case. This is illustrated by the following example. In
the same example we show that the class of the affine selection in the metrizable
case cannot be improved.
Example 9.2. There are simplices X1 , X2 and upper semicontinuous mappings
Γi : Xi → R with closed values, bounded range and convex graph for i = 1, 2 such
that the following assertions hold:
(i) X1 is metrizable and Γ1 admits no affine Baire-one selection.
(ii) X2 is non-metrizable and Γ2 admits no affine Borel selection.
Proof. Let A ⊂ [0, 1] be any subset. Let K, A and X be defined as in Example 5.4.
We again consider K canonically embedded into X. Fix an arbitrary set B ⊂ A and
define two real-valued functions on K by u0 = χB×{1} and v0 = χ(B×{1})∪([0,1]×{0}) .

38

ONDŘEJ F.K. KALENDA AND JIŘÍ SPURNÝ

Then u0 ≤ v0 . We further define two functions on X by the formulas
u(x) = sup{h(x); h ∈ A(X, R), h ≤ u0 on K},
v(x) = inf{h(x); h ∈ A(X, R), h ≥ v0 on K}.
Then u is a lower semicontinuous convex function on X and v is an upper semicontinuous concave function on X. Moreover, clearly u ≤ v (if h1 , h2 ∈ A(X, R) with
h1 ≤ u0 and h2 ≥ v0 on K, then h1 ≤ h2 on ext X, hence h1 ≤ h2 on X). Therefore
the formula Γ(x) = [u(x), v(x)], x ∈ X, defines a bounded upper semicontinuous
mapping with nonempty closed values and convex graph.
We claim that u|K = u0 and v|K = v0 . This follows from abstract results [43,
Propositions 3.48 and 3.55], but it can be seen also directly:
Since 0 ≤ u0 , it follows that u(x) = 0 = u0 (x) for x ∈ K \ (B × {1}). If x = (b, 1)
for some b ∈ B, consider the function fb = χ(b,1) −χ(b,−1). Then fb ∈ A and fb ≤ u0 .
Since fb defines a function in A(X, R), we conclude that u(x) = 1 = u0 (x).
Since v0 ≤ 1, we get v(x) = 1 = v0 (x) for x ∈ (B × {1}) ∪ ([0, 1] × {0}). If
x = (a, −1) for some a ∈ A, then 1 + fa ≥ v0 , thus v(x) = 0 = v0 (x). If x = (a, 1)
for some a ∈ A \ B, then 1 − fa ≥ v0 , thus v(x) = 0 = v0 (x).
In particular, u = v on A × {−1, 1}. Let g be any affine selection from Γ. Then
(
1
, a ∈ B,
f (a, 0) = 2
0, a ∈ A \ B.
Therefore, to construct X1 it is enough to take A to be a countable dense subset
of [0, 1] and B ⊂ A such that both B and A \ B are dense. To construct X2 it is
enough to take A to be an uncountable Borel set and B ⊂ A a non-Borel subset. 
10. Sharpness of results and open problems
In this final section we collect several open questions and discuss which of the
results are sharp. We start by pointing out a gap between Theorem 2.2 and Example 2.3.
Question 10.1. Let X be a compact convex set and E a Banach space having the
approximation property (or the compact approximation property). Does any affine
function f ∈ C1 (X, E) belong to A1 (X, E)?
The next question concerns optimality of constants in Theorem 2.2.
Question 10.2. Let X be a compact convex set and E a Banach space with the
bounded approximation property. Does any affine function f ∈ C1 (X, BE ) belong to
A1 (X, BE )?
We continue with problems concerning Theorem 2.4. In case of a metrizable
simplex we have proved that the mapping T is of class A1 when the target space is
M1 (X). The same proof gives a slightly stronger conclusion that T is of class A1
when the target space is M1 (ext X) and similar statement in cases (R) and (C).
However the following question seems to be open.
Question 10.3. Let X be a metrizable simplex. Is T ∈ A1 (X, M1 (ext X))? Is the
analogous statement valid for L1 -preduals?
As we have remarked above, the metrizability assumption was used in the proof
of Theorem 2.4 in an essential way. Further, the metrizability assumption cannot

BAIRE CLASSES OF AFFINE VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS

39

be omitted or just weakened to the Lindelöf property of ext X by Example 5.4.
However, the general question when the operator T belongs to the class C1 or even
A1 seems to be hard. A sufficient condition is metrizability of X or closedness of
ext X. But these conditions are not necessary. It is easy to construct a simplex X
when T is of class A1 even though X is not metrizable and ext X is not closed. For
example, the simplex constructed by the method used in [27, Theorem 4] starting
with K = [0, ω1 ] and A = {ω}. (This construction is based upon the well-known
constructions from [69] and [3].) It seems that the following question is natural. (By
an (S, R, C) compact set we mean a compact convex set which is either a simplex
of the dual unit ball of a real or complex L1 -predual.)
Question 10.4. Let X be an (S,R,C) compact set. Is T of the class C1 or even A1
if one of the below conditions is satisfied?
• ext X is K-analytic.
• ext X is a Baire set.
• ext X is Fσ .
Let us further remark that the operator T cannot be ‘too non-measurable’ since
it is strongly affine due to Lemma 5.1. More precisely, it follows from the proof
of this lemma that in cases (S) and (R) T f is a uniform limit of a sequence of
differences of lower semicontinuous functions for any f ∈ C(X, R). In case (C) the
same property is enjoyed by Re T f and Im T f for each f ∈ C(X, C) by the proof
of [51, Lemma 4.12]. Hence, in all three cases, T f is Borel measurable for any
scalar continuous function f . (In fact, in this case T f is of the first Borel class in
the sense of [65].) It easily follows that T −1 (U ) is a Borel set (of the first additive
class in the sense of [65]) for any cozero set U in the respective set of measures
(but it need not be Borel measurable as the spaces from Example 5.4 easily show).
However, the function T f need not be of the first Baire class – an example is given
in [27, Theorem 4]. In fact, in the quoted example T is not in the class Aα for
any α < ω1 since T f need not even be a Baire function (it is a consequence of the
quoted example and [27, Theorem 5]).
We continue by looking at Theorem 2.6. It is sharp even in the scalar case, i.e.
the shift α → 1 + α may occur. In the case (S) it was showed in [64] for α = 2 and
in [67] for general α ∈ [2, ω). The same examples can be easily transferred to the
cases (R) and (C). What we further do not know is the following question.
Question 10.5. Let X be an (S,R,C) compact set such that ext X is a Lindelöf
resolvable set. Can one replace 1 + α by α in Theorem 2.6?
Recall that a subset of a X is said to be resolvable (or a H-set ) if its characteristic
function has the point of continuity property. For more details see [66]. Within
metrizable spaces this class is defined in [30, §12, III] using an equivalent condition.
Further, a subset of a completely metrizable space is resolvable if and only if it is
simultaneously Fσ and Gδ . Thus, the answer is positive if X is metrizable. Further,
the answer is also positive in the scalar case. The case (S) follows from [66], the
case (R) from [40, Theorem 1.4], the case (C) from [38, Theorem 2.23].
The conclusion of Theorem 2.7 is optimal since it follows from the optimality
of Theorem 2.6 (the above-mentioned examples from [64] and [67] are metrizable).

Question 10.6. Let X be an (S,R,C) compact with ext X Lindelöf, F be a Fréchet
space and f : ext X → F a bounded continuous (odd, homogeneous) map. Can f
be extended to an element of A1 (X, F )?
In the scalar case the answer is positive (by [25, 41, 38]), but in the vector case
our proof gives just an extension in A2 (X, F ). Moreover, if g is such an extension,
the scalar version yields τ ◦ g ∈ A1 (X, F) for each τ ∈ F ∗ .
Another question is the following.
Question 10.7. Let X be an (S,R,C) compact set such that ext X is a Lindelöf
resolvable set. Can one replace 1 + α by α in Theorem 2.7?
In the scalar case the answer is positive (by [66, 41, 38]). In the vector case we
are able to prove it only if ext X is an Fσ set, hence the answer is positive if X is
metrizable.
Theorem 2.7 deals with extending Baire mappings. It is natural to ask whether
we can extend Baire measurable mappings. If the target space F is separable,
then any Baire measurable mapping with values in F which is defined on a regular
Lindelöf space is a Baire mapping of the respective class (by Lemma 3.1). Hence the
question of extending Baire measurable mappings reduces to the question whether
a Baire measurable mapping has separable range.
Question 10.8. Let X be a compact convex set with ext X Lindelöf. Let f :
ext X → F be a Baire measurable mapping with values in a Fréchet space. Is the
range of f separable?
The answer is positive if ext X is a Baire set (or, more generally, a K-analytic
set) – see Lemma 3.3(a). For a general Lindelöf (even separable metric) space in
place of ext X the answer is negative by [29, Example 2.4(3)]. But we do not know
whether an example can be of the form of ext X.
Finally, one can ask whether the assumption that ext X is Lindelöf is necessary.
It cannot be just omitted (even in the scalar case, see, e.g., [27, Theorem 4]).
However, the following question asked already in [25] is still open.
Question 10.9. Let X be a simplex such that each bounded continuous real-valued
function on ext X can be extended to an affine Baire function on X. Is necessarily
ext X Lindelöf ? Does the analogous implication hold for dual balls of L1 -preduals?
Let us remark that the answer is positive within a special class of ‘Stacey simplices’ by [27, Theorems 2 and 6], but the general case is not clear.
Finally, Theorem 2.8 is clearly sharp and Theorem 2.9 is sharp due to Example 9.2.
