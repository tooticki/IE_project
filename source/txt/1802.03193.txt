Abstract In this paper we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of
Young differential delay equations under weaker conditions than it is known in the
literature. We also prove the continuity and differentiability of the solution with
respect to the initial function and give an estimate for the growth of the solution. The
proofs use techniques of stopping times, Shauder-Tychonoff fixed point theorem and
a Gronwall-type lemma.

for some fixed time interval [0, T ], where C([a, b], Rd ) denote the space of all continuous paths x : [a, b] → Rd equipped with sup norm kxk∞,[a,b] = supt∈[a,b] kx(t)k,
with k · k is the Euclidean norm in Rd , xt ∈ Cr is defined by xt (u) := x(t + u)
for all u ∈ [−r, 0]; f , g : Cr → Rd are coefficient functions; and ω belongs to
Cν −Hol ([0, T ], R) - the space of Hölder continuous paths for index ν > 12 . Such
system appears, for example, while solving stochastic differential equations of the
form
(3)
dx(t) = f (xt )dt + g(xt )dBH (t),
x0 = η ∈ Cr ,
where BH is a fractional Brownian motion defined on a complete probability space
(Ω , F , P) with the Hurst index H ∈ (1/2, 1) [15]. Since BH is neither Markov nor
semimartingale if H 6= 12 , one cannot apply the classical Ito theory to solve (3).
Instead, due to the fact that BH (·) is Hölder continuous for almost surely all the realizations, one can define the stochastic integral w.r.t. the fBm as the integral driven
by a Hölder continuous path using the so called rough path theory [8], [12], [13],
[14], or fractional calculus theory [18], [21]. As a result, solving (3) leads to the
deterministic equation (1) or (2), where the second integral in (2) is understood in
the Young sense (see [11], [20]).
The theory of stochastic differential equations driven by the fBm BH for H >
1
2 has been well developed by many authors, especially results on existence and
uniqueness of the pathwise solution, the generation of random dynamical systems
(see e.g. [4], [5], [9], [10], [11], [16], [17], [20],... and the references therein). For
studies on delay equations, we refer to [1], [2], [3], [6].
In the general case where f , g are functions of (t, xt ), under some regularity conditions, i.e. f is globally Lipschitz continuous and of linear growth, g is C1 such
that its Frechet derivative is bounded and globally Lipschitz continuous, there exists
a unique solution x(·, ω , η ) of (1) (see [1] or [19]). These results are based on the
tools of fractional calculus developed in [17], [21], [22].
In this paper, we reprove the existence and uniqueness theorem of (1) under the
following assumptions.
(H f ) The function f is globally Lipschitz continuous and thus has linear growth,
i.e there exist constants L f such that for all ξ , η ∈ Cr
k f (ξ ) − f (η )k ≤ L f kξ − η k∞,[−r,0]
(Hg ) The function g is C1 such that its Frechet derivative is bounded and locally
δ −Hölder continuous with 1 ≥ δ > 1−ν ν , i.e there exists Lg such that for all ξ , η ∈ Cr
kDg(ξ )kL(Cr ,Rd ) ≤ Lg
and for each M > 0, there exists LM such that for all ξ , η ∈ Cr that satisfy
kξ k∞,[−r,0], kη k∞,[−r,0] ≤ M
one has
kDg(ξ ) − Dg(η )kL(Cr ,Rd ) ≤ LM kξ − η kδ∞,[−r,0]

for some constant 1 > δ > 1−ν ν . Assumption (4) is weaker than the global Lipschitz
continuity of Dg, as seen in [1], [6] or [19].
Furthermore, we show that the solution is differentiable with respect to the initial
function η and give an estimate for the growth of the solution. Note that in order
to define the second integral in (2) in the Young sense, one needs to consider the
solution x and the initial function η in Hölder function spaces Cβ -Hol with β + ν > 1.
To finish the introduction, we recall some facts about Young integral, more details
can be seen in [8]. For p ≥ 1 and [a, b] ⊂ R, a continuous path x : [a, b] → Rd is of
finite p−variation if
n

|||x||| p-var,[a,b] :=

sup

∑ kx(ti+1 ) − x(ti)k

Π (a,b) i=1

p

!1/p

< ∞,

(5)

where the supremum is taken over the whole class of finite partition of [a, b]. The
subspace C p−var ([a, b], Rd ) ⊂ C([a, b], Rd ) of all paths x with finite p−variation and
equipped with the p−var norm
kxk p-var,[a,b] := kx(a)k + |||x||| p-var,[a,b] ,
is a nonseparable Banach space [8, Theorem 5.25, p. 92].
Also, for 0 < β ≤ 1 denote by Cβ −Hol ([a, b], Rd ) the Banach space of all Hölder
continuous paths x : [a, b] → Rd with exponent β , equipped with the norm
kxk∞,β ,[a,b] := kxk∞,[a,b] + |||x|||β ,[a,b] where
|||x|||β ,[a,b] :=

kx(t) − x(s)k
< ∞.

Note that the space is not separable. However, the closure of C∞ ([a, b], Rd ) in the β −
Holder norm denoted by C0,β −Hol ([a, b], Rd ) is a separable space (see [8, Theorem
5.31, p. 96]), which can be defined as

Clearly, if x ∈ Cβ −Hol ([a, b], Rd ) then for all s,t ∈ [a, b] we have
kx(t) − x(s)k ≤ |||x|||β ,[a,b] |t − s|β .
Hence, for all p such that pβ ≥ 1 we have
|||x||| p-var,[a,b] ≤ |||x|||β ,[a,b] (b − a)β < ∞.

(7)

In particular, C1/p-Hol ([a, b], Rd ) ⊂ C p−var ([a, b], Rd ).
For a, b, c ∈ R such that a < b < c and x ∈ Cβ -Hol ([a, c], Rd ), it is easy to see that

|||x|||β ,[a,c] ≤ |||x|||β ,[a,b] + |||x|||β ,[b,c] .
Now consider x ∈ Cβ -Hol ([a, b], Rd ) and ω ∈ Cν -Hol ([a, b], R) with β + ν > 1. Then

by (7), x ∈ C β ([a, b], Rd ) and ω ∈ C ν -var ([a, b], R), thus it is well known that the

2 Existence, uniqueness and continuity of the solution
Since δ ν + ν > 1, there exists β < ν such that

β + ν > β δ + ν > 1.
By choosing a smaller ν ′ ∈ ( 12 , ν ) if necessary, we can always assume without loss
of generality that ω ∈ C0,ν −Hol ([0, T ], R). System (1) would then be considered for
η ∈ Cβ −Hol ([−r, 0], Rd ), i.e. we consider the equation
dx(t) = f (xt )dt + g(xt )d ω (t),

which proves (11).
Remark 1. The lemma is not true if we replace the Hölder continuous space by
p−variation bounded space. Namely, if a function x belongs to C p−var ([a − r, b], Rd ),
it does not follow that its translation function x· belongs to C p−var ([a, b],Cr ) with p ≥
1. As a counterexample, consider the function x(t) = |t|β , t ∈ [−1, 1], β p < 1 then
x ∈ C p−var ([−1, 1], R). However, with the partition Π = 0 < 1n < 2n < · · · < n−1

This shows that x. is not of bounded p−variation.
Lemma 2. Assume that g satisfies the condition (Hg ). If x ∈ Cβ −Hol ([a − r, b], Rd )
then g(x. ) ∈ Cβ −Hol ([a, b], Rd ) and
|||g(x. )|||β ,[a,b] ≤ Lg |||x|||β ,[a−r,b] .

Proof. The proof is directed from the Lipschitz continuity of g and Lemma 1.

Lemma 4. If x, y ∈ Cβ −Hol ([a − r, b], Rd ) are such that kxk∞,β ,[a−r,b], kyk∞,β ,[a−r,b] ≤

(14)
Proof. First, observe that

(17)

We can now state the theorem on existence and uniqueness of solution of system
(1).
Theorem 1. Assume that (H f ) and (Hg ) are satisfied. If η ∈ Cβ −Hol ([−r, 0], Rd )
then there exists a unique solution to the equation (9) in Cβ −Hol ([−r, T ], Rd ). Moreover, the solution is ν −Hölder continuous on [0, T ].
Proof. The proof is divided into several steps.

Luu Hoang Duc and Phan Thanh Hong

Step 1: For any a < b in [0, T ], one first proves that F is a mapping from
Cβ -Hol ([a − r, b], Rd ) into itself, or sufficiently
|||F(x)|||β ,[a,b] ≤ |||I(x)|||β ,[a,b] + |||J(x)|||β ,[a,b] < ∞.
With a ≤ s < t ≤ b, using assumption (H f ) and assigning L′ := max{L f , k f (0)k}
one has

hence
|||I(x)|||β ,[a,b] ≤ L′ (b−a)1−β (1+kxk∞,[a−r,b]) ≤ L′ (b−a)1−β (1+kxk∞,β ,[a−r,b]) < ∞.
On the other hand, using Lemma 2 with K =

By Proposition 5.28 of [8], there exists a subsequence ynk 1[t0 ,t1 ] which converges in
Cβ -Hol ([t0 ,t1 ], Rd ). Additionally, for all k, ynk (t) = η (t), ∀t ∈ [t0 − r,t0 ], hence
kynk − ynk′ k∞,β ,[t0 −r,t1 ] = kynk − ynk′ k∞,β ,[t0 ,t1 ] → 0 as k, k′ → ∞.
Since Cβ -Hol ([t0 − r,t1 ], Rd ) is Banach one concludes that there is a subsequence of
yn that converges in Cβ -Hol ([t0 − r,t1 ], Rd ).
To sum up, F : B → B is a compact operator on the closed ball of Banach space
Cβ -Hol ([t0 − r,t1 ], Rd ). By Schauder-Tychonoff fixed point theorem (see e.g [23,
Theorem 2.A, p. 56]), there exists a function x∗ ∈ B such that F(x∗ ) = x∗ , i.e x∗
is a local solution of (9) on [t0 − r,t1 ]. The fact that x∗ ∈ Cν -Hol ([t0 − r,t1 ], Rd ) is then
obvious.
Step 4: The local solution is unique.
Assuming that x and y are solutions to (9) on [t0 −r,t1 ] with the same initial condition
η , bounded by M > 0. Put z = x − y then F(x) − F(y) = z. By virtue of Lemma 4,

Construct similarly to Step 2 a finite sequence {si } on [t0 ,t1 ] such that s0 = t0 and

(26)

Consequently, |||z|||β ,[s0 ,s1 ] = 0. By induction, one can prove that |||z|||β ,[t0 ,t1 ] = 0.
Therefore, z(u) ≡ 0, ∀u ∈ [t0 − r,t1 ], i.e. x ≡ y on [t0 − r,t1 ].

Step 5: By induction, there exists a unique solution of (9) on each [ti − r,ti+1 ].
Finally, due to the unboundedness of {ti } the solution of (9) can be extended to the
whole [−r, T ] by concatenation.

where N(t, ω )-the number of stopping times (22) in (0,t], can be approximated by
(23).
Proof. From the proof of Theorem 1, in particular (18) and (24), it follows that for
any i ≥ 0
kxk∞,β ,[ti −r,t] ≤ kxk∞,β ,[ti −r,ti ] + µ (1 + kxk∞,β ,[ti−r,t] ), ∀t ∈ [ti ,ti+1 ].

Denote by x(·, ω , η ) the solution of (1) with initial function η . We prove in the

Theorem 3. Under the assumptions of Theorem 1, the solution xt (·, ω , η ) is continuous with respect to η .

Proof. For any η 1 , η 2 ∈ Cβ -Hol ([−r, 0], Rd ) denote xi (·) = x(·, ω , η i ), i = 1, 2. Fix
η 1 , by (27) one can choose M large enough such that kx(·, ω , η 2 )k∞,β ,[−r,T] ≤ M
for all η 2 such that kη 2 − η 1 k∞,β ,[−r,0] ≤ 1. From (14) in Lemma 4, one has for all

which has the form (32) with A = 0 and C = L(T, M). Therefore,

kxt (·, ω , η 2 )−xt (·, ω , η 1 )k∞,β ,[−r,0] ≤ e−[N(t,ω )+1] log(1−2µ ) kη 1 − η 2 k∞,β ,[−r,0], ∀t ∈ [0, T ],
in which N(t, ω ) is defined in (23) with C = L(T, M) and µ < min{1/2, L(T, M)}
and N depends on L(T, M) - the local constant in the vicinity of η . That proves the
continuity of xt (·, ω , η ) w.r.t. the initial function η .
Remark 3. It can be seen that for x ∈ Cβ −Hol ([−r, T ], Rd ) there exists C(T, r) such
that
kx(·)k∞,β ,[−r,T] ≤ C(T, r) sup kxt (·)k∞,β ,[−r,0].
t∈[0,T ]

Indeed, since kx(·)k∞,[−r,T ] = supt∈[0,T ] kxt (·)k∞,[−r,0] , for s,t ∈ [−r, T ] one can construct a finite sequence si as follow: s = s0 , s1 = s0 + r, s2 = s1 + r, . . . , until sn + r ≥ t
and assign sn+1 := t. Then

Repeat the arguments in Theorem 1, one can prove the existence of solution to
(35). Since G is linear, the uniqueness of the solution is derived by a contraction
mapping argument. Finally, it is obvious that the solution depends linearly on the
initial function.
