1. Introduction
Let H be the upper half-plane with the Poincaré metric ds2 = y −2 (dx2 + dy 2 ).
A cofinite group is a discrete group Γ ⊂ PSL(2, R) with noncompact fundamental
domain F whose area |F | with respect to the invariant measure dµ = y −2 dx dy is
finite. In what follows, we only deal with cofinite groups Γ.
The Laplace operator ∆ = y 2 (∂x2 + ∂y2 ) extends to be a self-adjoint operator
on L2 (F, dµ) with continuous spectrum covering the interval [1/4, ∞) and with discrete spectrum {λn } (∆ϕn + λn ϕn = 0, 0 = λ0 < λ1 6 λ2 6 · · · , ϕn ∈ L2 (F, dµ)).
Little is known about the structure of the discrete spectrum. In particular, it is
not known for what groups Γ this spectrum is infinite.
Selberg posed the following question: what cofinite groups Γ satisfy the Weyl
formula

Nowadays, such groups are said to be essentially cuspidal. Formula (1.1) has been
proved for a number of groups (see [1–4]), in particular, for the congruence subgroups of SL(2, Z). However, all these groups correspond to nongeneric points in
the Teichmüller space. Roelke (e.g., see [1]) conjectured that NΓ (T 2 + 1/4) → ∞
as T → ∞.
The interest in these questions arose in connection with the papers [5, 6]. These
papers, as well as [7–9], provide a number of sufficient conditions for the Weyl
law (1.1) to be violated. Based on these results, Sarnak [2] conjectured that neither
the Weyl law nor even the Roelke conjecture holds for generic cofinite groups Γ.
One main approach to studying the spectrum {λn } is based on the Selberg
formula, and all the results of the present paper are corollaries of this formula.

D. A. POPOV

The Selberg formula for cofinite groups is given in Sec. 2. Symbolically, it can
be written as


X
1
,
λn = rn2 +
(1.2)
h(rn ) = ΦΓ [h|{λn }, {N (P )}, ϕ]
∀ h ∈ {h}S
4
n>0

where ΦΓ is a functional on the space {h}S (see Sec. 2). The functional ΦΓ depends
on the spectrum {λn }, the set {N (P )} of norms of hyperbolic conjugacy classes, the
function ϕ defined by ϕ(s) = det Φ(s) (where Φ(s) is the scattering matrix), and
finitely many parameters such as |F |, the number of elliptic and parabolic classes,
tr Φ(1/2), etc. The Selberg formula for a cocompact group Γ reads
X
(1.3)
h(rn ) = ΦΓ [h|{λn }, {N (P )}].
n>0

It was shown in [10] that, for strictly hyperbolic groups, the Selberg formula (supplemented by an additional condition on the function h) implies that the spectrum {λn } satisfies equations of the form
X
e Γ [h|{λn }}].
(1.4)
h(rn ) = Φ
n>0

One aim of the present paper is to generalize this result to arbitrary cofinite groups.
We show (Theorem 1) that the following analog of formula (1.4) holds:
X
e Γ [h|{λn }, {sα }].
(1.5)
h(rn ) = Φ
n>0

Here {sα } is the set of poles sα = βα + iγα of ϕ such that βα < 1/2 and γα 6= 0.
This set will be called the resonance spectrum.
We take various functions h and obtain relations that should be satisfied by
the discrete spectrum and the resonance spectrum. In Sec. 6, we compute the
e Γ [h|{λn }, {sα }] as t → 0 for the case of h(r) = e−tr2 (r2 + p2 )−1
asymptotics of Φ
and use this asymptotics to prove the Roelke conjecture (Theorem 2).
Note that if Γ = SL(2, Z), then sα = ρα /2, where the ρα are the nontrivial
zeros of the Riemann zeta function, and formulas (1.5) specify relations between
the sets {λn } and {ρα }.
A preliminary version of Theorem 1, containing a number of inaccuracies, was
published in [11]. The second theorem in [11], which gave some sufficient conditions
for thePRoelke conjecture to be true, was based on the assumption that the series
DΓ = sα |sα |−2 converges for any group Γ. I am grateful to the referee of [11] for
pointing out that this assumptions has never been proved and is most likely false.
2. Preliminaries

This section provides some insight into the Selberg formula for cofinite groups
and introduces notation to be used in the paper. All the information given here
can be found in [1, 3, 12–17].
Throughout the paper, we assume that the functions h( · ) belong to the class {h}S ,
that is, satisfy the following conditions:
1. h(r) = h(−r).
2. The function h is holomorphic in the strip {| Im r| 6 1/2 + ε, ε > 0}.
3. In this strip, one has |h(r)| = O(1 + |r|2 )−1−ε (|r| → ∞).

The eigenvalues λn in the interval 0 6 λn < 1/4 are said to be exceptional; the
number M of such eigenvalues is finite. For the exceptional eigenvalues, one has

The eigenvalues λn > 1/4 will be numbered by a subscript j, so that λj = 1/4 + rj2 ,
rj > 0.
When considering the Selberg formula, we restrict ourselves to the case of the
trivial one-dimensional representation χ : Γ → C, χ(γ) = 1, ∀ γ ∈ Γ. Then the
Selberg formula reads
X
(2.3)
h(rn ) = H[h] + SR [h] + SP [g] + P[h|ϕ]

for every h ∈ {h}S and determines the form of the functional ΦΓ (1.2).
Let us give the definitions of the objects occurring on the right-hand side in (2.3).

transformation z → N (P )z, N (P ) > 1, P = P0k (k > 1), where P is an arbitrary
hyperbolic class and N (P ) = N (P0 )k . In what follows, we write

(2.9)

n is the number of primitive parabolic conjugacy classes (the number of pairwise
nonequivalent parabolic points in F ), and Γ( · ) is the gamma function.
The properties of ϕ are described in [1,3,12,17]. This is a meromorphic function
satisfying the functional equations
(2.10)

ϕ(s) = ϕ(s̃),

ϕ(s)ϕ(1 − s) = 1,

where the tilde stands for complex conjugation. The function ϕ is holomorphic in
the half-plane Re s > 1/2 except for finitely many poles on the interval (1/2, 1]. The
poles sα of ϕ with Re sα < 1/2 lie in the strip 1 − µ0 < Re s < 1/2 symmetrically
with respect to the real axis, and

Throughout the following, Greek subscripts are used to number the poles of ϕ.
The Selberg zeta function Z( · ) for cofinite groups is defined in the same way as
for cocompact groups; for Re s > 1, one has
Z(s) =

∞
Y Y

[1 − N (P0 )−k−s ].

{P0 } k=1

This function has an analytic continuation into the entire plane of the variable
s = σ + it as a meromorphic function and satisfies a functional equation of the
form Z(1 − s) = A(s)Z(s). An explicit expression for the factor A(s) can be
found in the papers [1, 12], which give a complete description of all the zeros and
poles of Z, their multiplicities being indicated. Let us present this description and
simultaneously introduce a numbering to be used for the nontrivial zeros of the
Selberg zeta function.
The nontrivial zeros of Z( · ) are
1. The zeros sj on the critical line Re s = 1/2. They are arranged symmetrically
with respect to the real axis, and one has the corresponding eigenvalues
λj = sj (1 − sj ),

sj = 1/2 + rj

(j > 0).

2. The zeros sm ∈ (0, 1), m = 1, . . . , M1 . They are arranged symmetrically with
respect to the point s = 1/2, and one has the corresponding eigenvalues
λm = sm (1 − sm ),

sm = σm .

3. The zeros
sα = βα + iγα ,

1 − µ0 < βα < 1/2,

SELBERG FORMULA FOR COFINITE GROUPS

5

at the poles of the function ϕ (2.9). These zeros are arranged symmetrically with
respect to the real axis.
4. The zeros sν = σν , 1/2 < σν 6 1, ν = 0, 1, . . . , M2 − 1, at the poles of ϕ. One
has the corresponding eigenvalues λν = σν (1 − σν ) (ν 6= 0) and λ0 = 0 (σ0 = 1).
The poles of Z( · ) lie at the points s = −l + 1/2, l = 0, 1, . . . , and the trivial zeros
of Z( · ) lie at the points s = −l, l = 0, 1, . . . .
The numbers λm , λν , and λj exhaust the whole discrete spectrum, and so {λn } =
{λm } ∪ {λν } ∪ {λj }.
3. Explicit formula for SP [g]
In analytic number theory, the term explicit formulas refers to formulas representing the object of study by a series over zeros and poles of the corresponding
analytic function. The main example is given by the explicit formula representing
the Chebyshev function Ψ( · ) by a series over the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann
zeta function. In our setting, the function (see [14, 15])
ΛΓ (P ) =

(3.1)

ln N (P0 )
1 − N (P )−1

is an analog of the Mangoldt function Λ( · ), and
X
ΛΓ (P )
(3.2)
ΨΓ (x) =

is the corresponding analog of the Chebyshev function. Based on the results in [15,
16], let us present a definitive version of an explicit formula for the function
Z x
ΨΓ (ξ) dξ.
(3.3)
ΨΓ1 (x) =

The first two terms on the right-hand side in (3.4) are the sum of residues of the

The residues at the points s = 0, −1 must be considered separately (see [15]), and
their contribution is included in ΨΓ1,0 (x). This function includes the contributions

We differentiate, change the order of summation and integration, and then pass to
the limit as R → ∞, thus obtaining the desired result. The proof of Lemma 1 is

Formally, one can obtain Eq. (3.14) by substituting an explicit function for ΨΓ1 (x)
(see [16]) into (3.18) with subsequent integration by parts and changing the order

Note that if we use the estimate (3.9), then the entire derivation remains valid

Lemma 3 ((an explicit formula for P[h|ϕ])). For every cofinite group Γ, one has
(4.13)

P[h|ϕ] = J1 [h|ϕ] + ∆P[h|ϕ] + J0 [h|ϕ].

Here J1 [h|ϕ] is defined in (4.12), ∆P[h|ϕ] is defined in (4.2), and J0 [h|ϕ] is defined
in (4.9).
Proof. The proof amounts to the substitution of the right-hand sides of (4.8)
and (4.12) into (4.3). The series J1 [h|ϕ] converges in view of (4.13).

One derives Eq. (5.1) from (3.20) by twice integrating by parts. The absolute
convergence of the series SP1 [g|∆] and SP2 [g|ϕ] follows from (2.11) and the conP

vergence of the series (α) γα−3 and rj >0 rj−3 . To prove the convergence of the
series SP3 [g|ϕ], it suffices to integrate by parts. Now the convergence of the series W [g] follows from formula (5.1).
The proof of Lemma 4 is complete.

proof of Theorem 1 is complete.

Note that it follows from
P(5.3), (5.4), and (5.5) that the contribution of the
discrete spectrum {λn } to n>0 h(rn ) is determined by the behavior of g(y) for
y > b, while the contribution of the resonance spectrum {sα } is determined by the
behavior of g(y) for y 6 b.
6. Proof of the Roelke conjecture
The proof of the Roelke conjecture is based on an analysis of the asymptotics as
t → 0 of the expressions on the right-hand side in (5.6) for the case in which
2

(6.1)

h(r) = h(r, p) =

(p > 1/2).

Throughout the following, h(r) = h(r, p) and g(y) = g(y, p) in (2.1). The dependence of the objects in question on p will be indicated explicitly. By Ci we
denote various constants independent of p. We write A(t, p) = Op (tk ) if A(t, p) =
C(p)O(tk ) (t → 0) and A(t, p) = R(t, p) if A(t, p) = C0 (p) + C1 (p)t + C2 (p)t2 + · · ·
(t → 0). By Fi (t) we denote functions independent of p such that Fi (t) 6 Ci . The
constants Ci and Ci (p), as well as the functions Fi (t), may be different in different
formulas.

Let us proceed to the proof of the Roelke conjecture. V. A. Bykovskii noticed to
me that, given Eq. (6.2), to prove the Roelke conjecture it suffices to consider the

In this case, the left hand side of (6.43) becomes an analytic function of t. At the
same tine, both the formula (6.2) for B(t, p) and (6.44) imply that the asymptotic
expansion of the right hand side of (6.43) contains the terms

The explicit expressions for the coefficients dn in (6.44) can be derived, and it
follows that d2 > d1 . Thus, the hypothesis about the finiteness of the spectrum
leads to the contradiction. Theorem 2 is proved.

We omit its proof. We only note that it approves with the result of [17, Theorem 11.1].

Remark. We point out that the left-hand side of (6.43) is the sum n>0 h(rn ) +
P
(α) h(γα ). For rn ≫ p, the same sum is on the left-hand side in (6.2) (see
also (6.43) when rm → +∞).. Such a symmetry ({rn } ↔ {γα }) apparently holds
for a fairly broad class of functions h ∈ {h}S . This symmetry is related to the fact
that the sum SP3 [g|ϕ] (5.5) contains a term of the form

I am grateful to the anonymous referees, whose remarks helped me eliminate a
number of inaccuracies contained in earlier versions of the paper and M.A. Korolev
for the help.
