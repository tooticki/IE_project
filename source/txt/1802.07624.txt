Abstract. We give another proof of the existence of the endoscopic transfer for
unitary Lie algebras and its compatibility with Fourier transforms. By the work of
Kazhdan and Vashavsky in [9], this implies the corresponding endoscopic fundamental
lemma (theorem of Laumon–Ngô). We study the compatibility between Fourier transforms and transfers and we prove that the compatibility in the Jacquet-Rallis setting
implies the compatibility in the endoscopic setting for unitary groups.

1. Introduction
In [1] and [2], Waldspurger states a conjecture that the Langlands-Shelstad endoscopic
transfer on Lie algebras always exists and is preserved by Fourier transforms:
Conjecture 1.1. Let F be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero, G a
reductive group over F and H its endoscopic group. Let g and h be the Lie algebras of
G and H.

1. For any f ∈ Cc∞ (g), there exists a transfer f H ∈ Cc∞ (h).
2. Take compatible Fourier transforms FG and FH on g and h. There exists a constant
c such that whenever f H is a transfer of f , then FH (f H ) is a transfer of cFG (f ).
Waldspurger shows in [2] that conjecture 1.1 follows from the fundamental lemma. In
this paper, we consider the case when G = U(W ) and H = U(Wa ) × U (Wb ). We give
another proof of conjecture 1.1 in this case without using the fundamental lemma. Here
W, Wa , Wb are Hermitian spaces for a quadratic extension E over F .
In [9], Kazhdan and Varshavsky have shown that the fundamental lemma is also
implied by conjecture 1.1. So our paper can also be regraded as another proof of the
fundamental lemma.
We explain the idea of our proof. The key theorem is an identity between nilpotent
orbit integrals in the Jacquet-Rallis setting. Let E/F be a quadratic extension of nonarchimedean local fields of characteristic zero, V a vector space over F of dimension n,
and W0 , W1 the two isomorphism classes of Hermitian spaces of dimension n for E/F .
The Jacquet-Rallis transfer is transfer between f ∈ Cc∞ (gl(V ) × V × V ∗ ) and a pair
(f0 , f1 ) where fi ∈ Cc∞ (u(Wi ) × Wi ) such that their orbit integral in the regular semisimple matching orbits are the same. Here, the orbit is taken for the diagonal action of
GL(V ) on gl(V ) × V × V ∗ and the diagonal action of U(Wi ) on u(Wi ) × Wi . See section
2 for more details.
Given matching functions, we prove the following (theorem 4.7):

U(Wx )/Tδx

We shall explain in a vague way what these mean. On the right side, the summation
of x is a summation over H 1 (F, Tγ ). For each x, we defines an element δx that is stable
conjugate to δ. When x varies, δx gives all the conjugacy classes in the stable conjugacy
class of δ. For each Λ, we define a character hΛ, ·i on H 1 (F, Tγ ). For each character κ
of H 1 (F, Tγ ), we can find a unique Λ such that hΛ, xi = κ(x). Now on the left side, the
choice of Λ gives a γ-nilpotent orbit, and we have an orbit integral Orb(f, ·) along this
orbit. Therefore, the equation reduces any κ-orbits integrals to a single nilpotent orbit
integrals on gl(V ) × V × V ∗ . Using this equation for dimension n, a and b, we reduce
endoscopic identities to identities involving nilpotent orbit integrals on the general linear
side, which can be proved by parabolic induction.
Finally, to prove the above equation, the idea is to choose regular semisimple orbits
close to the nilpotent orbits. For each choice, we have an identity of orbit integrals of
matching functions. Then we take limit and subtract the equation from the limit. The
fact that the nilpotent orbit integrals appear in this limit is an consequence of the germ
expansion principle.
Since we are proving something that is already known, it is important to explain what
results we need to use. We need two ingredients.

ENDOSCOPIC TRANSFER FOR UNITARY LIE ALGEBRAS

The first ingredient is the existence of transfer and its compatibility with Fourier
transforms in the Jacquet-Rallis transfer (theorem 2.2, theorem 2.3). This is proved in
[4] by a purely local method without using the fundamental lemma.
The second ingredient is the existence of transfer and its compatibility with Fourier
transform in the Jacquet-Langlands transfer between inner forms of unitary Lie algebras
(theorem 3.12, theorem 3.13). This is a special case of conjecture 1.1 when G and H are
inner forms of unitary groups. This case is proved in [2] without any assumption because
fundamental lemmas between inner forms are trivial. Except for the Jacquet-Langlands
transfer, our proof is purely local. In particular, we do not reduce to positive characteristic cases. The same method also shows the fundamental lemma in the Jacquet-Rallis case
implies the fundamental lemma in the endoscopic case. Finally, it is interesting to see
whether the method of Kazhdan and Varshavsky can be applied directly to the JacquetRallis setting, thus yield another proof of the Jacquet-Rallis fundamental lemma. The
author hopes to return to this topic in the future.
Here is the structure of the paper. In section 2, we review basic facts about the
Jacquet-Rallis transfer. In section 3, we review basic facts about the endoscopic transfer
and work it out in details in the case of unitary Lie algebras. Then, we prove theorem
1.2 in section 4. Finally, we prove our main theorem in section 6.
Throughout this paper, we work over a non-archimedean local field F of characteristic
zero. And E will be a quadratic extension over F .

to thank Professor Hervé Jacquet for helpful discussions when preparing this paper.
2. Review of the Jacquet-Rallis transfer
In this section, we review the Jacquet-Rallis transfer. The main reference is [7].
2.1. General linear case. Let E/F be a quadratic extension of non-archimedean local
fields and we denote by χ the corresponding quadratic character of F × .
Let V be a vector space over F of dimension n. We denote by h , i the pairing between
V and V ∗ . Let Ad(g) be the adjoint action of g ∈ GL(V ) on gl(V ). For g ∈ GL(V ) and
v ∗ ∈ V ∗ , define v ∗ g by the formula
hv ∗ g, vi = hv ∗ , gvi.

Consider the following action of GL(V ) on gl(V ) × V × V ∗ :
g.(x, v, v ∗ ) = (Ad(g)x, gv, v ∗ g −1 ).

For (x, v, v ∗ ) ∈ gl(V ) × V × V ∗ and i = 0, ..., n − 1, define the following invariants:
ai = coefficient of ti in det(It − x),

Let {hv ∗ , xi+j vi}i,j

bi = hv ∗ , xi vi.
denote the matrix with (i, j) entries hv ∗ , xi+j vi. Define
∆(x, v, v ∗ ) = det({hv ∗ , xi+j vi}i,j ).

An element (x, v, v ∗ ) is called regular semisimple if its orbit is closed with maximal
dimension. It is known that (x, v, v ∗ ) is regular semisimple precisely when ∆(x, v, v ∗ ) 6= 0
(Theorem 6.1 in [7]). Also, two regular semisimple elements have the same invariants
precisely when they are in the same orbit (Prop. 6.2 in [7]).
Fix a Haar measuer dg on GL(V ), given a function f ∈ Cc∞ (gl(V ) × V × V ∗ ) and a
regular semisimple element (x, v, v ∗ ), we define its orbit integral

Later, we will need the following generized “nilpotent
Qmorbit integrals”. Fix x ∈ gl(V )
regular semisimple in the usual sense. Let F [x] = i=1 Fi , where each Fi is a field.
Write {1, ..., m} = S1 ∐ S2 . Here S1 consists of all i such that Fi + E and S2 consists

following property:
(1) For i ∈ S1 , exactly one of the vi and vi∗ is 0.
(2) When vi 6= 0, we require that {vi , xvi , x2 vi , ..., xdim Vi −1 vi } form a basis of Vi .
Similar condition applies when vi∗ 6= 0.
(3) For each i ∈ S2 , vi = vi∗ = 0.
These (x, v, v ∗ ) are not regular semisimple. We define its orbit integral in the following
way. In the special case when S2 = ∅, we define Orb(f, (x, v, v ∗ )) as

We use +1 if vi 6= 0 and −1 if vi∗ 6= 0. This definition makes sense because of the
following lemma:
Lemma 2.1. The inner integral over T1 in (2) converges when Re(s) > 0 and admits
meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane which at holomorphic at 0. Its
value at 0 is well defined as a locally constant and compactly supported function on
GL(V )/T .
Proof. In general, given a compactly supported function f on a local field F and χ a
unitary character of F × , the integral

converge for Re(s) > 0 and admits a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex
plane. When χ is nontrivial, the meromorphic continuation is holomorphic at 0.
Now to prove the lemma, it suffices to write f in (2) as a product of functions, then
the meromorphic continuation and being holomorphic at 0 are reduced to the above
statement.
If we change g to gt0 . The vaule of the inner integral in (2) after evaluating at s=0
does not change. So its a well defined function on GL(V )/T . Now since x is regular
semisimple, it is easy to check this function is locally constant and compactly supported.

2.2. Unitary case. As before, let E/F be a quadratic extension of non-archimedean
local fields. There are two isomorphism classes of non-degenerate Hermitian spaces
of dimension n for the extension E/F . They are distinguished by the determinant of
their Hermitian matrices as an element in F × /NmE/F (E × ). Let W be one of the two
Hermitian spaces. Let h , i be the Hermitian pairing and U(W ) the corresponding
unitary group over F . Throughout this paper, let u(W ) be the twisted Lie algebra of
U(Wi ) over F . Namely,
u(W ) = {x ∈ End(W )|hxu, vi = hu, xvi for all u, v ∈ W }.

Since we will never use the
√ usual Lie algebras of unitary groups, this notation will not
τ be a generator of the extension E/F , then multiplication
cause
any
confusion.
Let
√
by τ induces an isomorphism between u(W ) and the usual Lie algebras. We use the
twisted version to avoid this dependence on τ as our statements are more natural for the
twisted Lie algebra. In most cases, statements about Lie algebras are trivially equivalent
to the statements about twisted Lie algebras. And we will in general ignore justifications
of these equivalences.
We have an adjoint action of U(W ) on u(W ). Consider the action of U(W ) on u(W )×
W by
g.(x, w) = (Ad(g)x, gw).
For (x, w) ∈ u(W ) × W and i = 0, ..., n − 1, define the following invariants:
ai = coefficients of ti in det(It − x),
bi = hw, xi wi.

Take a basis of W and let H be the Hermitian matrix with respect to this basis.
Then x ∈ u(W ) implies xt H = Hx, equivalently H −1 xt H = x. Taking characteristic
polynomial of both sides, we deduce that ai ∈ F . Also
bi = hw, xi wi = hxi w, wi = hw, xi wi = bi .

So bi ∈ F as well.
Let {hw, xi+j wi}i,j denote the matrix with (i, j) entries hw, xi+j wi. Define
∆(x, w) = det({hw, xi+j wi}i,j ).

As in the general linear case, following the same proof as in [7], it can be seen that
(x, w) is regular semisimple precisely when ∆(x, w) 6= 0. Also, two regular semisimple
elements have the same invariants precisely when they are in the same orbit.
When (x, w) is regular semisimple, then {x, xw, x2 w, ..., xn−1 w} form a basis of W
and {hw, xi+j wi}i,j is the Hermitian matrix with respect to this basis. In particular,
χ(∆(x, w)) only depends on the isomorphism class of the Hermitian space W .
Fix a Haar measure dg on U(W ), given a function f ∈ Cc∞ (u(W ) × W ) and a regular
semisimple (x, w), we define the orbit integral
Z
f (Ad(g)x, gw)dg.
Orb(f, (x, w)) =
U(W )

2.3. The transfer. We first define the transfer of orbits. Given a regular semisimple
element in gl(V ) × V × V ∗ and a regular semisimple element in u(W ) × W , they match
if their invariants ai and bi are the same for i = 0, ..., n − 1. Here n = dimV = dimW .
Notice that this definition only involves regular semisimple elements.
Let W0 and W1 represent the two isomorphism classes of Hermitian spaces of dimension n. It is proved in [6] that matching orbits gives a bijection between regular
semisimple orbits in gl(V ) × V × V ∗ and the disjoint union of the regular semisimple
orbits in u(Wi ) × Wi (i = 0, 1).
Now we define the transfer of functions. The Jacquet-Rallis transfer of functions is a
transfer between f ∈ Cc∞ (gl(V )×V ×V ∗ ) and a pair {f0 , f1 }, where fi ∈ Cc∞ (u(Wi )×Wi )
for i = 0, 1.
We shall define f and {f0 , f1 } are transfers if for all the matching orbits (x, v, v ∗ ) and
(y, w) where (y, w) ∈ u(Wi ) × Wi , the following identity is satisfied:
ω(x, v, v ∗ )Orb(f, (x, v, v ∗ )) = Orb(fi , (y, w)).
Here ω(x, v, v ∗ ) is the transfer factor defined as follows. Fix a generator Ω of ∧top V ,
ω(x, v, v ∗ ) = χ(v ∧ xv ∧ ... ∧ xn−1 v/Ω).

(3)

Notice that ω is independent of v ∗ . We have the following theorem:
Theorem 2.2 (Existence of Transfers). For any f ∈ Cc∞ (gl(V ) × V × V ∗ ), there exists
a transfer {f0 , f1 }. Conversely, for any pair {f0 , f1 }, there exists a transfer f .
Now consider Fourier transforms. Fix an additive character ψ of F .
In the general linear case, we consider the non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form
tr(XY ) on gl(V ). Fix an additive Haar measure dY on gl(V ). For any f ∈ Cc∞ (gl(V ) ×
V × V ∗ ), we define the patial Fourier transfer on the gl(V ) factor as
Z
∗
f (Y, v, v ∗ )ψ(tr(XY ))dY.
F1 (f )(X, v, v ) =
gl(V )

In the unitary case, we consider the non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form tr(XY )
on u(W ). We check that tr(XY) takes value in F : Take a basis of W and let H denote the
Hermitian matrix with respect to this basis. Then X, Y ∈ u(W ) implies H −1 X t H = X
and H −1 Y t H = Y . Hence H −1 X t Y t H = XY . This implies tr(XY ) takes value in F .
Fix an additive Haar measure dY on u(W ). For any f ∈ Cc∞ (u(W ) × W ), define

u(W )

Theorem 2.3 (Fourier Transform). Let n = dimV = dimW . There exists a constant
c independent of the matching functions, such that if f and {f0 , f1 } are transfers, then
cF1 (f ) and {F1 (f0 ), (−1)n−1 F1 (f1 )} are transfers.
The similar theorem for Fourier transforms on the V × V ∗ (resp. W ) factor are also
true. But we only need the above theorem in this paper.
Proof of theorem 2.2 and theorem 2.3. Both theorem 2.2 and theorem 2.3 are proved in
[4]. We remark that both proofs are local and do not rely on the fundamental lemma.
However, the factor (−1)n−1 in theorem 2.3 is missed in [4]. We shall explain now why
there is a (−1)n−1 factor. We shall use freely the notation in section 4 of [4].
The theorem we cite here is the Bn part of theorem 4.17 in [4]. It is proved along with
the An part and Cn part by induction. For each Cn , there is a −1 missing, which by
induction, gives (−1)n−1 for the Bn . The −1 is missing from Cn because of the equation
(4.30) in [4]. It claims
κη (w, w′ ) = λκ(wi , wi′ ).
This is proved by reducing it to the identity of Kloosterman sums (theorem 4.12 [4]).
However, in this reduction, different Wi gives a ±1. The correct version is
κη (w, w′ ) = ±λκ(wi , wi′ ).
where one finds +1 if i = 0 and −1 if i = 1.



Finally, we state the fundamental lemma. However, we will not need this later in this
paper. Suppose E/F is unramified. Let OE and OF be their rings of intergers.
In the general linear side, take V = F n , consider the characteristic function 1k of the
set Mn (OF ) × OFn × OFn ⊂ gl(V ) × V × V ∗ .
In the unitary side, take W0 = E n with the split Hermitian form h , i defined by the
anti-diagonal matrix H with all entries 1. Consider the characteristic function 1k0 of the
n . Let p be the residue characteristic of F .
set u(W0 )(OE ) × OE
Conjecture 2.4 (Fundamental Lemma). When p is odd, 1k and {1k0 , 0} are transfers.
Remark. The conjecture is known when p is large enough. This is proved in [11] by Z.
Yun in the positive characteristic case, extended to characteristic zero by J. Gordon in
the appendix to [11]. It is not known for small p.
3. Endoscopic transfer
In this section, we review the endoscopic transfer in unitary Lie algebras.

3.1. Generality on endoscopy. The main reference for this section is [9]. Let F be a
non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero, and G a reductive group over F .
Definition 3.1. An endoscopic triple of G is a triple (H, s, η). Here H is a quasi-split
b and η is an embedding of the
group over F, s is a regular semisimple element in G,
b
b
complex algebraic groups: H ֒→ G. The triple has to satisfy the following conditions:
b is the identity component of the centralizer of s in G.
b
• η(H)
• The conjugacy class of η is Galois equivariant.
b
• η −1 (s) is fixed by the Galois action on H.

The endoscopic triple are designed to compare κ-orbit integrals on G with stable orbit
integrals on H. To state this, we recall the matching of stable conjugacy classes and the
transfer of functions. We review this in several steps. In the following, let (H, s, η) be
an endoscopic triple of G. We denote by G the base change of G to the algebraic closure
of F , G(F )r.s. the regular semisimple elements and g the Lie algebras of G. Similar
notations apply to other algebraic groups.
• For any embedding of an F -torus T into G as a maximal torus, there is a Galois

maximal tori. The two embeddings of T match if the corresponding map Tb ֒→ H

and T ֒→ G are conjugate after applying the emmbeding η : H ֒→ G.
• Let γ H ∈ H(F )r.s. and γ ∈ G(F )r.s. . Then γ H and γ match if there exist an
F -torus T , two matching embeddings T ֒→ G and T ֒→ H and an element
γ0 ∈ T (F ), such that γ0 maps to γ H and γ by the two embeddings.
• Let xH ∈ h(F )r.s. and x ∈ g(F )r.s. . Then xH and x match if there exist an
F -torus T , two matching embeddings T ֒→ G and T ֒→ H and an element x0 ∈
t(F ), such that x0 maps to xH and x by the differentials of the two embeddings.

Remark. It is easy to see that the matching between embeddings to maximal F-tori and
regular semisimple elements is a matching between stable conjugacy classes in G and H.
Let G∗ be the quasi split inner form of G. Every embedding T ֒→ H has a matching
T ֒→ G∗ . This is not true for G. An element xH ∈ h(F )r.s. is G∗ -regular semisimple if
it matches a regular semisimple element x∗ in g∗ (F ).
Definition 3.2. Let f H ∈ Cc∞ (h(F )) and f ∈ Cc∞ (g(F )). Then f H and f match if the
following conditions are satisfied (see below for definitions of these terms):
∗
1) For any matching orbits xH ∈ h(F )G −r.s. and x ∈ g(F )r.s. , we have the identity:
OrbSt (f H , xH ) = ∆(xH , x)Orbκ (f, x).

(4)
G∗ −r.s.

2) If there does not exist x ∈ g(F )r.s. that matches xH ∈ h(F )

, then

OrbSt (f H , xH ) = 0.

We explain these terms. The stable orbit integral of f H at xH is defined as:

Orb(f H , xH

H
where xH
i run through the conjugacy classes in h that are stable conjugagte to x .
Let T = CG (x) and t be the Lie algebra of T . The conjugacy classes in g that are
stable conjugate to x is a torsor over ker(H 1 (F, T ) → H 1 (F, G)). Therefore for x1 and
x2 that are stable conjugate to x, we can define inv(x1 , x2 ) ∈ ker(H 1 (F, T ) → H 1 (F, G))
as the element that maps x1 to x2 .
The character κ is a character of this group. It is canonically defined by the endoscopic
triple (H, s, η) via Tate-Nakayama isomorphism.

Theorem 3.3 (Tate-Nakayama Isomorphism [12]). Let F be a non-archimedean local
field and T a F-torus. Then the Galois cohomology group H 1 (F, T ) is canonically isomorphic to the quotient of
{x ∈ X∗ (T )|tr(x) = 0}
by its subgroup generated by

{σx − x|σ ∈ Gal(F /F ), x ∈ X∗ (T )}.
b is equipped with a canonical
We now explain how κ is defined. The dual group H
maximal torus THb . The torus THb has a Galois action and s ∈ THb is invariant under
this action. There is an isomorphism X∗ (T ) ≃ X ∗ (THb ) well defined up to conjugation
by elements in the Weyl group of H. Since s gives a character of X ∗ (THb ), via this
isomorphism, s also defines a character of X∗ (T ). The resulting character κ is independent of the choice of the isomorphism since s lies in the center of H. Now κ is trivial
on {σx − x|σ ∈ Gal(F /F ), x ∈ X∗ (T )} since s is invariant under the Galois action on
THb and the Galois actions on THb and T differ by an element in the Weyl group of H.
Finally, by Tate-Nakayama isomorphism, κ is a character of H 1 (F, T ).
The κ-orbit integrals are then defined as
Orbκ (f, x) =

X

Orb(f, xi )κ(inv(x, xi ))

xi ∼x

where xi run through the conjugacy classes in g that are stable conjugagte to x.
Finally, ∆(xH , x) is the Langlands-Shelstad transfer factor. It is defined as a function
∗
on hG −r.s ×gr.s. such that ∆(x, y) is not zero if and only if x and y match. The definition
of ∆(xH , x) is delicate and we will omit here. We only remark that if one change x and
y to x′ and y ′ that are stably conjugate, then ∆(x, y) and ∆(x′ , y ′ ) are changed by
multiplying κ(inv(y, y ′ )). This is evident from equation (4).
We have the following theorem regrading transfer of functions:
Theorem 3.4 (Existence of Transfers). For any f ∈ Cc∞ (g), there exists f1 ∈ Cc∞ (h)
matches f .
Now consider Fourier transforms. Fix an additive character ψ : F → C× . Fix a Ginvariant non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form h , i on g. Define the Fourier transform
F on Cc∞ (g) as follows:

ENDOSCOPIC TRANSFER FOR UNITARY LIE ALGEBRAS

F(f )(x) =

f (y)ψ(hx, yi)dy.

g

It can be shown the G-invariant bilinear form canonically gives a H-invariant nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on h, hence a Fourier transform F on Cc∞ (h). (VIII.6
of [1])
Theorem 3.5 (Fourier Transform). There exists a constant c independent of the matching functions, such that if f ∈ Cc∞ (g) and f1 ∈ Cc∞ (h) match, then cF(f ) and F(f1 )
also match.
Remark. The constant c are given explicitly in [2]. It equals the quotient of the Weil
indexes of h and g. We will come back to this in section 3.4.
Proof of theorem 3.4 and theorem 3.5. Both theorem 3.4 and theorem 3.5 are deduced
in [2] from the fundamental lemma. In our paper, for the case of unitary groups, we
are going to deduce theorem 3.4 (resp. theorem 3.5) from theorem 2.2 (resp. theorem
2.3).

Finally, there are fundamental lemmas assertion characteristic functions of hyperspecial maximal compact match when H and G are unramified. We omit the details since
we do not need it in this paper.
3.2. Stable conjugacy classes in unitary Lie algebras. In this part, we study stable
conjugacy in unitary Lie algebras.
Let W be a non-degenerate Hermitian space for the extension E/F . Recall that we
denote by u(W ) the twisted Lie algebras:
u(W ) = {x ∈ End(W )|hxu, vi = hu, xvi for all u, v ∈ W }.
Let δ be a regular semisimple Q
element in u(W ). The characteristic polynomial
N of δ
m
has coefficients
in F . Let F [δ] = i=1 Fi , where
Q
` each Fi is a field. Set Ei = E F Fi ,
so E[δ] = m
E
.
Finally,
let
{1,
...,
m}
=
S
S2 with S1 = {i|Fi + E}.

i=1
The following proposition computes the stable conjugacy of δ in the classical setting.
PropositionQ
3.6. The centralizer Tδ of δ in U(W ) equals U(1)(E[δ]× /F [δ]× ). We have
1
H (F, Tδ ) = S1 Z/2Z. And the conjugacy class in the stable conjugacy class of δ is
canonically a torsor of


Y
ker(H 1 (F, Tδ ) → H 1 (F, U(W ))) = ker  Z/2Z → Z/2Z
S1

where all the map from Z/2Z to Z/2Z are identity.

Proof. For any α ∈ E[δ], let α be the conjugation of α by the unique nontrivial automorphism for the extension E[δ]/F [δ]. The identities hδw1 , w2 i = hw1 , δw2 i and hcw1 , w2 i =
hw1 , cw2 i (c ∈ E) together imply that for any α ∈ E[δ], hαw1 , w2 i = hw1 , αw2 i.
Since Centralizer of δ in GL(W ) equals E[δ]× , centralizer of δ in U(W ) equals {α ∈
E[δ]× |hαw1 , αw2 i = hw1 , w2 i}. But hαw1 , αw2 i = hααw1 , w2 i. Hence the centralizer
equals U(1)(E[δ]× /F [δ]× ).

Now, a simple computation shows H 1 (F,
Q U(1)(Ei /Fi )) is trivial if Fi ⊇ E and equals
1
Z/2Z if Fi + E. Therefore H (F, Tδ ) = S1 Z/2Z. The rest of the proposition follows
from standard results on stable conjugacy.

In our setting, it is more natural to consider not only the conjugacy class in u(W ),
but also its Jacquet-Langlands transfer on the other Hermitian space. So let W0 and W1
be the representatives of the two isomorphism classes of Hermitian spaces of dimension
n. For δi ∈ u(Wi ), we shall say δ0 and δ1 are Jacquet-Langlands transfers if they
become conjugate in the algebraic closure F of F . When δ0 and δ1 are transfers, they
are conjugate over F . This conjugation defines an isomorphism between F [δ0 ] and
F [δ1 ], which is independent of the conjugation we choose. In particular Tδ0 and Tδ1 are
canonically isomorphic.
We warn the reader that even when n is odd, so u(W0 ) and u(W1 ) are abstractly
isomorphic, we still distinguish them as two different Lie algebras. In fact, they are
different as pure inner forms.
Now fix a stable conjugacy class δ ∈ u(W0 ). Let S be the union of the conjugacy
classes in u(W0 ) that are stable conjugate to δ and the conjugacy classes in u(W1 ) that
′
′
are Jacquet-Langlands transfers of δ. For any δ ∈ S, let T be the centralizer of δ .
′
Different choices of δ define T that are canonically isomorphic to each other.
We want to show S is naturally a torsor over H 1 (F, T ). We start with the case when
m = 1, namely F [δ] = F1 is a field.
Proposition 3.7. Let m = 1. When F1 ⊇ E, then dimW is even and S is a single
point belongs to the split Hermitian space. When F1 + E, then S consists of two points,
with one point for each Hermitian space.
N
Proof. Let E1 = E F F1 . To find whether S contains element in u(Wi ), we need to
compute the determinant of any Hermitian structure on E1 such that δ ∈ u(E1 ). Given
such an Hermitian form h , i and using δ ∈ u(E1 ), we find hx, yi = trE1 /E (axy) for
some a ∈ F1× . If a1 and a2 differ by multiplication of elements in Nm(E1× /F1× ), then the
Hermitian space are isomorphic. So we only need to consider a ∈ F1× /Nm(E1× /F1× ).
When F1 ⊇ E, then F1× /Nm(E1× /F1× ) = {1} and the Hermitian space is unique. It
has to be the split one since only the quasi-split unitary Lie algebras contain elements
that are not Jacquet-Langlands transfer from its non-trivial inner form. This can also
be verified directly.
When F1 + E, then F1× /Nm(E1× /F1× ) = Z/2Z. The determinant of trE1 /E (axy)
equals NmF1 /F (a) times a constant. By class field theory, this surjects to F × /NmE/F (E × ).
We conclude that both Hermitian spaces occur.
Finally, the fact that S intersects with each u(Wi ) with at most one point follows from
the computation of the conjugacy class in a fixed Lie algebras as m = 1.

We can now treat the general case.

Q
Proposition 3.8. There is a natural isomorphism S → S1 Z/2Z. It defines S as a
torsor over H 1 (F, T ) which extends the classical torsor structure over ker(H 1 (F, T ) →
H 1 (F, U (W )).

ENDOSCOPIC TRANSFER FOR UNITARY LIE ALGEBRAS

12

Proof. The
Q map is defined
N in the following
L way. Let δ ∈ S belongs to u(W ). As usual,
F [δ] =
Fi , Ei = E F Fi and W =
Wi , where Wi = Ei W . Since δ is regular
semisimple and δ ∈ u(W ), these Wi are orthogonal to each other. By the m = 1 case,
the Hermitian form on Wi is unique if Fi ⊇ E and there are two
Q possible choices if
Fi + E. Therefore the type of these Wi defines a map S → S1 Z/2Z. Here, we
normalize so thatQ
the split Hermitian space maps to 0.
The map S → S1 Z/2Z admits a section. Indeed, for any element
L in Z/2Z, we may
construct a Hermitian space Wi as in the m = 1 case. Then W =
Wi is a Hermitian
space such that F [δ] ⊂ u(W ). The space W is isomorphic to one of the Hermitian spaces
of dimension n. And any such isomorphism defines an element
in S that is independent
Q
of the isomorphism we take. This implies the map S → S1 Z/2Z is surjective. And by
counting numbers, we find it is an isomorphism. It also implies that S contains elements
of both Hermitian spaces except when S1 = ∅.
This defines S as a torsor over H 1 (F, T ). Notice that δ1 and δ2 ∈ S are in the same
Hermitian space exactly when the corresponding Wi differs at even number of places.
Now it is almost trivial to check the torsor structure agrees with the classical one. 
The proposition shows elements in S are uniquely determined by the type of these
Wi . It also allows us to define the invariant of two elements in S:
Definition 3.9. Let ρ denote the map S → H 1 (F, T ). Given δ1 , δ2 ∈ S, define
inv(δ1 , δ2 ) = ρ(δ1 ) − ρ(δ2 ).

3.3. Endoscopic transfer for unitary Lie algebras. In this section, we consider the
endoscopic transfer in the case of unitary Lie algebras.
Let W be a non-degenerate Hermitian space of dim n for E/F . In F , U(W ) corresponds to the root datum:
(Zn , Zn , αi − αj , λi − λj )
where the weight αi maps (x1 , ..., xn ) to xi and the coweight λi maps t to (1, 1, ..., t, ..., 1)
with t in the i-th component. The root datum admit an action of the Gal(F /F )
which factors through Gal(E/F ). The nontrivial element σ ∈ Gal(E/F ) acts as fol\
lows: σ(λi ) = −λn+1−i and σ(αi ) = −αn+1−i . Hence U
(W ) ∼
= GLn (C) with σ ∈
Gal(E/F ) acting as an outer isomorphism on GLn (C) (when n ≧ 3).
The endoscopic triples (H, s, η) are constructed as follows. Let n = a + b. Let Wk be
the Hermitian space of dimension k with Hermitian matrix that is anti-diagonal with
entries 1 and U(k) ∼
= U(Wk ). So U(a) is the quasi split unitary group of dimension
a for E/F . Take H = U(a) × U(b). The embedding η is the natural embedding of
GLa (C) × GLb (C) into GLn (C). Finally, s = (1, 1, ..., 1, −1, ..., −1) with the first a
coordinates equal 1. It is easy to verify these (H, s, η) are indeed endoscopic triples of
U(W ). In fact, they are all the possible elliptic endoscopic groups.
Let us write down the character κ in this case. Given matching orbits δ and (δ1 , δ2 ),
1 (F, T × T ) = H 1 (F, T ) × H 1 (F, T )
the character κ is a character of H 1 (F, Tδ ) = HQ
δ1
δ2
δ1
δ2
where Tδ is the centralizer of δ. Recall F [δ] = Fi and S1 = {i|Fi + E}. Let us define
for k = 1 or 2:
S1 (δk ) = {i ∈ S1 |Fi comes from δk }.

ENDOSCOPIC TRANSFER FOR UNITARY LIE ALGEBRAS

13

Since s = (1, 1, ..., 1, −1, ..., −1), Tate-Nakayama duality implies:

Proposition 3.10. The character κ of H 1 (F, Tδ ) is defined as follows: on each copy of
Z/2Z corresponding to S1 (δ1 ), κ is the trivial map. On each copy of Z/2Z corresponding
to S1 (δ2 ), κ is the unique nontrivial map.
Finally, we mention the transfer factor. To this end, for each matching stable conjugacy orbits δ and (δ1 , δ2 ), we need to pick a conjugacy class in the stable conjugacy
class of δ. We distinguish
L two cases.
Case 1. W ≃ Wa Wb . This is the case for example
L when E/F is unramified and
W = Wn .L
Choose an isomorphism between W and Wa Wb . This defines an embedding
of u(Wa ) u(WL
b ) into u(W ), which is well defined up to conjugate by U(W ). For any
(δ1 , δ2 ) ∈ u(Wa ) u(Wb ), let δ ∈ u(W ) be its image under the embedding.
If (δ1 , δ2 ) is taken in a stable conjugacy class, then δ is in a single stable conjugacy class.
Furthermore, δ matches (δ1 , δ2 ) in the endoscopic sense. This is because stable conjugacy
of regular semisimple elements in u(W ) is determined by characteristic polynomials and
δ has the same characteristic polynomial with (δ1 , δ2 ). Also, if (δ1 , δ2 ) is taken in a
conjugacy class, then δ is in a single conjugacy class (notice that the embedding is well
defined up to conjugate over F ). This means we have a preferable choice of a conjugacy
class in the endoscopic transfer of (δ1 , δ2 ). This is useful since two different conjugacy
classes in U(W ) will change the transfer factor in (4) by their relative position.
Definition 3.11. We define elements δ and (δ1 , δ2 ) are nice matching elements if they
arise in the way described above.
For nice matching orbits δ and (δ1 , δ2 ), define
Y
(x1 − x2 )
D(δ) =
x1 ,x2

where x1 (resp. x2 ) run through all the eigenvalues of δ1 (resp. δ2 ) in F . Then the
transfer factor equals
∆((δ1 , δ2 ), δ) = χ(D(δ))|D(δ)|F .
For example, when E/F is unramified, the transfer factor equals (−q)−r with r =
vF (D(δ)).
L
Case 2. W ≇ Wa Wb . Let δ and (δ1 , δ2 ) are matching elements. Choose δ′ such
that δ′ and (δ1 , δ2 ) are nice matching elements. So δ′ arises from the other Hermitian
space. Then
∆((δ1 , δ2 ), δ) = κ(inv(δ, δ′ ))χ(D(δ))|D(δ)|F .
3.4. Jacquet-Langlands transfer for unitary Lie algebras. Let W0 be the split
Hermitian space of dimension n and W1 the non-split Hermitian spaces of dimension n.
The reductive group U(W0 ) is an endoscopic group of U(W1 ), whose endoscopic triple is
(U(W0 ), 1, id). Hence everything we have defined for endoscopic transfer applies to this
case. Endoscopic transfers of orbits are the same as Jacquet-Langlands transfers. The
transfer factor is identically 1.
Then theorem 3.4 and theorem 3.5 in this case mean:

ENDOSCOPIC TRANSFER FOR UNITARY LIE ALGEBRAS

14

Theorem 3.12. For any f1 ∈ Cc∞ (u(W1 )), there exists a transfer f0 ∈ Cc∞ (u(W0 )).

Theorem 3.13. Let fi ∈ Cc∞ (u(Wi )). There exists a constant c independent of the
matching functions, such that if f0 and f1 match, then F(f0 ) and cF(f1 ) also match.
Proof of theorem 3.12 and theorem 3.13. Both theorem 3.12 and theorem 3.13 are proved
in [2] (theorem 1.5 in [2]). Since the fundamental lemmas between inner forms are trivial,
the proof in [2] applies without any assumption.

Theorem 3.12 and theorem 3.13 will be used in our proof of the main theorem. We
also need the explicit constant c in (3.13). Recall the definition of Weil index:
Definition 3.14 (Weil index). Let F be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic
zero and V a vector space of dimension n over F equipped with a quadratic form q :
V → F . Fix an additive character ψ : F → C× . Let fq be the function ψ ◦ q and F the
Fourier transform defined by ψ. There exists a constant γq (ψ), called Weil index, such
that for all f ∈ Cc∞ (V ), the following identity is true:
F(fq ) = γq (ψ)f−q .

Waldspurger shows in [2] the following:
Proposition 3.15. The constant c in theorem 3.5 equals
quadratic forms on g and h that match each other.

γqG (ψ)
γqH (ψ) .

Here qG and qH are

Let us compute this quotient of Weil index in the case of unitary Lie algebras:
Proposition 3.16. The constant c in theorem 3.13 equals (−1)n−1 .
Proof. We only treat the case when n = 2. The general case is n−1 copy of the n = 2 case
plus a common part in u(W0 ) and u(W1 ). Consider the 2 dimensional Hermitian space
W for E/F with Hermitian matrix diag{1, λ}. Choose the non-degenerate quadratic
form as qW =tr(X 2 ). A basis of u(W ) is given by

qW = q1 q2λ q−ελ q1 . Let γa = γqa (ψ), then γqW = γ12 γ2λ γ−2ελ since Weil index commutes with direct sum. Suppose γqW is independent of λ, this implies:

We have the following properties of Weil

γ−a = γa−1 ,
γa γb = γ1 γab (a, b)F
where (a, b)F is the Hilbert symbol.
Using (a, x)F = −1 and the above two identities, one show (6) is only correct if we
multiple one side by −1. This means c = −1.

4. Nilpotent identity
The goal of this section is to prove theorem 4.7. It gives an identity in the JacquetRallis transfer between certain nilpotent orbit integrals. In the unitary side, this nilpotent orbit integrals turns out to be the usual κ-orbit integrals in the endoscopic case. So
theorem 4.7 enables us to reduce the endoscopic transfer identity to the general linear
side.
As indicated in the introduction, theorem 4.7 is proved by approaching the nilpotent
orbits by regular semisimple ones and using germ expansion identities. Here, germ
expansion identities are relations between orbit integrals of nilpotent orbits and very
close regular semisimple orbits. We break the proof into several parts. We first prove
germ expansion identities for tori. We use this to prove germ expansion identities in the
two sides of the Jaquet-Rallis transfer. Then we relate the germ expansion identities in
the two sides and finally prove theorem 4.7.
4.1. Germ expansions in the torus case. Let E/F be a quadratic extension of nonarchimedean local fields, χ the quadratic character of F × corresponding to E/F and
Fi /F finite extensions of fields. We set

When a ∈ A and Λ ⊂ {1, ..., m}, we denote by aΛ the element in A which equals a

field of F , we have the norm map |·|i : T −→
Fi× → R×
>0 extending the given one on F
×

(normalized so that |πF |= q ). We define |·|Λ : T → R>0 to be the products of |·|i for
i ∈ Λ. Finally, Write {1, ..., m} = S1 ∐ S2 , where S1 contains all i such that Fi + E and
S2 contains all i such that Fi ⊇ E.
Lemma 4.1 (Germ Expansions for Tori). Let f ∈ Cc∞ (A×A) and consider the following
integral
Z
f (t, εt−1 )χ(t)dt.

Orb(f, ε) =

T

When ε ∈ T is close enough to 0 (as an element in A), the above integral equals:

where cΛ2 (f ) is independent of εS2 and

The integral in c∅ is defined by analytic continuation.
To explain this lemma, consider the action of T on A × A by (t, t−1 ). Then A will be
the quotient space and π : A × A → A the quotient map, π(x, y) = xy. The integrals
Orb(f, ε) are orbit integrals on regular semisimple orbits whose invariants approach 0 as
ε → 0. By the general principle of Shalika germs, it can be expressed as a summation

ENDOSCOPIC TRANSFER FOR UNITARY LIE ALGEBRAS

16

over (T, χ) invariant distributions supported on π −1 (0) with coefficients depending on
the regular semisimple orbits.
Our lemma gives an explicit formula in this case, where we first arrange these (T, χ)
invariant distributions by Λ2 ⊆ S2 and each Λ2 is distinguished by the term logq (|ε|S2 \Λ2 ).
Then for the part Λ2 = ∅, we give an explicit formula for c∅ (f ). The term c∅ (f ) contains
2|S1 | different (T, χ) invariant distributions supported on π −1 (0)
Q indexed by Λ1 ⊆ S1 .
For each Λ1 , the coefficient of the corresponding distribution is i∈S1 \Λ1 χ(εi ). One can
also give a general formula for all the cΛ (f ), but this is not needed here.
Q
Proof. Both sides are linear in f , so we can assume f = fi with fi ∈ Cc∞ (Fi × Fi ).
Using this f to substitute reduces the question to the case when m = 1. So we can
assume m = 1.
Now distinguish two cases. In the first case, Fi ⊇ E, so χ is trivial, we want to prove:
Z
f (t, εt−1 ) = c − f (0, 0) log q |ε|.

tinuations. Both integrals have a simple pole at 0 with residues that are negative of each
other, so there sum is holomorphic at 0.
To prove the identity, notice that the identity is linear in f . If f (x, 0) ≡ 0 or f (0, y) ≡
0 or f = 1OF ×OF , the identity is easily verified. Now the identity follows because
Cc∞ (A × A) is generated by those three kinds of functions.

In this case both integrals converge for Re(s) > 0, extends to a meromorphic function

In the definition of c∅ (f ), we use “nilpotent orbit integrals” that are defined in (2).
Once again, the ‘nilpotent orbit integrals” in c∅ are (G, χ) invariant distributions on
the fiber π −1 (inv(γ), 0). Here we consider the points on the quotient space where ai is
defined by γ and bi = 0. Because of Shalika germ, it is natural to expect that they
appears in the formula.

For any fixed g, we may apply lemma 4.1 to the function

We claim that when ε is close enough to 0, lemma 4.1 will work for all the fg . This
is because γ is regular semisimple, the outer integral is over a compact set and the map

4.4. Matching in the Jacquet-Rallis transfer. We combine the previous two germ
expansions together. Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over F . Let W0 and W1
be representatives of the two isomophism classes of finite dimensional Hermitian spaces
over E of the same dimension as V .
Choose matching orbits (γ, v, v ∗ ) and (δ, w). We also assume that γ (resp. δ) is
regular semisimple in gl(V ) (resp. u(W )). Since γ and δ have the same characteristic
polynomials and are regular semisimple, they can be conjugated over F alg . This defines
an isomorphism F [γ] ∼
= F [δ] which is independent of the conjugation we choose.
Lemma 4.4. When (γ, v, v ∗ ) and (δ, w) match, choose ε ∈ F [γ]× , ε1 ∈ E[δ]× with
NmE[δ]/F [δ] (ε1 ) = ε

then

(γ, v, v ∗ ε)

and (δ, ε1 w) also match.

Proof. The invariants ai are equal since they only depend on γ and δ. For the invariants
bi , since (γ, v, v ∗ ) and (δ, w) match, we have hv ∗ ε, γ i vi = hv ∗ , γ i εvi = hw, δi εwi =
hw, δi ε1 ε1 wi = hε1 w, δi ε1 wi.

Let f and {fW } match, so

Orb(fW , (δ, ε1 w)) = Orb(f, (γ, v, v ∗ ε))ω(γ, v, v ∗ ε)

for all ε and ε1 such that NmE[δ]/F [δ] (ε1 ) = ε. Recall that the transfer factor ω is
independent of the the V ∗ part.
Choose ε1 and ε that are very close to 0. Apply the germ expansions in section 4.2
and section 4.3. The lemma below implies we may subtract the leading terms correspond

Proof. This easily follows by induction on |S| and changing one of the εi by its square. 
4.5. Inverse the identity. Theorem 4.7 is obtained from (7) by considering the stable conjugacy class of δ, each conjugacy class will give an identity and inversing these
identities will give theorem 4.7.
Fix a regular semisimple (γ, v, v ∗ ) ∈ gl(V ) × V × V ∗ and assume γ is also regular
semisimple. For any x ∈ F [γ]× , we denote by (δx , wx ) the orbit that matches (γ, v, v ∗ x).
Consider the map x 7→ δx .
Lemma 4.6. We use the notation S as in proposition 3.8. The map x 7→ δx defines an
isomorphism of H 1 (F, Tx ) torsor
F [γ]× /NmE[γ]/F [γ](E[γ]× ) → S.
Proof. The image lies in a single S since they are all stably conjugate to γ. The map
factors through the quotient since if (γ, v, v ∗ ) and (δ, w) match, then (γ, v, v ∗ ε) and
(δ, ε1 w) also match with Nm(ε1 ) = ε (lemma 4.4).Q
Let us show the map is a bijection. Let F [γ] = m
i=1 Fi , Vi = Fi V , and v = (vi ) in the
L
decomposition V =
Vi . Define ∆i (γ, v, v ∗ ) to be χ(det({hvi∗ , γ a+b vi i}a,b )). Similarly
define ∆i (δ, w). The invariant ∆i are the same for matching orbits.
Notice that (∆1 (γ, v, v ∗ x), ..., ∆m (γ, v, v ∗ x)) ∈ {±1}m is uniquely determined by x,
and (∆1 (δ, w), ..., ∆m (δ, w)) ∈ {±1}m uniquely determines the isomorphism class of the
Hermitian space Ei W , which uniquely determines elements in S. Therefore, the map is
a bijection.
Since H 1 (F, Tx ) acts on S by acting on the isomorphism class of Ei W , it is obvious
that the map commutes with the H 1 (F, Tx ) action.

Let us reinterpret this formula. We start by choosing regular semisimple γ. This
defines the conjugacy class S on the unitary side. Then we choose some Λ. This defines
a character of H 1 (F, T ). Finally, we choose auxiliary v and v ∗ . This gives the quantity
on the left side of the formula and also determines a base point δ of S ((δ, w) matches
(γ, v, v ∗ )). It is a funny exercise to show the formula we get are equivalent for different
choice of v and v ∗ . So it only depends on the choice of γ and Λ. Also, by choosing
appropriate Λ, we get all the possible κ-orbit integrals.
5. Parabolic descent
We shall use a computation similar to Harish-Chandran’s parabolic descent of orbit
integrals. This will be used in the next section
L to prove the main theorem.
Let f ∈ Cc∞ (gl(V ) × V × V ∗ ) and V = V1 V2 . We define the parabolic descent of f

Let λ = (λ1 , λ2 ) ∈ gl(V1 ) × gl(V2 ) be regular semisimple in gl(V ).

6. Proof of the main theorem
In this section, we prove our main theorem. Let us fix notations that will be used in
the proof. As before, E/F is a quadratic extension of non-archimedean local fields of
characteristic zero. Let χ be the quadratic character of F × corresponding to E/F . We
will write Wn,0 and Wn,1 as the two isomorphism classes of non-degenerate Hermitian
spaces of dimension n for E/F . We use Wn,0 to denote the split one. Also, let Vn = F n
be the vector space over F of dimension n.
Theorem 6.1 (Main Theorem). Let W be a Hermitian space of dimension n for E/F .
Let n = a + b. Define G = U(W ) and it has endoscopic group H = U(Wa,0 ) × U(Wb,0 ).
(1) For each f ∈ Cc∞ (g), there exists a transfer f H ∈ Cc∞ (h).
(2) If f and f H are matching functions, then for the Fourier transfrom F and F H
(defined by tr(XY )), F(f ) and F H (f H ) are also matching functions.

Proof. We first prove the existence of transfer. The transfer is defined in several steps.
Start with f ∈ Cc∞ (u(W )),
• Choose any F ∈ Cc∞ (u(W ) × W ) such that F (x, 0) = f (x).
• Define φ ∈ Cc∞ (gl(Vn ) × Vn × Vn∗ ) as the Jacquet-Rallis transfer of {F, 0}.
• Define φa,b ∈ Cc∞ (gl(Va ) × gl(Vb ) × Vn × Vn∗ ) as the parabolic descent of φ.
• Using the product of Jacquet-Rallis transfers in dimension a and b, we can transa,b
fer φa,b to four functions {Fi,j
}(i, j = 0, 1), where
a,b
Fi,j
∈ Cc∞ (u(Wa,i ) × Wa,i × u(Wb,j ) × Wb,j ).

a,b
a,b

• Define fi,j

(x, y) = Fi,j

• Let fi,j
be the Jacquet-Langlands transfer of fi,j

• Finally, define f a,b = f0,0

.

We claim f a,b is an endoscopic transfer of f . Choose elements δ ∈ u(W ) and (δ1 , δ2 ) ∈
u(Wa,0 ) × u(W
L b,0 ) whose orbits are matching. We first verify (4) for these orbits. Let
W ′ = Wa,0 Wb,0 , recall in definition 3.11, (δ1 , δ2 ) gives a nice matching element δ′ ∈
u(W ′ ).
Choose auxiliary w1 ∈ Wa,0 and w2 ∈ Wb,0 such that (δi , wi ) is regular semisimple. Let
(γi , vi , vi∗ ) be a Jacquet-Rallis transfer of (δi , wi ). The element ((γ1 , γ2 ), (v1 , v2 ), (v1∗ , v2∗ ))
is naturally a regular semisimple element in gl(Vn ) × Vn × Vn∗ that is a Jacquet-Rallis
transfer of (δ′ , (w1 , w2 )).
The equation (4) follows from a sequence of identities. To simplify the equation, for
the moment, we useQCk to represent all the transfer factors appearing in these identities.
Recall that F [δ] = Fk , S1 = {k|Fk + E} and S1 (δi ) = {k ∈ S1 |Fk comes from δi }.
OrbSt (f a,b , (δ1 , δ2 )) = Orb(Ga,b , ((γ1 , γ2 ), ((v1 )S1 (δ1 ) , 0), (0, (v2∗ )S1 (δ2 ) ))) × C1
= Orb(G, ((γ1 , γ2 ), ((v1 )S1 (δ1 ) , 0), (0, (v2∗ )S1 (δ2 ) ))) × C2
= Orbκ (f, δ) × κ(inv(δ′ , δ)) × C3 .

The first identity follows by taking the product of (8) applied to the case when dimV =
a and Λ = S1 (δ1 ) and the case when dimV = b and Λ = ∅. The second identity follows

ENDOSCOPIC TRANSFER FOR UNITARY LIE ALGEBRAS

24

from parabolic descent (lemma 5.1). The third identity follows by applying (8) to the
case when dimV = n and Λ = S1 (δ1 ).
We remark that κ-orbit integral here is different from the classical one since it contains
conjugacy classes in both Hermitian spaces. We have shown that these conjugacy classes
is a natural torus under H 1 (F, Tδ ) and κ is character of H 1 (F, Tδ ). Therefore we can
extend the usual κ orbit integral to
Let us explain that the third identity does give the κ-orbit integral defined using the
endoscopic group H. This means we will need to verify the identity
κ(inv(δ′ , δx )) = hS1 (δ1 ), xi.

(10)

Here (δx , wx ) is the Jacquet-Rallis transfer of ((γ1 , γ2 ), (v1 , v2 ), (v1∗ , v2∗ )x) with x ∈
F [γ]× . By proposition 4.6, the canonical isomorphism between F [γ]× /NmE[γ]/F [γ](E[γ]× )
and H 1 (F, Tγ ) maps x to inv(δ, δx ) (proposition 4.6) and maps κ to hS1 (δ1 ), i (proposition 3.10). This implies (10).
Finally, we compute the transfer factor. In the above computation, we have introduced three transfer factors: two come from the Jacquet-Rallis transfer and one comes
from the parabolic descent. We need to prove their product gives the transfer factor
χ(D(δ))|D(δ)|F . The transfer factor in the parabolic descent equals |D(δ)|F . So it
remains to show the product of the two transfer factors in the Jacquet-Rallis transfer
equals χ(D(δ)).
To define the transfer factor in the Jacquet-Rallis case, we fix Ω1 ∈ ∧top Va , Ω2 ∈
top
∧ Vb , and take Ω ∈ ∧top V defined by Ω1 ∧ Ω2 . For careful readers, we should fix this
transfer factor before defining the Jacquet-Rallis transfer of functions. Recall we have
defined ω(γ, v, v ∗ ) in (3). The desired equality for transfer factors reduces to
ω(γ, v, v ∗ ) = χ(D(γ))ω(γ1 , v1 , v1∗ )ω(γ2 , v2 , v2∗ ),
where γ = (γ1 , γ2 ), v = (v1 , v2 ) and v ∗ = (v1∗ , v2∗ ). To prove this, diagonalize γ1 and γ2
in F and compute both sides.
To verify f a,b is an endoscopic transfer of f , we still need to verify the requirement
(5). Namely, consider (δ1 , δ2 ) that is not a transfer from u(W ). This happens only when
S1 (δ) = ∅. In this case, W ′ = Wn,0 and W ′ ≇ W . The stable conjugacy class of the
nice matching element δ′ of (δ1 , δ2 ) is the unique conjugacy class contained in u(Wn,0 ).
Following the same computation as before, we find
OrbSt (f a,b , (δ1 , δ2 )) = 0.
This finishes the proof of the existence part. To prove the Fourier transform part,
notice that our construction commutes with Fourier transforms. For this commutativity,
it is important that the (−1)n−1 in theorem 2.3 and proposition 3.16 exactly cancels. We
have shown that for any f , there exists f H such that f matches f H and F(f ) matches
F(f H ). A theorem of Waldspurger (Proposition A in [3]) ensures that for a fixed f ,
the validity of commutativity does not depend on the choice of f H . This finishes our
proof.

The same idea also applies to the fundamental lemma.

Theorem 6.2. For any odd prime p and consider the fundamental lemmas on the Lie
algebras. Then the fundamental lemma in the Jacquet-Rallis case (conjecture 2.4) implies
the fundamental lemma in the endoscopic case.
Proof. We leave it to the reader to give the formulation of the fundamental lemma in
the unitary Lie algebras. To prove the above theorem, we start with the right function
on u(Wn,0 ). Then the Jacquet-Rallis fundamental lemma and a simple calculation of
parabolic descent implies that we get the right function on u(Wa,0 ) × u(Wb,0 ) following
the process as in the proof of theorem 6.1.

Remark. In [9], Kazhdan and Varshavsky have shown that the fundamental lemma in
the endoscopic case is implied by theorem 3.5 (at least when p is large). In the unitary
case, theorem 6.1 give a direct proof of theorem 3.5. Hence, we also give a genuinely
different proof of the endoscopic fundamental lemma.
