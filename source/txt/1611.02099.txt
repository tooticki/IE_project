Abstract
A result of Simonovits and Sós states that for any ﬁxed graph H and any ǫ > 0 there exists
δ > 0 such that if G is an n-vertex graph with the property that every S ⊆ V (G) contains
pe(H) |S|v(H) ± δnv(H) labeled copies of H, then G is quasirandom in the sense that every S ⊆ V (G)
contains 12 p|S|2 ± ǫn2 edges. The original proof of this result makes heavy use of the regularity
lemma, resulting in a bound on δ −1 which is a tower of twos of height polynomial in ǫ−1 . We
give an alternative proof of this theorem which avoids the regularity lemma and shows that δ may
be taken to be linear in ǫ when H is a clique and polynomial in ǫ for general H. This answers a
problem raised by Simonovits and Sós.

Introduction

What does it mean to say that a graph is random-like and how does one construct such graphs?
Attempts to answer these questions have played a central role in mathematics over the last forty
years, with connections to combinatorics, probability, number theory, theoretical computer science
and more (see, for example, [8, 12]).
For dense graphs, there is a somewhat surprising answer to the ﬁrst question, in that many of the
possible deﬁnitions for what it means to be random-like turn out to be equivalent, a fact ﬁrst observed
by Chung, Graham and Wilson [1], building on earlier work of Thomason [24, 25]. To be more precise,
let H be a ﬁxed graph with r vertices and m edges, 0 < p < 1 a ﬁxed constant and G an n-vertex
graph. Consider the following properties that G might have:
PH,p (ǫ): The number of labeled copies of H in G is within ǫnr of pm nr .
∗ (ǫ): For every subset S ⊆ V (G), the number of labeled copies of H in the induced subgraph
PH,p
G[S] is within ǫnr of pm |S|r .

The property PH,p asks that the number of copies of H in G is close to what one would expect in the
∗
binomial random graph G(n, p), while the hereditary property PH,p
asks for a more robust version of
this condition, saying that the copies of H are also uniformly distributed in G, again just as one would
expect in G(n, p).

A sequence of graphs (Gn )∞
n=1 with |Gn | = n is said to be p-quasirandom if it satisﬁes the property
∗ (ǫ) with ǫ = o(1), where, here and throughout the paper, we write P
∗
P2,p
r,p and Pr,p for PH,p and
∗
PH,p
when H is the complete graph Kr . That is, a sequence of graphs is p-quasirandom if the density
of Gn is asymptotic to p and the edges are uniformly distributed across subsets. Of the equivalent
formulations discovered by Chung, Graham and Wilson [1], the most striking is perhaps the following.
Theorem (Chung–Graham–Wilson). For any ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
∗ (ǫ);
(a) if a graph satisfies P2,p (δ) and PC4 ,p (δ), then it also satisfies P2,p
∗ (δ), then it also satisfies P (ǫ) and P
(b) if a graph satisfies P2,p
2,p
C4 ,p (ǫ).

It follows from part (a) that if the number of edges and the number of cycles of length four in a sequence
of graphs (Gn )∞
n=1 are both asymptotic to their expected values in the random graph G(n, p), then the
sequence is p-quasirandom. What is striking about this conclusion is that a purely global property,
that of having certain counts of edges and cycles of length four, is suﬃcient to imply a local property
about the distribution of edges on small subsets. Moreover, by part (b), the converse also holds.
A similar result is conjectured [4, 21] to hold when C4 is replaced by any bipartite graph H with at
least one cycle. Known as the forcing conjecture, this conclusion is now known to hold for a wide range
of bipartite graphs, with progress on the conjecture closely paralleling recent progress [4, 5, 11, 14, 22]
on Sidorenko’s conjecture. On the other hand, part (a) does not hold when C4 is replaced by a nonbipartite H. To see this for triangles, consider the graph G on n vertices consisting of four disjoint sets
V1 , V2 , V3 and V4 , each of order n/4, with V1 and V2 complete, V3 and V4 empty, a complete bipartite
graph between V3 and V4 and a random bipartite graph with edge probability 1/2 between V1 ∪ V2 and
V3 ∪ V4 . This graph has density 1/2 and asymptotically n3 /8 labeled triangles. However, it is clearly
not 1/2-quasirandom.
A key result about quasirandom graphs, proved by Simonovits and Sós [20], says that such counterexamples can be avoided if we strengthen our assumption, asking that G satisﬁes the hereditary property
∗
PH,p
rather than just PH,p . That is, a sequence of graphs (Gn )∞
n=1 with |Gn | = n is p-quasirandom
if every subset S ⊆ V (Gn ) contains roughly the same number of copies of H as one would expect to
ﬁnd in G(n, p).
∗ (δ),
Theorem (Simonovits–Sós). For any ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if a graph satisfies PH,p
∗
then it also satisfies P2,p (ǫ).

The original proof of this result makes heavy use of the regularity lemma [23], resulting in a bound
on δ−1 which is a tower of twos of height polynomial in ǫ−1 . The main aim of this paper is to give an
alternative proof of this theorem which avoids the use of the regularity lemma, giving a much better
bound for δ in terms of ǫ. This answers a problem raised by Simonovits and Sós in their paper. In
reality, we prove two theorems, the ﬁrst showing that δ may be taken to be linear in ǫ when H is
a clique, a result which is clearly optimal (consider the random graph with density p + ǫ), and the
second showing that δ may be taken to be polynomial in ǫ for general H.
Theorem 1.1. For every natural number r ≥ 3, there is a constant c(r) such that if p and ǫ are
constants with 0 < ǫ, p < 1 and n is sufficiently large depending on r, p and ǫ, then any n-vertex graph
∗ (δ) with δ = c(r)p2r 2 ǫ also satisfies P ∗ (ǫ).

Theorem 1.2. For every 0 < p < 1 and natural number r ≥ 3, there are constants c = c(p, r) and
∗ (δ) with
c′ (p, r) such that if H is a graph with r vertices, 0 < ǫ < 1/2 and a graph G satisfies PH,p
∗ (ǫ).
δ = c′ (p, r)ǫc(p,r) , then it also satisfies P2,p
We note that another alternative proof for a variant of the Simonovits–Sós theorem, also avoiding
regularity, was found independently by Reiher and Schacht [18]. However, their result uses slightly
stronger assumptions and gives weaker quantitative control than ours. As well as being interesting in
its own right, our close attention to quantitative aspects was motivated by the possibility of application
in extremal combinatorics. Indeed, the best bounds for a number of well-known theorems in this area,
including Ramsey’s theorem [2] and Szemerédi’s theorem [7], rely crucially on the interplay between
diﬀerent notions of quasirandomness. Our results bring the Simonovits–Sós theorem into a range
where it could also be proﬁtably applied in this manner.
The rest of the paper will be laid out as follows: we study complete graphs in the next section,
proving Theorem 1.1; we treat the general case in Section 3, proving Theorem 1.2; and we conclude
with some further remarks and open problems in Section 4. For the sake of clarity of presentation, we
systematically omit ﬂoor and ceiling signs whenever they are not crucial.

Complete graphs

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.1. We will need several lemmas about graphs G that satisfy
∗ (δ), the ﬁrst of which estimates the number of r-cliques with exactly i vertices in one set X and
Pr,p
r − i vertices in another set Y . The proof draws on ideas used by Shapira [19] when studying a
related problem. Here and throughout this section, we will use big O notation, allowing the hidden
constants to depend on the clique size r but not on the edge density p. In keeping with the statement
of Theorem 1.1, we will always assume that n is taken suﬃciently large.
∗ (δ). Then, for all disjoint subsets X, Y of
Lemma 2.1. Let G be an n-vertex graph that satisfies Pr,p

by at most O(δnr ).
For j = 1, 2, . . . , r + 1, let qj = j/(r + 1) and let A be the (r + 1) × (r + 1) matrix with aji = qji .
The matrix A is not singular, since it is a Vandermonde matrix and the qj are distinct. Let a be a
maximum in absolute value entry of A−1 , noting that this depends only on r. Let x = (x0 , x1 , . . . , xr )
and x′ = (x′0 , x′1 , . . . , x′r ). By the above discussion, we know that the coordinates of the vectors z = Ax
and z ′ = Ax′ diﬀer by at most O(δnr ). Since x − x′ = A−1 (z − z ′ ), it follows that the coordinates of
the vectors x and x′ diﬀer by at most O(r · |a| · δnr ) = O(δnr ), completing the proof.

We will need a corollary of this lemma saying that for any subset U ⊆ V (G), most u ∈ U are
contained in approximately the same number of r-cliques in U . The following deﬁnition helps capture
this condition.

and, therefore, 1 = O(δnr ). A similar argument shows that 2 = O(δnr ).
Definition. Given two vertices u, v ∈ V (G), let c(u, v) denote the number of subsets S ⊂ V (G) of
order r − 1 such that both {u} ∪ S and {v} ∪ S form an r-clique in G and write

Note that by deﬁnition c(u, v) = c(v, u). Therefore, by the triangle inequality, we have

r 
disc(u, v) + disc(v, u) ≥ p(2) dr−1 (v) − dr−1 (u)/(r − 1)! .

Using this inequality, we can prove the following lemma which shows that most pairs of vertices in G
have comparable degree.

Let U be the set of neighbors of u in G and let W be the complement of U . Partition W further

bounded by O(δnr ) by Corollary 2.1.

We now consider a converse to our intended theorem, saying that if a graph satisﬁes P2,p

also satisﬁes Pr,p
in Section 10.5 of Lovász’ book on graph limits [16]. However, because this result is central to our
estimates and not as well known as it should be, we include the proof.

Lemma 2.3. If a graph G satisfies P2,p

Proof. Given S, T ⊆ V (G), write e(S, T ) = s∈S,t∈T 1G (s, t), where 1G is the indicator function for
edges of G. In particular, when S = T , this counts the number of labeled edges in S. By assumption,
e(S, S) = p|S|2 ± γn2 for all S ⊆ V (G). Therefore, using the identity
2e(S, T ) = e(S ∪ T, S ∪ T ) + e(S ∩ T, S ∩ T ) − e(S \ T, S \ T ) − e(T \ S, T \ S),
we see that e(S, T ) = p|S||T | ± 2γn2 for all S, T ⊆ V (G). Rewriting this conclusion, we see that
X
|
(1G (s, t) − p)| ≤ 2γn2
s∈S,t∈T

for all S, T ⊆ V (G). In turn, this implies that for any functions u, v : V (G) → [0, 1],
X
|
(1G (x, y) − p)u(x)v(y)| ≤ 2γn2 .
x,y∈V (G)

Indeed, since the function we wish to estimate is linear in u(x) and v(y) for each x and y, the value
of the function is maximised when u and v take values in {0, 1}. In this case, u and v correspond to
indicator functions, so the inequality reduces to the previous special case.

For ease of notation, we spell out the rest of the proof for the case of triangles. By telescoping, the
deviation between the number of labeled triangles in a set S ⊆ V (G) and its expected value is

We will also use some simple ingredients from other papers. The ﬁrst, taken from a paper of Erdős,
Goldberg, Pach and Spencer [6], says that if an n-vertex graph contains a set which deviates from the
expected density, then there is also a set of order n/2 which deviates from this density.

We also need a special case of the Kruskal–Katona theorem [10, 13] giving an upper bound for the
number of r-cliques in a graph with given density. The result we use is given as Exercise 31b in
Chapter 13 of Lovász’ problem book [15]. Here the binomial coeﬃcient xr is extended to all real x in
the obvious way.

Lemma 2.5. Let r≥ 3 be an integer and x ≥ r a real number. Then a graph with exactly x2 edges
contains at most xr cliques of order r.
Finally, we need the standard Azuma–Hoeﬀding inequality, which we apply in the following form (see
Corollary 2.27 in [9]).

Lemma 2.6. Given positive real numbers λ, c1 , . . . , ck , let f : {0, 1}k → R be a function satisfying the
following Lipschitz condition: whenever two vectors z, z ′ ∈ {0, 1}k differ only in the ith coordinate,
|f (z)−f (z ′ )| ≤ ci . Then, if X1 , . . . , Xk are independent random variables, each taking values in {0, 1},

We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.1. We will do this by showing that if a suﬃciently large graph

1.1: Let G be an n-vertex graph satisfying the assertion of the theorem and

let q = e(G)/ 2 be the edge density of G. By the Kruskal–Katona theorem, Lemma 2.5, G contains
r
O(q r/2 nr ) labeled r-cliques. Since the number of labeled r-cliques in G is also at least 1 p(2) nr , this

implies that q = Ω(pr−1 ).

2
it contains a subset of vertices S such that e(S) deviates from q |S|
2 by at least γn . Using Lemma 2.4,
6

we can assume that S has order n/2, allowing for the possibility that γ may change by a small constant
factor.
Let A be a random subset of G, obtained by choosing every vertex independently with probability
1/2. Let X = S ∩ A and let Y be a random subset of G \ A, obtained by further choosing every vertex
with probability 1/2. By linearity, the expected number of vertices in X is n/4 and the expected
number of edges in X is e(S)/4. Moreover, both of these quantities are highly concentrated by the
Azuma–Hoeﬀding inequality. Indeed, changing the choice for one vertex can change the number of
vertices in X by at most one and the number of edges by at most n, so the sum of squares of these
changes is at most O(n) for the number of vertices and O(n3 ) for the number of edges. These are much
smaller than the square of the corresponding expectations. Similarly, the expected number of vertices
and edges in Y are n/4 and e(G)/16, respectively, and they are also both concentrated. Therefore,
we can ﬁnd two disjoint subsets X and Y , each of order n/4 + o(n), such
+ o(n2 )
 that e(X) = e(S)/4
2
2
and e(Y ) = e(G)/16 + o(n ). Thus, by the discussion above, we have e(X) − e(Y ) = Ω(γn ) and we
can delete o(n) vertices to make the orders of X and Y equal without changing this inequality.

Let U = X ∪ Y and let H = G[U ] be the subgraph of G induced by U . Without loss of generality, we
P
will assume that e(X) ≥ e(Y ). In particular, the edge density in X is at least q. Since x∈X dH (x) =
P
P
P
2e(X) + e(X, Y ) and y∈Y dH (y) = 2e(Y ) + e(X, Y ), we have x∈X dH (x) − y∈Y dH (y) = Ω(γn2 ).
Therefore, using Corollary 2.2 (with s = r − 1) and |X| = n/4 + o(n), we deduce that

General graphs

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.2. We will assume throughout that H does not have isolated
vertices, as deleting such a vertex from H simply scales the number of labeled copies in S by a factor
of |S| − r + 1.
We say that an n-vertex graph G has property QH,p (ǫ) if, for every r disjoint subsets V1 , . . . , Vr ⊆ V (G),
Q
the number of labeled copies of H with one vertex in each Vi is pm r! ri=1 |Vi | ± ǫnr . In other words,
property QH,p (ǫ) says that if we average over all possible permutations π of [r] the number of copies
Q
of H with the copy of vertex i in Vπ(i) , the result is at most ǫnr /r! from pm ri=1 |Vi |.
For a subset U ⊆ V (G), let NH (U ) denote the number of labeled copies of H in G whose vertices lie
in U . Let NH (V1 , . . . , Vr ) denote the number of labeled copies of H in G with one vertex in each Vi .

Lemma 3.1. If G satisfies PH,p

We remark that the property studied by Reiher and Schacht [18] is a variant of QH,p . We say that
a graph G on n vertices has property RH,p (ǫ) if for any r disjoint vertex subsets V1 , . . . , Vr of G and
every one-to-one mapping π : V (H) → [r], the number of copies of H where the image of v is in Vπ(v)
Q
for each vertex v of H is within ǫnr of pm ri=1 |Vi |. Note that R is a stronger property than Q, since if
a graph satisﬁes RH,p (ǫ), then it also satisﬁes QH,p (r!ǫ). It remains an open problem to ﬁnd a simple
proof (i.e., without going through the methods developed here or through regularity methods) that
shows the other direction, that Q implies R.
We say that a pair (A, B) of vertex subsets of a graph G is lower-(q, ǫ)-regular if, for all A′ ⊆ A and
B ′ ⊆ B,
e(A′ , B ′ ) ≥ q|A′ ||B ′ | − ǫ|A||B|.
That is, the density between all pairs of large subsets is at least q, up to an error depending on ǫ.
As in the proof of Lemma 2.3, this is equivalent to saying that for all functions u : A → [0, 1] and
v : B → [0, 1],
X

1G (a, b)u(a)v(b) ≥ q
u(a)v(b) − ǫ|A||B|.

a∈A,b∈B

Similarly, we say that (A, B) is upper-(q, ǫ)-regular if, for all subsets A′ ⊆ A and B ′ ⊆ B,
e(A′ , B ′ ) ≤ q|A′ ||B ′ | + ǫ|A||B|.
We note that if a pair of subsets is both lower-(q, ǫ)-regular and upper-(q, ǫ)-regular, it satisﬁes a
notion of regularity introduced by Lovász and Szegedy [17] (though equivalent up to a polynomial
change in ǫ to the original notion of regularity introduced by Szemerédi [23]).
The following counting lemma gives a lower bound for the number of copies of a graph H between a
collection of sets with lower-regular pairs. We omit the proof, which follows by the same telescoping
argument used for Lemma 2.3.
Lemma 3.2. Let H be a graph on vertex set {1, 2, . . . , r}. Let G be a graph with vertex subsets
V1 , . . . , Vr such that (Vi , Vj ) is lower-(pij , ǫ)-regular for each edge (i, j) of H. Then the number of
homomorphisms from H to G with the copy of vertex i in Vi is at least

Note that a similar lemma also holds if lower is replaced by upper and − by +. It is also worth
noting that we have not insisted that the vertex sets V1 , . . . , Vr be disjoint. In particular, we may take
V1 = · · · = Vr to obtain a non-partite version of the lemma.
The next lemma shows that lower regularity implies upper regularity and vice versa.

Lemma 3.3. If a pair (A, B) of vertex subsets of a graph is not lower-(d(A, B), ǫ)-regular, then it is
also not upper-(d(A, B), ǫ/2)-regular. The same holds if lower and upper are switched.
Proof. By assumption, there are subsets A′ ⊂ A and B ′ ⊂ B such that e(A′ , B ′ ) − d(A, B)|A′ ||B ′ | <
−ǫ|A||B|. As
e(A′ , B ′ ) + e(A \ A′ , B) + e(A′ , B \ B ′ ) = e(A, B)
= d(A, B)|A||B|
= d(A, B)|A′ ||B ′ | + d(A, B)|A \ A′ ||B| + d(A, B)|A′ ||B \ B ′ |,
it follows that at least one of the pairs (A \ A′ , B) and (A′ , B \ B ′ ) demonstrates that (A, B) is not
upper-(d(A, B), ǫ/2)-regular. The proof when lower and upper are switched is the same.
✷
We also need a simple lemma saying that we can always ﬁnd a pair of subsets of equal size which bear
witness to irregularity.
Lemma 3.4. Suppose (A, B) is a pair of vertex subsets of a graph which is not upper-(q, γ)-regular.
|A| |B|
Then there are subsets A′ ⊆ A and B ′ ⊆ B with |A′ | = |B ′ | and d(A′ , B ′ ) ≥ q + γ min{ |A
′ | , |B ′ | }. The
same holds with upper replaced by lower, + by − and the inequality reversed.
Proof. As (A, B) is not upper-(q, γ)-regular, there are subsets A0 ⊆ A and B0 ⊆ B such that
e(A0 , B0 ) ≥ q|A0 ||B0 | + γ|A||B|. Without loss of generality, we may assume that |A0 | ≤ |B0 |. Let
B ′ ⊆ B0 be the subset of |A0 | vertices with the most neighbors in A0 and A′ = A0 . Then
d(A′ , B ′ ) ≥ d(A0 , B0 ) =

The next lemma shows that if a graph satisﬁes QH,p but there are sets A and B for which the density
d(A, B) deviates signiﬁcantly from the expected density, then there are sets A′ and B ′ such that the
density d(A′ , B ′ ) deviates by even more. This observation will allow us to run a density-increment
argument in the proof of Theorem 1.2.
Lemma 3.5. Let H be a graph with r vertices and m edges. Suppose G is a graph on n vertices that
1
satisfies QH,p (δ) and has disjoint subsets A and B with |A| = |B| such that δ ≤ 4r
αmpm r −r (|A|/n)r
1
and d(A, B) ≥ (1 + α)p or d(A, B) ≤ (1 − α)p with α ≤ 16mr . Then there are also disjoint subsets
A′ and B ′ with |A′ | = |B ′ | and d(A′ , B ′ ) ≥ (1 + (1 + β)α)p or d(A′ , B ′ ) ≤ (1 − (1 + β)α)p where
m−1 |A|
β = p4r3 |A
′| .
Proof. Suppose that we are in the case where d(A, B) ≥ (1 + α)p. Let q = (1 − α)p and υ = pm α/(4r).
Take an arbitrary equitable partition of A into ⌊r/2⌋ subsets A1 , . . . , A⌊r/2⌋ and B into ⌈r/2⌉ subsets
A⌊r/2⌋+1 , . . . , Ar .
First suppose that there is a pair (Ai , Aj ) with 1 ≤ i ≤ ⌊r/2⌋ < j ≤ r which is not lower-(d(A, B), υ)|Ai |||Aj |
regular. As Ai ⊂ A and Aj ⊂ B, (A, B) is not lower-(d(A, B), υ ′ )-regular, where υ ′ = υ |A||B|
≥ r22 υ.
By Lemma 3.3, (A, B) is also not upper-(d(A, B), υ ′ /2)-regular. Therefore, by Lemma 3.4, there are
′ |A|
υ |A|
subsets A′ ⊆ A and B ′ ⊆ B such that |A′ | = |B ′ | and d(A′ , B ′ ) ≥ d(A, B) + υ2 |A
′ | ≥ d(A, B) + r 2 |A′ | .
9

|A|
Hence, since rυ2 |A
′ | = αβp, we may suppose all pairs (Ai , Aj ) with 1 ≤ i ≤ ⌊r/2⌋ < j ≤ r are
lower-(d(A, B), υ)-regular.

Now suppose there is a pair (Ai , Aj ) with 1 < i < j ≤ ⌊r/2⌋ which is not lower-(q, υ)-regular.
By Lemma 3.4, there are subsets A′ ⊆ Ai and B ′ ⊆ Aj with |A′ | = |B ′ | and d(A′ , B ′ ) ≤ q −
υ |A|
i | |Aj |
υ min{ |A
|A′ | , |B ′ | } ≤ q − r |A′ | ≤ (1 − (1 + β)α)p. Hence, we may suppose all pairs (Ai , Aj ) with 1 < i <
j ≤ ⌊r/2⌋ are lower-(q, υ)-regular. Similarly, we may suppose all pairs (Ai , Aj ) with ⌊r/2⌋ < i < j ≤ r
are lower-(q, υ)-regular.
Consider a bijection φ : V (H) → [r]. Let m1 denote the number of edges (v, w) of H for which
φ(v), φ(w) ≤ ⌊r/2⌋ or φ(v), φ(w) > ⌊r/2⌋ and m2 denote the number of edges (v, w) of H for which
φ(v) ≤ ⌊r/2⌋ < φ(w), so m = m1 + m2 . By Lemma 3.2, the number of copies of H where v maps to

A single vertex subset U of a graph is called ǫ-regular if, for each pair of subsets A′ , B ′ ⊂ U , we have
|e(A′ , B ′ ) − d(U )|A′ ||B ′ || ≤ ǫ|U |2 . In [3], the ﬁrst two authors proved the following lemma with δ−1
having a double-exponential dependence on ǫ−1 .
Lemma 3.6. For each ǫ > 0, there is δ > 0 such that every graph on n vertices has an ǫ-regular subset
on at least δn vertices.

Proof of Theorem 1.2: Suppose for contradiction that G is a graph on n vertices which satisﬁes

2e(S) − p|S|2  > ǫn2 . Averaging over all equitable partitions S = A ∪ B, we obtain that there are
disjoint vertex subsets A0 and B0 with |A0 | = |B0 | and |e(A0 , B0 ) − p|A0 ||B0 || > ǫn2 /4. We have
|A0 |2 = |A0 ||B0 | > ǫn2 /4, so that |A0 | ≥ ǫ1/2 n/2 and also |d(A0 , B0 ) − p| > ǫn2 /(4|A0 ||B0 |) ≥ ǫ.
We repeatedly apply Lemma 3.5, starting with A0 and B0 , until we arrive at a pair of subsets (A′ , B ′ )

is at least (p − κ)m |C1 |r − mη|C1 |r ≥ pm |C1 |r − (mpm−1 κ + mη)|C1 |r . The number of homomorphisms
from H to C1 which fail to be copies of H is at most the number of non-injective mappings from H
to C1 , which is less than r 2 |C1 |r−1 . Thus, we get at least pm |C1 |r − (mpm−1 κ + mη + r 2 |C1 |−1 )|C1 |r
copies of H in C1 .

We next give a lower bound on the number of copies of H in C1 ∪ D1 with the copy of vertex i in D1
and the remaining r − 1 vertices in C1 . Suppose vertex i has degree t in H. We have t ≥ 1 as H has
no isolated vertices. Fix a vertex v ∈ D1 to map i to, and let C2 be the neighborhood of i in C1 , so
|C2 | ≥ (1 + α/4)p|C1 |. Since |C2 | ≥ p|C1 | and C1 is η-regular, we get that each of the pairs (C1 , C1 ),
(C1 , C2 ), (C2 , C2 ) is 2p−2 η-regular. The number of homomorphisms of H with the copy of vertex i
mapping to v and the remaining vertices of H mapping to C1 (so each of the t neighbors of i has to

Concluding remarks

It is plausible that Theorem 1.1 can be extended to all H, that is, that a graph G which satisﬁes
∗ (δ) also satisﬁes P ∗ (ǫ) with ǫ ≤ c(p, r)δ, where r is the number of vertices in H. However, it
PH,p
2,p
seems that new ideas will be needed to prove this in full generality. It would already be interesting to
obtain a linear dependence in the special case H = C4 .
One might also ask about the quantitative aspects of other quasirandom equivalences. For example,
we know that for any ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if a graph G has density p and satisﬁes
∗ (ǫ). The forcing conjecture, which was already mentioned in the
PC4 ,p (δ), then it also satisﬁes P2,p
introduction, states that a similar result should hold when C4 is replaced by any bipartite graph H
which contains a cycle. Somewhat tentatively, we are willing to venture that the following stronger
quantitative version of this conjecture holds.
Conjecture 4.1. Let H be a fixed bipartite graph of girth g and 0 < p < 1 a fixed constant. For each
ǫ > 0, there is δ = Ω(ǫg ) such that any graph G with density p which satisfies PH,p (δ) also satisfies
∗ (ǫ).
P2,p
To see that the girth dependence would be tight, consider a random graph with n vertices whose vertex
set is partitioned into two parts V1 and V2 , each of order n/2, with density p − ǫ inside parts and
density p + ǫ between parts. Equivalently, consider the generalized random graph G on two vertices,
where loops have weight p − ǫ and the edge between the two vertices has weight p + ǫ. By picking one
∗ (ǫ/2).
vertex from G, we see that it does not satisfy P2,p
Consider now a random mapping of the vertices of H to the two vertices of G. For an edge e of H,
let Xe = −1 if both vertices of e map to the same vertex of G and Xe = 1 if the vertices of e map to
diﬀerent vertices of G. The homomorphism density of H in G is then
Y
E[ (p + Xe ǫ)].
e

Suppose that e1 , . . . , ek are edges of H with k < g. Since these edges form a forest, it follows that
E[Xe1 Xe2 . . . Xek ] = E[Xe1 ] · · · E[Xek ].
In particular, since E[Xe ] = 0, this implies that the coeﬃcient of ǫi is zero for i = 1, . . . , g − 1 and,
therefore, G satisﬁes PH,p (δ) with δ = O(ǫg ).
It is not hard to verify that Conjecture 4.1 holds when H is an even cycle. Combining this observation
with other known results allows us to prove the conjecture for some reasonably broad classes of graphs.
13

For example, Theorem 1.1 in [4] implies that if H is a bipartite graph with m edges which has two
vertices in one part complete to the other part and minimum degree at least two in the ﬁrst part, then
the homomorphism density tH (G) satisﬁes tH (G) ≥ tC4 (G)m/4 . Therefore, if tH (G) ≤ pm (1 + ǫ4 ), we
8 4
have tC4 (G) ≤ p4 (1 + ǫ4 )4/m ≤ p4 (1 + m
ǫ ) and the required result for H follows from the C4 case. As
with the forcing conjecture, similar arguments can likely prove Conjecture 4.1 for many of the graphs
for which Sidorenko’s conjecture is known to hold. On the other hand, our second-order Sidorenko
conjecture may be easier to disprove than the conjecture itself.
