Abstract. By use of a natural map introduced recently by the first and third authors
from the space of pure-type complex differential forms on a complex manifold to the
corresponding one on the small differentiable deformation of this manifold, we will give
a power series proof for Kodaira-Spencer’s local stability theorem of Kähler structures.
We also obtain two new local stability theorems, one of balanced structures on an ndimensional balanced manifold with the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma by power series
method and the other one on p-Kähler structures with the deformation invariance of
(p, p)-Bott-Chern numbers.

1. Introduction
The local stability of some special complex structure is an interesting topic in deformation theory of complex structures and the power series method, initiated by KodairaNirenberg-Spencer and Kuranishi, plays a prominent role there. One main goal of this
paper is to present a power series proof for the classical Kodaira-Spencer’s local stability

of Kähler structures, which is a problem at latest dated back to [37, Remark 1 on Page
180]: ”A good problem would be to find an elementary proof (for example, using power
series methods)”.
Theorem 1.1 ([27, Theorem 15]). Let π : X → B be a differentiable family of compact
complex manifolds. If a fiber X0 := π −1 (t0 ) admits a Kähler metric, then, for a sufficiently
small neighborhood U of t0 on B, the fiber Xt := π −1 (t) over any point t ∈ U still admits
a Kähler metric, which depends smoothly on t and coincides for t = t0 with the given
Kähler metric on X0 .
The other goal is to prove a new local stability theorem of balanced structures when
the reference fiber satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma, a new-type ∂∂-lemma, using
the power series method developed above, and also one of p-Kähler structures with the
deformation invariance of (p, p)-Bott-Chern numbers by two different proofs.
This paper is a sequel to [34, 39], whose notions are adopted here. All manifolds in
this paper are assumed to be compact complex n-dimensional manifolds. The symbol
Ap,q (X, E) stands for the space of the holomorphic vector bundle E-valued (p, q)-forms
on a complex manifold X. A Beltrami differential on X, generally denoted by φ, is
an element in A0,1 (X, TX1,0 ), where TX1,0 denotes the holomorphic tangent bundle of X.
Then ιφ or φy denotes the contraction operator with respect to φ ∈ A0,1 (X, TX1,0 ) or other
analogous vector-valued complex differential forms alternatively if there is no confusion.
We also follow the convention
∞
X
1 k
♠
(1.1)
e =
♠ ,
k!
k=0

where ♠k denotes k-time action of the operator ♠. Since the dimension of X is finite,
the summation in the above formulation is always finite.
We will always consider the differentiable family π : X → B of compact complex
n-dimensional manifolds over a sufficiently small domain in Rk with the reference fiber
X0 := π −1 (t0 ) and the general fibers Xt := π −1 (t). For simplicity we set k = 1. Denote
by ζ := (ζjα (z, t)) the holomorphic coordinates of Xt induced by the family with the
holomorphic coordinates z := (z i ) of X0 , under a coordinate covering {Uj } of X, when
t is assumed to be fixed, as the standard notions in deformation theory described at the
beginning of [37, Chapter 4]. This family induces a canonical differentiable family of
integrable Beltrami differentials on X0 , denoted by ϕ(z, t), ϕ(t) and ϕ interchangeably,
to be explained at the beginning of Section 2.
In [39], the first and third authors introduce an extension map
ι

e ϕ(t)

|ιϕ(t)

: Ap,q (X0 ) → Ap,q (Xt ),

which plays an important role in this paper.

Definition 1.2. For s ∈ Ap,q (X0 ), we define

eιϕ(t) |ιϕ(t) (s) = si1 ···ip j1 ···jq (z(ζ)) eιϕ(t) dz i1 ∧ · · · ∧ dz ip

where s is locally written as



∧ eιϕ(t) dz j1 · · · ∧ dz jq



,

s = si1 ···ip j1 ···jq (z)dz i1 ∧ · · · ∧ dz ip ∧ dz j1 · · · ∧ dz jq
ι

and the operators eιϕ(t) , e ϕ(t) follow the convention (1.1). It is easy to check that this
map is a real linear isomorphism as in [39, Lemma 2.8].
Now let us describe our approach to reprove Kodaira-Spencer’s local stability of Kähler
structures. We will use Kuranishi’s completeness theorem [29] to reduce the proof to
2

Kuranishi family ̟ : K → T and a power series method to construct a natural Kähler
extension ω̃t of the Kähler form ω0 on X0 , such that ω̃t is a Kähler form on the general
fiber ̟ −1 (t) = Xt . More precisely, the extension is given by
eιϕ |ιϕ : A1,1 (X0 ) → A1,1 (Xt ),

ω0 → ω̃t := eιϕ |ιϕ (ω(t)),

where ω(t) is a family of smooth (1, 1)-forms on X0 , depending smoothly on t, and
ω(0) = ω0 . This method is developed in [35, 43, 44, 34, 51, 52, 39]. The following
proposition will be used many times in this paper:
Proposition 1.3 ([34, Theorem 3.4], [39, Proposition 2.2]). Let φ ∈ A0,1 (X, TX1,0 ). Then
on the space A∗,∗ (X),
(1.2)

d ◦ eιφ = eιφ (d + ∂ ◦ ιφ − ιφ ◦ ∂ − ι∂φ− 1 [φ,φ] ).
2

By a careful use of Proposition 1.3, we can show that d(eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (ω)) = 0 with ω ∈ A1,1 (X0 )
is equivalent to
(
¯
([∂, ιϕ ] + ∂)(1
− ϕ̄ϕ)yω = 0,
(1.3)
¯
([∂, ιϕ̄ ] + ∂)(1 − ϕϕ̄)yω = 0.

In this paper we always use the notations: ϕϕ = ϕyϕ, ϕϕ = ϕyϕ and 1 is the identity
operator defined as:
!
n
n
X
X
∂
∂
1
i
i
dz ⊗ i +
dz̄ ⊗ i
1=
p+q
∂z
∂ z̄
i
i

when it acts on (p, q)-forms of a complex manifold. Obviously, the identity operator is
a real operator. It is worth noticing that this definition is a little different from that in
[39], where for a (p, q)-form α on a complex manifold,
1
p+q

1(α) = (p + q) · α

since the constant factor
didn’t appear in that definition.
Then one has the crucial reduction:
Proposition 1.4 (=Proposition 2.7). If the power series
∞ X
X
ω(t) =
ωi,j ti t̄j
k=0 i+j=k

of (1, 1)-forms on X0 is a real formal solution of the system of equations
(
¯ = ∂(
¯ ϕ̄ϕyω − ϕyϕ̄yω) − ∂(ϕyω),
∂ω
(1.4)
¯ ϕ̄yω),
∂ω = ∂(ϕϕ̄yω − ϕ̄yϕyω) − ∂(
then it is also one of the system (1.3).
Base on Observation 2.11, one can solve the system (1.4) easily by the Kählerian condition on the reference fiber inductively. Then the Hölder convergence and regularity
argument in Subsections 2.3 and 2.4 gives rises to the desired Kähler form on the deformation Xt of X0 .
In Section 3, we will discuss the local stability problem of balanced structures on
¯
the complex manifolds also satisfying various ∂∂-lemmata. The (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂ ∂lemma is introduced in Subsection 3.1: an n-dimensional complex manifold X satisfies
¯
the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂ ∂-lemma,
if for any (n − 2, n)-complex differential form ξ on X,
there exists an (n − 2, n − 1)-form θ on X such that
∂∂θ = ∂ξ.
3

Then another main result of this paper can be described as follows:
Theorem 1.5 (=Theorem 3.11). Let X0 be a balanced manifold of complex dimension
n, satisfying the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma. Then Xt also admits a balanced metric for
t small.
Nilmanifolds with invariant abelian complex structures satisfy the (n − 1, n)-th mild
∂∂-lemma as shown in Corollary 3.4. Many examples and results, such as [8, Proposition
4.4, Remark 4.6, Remark 4.7 and Example 4.10] and [22, Corollary 8 and Corollary 9],
become consequences of this theorem.
It is an obvious generalization of C. Wu’s result [50, Theorem 5.13] that the balanced
structure is preserved under small deformation if the reference fiber satisfies the ∂∂lemma. Fu-Yau [22, Theorem 6] show that the balanced structure is deformation open,
assuming that the (n−1, n)-th weak ∂∂-lemma, introduced by them, holds on the general
fibers Xt for t 6= 0. Recall that the (n − 1, n)-th weak ∂∂-lemma on a compact complex
manifold X says that if for any real (n − 1, n − 1)-form ψ on X such that ∂ψ is ∂-exact,
there exists an (n − 2, n − 1)-form θ on X such that ∂∂θ = ∂ψ. It is well known from
[2] that a small deformation of the Iwasawa manifold, which satisfies the (2, 3)-th weak
∂∂-lemma but does not satisfy the mild one from Example 3.7, may not be balanced.
Thus, the condition ”(n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma” in Theorem 1.5 can’t be replaced by
the weak one. In [48, Example 3.7] or Example 3.13, Ugarte-Villacampa construct an
explicit family of nilmanifolds Iλ of complex dimension 3 with invariant balanced metric
on each fiber, for λ ∈ [0, 1). However, the general fiber Xt doesn’t satisfy the (n − 1, n)-th
weak ∂∂-lemma for t 6= 0. Fortunately, the mild one holds on the reference fiber and
thus, Fu-Yau’s theorem is not applicable to this example, while ours is applicable.
Based on Fu-Yau’s theorem, Angella-Ugarte [8, Theorem 4.9] prove that if X0 admits
a locally conformal balanced metric and satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th strong ∂∂-lemma, then
Xt is balanced for t small. They define the (n − 1, n)-th strong ∂∂-lemma of a complex
manifold X as: for any ∂-closed (n − 1, n)-form Γ on X of the type Γ = ∂ξ + ∂ψ, there
exists a suitable θ on X with ∂∂θ = Γ. Interestingly, a complex manifold satisfies the
(n − 1, n)-th strong ∂∂-lemma if and only if both of the mild one and the dual mild one
hold on it, and the (n − 1, n)-th dual mild ∂∂-lemma guarantees that a locally conformal
balanced metric is also a global one. The (n − 1, n)-th dual mild ∂∂-lemma refers to
n−1,n
n−1,n
that the induced mapping ιBC,∂
: HBC
(X) → H∂n−1,n (X) from the (n − 1, n)-th BottChern cohomology group by the identity map is injective. From this point of view, one
can understand Angella-Ugarte’s theorem more intrinsically. Besides, there indeed exist
examples that satisfy the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma but not the strong one, such as a
nilmanifold endowed with an invariant abelian complex structure from Corollary 3.4 and
[9, Proposition 2.9].
Similarly to the Kähler case, we will prove Theorem 1.5 in Subsection 3.2 by reducing
the proof to Kuranishi family and constructing a power series Ω(t) ∈ An−1,n−1 (X0 ) such
that

ιϕ |ιϕ̄

(Ω(t))) = 0,
d(e
(1.5)
Ω(t) = Ω(t),

Ω(0) = ω n−1,
where ω is the original balanced metric on X0 . By Proposition 1.3 again and setting
Ω̃(t) = e−ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ ◦ e−ιϕ ◦ eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (Ω(t)),
4

one reduces the obstruction system (1.5) of equations to:

(1.6)





 ∂¯ + ∂ ◦ ιϕ + ∂¯ ◦ ιϕ ◦ ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ + 2 ∂ ◦ ιϕ ◦ ιϕ ◦ ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ Ω̃(t) = 0,
∂ + ∂¯ ◦ ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ + ∂ ◦ ιϕ ◦ ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ Ω̃(t) = 0,

Ω̃(0) = ω n−1 ,

and solves this system formally also by the power series method, when the ”(n − 1, n)-th
mild ∂∂-lemma” just comes from the strategy of using Observation 2.11 to resolve (1.6).
Inspired by the Hölder convergence and regularity argument for the integrable Beltrami
differential ϕ(t) in the deformation theory of complex structures, we complete that of
Ω̃(t). The key point is to deal with the Green’s operator in the explicit canonical solution
of Ω̃(t) there.
The last section 4 is devoted to the local stability of p-Kähler structures. In Subsection
4.1, by means of Wu’s result [50, Theorem 5.13], we will use the cohomological method,
originally from [27], to get:
Proposition 1.6 (=Proposition 4.1). Let r and s be non-negative integers. Assume that
the reference fiber X0 satisfies the ∂∂-lemma. Then any d-closed (r, s)-form Ω0 and ∂0 ∂ 0 closed (r, s)-form Ψ0 on X0 can be extended unobstructed to a d-closed (r, s)-form Ωt and
a ∂t ∂ t -closed (r, s)-form Ψt on its small differentiable deformation Xt , respectively.
We can also prove this proposition in the (n − 1, n − 1)-case by another way inspired
by the results of [8, 22, 50]. It is impossible to prove Theorem 1.5 by this method since
the proof would rely on the deformation openness of (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma, which
contradicts with Ugarte-Villacampa’s Example 3.13.
Finally, in Subsection 4.2, we study some basic properties of p-Kähler structures, a
possibly more intrinsic notion for the local stabilities of complex structures. Based on
this study and (the proof of) Proposition 1.6, we use two different approaches to obtain:
Theorem 1.7 (= Theorem 4.9+ Remark 4.13). For any positive integer p ≤ n − 1, any
small differentiable deformation Xt of a p-Kähler manifold X0 satisfying the deformation
invariance of (p, p)-Bott-Chern numbers is still p-Kählerian.
Notation Without specially mentioned, the hermitian metrics will be identified with
their fundamental forms. We only consider the small differentiable deformations in this
paper, i.e., the parameter t is always assumed to be small. All sub-indices in the power
series, such as i, j, · · · , are set no less than zero, while Einstein sum convention is adopted
in the local settings and calculations. In many places, we fix a Kähler metric or a balanced
one on the reference fiber of the differentiable family to induce the dual operators and
the associated Hodge decomposition with respect to ∂ and ∂ on it. A complex differential
form, linear operator or current is called real if it is invariant under conjugation.

2. Stability of Kähler structures
We introduce some basics on deformation theory of complex structures to be used
throughout this paper. For holomorphic family of compact complex manifolds, we adopt
the definition [26, Defition 2.8]; while for differentiable one, we follow:
Definition 2.1 ([26, Defition 4.1]). Let X be a differentiable manifold, B a domain of Rk
and π a smooth map of X onto B. By a differentiable family of n-dimensional compact
complex manifolds we mean the triple π : X → B satisfying the following conditions:
(i) The rank of the Jacobian matrix of π is equal to k at every point of X;
(ii) For each point t ∈ B, π −1 (t) is a compact connected subset of X;
(iii) π −1 (t) is the underlying differentiable manifold of the n-dimensional compact complex manifold Xt associated to each t ∈ B;
(iv) There is a locally finite open covering {Uj | j = 1, 2, · · · } of X and complex-valued
smooth functions ζj1 (p), · · · , ζjn (p), defined on Uj such that for each t,
{p → (ζj1 (p), · · · , ζjn (p)) | Uj ∩ π −1 (t) 6= ∅}

form a system of local holomorphic coordinates of Xt .

Let us sketch Kodaira-Spencer’s proof of local stability theorem [27]. Let Ft be the
orthogonal projection to the kernel Ft of the first 4-th order Kodaira-Spencer operator
(also often called Bott-Chern Laplacian)
(2.1)

and Gt the corresponding Green’s operator with respect to a given Kähler metric α0 on
X0 . By a cohomological argument with the upper semi-continuity theorem, they prove
that Ft and Gt depend differentiably on t. Let
√
j
αt = −1gij̄ (ζ, t)dζ i ∧ dζ

be a hermitian metric on Xt and depends differentiably on t. Then they can construct
the desired the Kähler metric on Xt as
1
αet = (Ft αt + Ft αt ).
2
See also [49, Subsection 9.3].
Now let us describe our basic philosophy to reprove the Kodaira-Spencer’s local stability
of Kähler structures. By (the proof of) Kuranishi’s completeness theorem [29], for any
compact complex manifold X0 , there exists a complete holomorphic family ̟ : K → T
of complex manifolds at the reference point 0 ∈ T in the sense that for any differentiable
family π : X → B with π −1 (s0 ) = ̟ −1 (0) = X0 , there is a sufficiently small neighborhood
E ⊆ B of s0 , and smooth maps Φ : XE → K, τ : E → T with τ (s0 ) = 0 such that the
diagram commutes

Φ maps π −1 (s) biholomorphically onto ̟ −1 (τ (s)) for each s ∈ E, and
Φ : π −1 (s0 ) = X0 → ̟ −1 (0) = X0

is the identity map. This family is called Kuranishi family and constructed as follows.

Let {ην }m

differentiable family κ : M → P with s0 ∈ P and κ−1 (s0 ) = X0 , there is a neighborhood
V ⊆ P of s0 such that κ : κ−1 (V ) → V is trivial. Then one can construct a holomorphic
family

It is obvious that ϕ(t) satisfies the equation
1 ∗
ϕ(t) = ϕ1 + ∂ G[ϕ(t), ϕ(t)].
2
Let
T = {t | H[ϕ(t), ϕ(t)] = 0}.
Thus, for each t ∈ T , ϕ(t) satisfies
(2.5)

1
¯
∂ϕ(t)
= [ϕ(t), ϕ(t)],

and determines a complex structure Xt on the underlying differentiable manifold of X0 .
More importantly, ϕ(t) represents the complete holomorphic family ̟ : K → T of complex manifolds. Roughly speaking, Kuranishi family ̟ : K → T contains all sufficiently
small differentiable deformations of X0 .
By means of these, one can reduce the local stability Theorem 1.1 to the Kuranishi
family by shrinking E if necessary, that is, it suffices to construct a Kähler metric on
each Xt . From now on, one uses ϕ(t) and ϕ interchangeably to denote this holomorphic
family of integrable Beltrami differentials, and assumes m = 1 for simplicity.
Using this reduction, we should construct a natural Kähler extension ω̃t of a given
Kähler metric ω0 on X0 , such that ω̃t is a Kähler metric on the general fiber ̟ −1 (t) = Xt .
More precisely, the extension is given by
eιϕ |ιϕ : A1,1 (X0 ) → A1,1 (Xt ),

ω0 → ω̃t := eιϕ |ιϕ (ω(t)),

where ω(t) is a family of smooth (1, 1)-forms on X0 , depending smoothly on t, and
ω(0) = ω0 . As we need to construct a Kähler extension, the following conditions appear:

(1) d eιϕ |ιϕ (ω(t)) = 0,
(2) ω(t) = ω(t).
As t is sufficiently small, ω(t) is positive by the convergence argument and thus eιϕ |ιϕ (ω(t))
is a Kähler form on Xt . Here we will use an elementary power series method to complete
the construction.

2.1. Obstruction equations. We will discuss the obstruction equation to extend the dclosed pure-type complex differential forms on a complex manifold to the ones on its small
differentiable deformation in this subsection. The argument in this and next subsections
is applicable to a general differentiable family of complex manifolds.
For a general α ∈ Ap,q (X0 ), by Proposition 1.3 and the integrability condition (2.5),
one has

−ι

and the operators e−ιϕ(t) , e ϕ(t) also follow the convention (1.1) as in the proof of [39,
Lemma 2.8]. We introduce one more new notation ` to denote the simultaneous contraction on each component of a complex differential form. For example, (1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)`α
means that the operator (1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄) acts on α simultaneously as:
(2.8)

(1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)`(fi1 ···ip j1 ···jq dz i1 ∧ · · · ∧ dz is ∧ dz̄ j1 ∧ · · · ∧ dz̄ jt )

=fi1 ···ip j1 ···jq (1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)ydz i1 ∧ · · · ∧ (1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)ydz is

∧ (1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)ydz̄ j1 ∧ · · · ∧ (1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)ydz̄ jt ,

if α is locally expressed by:
α = fi1 ···ip j1 ···jq dz i1 ∧ · · · ∧ dz ip ∧ dz̄ j1 ∧ · · · ∧ dz̄ jq .
This new simultaneous contraction is well-defined since ϕ(t) is a global (1, 0)-vector valued
(0, 1)-form on X0 (See [37, Pages 150 − 151]) as reasoned in [39, Proof of Lemma 2.8].
Notice that (1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)`α 6= 1`α − ϕ̄ϕ`α + ϕ̄`α in general. Using this notation, one
can rewrite the extension map eιϕ |ιϕ̄ in Definition 1.2:
eιϕ |ιϕ̄ = (1 + ϕ + ϕ̄)`.
Then one has:
Lemma 2.2. For any α ∈ Ap,q (X0 ),
(2.9)

e−ιϕ ◦ eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (α) = (1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)`α.

where the last equality holds by
(1 + ϕ)y(1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)ydz ik = (1 + ϕ)ydz ik
and
(1 + ϕ)y(1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)ydz̄ jk = (1 − ϕ̄ϕ + ϕ̄)ydz̄ jk + (ϕ̄ϕ)ydz̄ jk = (1 + ϕ̄)ydz̄ jk .
Therefore, (2.9) is proved by (2.10) and (2.11).

From the original proof of the stability theorem sketched at the beginning of this
section, one knows that the system (2.15) of obstruction equations indeed has a real
solution α(t) ∈ A1,1 (Xt ) with α(0) = ω(0). To get this solution by a power series method,
we will formulate an effective obstruction system (2.17) of equations in Proposition 2.7
for (2.15).
We will use the commutator formula repeatedly, which is originated from [45, 46] and
whose various versions appeared in [20, 10, 32, 35, 12] and also [33, 34] for vector bundle
valued forms.
Lemma 2.5. For φ, ψ ∈ A0,1 (X, TX1,0 ) and α ∈ A∗,∗ (X) on a complex manifold X,
(2.16)

[φ, ψ]yα = −∂(ψy(φyα)) − ψy(φy∂α) + φy∂(ψyα) + ψy∂(φyα).

There are several formulae to be established, whose proofs are given in Appendix 5.
Proposition 2.6. Let φ ∈ A0,1 (TX1,0 ) and α ∈ Ap,q (X) on a complex manifold X. Then
we have:
(1)
(2)
(3)

φyφyα − (φyφ)yα = φyφyα − (φyφ)yα.
[φ, φ]yφyα = 2φy∂(φyφyα) − φyφy∂(φyα).
For ψ ∈ Ar,s (TX1,0 ), ∂(ψyα) = (∂ψ)yα + (−1)r+s+1 ψy∂α.
In particular, if ψ ∈ A1,0 (TX1,0 ) or A0,1 (TX1,0 ), then
∂(ψyα) = (∂ψ)yα + ψy∂α.

(4)

φyφyφyα − φyφyφyα = 2(φyφφyα − φφyφyα).
In particular, if α ∈ A1,1 (X), then one has
φyφyφyα = 2(φyφφyα),
since φyφyφyα = 0 and φφyφyα = 0.

We first explain the homogenous notation for a power series to be used here and
henceforth. Assuming that α(t) is a power series of (bundle-valued) (p, q)-forms, expanded
as
∞ X
X
α(t) =
αi,j ti t̄j ,
k=0 i+j=k

one uses the notation

(
P
α(t) = ∞
k=0 αk ,
P
j
αk = i+j=k αi,j ti t ,
10

where αk is the k-degree homogeneous part in the expansion of α(t) and all αi,j are
smooth (bundle-valued) (p, q)-forms on X0 with α(0) = α0,0 . Similarly, according to the
expansion (2.2), one will also adopt this notation to other terms related with ϕ, such as
−1

(1 − ϕϕ) yϕ =


(1 − ϕϕ)−1 yϕ k ,


where (1 − ϕϕ)−1 yϕ k stands for the k-degree homogeneous part of the power series
(1 − ϕϕ)−1 yϕ in t, t̄. Then we come to the crucial reduction:
Proposition 2.7. If the power series
ω(t) =

∂ω = ∂(ϕϕ̄yω − ϕ̄yϕyω) − ∂(

up to the degree N, then ∂(ϕ(t)yω(t))k = 0 for each 0 ≤ k ≤ N + 1 and thus ω(t) is also
one real formal solution of the system (2.15) up to the degree N.
We will realize the importance of the ∂-closedness ∂(ϕ(t)yω(t))N +1 = 0, which fulfills
(2.20) in Observation 2.11 under the Kähler condition and guarantees the existence of a
real solution of (2.17)N +1 , the equation (2.17) at the (N + 1)-th degree.
Proof. Comparing the power series expansion of the equations (2.15) and (2.17), we use
induction on the degrees to complete the proof.
P
Denote by ωk the homogenous k-part of the power series ω(t), i.e., ωk = i+j=k ωi,j ti t̄j .
Without danger of confusion, we will use ϕ and ω to denote ϕ(t) and ω(t), respectively.
The case N = 0 is trivial. By induction, assuming that the proposition holds for the
degrees ≤ N − 1, we need to show the proposition for the degree N. That is, if (2.17)k
has a real solution and
∂(ϕyω)k = 0
for the degrees k ≤ N, then we will show that this solution is also one for the system
(2.15)N and satisfies ∂(ϕyω)N +1 = 0. Without loss of generality, we always assume that
N ≥ 4 since the lower-degree cases are also obtained by the same formulation as follows.
Here is an important observation.
Observation 2.8.
k ≤ N + 1.

∂(ϕyω)k = 0,

Let us show it. We will omit the sub-index in many places without danger of confusion. By use of (3) and (2) in Proposition 2.6, the integrability condition (2.5) and the

Therefore, ∂(ϕyω)N = 0 reduces to the equality
∂(ϕyω)k = 0,

which are easily to be checked by the above formulation. This concludes the proof of

whose left-hand side is exactly the difference of the first equations in (2.17)N and (2.15)N .
Therefore, this real solution of the first equation in (2.17)N is also that in (2.15)N , and
similarly for the second equations in (2.15)N and (2.17)N .

2.2. Construction of power series. For the resolution of the system (2.17), we need
¯
several more lemmas. As usual, the ∂ ∂-lemma
refers to: for every pure-type d-closed
¯
¯
form on X0 , the properties of d-exactness, ∂-exactness, ∂-exactness
and ∂ ∂-exactness
are
equivalent.
Lemma 2.9. Let X be a complex manifold satisfying the ∂∂-lemma. Consider the system
of equations:
(
∂x = β,
(2.18)
∂x = γ,
where β, γ are (p + 1, p)-forms on X. The system of equations (2.18) has a solution if
and only if the following three statements hold:
(1) ∂β + ∂γ = 0,
(2) The ∂-equation ∂x = β has a solution,
(3) The ∂-equation ∂x = γ has a solution.
Proof. If the system (2.18) has a solution η, then both the ∂- and ∂-equations have
solutions. And it is easy to see that
∂β + ∂γ = ∂∂η + ∂∂η = 0.
Conversely, let η1 be a solution of the ∂-equation, η2 a solution of the ∂-equation with
β, γ satisfying ∂β + ∂γ = 0, which yields that ∂η1 = β.
We claim that there exists some τ ∈ Ap,p−1(X) such that η2 + ∂τ satisfies the system
(2.18). In fact, it is obvious that η2 + ∂τ satisfies the second equation of (2.18). As to
the first one, we only need to show that β − ∂η2 is ∂∂-exact. It is easy to check that
∂(β − ∂η2 ) = ∂β + ∂γ = 0.

And note that β − ∂η2 is ∂-exact by the equality

β − ∂η2 = ∂(η1 − η2 ).

From the ∂∂-Lemma, there exists some τ ∈ Ap,p−1(X) such that β − ∂η2 = ∂∂τ , equivalently saying that η2 + ∂τ satisfies the first equation of (2.18). Therefore, the claim is

proved and η2 + ∂τ is the solution of the system (2.18).
13

Corollary 2.10. Let X be a complex manifold satisfying the ∂∂-lemma. The system of
equations:
(
∂x = β,
(2.19)
∂x = β,
where β is a (p + 1, p)-form on X, has a real solution if and only if the following two
statements hold:
(1) ∂β + ∂β = 0,
(2) The ∂-equation ∂x = β has a solution.
Proof. If η2 is a solution of the ∂-equation and ∂β + ∂β = 0, it is clear that η2 satisfies
the ∂-equation ∂η2 = β. Then Lemma 2.9 assures that the system (2.19) of equations
admits a solution, denoted by η. And η+η
will be a real solution of the system (2.19). 
2
Since β and γ involved in this paper are mostly ∂-exact and ∂-exact, respectively, such
as (2.17), we have:
Observation 2.11. Let β = ∂ζ and γ = ∂ξ for some suitable-type complex differential
forms ζ and ξ, respectively, which automatically fulfill the condition (1) in Lemma 2.9.
The conditions (2) and (3) rely on the equalities
(
∂β = ∂(∂ζ) = 0,
(2.20)
∂γ = ∂(∂ξ) = 0.
Then the ∂∂-lemma will produce µ and ν, satisfying the equations
(
∂∂µ = ∂ζ = β,
(2.21)
∂∂ν = ∂ξ = γ.
The combined expression
(2.22)

∂µ + ∂ν

is our choice for the solution of the system (2.18), which will be slightly modified to
∂µ + ∂ µ̄
as the real solution of the system (2.19), when β happens to equal to γ.
∗

Recall a useful fact that ∂ G∂ y is the unique solution, minimizing the L2 -norms of all
the solutions, of the equation
∂x = y
on a compact complex manifold if the equation admits one, where x, y are complex
differential forms of pure types and the operator G∂ denotes the corresponding Green’s
operator of the ∂-Laplacian . In the Kähler case, we choose
∗

∂µ = ∂ ∗ G∂ (∂ζ) = ∂ ∗ G∂ β

∗

and ∂ν = ∂ G∂ (∂ξ) = ∂ G∂ γ,

where G∂ and G∂ coincide, with a uniform symbol G used afterwards. Then an explicit
solution of the system (2.18) can be taken as
∗

∗

x = ∂ ∗ G∂ζ + ∂ G∂ξ = ∂ ∗ Gβ + ∂ Gγ.
When β happens to equal to γ, one takes the real solution of the system (2.19) as
(2.23)

∗

∗

x = ∂ ∗ G∂ζ + ∂ G∂ζ = ∂ ∗ Gβ + ∂ Gβ

and accordingly, notices that the operator G is real in this case.
By these, one is able to obtain the main result of this section:

manifold X0 . Therefore, we can construct a smooth Kähler metric eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (ω(t)) on Xt .
Proof. We are going to present such an explicit expression for the solution of the obstruction equation (2.17), whose existence is assured by Proposition 2.7 and the remarks after
it, with the initial metric ω(0) = ω0 . The first-order system of equations

ω1 = ∂∂ G(ϕ1 yω0 ) + ∂∂ ∗ G(ϕ̄1 yω0 ).

Then we use induction and (2.26) to get:

(2.32) and ω (1) , ω (2) ≪ A(t) according to the above formulation, which are obviously
possible as long as t is small and we notice that the Hölder norm depends on the choice
of the local coordinate charts when defined a differential manifold as pointed out on [26,
Page 275]. Therefore, for small t, ω(t) converges in the C k,α-norm and thus its positivity
follows.
2.4. Regularity argument. In this subsection we proceed to the regularity argument
for the power series constructed as above since there is possibly no uniform lower bound
for the convergence radius obtained in the last subsection in the C k,α -norm as k converges
to +∞. We resort to the elliptic operator, the ∂-Laplacian
∗

(2.33)

∗

 = ∂ ∂ + ∂∂ .

Here the dual operators are defined with respect to the fixed original Kähler metric ω0 .
By the classical Kähler identity, Hodge decomposition and the induced commutativity of
the associated operators, one has

ω = (ϕ̄ϕyω − ϕyϕ̄yω) + ∂∂ G(ϕyω) + ∂∂ G(ϕyω)

∗

= (ϕ̄ϕyω − ϕyϕ̄yω) + ∂∂ (ϕyω) + ∂∂ (ϕyω)
according to the solution (2.29).

Consequently, ω is a solution of the two-order partial differential equation
(2.34)

∗

ω − (ϕ̄ϕyω − ϕyϕ̄yω) − ∂∂ (ϕyω) − ∂∂ ∗ (ϕ̄yω) = 0.

Similarly to the argument on [26, Page 281], writing out the last three terms in the
left-hand side of (2.34) locally, we can find that the expressions of their principal parts
(i.e., the highest-order terms) contain factors from ϕ̄ϕ, ϕ, or ϕ̄. Since ϕ(t) → 0 as
t → 0, taking sufficiently small ǫ-disk ∆ǫ ⊆ C, we can assume that the equation (2.34)
is a linear elliptic partial differential equation of ω on X0 when noticing the ellipticity of
an operator only concerns about its principal part. Thus, the interior estimates [19] for
elliptic systems of partial differential equations give rises to the desired regularity of ω(t),
i.e., ω(t) is smooth on X0 for each t smaller than a uniform upper bound to be obtained
similarly to [26, Appendix.§8]. Then ω(t) can be regarded as a real analytic family of
(1, 1)-forms in t and it is smooth on t by [28, Proposition 2.2.3].

3. Stability of balanced structures with (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂ ∂-lemma
In this section we will discuss the local stability problem of balanced structures, satisfying various ∂∂-lemmata. Recall that a balanced metric ω on an n-dimensional complex
manifold is a real positive (1, 1)-form, satisfying that
d(ω n−1) = 0,
and a complex manifold is called balanced if there exists a balanced metric ω on it. Note
that the existence of a balanced metric ω is equivalent to that of a d-closed real positive
(n − 1, n − 1)-form Ω with the relation Ω = ω n−1 (see [36, (4.8)]).

and examples. We are going to study a new

kind of ”∂∂-lemma”, its relations with various analogous conditions in the literature and
its examples involved.

There are three more similar conditions in relevance with the local stability of balanced
structures. The (n − 1, n)-th weak ∂∂-lemma on the compact complex manifold X,
introduced by Fu-Yau [22], says that if for any real (n − 1, n − 1)-form ψ such that ∂ψ is
∂-exact, there exists an (n − 2, n − 1)-form θ, satisfying
∂∂θ = ∂ψ.
And the (n − 1, n)-th strong ∂∂-lemma, proposed by Angella-Ugarte [8], states that the
n−1,n
n−1,n
mapping ιBC,A
: HBC
(X) → HAn−1,n (X), induced by the identity map, is injective,
which is equivalent to that for any ∂-closed (n − 1, n)-form Γ of the type Γ = ∂ξ + ∂ψ,
there exists an (n − 2, n − 1)-form θ such that
∂∂θ = Γ.
Angella-Ugarte [8, Theorem 3.1] show that the (n − 1, n)-th strong ∂∂-lemma amounts to
the sGG condition and the vanishing of the first ∂∂-degree ∆1 (X), with the deformation
openness of the (n − 1, n)-th strong ∂∂-lemma proved in [8, Proposition 4.8]. They also
show in [8, Corollary 3.3] the equivalence:
n−1,n
(X) = dimC HAn−1,n (X)
the (n − 1, n)-th strong ∂∂-lemma ⇐⇒ dimC HBC
0,1
⇐⇒ dimC HBC
(X) = dimC HA0,1 (X)

⇐⇒ b1 = 2 dimC HA0,1 (X).

n−1,n
n−1,n
Besides, the condition that the induced mapping ιBC,∂
: HBC
(X) → H∂n−1,n (X) by
the identity map is injective, is presented by Angella-Ugarte [9] to study local conformal
balanced structures and global ones, which we may call the (n − 1, n)-th dual mild ∂∂lemma.
After a simple check, we have the following observation:

Observation 3.2. The compact complex manifold X satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th strong
∂∂-lemma if and only if both of the mild one and the dual mild one hold on X.
And the mild one and the dual mild one both imply the weak one. All the four ”∂∂lemmata” hold if the compact complex manifold X satisfies the standard ∂∂-lemma.
We refer the readers to [40, 48, 30, 6] as the background materials on the theory of
nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds to be focused on in the rest of this subsection.
Recall that a nilmanifold M with left-invariant complex structure is a compact quotient
of a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group G of real even dimension by a lattice Γ of
maximal rank, whose Lie algebra g admits an integrable complex structure J. It is clear
that the invariant complex structure J on G descends to M in a natural way and it is
given by an endomorphism J : g → g of the Lie algebra g such that J 2 = −1, satisfying
the ”Nijenhuis condition”
[JX, JY ] = J[JX, Y ] + J[X, JY ] + [X, Y ],
for any X, Y ∈ g.
Let gC be the complexification of g and g∗C its√dual. We denote by g1,0 and g0,1 the
eigenspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues ± −1 of J as an endomorphism of g∗C ,

As for nilpotent Lie algebras g, Salamon [41] proves the equivalence: J is a complex

d̟ i ∈ I(̟ 1 , · · · , ̟ i−1), for i = 2, · · · , n,

where I(̟ 1, · · · , ̟ i−1 ) is the ideal in ∧∗ g∗C generated by {̟ 1, · · · , ̟ i−1}. The work [15]
shows that a complex structure J is nilpotent if and only if g1,0 admits a basis {̟ i }ni=1
with d̟ 1 = 0 and
d̟ i ∈ ∧2 h̟ 1 , · · · , ̟ i−1, ̟

otherwise
J is non-nilpotent. Abelian complex structures satisfy additionally that dg1,0 ⊂

Inspired by Ugarte-Villacampa [48, Proposition 3.4 and Corollary 3.5], one has:

Proposition 3.3. Let M = Γ\G be a 2n-dimensional nilmanifold endowed with an invariant complex structure J (i.e., complex n-dimensional M) and g the Lie algebra of G.
n−2,n
If (g, J) satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma and H∂n−2,n (M, J) ∼
(g, J), then
= H∂
(M, J) satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma.
Proof. Let ξ be an (n − 2, n)-complex differential form on M. From the isomorphism
n−2,n
H∂n−2,n (M, J) ∼
(g, J) and [48, Remark 3.3], there exists an (n − 2, n − 1)-form θ
= H∂
on M such that
ξ = ξν + ∂θ,
V
where ξν denotes the image of ξ under the symmetrization process Ap,q (M) → p,q (g∗ ).
The (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma on (g, J) implies that
for some θ̃ ∈

∂∂ θ̃ = ∂ξν

∂ξ = ∂∂(θ̃ + θ).

with the abelian complex structure J (cf. [13, Remark 4], [40, Theorem 1.10] and the

Similarly with [48, Proposition 3.2], we have
Proposition 3.5. Let M = Γ\G be a 2n-dimensional nilmanifold endowed with an invariant complex structure J with g the Lie algebra of G. If (g, J) does not satisfy the
(n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma, then (M, J) does not satisfy the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma
either.
Proof. Suppose that the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma holds on (M, J), that is, for any
(n − 2, n)-form ξ on M, there exists a (n − 2, n − 1)-form θ such that
∂∂θ = ∂ξ.

Using the symmetrization process (cf. the proof of [48, Proposition 3.2]) on the both
sides, we have
∂∂θν = ∂ξν ,
which contradicts the assumption on the Lie algebra level (g, J). Here the equalities
and (∂α)ν = ∂αν

(∂α)ν = ∂αν

for any α ∈ Ap,q (M) are used as in the proof of [48, Proposition 3.2].



The following result of the (n − 1, n)-th dual mild ∂∂-lemma is almost the same as the
mild one in Propositions 3.3 and 3.5, for which we omit the proofs.

Proposition 3.6. Let M = Γ\G be a 2n-dimensional nilmanifold endowed with an invariant complex structure J and g the Lie algebra of G. If (g, J) satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th
n−1,n
n−1,n
dual mild ∂∂-lemma and HBC
(M, J) ∼
= HBC (g, J), then (M, J) satisfies the (n−1, n)th dual mild ∂∂-lemma; Similarly if (g, J) does not satisfy the (n − 1, n)-th dual mild
∂∂-lemma, then (M, J) does not satisfy the (n − 1, n)-th dual mild ∂∂-lemma.
Example 3.7. The complex structure in the category (i) of [48, Proposition 2.3], i.e., the
complex parallelizable case of complex dimension 3, satisfies the (2, 3)-th weak ∂∂-lemma
and the dual mild one, but does not satisfy the mild one. The Iwasawa manifold belongs
to the category (i).

Proof. Let J be the complex structure in the category (i), which satisfies the (2, 3)-th
weak ∂∂-lemma by the proof of [48, Proposition 3.6]. It is easy to check that, on the Lie
algebra level,

and thus (2, 3)-th mild ∂∂-lemma does not hold on the nilmanifold, from Proposition 3.5.
Here ω 31̄2̄3̄ denotes ω 3 ∧ ω 1 ∧ ω 2 ∧ ω 3 as the notation used in [48]. Also, it is clear that

(g, J) satisfies the (2, 3)-th dual mild ∂∂-lemma, with HBC
(M, J) ∼

the nilmanifold by Proposition 3.6.

An invariant balanced Hermitian structure F on a nilmanifold M is the one, coming
from a balanced Hermitian structure on the Lie algebra g∗ .
Proposition 3.8. Let M be a 6-dimensional nilmanifold endowed with an invariant
balanced Hermitian structure (J, F ). Then (M, J) satisfies the (2, 3)-th mild ∂∂-lemma
if and only if J is abelian or non-nilpotent, and (M, J) satisfies the (2, 3)-th dual mild
∂∂-lemma if and only if J is complex parallelizable.
21

Proof. It is known, from [48, Proposition 3.6], (M, J) satisfies the (2, 3)-th weak ∂∂-lemma
if and only if J abelian, complex parallelizable or non-nilpotent. Example 3.7 shows that
the complex parallelizable case satisfies the (2, 3)-th dual mild ∂∂-lemma but does not
satisfy the mild one. Corollary 3.4 and [9, Proposition 2.9] say that a 2n-dimensional
nilmanifold endowed with an invariant abelian complex structure satisfies the (n−1, n)-th
mild ∂∂-lemma but never satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th dual mild ∂∂-lemma, especially for
the situation of the 6-dimension (i.e., complex dimension 3) here. Hence, the only left to
check is the non-nilpotent case.
As shown in the proof of [48, Proposition 3.6], the equality holds

induces an isomorphism in the ∂-cohomology in this case. Therefore, (M, J) with the

3.3. Meanwhile, it should be noted that

∂ω 132̄3̄ = ± −1ω 121̄2̄3̄ and ∂ω 121̄2̄3̄ = 0,

Then Proposition 3.6 tells us that (M, J) with J non-nilpotent does not satisfy the (2, 3)th dual mild ∂∂-lemma.

Explicit examples of different complex structures in Proposition 3.8 have been provided
in [48]. Directly from Observation 3.2 and Proposition 3.8, one has:
Corollary 3.9. Let M be a 6-dimensional nilmanifold endowed with an invariant balanced
Hermitian structure (J, F ). Then the (2, 3)-th strong ∂∂-lemma does not hold on M, i.e.,
the mild one and dual mild one never hold simultaneously on M. Especially, the (n−1, n)th mild ∂∂-lemma and the dual mild one are unrelated.
Remark 3.10. The (2, 3)-th strong ∂∂-lemma can hold on the completely-solvable balanced Nakamura manifolds, with one concrete example given in [8, Example 4.10], which
0,1
is of complex dimension 3 and satisfies dimC HBC
(X) = dimC HA0,1 (X) = 1.
Let π : X → B be a differentiable family of compact n-dimensional complex manifolds
with the reference fiber π −1 (t0 ) = X0 and the general fibers Xt := π −1 (t). Here B
denotes a sufficiently small domain in Rk . Fu-Yau [22, Theorem 6] show that the balanced
structure is deformation open, assuming that the (n − 1, n)-th weak ∂∂-lemma holds on
the general fibers Xt for t 6= 0. Angella-Ugarte [8, Theorem 4.9] prove that if X0 admits
a locally conformal balanced metric and satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th strong ∂∂-lemma, then
Xt is balanced for t small. Our main result in this section, whose proof is postponed to
the next subsection, is
Theorem 3.11. Let X0 be a balanced manifold of complex dimension n, satisfying the
(n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma. Then Xt also admits a balanced metric for t small.
22

It is well known from [2] that small deformation of the Iwasawa manifold, which satisfies
the (2, 3)-th weak ∂∂-lemma but does not satisfy the mild one from Example 3.7, may
not be balanced. Thus, the condition ”(n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma” in Theorem 3.11
can’t be replaced by the weak one. It is an obvious generalization of Wu’s result [50,
Theorem 5.13] that the balanced condition is preserved under small deformation if the
reference fiber satisfies the ∂∂-lemma. Based on Corollary 3.4 and Proposition 3.8, one
obtains:
Corollary 3.12. Let M be a 2n-dimensional nilmanifold endowed with an invariant
abelian balanced Hermitian structure. Then small deformation of M is also balanced.
Moreover, in the case of 6-dimension, this result still holds when M is endowed with the
non-nilpotent balanced Hermitian structure.
Examples and results such as [8, Proposition 4.4, Remark 4.6, Remark 4.7 and Example
4.10] and [22, Corollary 8 and Corollary 9] become consequences of Theorem 3.11 and
Corollary 3.12. And it is interesting to note that 6-dimensional nilmanifolds endowed with
an invariant abelian or non-nilpotent balanced Hermitian structure provide solutions of
the Strominger system with respect to the Bismut connection or the Chern connection
in the anomaly cancellation condition, respectively. See [48, Section 5] and [47, Section
4] for more details.
Example 3.13 ([48, Example 3.7]). Ugarte-Villacampa constructed an explicit family
of nilmanifolds with invariant complex structures Iλ for λ ∈ [0, 1) (of complex dimension
3), with the fixed underlying manifold the Iwasawa manifold. The complex structure of
the reference fiber I0 is abelian and admits an invariant balanced metric, satisfying the
(2, 3)-th mild ∂∂-lemma by Proposition 3.8. The complex structures of Iλ for λ 6= 0 are
nilpotent from [14, Cororllary 2], but neither complex-parallelizable nor abelian. And
thus they do not satisfy the (2, 3)-th weak ∂∂-lemma by [48, Proposition 3.6]. However,
the nilmanifolds Iλ for λ 6= 0 admit balanced metrics.

The example above proves that neither the (n − 1, n)-th weak ∂∂-lemma nor the mild
one is deformation open. And it shows that the condition in [22, Theorem 6] is not a
necessary one for the deformation openness of balanced structures as mentioned in [48,
the discussion ahead of Example 3.7]. Fortunately, Corollary 3.12 can be applied to this
example. See also [8, Remark 4.7], where Corollary 3.12 can also be applied.
Meanwhile, from Corollary 3.4 and [9, Proposition 2.9], a 2n-dimensional nilmanifold
endowed with an invariant abelian complex structure satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂lemma but never satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th dual mild ∂∂-lemma. It implies that the
deformation openness of balanced structures with the reference fiber a 2n-dimensional
nilmanifold endowed with an invariant abelian balanced Hermitian structure can be obtained by Corollary 3.12, but it can’t be derived from [8, Theorem 4.9].
Besides, it is known that the deformation invariance of the dimensions of the (n−1, n−
n−1,n−1
1)-th Bott-Chern group HBC
(Xt ) can assure the deformation openness of balanced
structures as shown in [8, Proposition 4.1]. See also Proposition 4.1, which is a kind of
generalization of this result. However, [8, Example 4.10] shows that small deformation
of a completely-solvable Nakamura threefold, which is balanced and satisfies the (2, 3)-th
strong ∂∂-lemma, is also balanced. The (2, 2)-th Bott-Chern number varies along this
deformation. Fortunately, Theorem 3.11 is applicable to this case and also possibly to
some cases with deformation variance of (n − 1, n − 1)-th Bott-Chern number.
Finally, from the perspective of Theorem 3.11, we may have a clear picture of AngellaUgarte’s result [8, Theorem 4.9], which states that if X0 admits a locally conformal
balanced metric and satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th strong ∂∂-lemma, then Xt is balanced for
23

t small. Actually, the (n − 1, n)-th strong ∂∂-lemma decomposes into the mild one and
the dual mild one, according to Observation 3.2. A locally conformal balanced metric
can be transformed into a balanced one by the (n − 1, n)-th dual mild ∂∂-lemma, from [9,
Theorem 2.5]. Then the (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma assures that the deformation openness of balanced structures starts from the transformed balanced metric on the reference
fiber, thanks to Theorem 3.11.
3.2. Proof for stability of balanced structures with mild ∂∂-lemma. In this subsection, we will prove the local stability Theorem 3.11 of balanced structures with the
¯
balanced reference fiber X0 with the (n−1, n)-th mild ∂ ∂-lemma.
Similarly to the Kähler
case, we will reduce the proof to Kuranishi family as described in the beginning of Section
2.
Our goal is to construct a power series Ω(t) ∈ An−1,n−1 (X0 ) such that


(Ω(t))) = 0,
d(e
(3.1)
Ω(t) = Ω(t),

Ω(0) = ω n−1,

and show the Hölder C k,α -convergence and regularity of the power series Ω(t). Then it is
clear that eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (Ω(t))) will be a positive (n − 1, n − 1)-form on Xt for t small, due to the
positivity of its initial complex differential form ω n−1 and the convergence argument. By
the real property of eιϕ |ιϕ̄ as in [39, Lemma 2.8], it suffices to solve the following system
of equations
(
d(eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (Ω(t))) = 0,
(3.2)
Ω(0) = ω n−1,
from one solution Ω(t) of (3.2) becomes one of the system (3.1). The
since Ω(t)+Ω(t)
2
resolution of the system (3.2) below is a bit different from the one for the Kähler case,
which relies more on the form type (n − 1, n − 1).
As both eι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ and eιϕ are invertible operators when t is sufficiently small, it follows
that for any Ω ∈ An−1,n−1 (X0 ),

eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (Ω) = eιϕ ◦ eι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ ◦ e−ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ ◦ e−ιϕ ◦ eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (Ω).
Ω̃ = e−ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ ◦ e−ιϕ ◦ eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (Ω),

where Ω and Ω̃ are apparently one-to-one correspondence. And it is easy to check that
the operator
e−ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ ◦ e−ιϕ ◦ eιϕ |ιϕ̄
preserves the form types and thus Ω̃ is still an (n − 1, n − 1)-form. In fact, for any
(p, q)-form α on X0 , we will find
e−ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ ◦ e−ιϕ ◦ eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (α)

we obtain that
d(eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (Ω)) = d ◦ eιϕ ◦ eι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ (Ω̃)

where Proposition 1.3 is used in the second equality of (3.5) and the third equality results
from the form type of Ω̃.
By the invertibility of the operator eιϕ and the form-type comparison, the equation
d(eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (Ω)) = 0 amounts to
(
(∂¯ + [∂, ιϕ ])Ω̃ = 0,
(3.6)
∂ Ω̃ + (∂¯ + ∂ ◦ ιϕ ) ◦ ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ (Ω̃) = 0.
Then the second equation in (3.6) and Lemma 2.5 imply
ιϕ ◦ ∂ Ω̃ = −ιϕ ◦ (∂¯ + ∂ ◦ ιϕ ) ◦ ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ (Ω̃)

For the resolution of ∂∂-equations, we need a lemma due to [38, Theorem 4.1]:

Lemma 3.14. Let (X, ω) be a compact Hermitian complex manifold with the pure-type
complex differential forms x and y. Assume that the ∂∂-equation
(3.9)

∂∂x = y

admits a solution. Then an explicit solution of the ∂∂-equation (3.9) can be chosen as
(∂∂)∗ GBC y,
which uniquely minimizes the L2 -norms of all the solutions with respect to ω. Besides,
the equalities hold
GBC (∂∂) = (∂∂)GA

and (∂∂)∗ GBC = GA (∂∂)∗ ,

where GBC and GA are the associated Green’s operators of BC and A , respectively.
Here BC is defined in (2.1) and A is the second Kodaira-Spencer operator (often also
called Aeppli Laplacian)
∗

∗

∗

∗

∗

A = ∂ ∗ ∂ ∂∂ + ∂∂∂ ∗ ∂ + ∂∂ ∗ ∂∂ + ∂∂ ∂∂ ∗ + ∂∂ + ∂∂ ∗ .
Proof. We shall use the Hodge decomposition of BC on X:
(3.10)

∗

Ap,q (X) = ker BC ⊕ Im (∂∂) ⊕ (Im ∂ ∗ + Im ∂ ),

whose three parts are orthogonal to each other with respect to the L2 -scalar product
defined by ω, combined with the equality
1 = HBC + BC GBC ,
where HBC is the harmonic projection operator. And it should be noted that
(3.11)

ker BC = ker ∂ ∩ ker ∂ ∩ ker(∂∂)∗ .

Then two observations follow:
(1) BC ∂∂(∂∂)∗ = ∂∂(∂∂)∗ BC ;

25

(2) GBC ∂∂(∂∂)∗ = ∂∂(∂∂)∗ GBC .
It is clear that (1) implies (2). Actually, (1) yields
GBC BC ∂∂(∂∂)∗ GBC = GBC ∂∂(∂∂)∗ BC GBC .
A routine check shows that
and

GBC BC ∂∂(∂∂)∗ GBC = (1 − HBC )∂∂(∂∂)∗ GBC = ∂∂(∂∂)∗ GBC

GBC ∂∂(∂∂)∗ BC GBC = GBC ∂∂(∂∂)∗ (1 − HBC ) = GBC ∂∂(∂∂)∗ ;
while, the statement (1) is proved by a direct calculation:
BC ∂∂(∂∂)∗ = (∂∂)(∂∂)∗ (∂∂)(∂∂)∗ = ∂∂(∂∂)∗ BC .
Hence, one has
(∂∂)(∂∂)∗ GBC y = GBC (∂∂)(∂∂)∗ y = GBC BC y = (1 − HBC )y = y,

where y ∈ Im ∂∂ due to the solution-existence of the ∂∂-equation.
To see that the solution (∂∂)∗ GBC y is the unique L2 -norm minimum, we resort to the
Hodge decomposition of the operator A :
(3.12)

Ap,q (X) = ker A ⊕ (Im ∂ + Im ∂) ⊕ Im (∂∂)∗ ,
∗

where ker A = ker(∂∂)∩ker ∂ ∗ ∩ker ∂ . Let z be an arbitrary solution of the ∂∂-equation
(3.9), which decomposes into three components z1 + z2 + z3 with respect to the Hodge
decomposition (3.12) of A . By the Hodge theory of A , the equality holds
ker(∂∂) = ker A ⊕ (Im∂ + Im∂),

which implies that ∂∂(z1 + z2 ) = 0. Hence, it follows that
∂∂z = ∂∂z3 = y.
∗

After noticing that ∂ z3 = ∂ ∗ z3 = 0, we get
(∂∂)∗ y = (∂∂)∗ ∂∂z3 = A z3 ,
which implies that
Then it is obvious that
(3.13)

GA (∂∂)∗ y = GA A z3 = (1 − HA )z3 = z3 .
BC (∂∂) = ∂∂(∂∂)∗ ∂∂ = (∂∂)A ,

with GBC (∂∂) = (∂∂)GA established as well. Taking adjoint operators of both sides in
(3.13), we will find that
(∂∂)∗ BC = A (∂∂)∗ ,
implying the equality
(∂∂)∗ GBC = GA (∂∂)∗ .
And thus, we obtain that
z3 = GA (∂∂)∗ y = (∂∂)∗ GBC y.
Therefore,
kzk2 = kz1 k2 + kz2 k2 + kz3 k2 ≥ kz3 k2 = k(∂∂)∗ GBC yk2,
and the equality holds if and only if z1 = z2 = 0, i.e., z = z3 = (∂∂)∗ GBC y.



Now we arrive at:
Proposition 3.15. Let ω be a balanced metric on X0 , which satisfies the (n − 1, n)-th
¯
mild ∂ ∂-lemma.
Then the system (3.1) of equations is formally solved.
26

Proof. It suffices to resolve (3.8) with initial value Ω̃(0) = ω n−1. Actually, the solution
Ω̃(t) of the system (3.8), satisfying that Ω̃(0) = ω n−1 , corresponds to the one of (3.2), by
the relation below as in (3.4)
Ω̃(t) = e−ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ ◦ e−ιϕ ◦ eιϕ |ιϕ̄ (Ω(t)).

Therefore, we focus on


Ω̃(0) = ω n−1,

and solve this system of equations also by the iteration method used in the Kähler case.
Assume that Ω̃(t) can develop into a power series as follows:
(

Ω̃(t) = ∞
P k=0
Ω̃k = i+j=k Ω̃i,j ti t̄j ,

where Ω̃k is the k-degree homogeneous part in the expansion of Ω̃(t) and Ω̃i,j are all
smooth (n − 1, n − 1)-forms on X0 . Here we follow the notation described before Proposition 2.7. And in (2.31) the holomorphic family of integrable Beltrami differentials on
X0 develops a power series of Beltrami differentials in t as

(3.21)

ρlj (x, t) = ρj (x)η l (t).

Recall in the proof for ϕ(t) in [26, Appendix.§8], one should also set
χlj (x, t) = χj (x)η l (t),
where the smooth function χj (x) with sup χj ⊂ Xj is identically equal to 1 on some
neighborhood of the support of ρj . But here we will replace its role directly by η l (t) to
avoid the trouble caused by the presence of Green’s operator GBC .
First we will prove that η 3 Ω̃ is C k+1,α. Consider the equation:
(3.22)

(△hi ρ3j Ω̃) = F11 + F21 + F31 ,

where F11 , F21, F31 denote the three terms with respect to the ones in the right-hand side
of (3.19) after the corresponding operations, respectively, and i = 1, · · · , 2n. Here △hi is
the difference quotient as [26, Appendix.(8.14)]. In particular,

+ lower-order terms of Ω̃(t).
F21 = −△hi ρ3j ∂∂ ∂(∂∂)∗ GBC ∂ ι(1−ϕ̄ϕ)−1 ϕ̄ Ω̃(t)

In this proof the ”order” refers to the one of a pseudo-differential operator. Since  is
an elliptic linear differential operator whose principal part is of diagonal type, by [26,
29

Appendix.Theorem 2.3] and (3.22), one obtains the a priori estimate
k△hi ρ3j Ω̃kk,α ≤ Ck (kF11 + F21 + F31 kk−2,α + k△hi ρ3j Ω̃k0 )

(3.23)

≤ Ck (kF11 kk−2,α + kF21 kk−2,α + kF31 kk−2,α + k△hi ρ3j Ω̃k0 ),

where Ck is a positive constant, possibly depending on k. Now let us estimate the first
three terms in the right-hand side of the above inequality. Here we just estimate the
second one, the most troublesome one, since the other two terms are quite analogous.
We need an equality for the Green’s operator: Let E := E(x, D) be an elliptic linear
partial differential operator on a smooth manifold and GE , HE its associated Green’s
operator and orthogonal projection to ker E defined such as in [26, Appendix.Definition
7.2]. Then for any smooth function f and differential form ̟ on this manifold,

kF22 kk−2,α ≤ M21 A(r)k△hi Dβ (ρ5j Ω̃(t))kk,α + Mk+1 kη 5 Ω̃(t)kk+1,α kη 3 ϕkk+1,α ,

where M21 , Mk+1 are positive numbers. Crucially, M21 is exactly the same as in (3.27),
since the range of the function η l (t) is [0, 1] by (3.20), although Mk+1 is possibly different
from Mk in (3.27). Similarly, we are able to get the analogous estimates for F12 and F32
with the positive constants M11 and M31 , which are the same as in the above argument
for η 3 Ω̃(t) ∈ C k+1,α . Thus, by (3.31) and (3.32),
(3.33)
k△hi Dβ (ρ5j Ω̃(t))kk,α

≤Ck (M11 + M21 + M31 )A(r)k△hi Dβ (ρ5j Ω̃(t))kk,α + Ck kρ5j Ω̃(t)k2 + Ck Mk+1 kη 5 Ω̃(t)kk+1,α kη 3 ϕkk+1,α.

Choose the same sufficiently small r as in the above argument for η 3 Ω̃(t) ∈ C k+1,α , given
by (3.29) and (3.30). Therefore, by (3.33),
k△hi Dβ (ρ5j Ω̃(t))kk,α ≤ 2Ck kρ5j Ω̃(t)k2 + 2Ck Mk+1 kη 5 Ω̃(t)kk+1,α kη 3 ϕkk+1,α ,
where the right-hand side is bounded when we use the formula (3.26), η 3 Ω̃(t) ∈ C k+1,α
that we just proved in the above argument and also the fact that η 3 ϕ(t) ∈ C k+1,α proved
in [26, Appendix.§8]. Hence, we have proved
Dβ (ρ5j Ω̃(t)) ∈ C k+1,α

by [26, Appendix Lemma 8.2.(iii)] and thus

ρ5j Ω̃(t) ∈ C k+2,α .
Summing with respect j, one obtains that η 5 Ω̃(t) ∈ C k+2,α by (3.21). Notice that in this
procedure r has not been replaced.
31

We can also prove that, for any l = 1, 2, · · · , η 2l+1 Ω̃ is C k+l,α , where r can be chosen
independent of l. Since η 2l+1 (t) is identically equal to 1 on |t| < 2r which is independent
of l, Ω̃(t) is C ∞ on X0 with |t| < 2r . Then Ω̃(t) can be considered as a real analytic family
of (n − 1, n − 1)-forms in t and it is smooth on t by [28, Proposition 2.2.3] again.
4. Stability of p-Kähler structures
This section is to prove a local stability theorem of p-Kähler structures with deformation invariance of Bott-Chern numbers. We will first study obstruction of extension for
d-closed forms and then the un-obstruction of real extension for transverse form via its
two equivalent definitions.
Consider the differentiable family π : X → B of compact complex n-dimensional manifolds over a sufficiently small domain in Rk with the reference fiber X0 := π −1 (0) and
the general fibers Xt := π −1 (t). Here we fix a family of hermitian metrics on Xt .
4.1. Obstruction of extension for d-closed and ∂∂-closed forms. Inspired by Wu’s
result [50, Theorem 5.13], one has:
Proposition 4.1. Let r and s be non-negative integers. Assume that the reference fiber
X0 satisfies the ∂∂-lemma. Then any d-closed (r, s)-form Ω0 and ∂0 ∂ 0 -closed (r, s)-form
Ψ0 on X0 can be extended unobstructed to a d-closed (r, s)-form Ωt and a ∂t ∂ t -closed
(r, s)-form Ψt on its small differentiable deformation Xt , respectively.
Proof. By use of the extension map eιϕ |ιϕ , we can construct two (r, s)-forms eιϕ |ιϕ (Ω0 )
and eιϕ |ιϕ (Ψ0 ) on Xt , starting with Ω0 and Ψ0 , respectively.
Let Ft be the orthogonal projection to Ft , the kernel of

and Gt denote the associated Green’s operator. Then Ft and Gt are C ∞ differentiable in
t since the dim Ft is deformation invariant, thanks to [50, Theorem 5.12]. Therefore, the
desired d-closed (r, s)-form is

(4.1)
Ωt = ∂t ∂ t ∂ t ∂t∗ Gt + Ft eιϕ |ιϕ (Ω0 )
as long as one notices that


Ωt |t=0 = BC,0 G0 + F0 Ω0 = Ω0

by the Hodge decomposition of the operator BC,0 and the d-closedness of Ω0 .
The construction of Ψt is quite similar to the one of Ωt in (4.1). Denote by Fet the
e t , the kernel of
orthogonal projection to F

e t the associated Green’s operator. By the same token, Fet and G
e t are also C ∞
and by G
e t is deformation invariant. Then the construction of Ψt

where it is easy to see that

Remark 4.2. It follows easily from the proposition above that any small deformation
of a pluriclosed manifold, satisfying the ∂∂-lemma, is still pluriclosed. Recall that a a
compact complex manifold is called pluriclosed if it admits a ∂∂-closed positive (1, 1)form. Moreover, it follows from the proof that the theorem still holds when the the ∂∂lemma assumption is replaced by the infinitesimal deformation invariance of (r, s)-BottChern and Aeppli numbers, respectively. These results are possibly known to experts.
We can also prove this proposition by another way inspired by the results of [8, 22, 50]
in the (n − 1, n − 1)-case, i.e., any d-closed (n − 1, n − 1)-form Ω on a complex manifold X
satisfying the ∂∂-lemma can be extended unobstructed to a d-closed (n − 1, n − 1)-form
on the small differentiable deformation Xt of X.
Let ft : Xt → X0 be a diffeomorphism depending on t with f0 = identity. And then
one obtains a d-closed (2n − 2)-form Ωt = ft∗ Ω on Xt , which is decomposed as
Ωt = Ωtn−2,n + Ωn−1,n−1
+ Ωn,n−2
t
t

with respect to the complex structure on Xt . It is easy to check the following properties:
(1) Ωn−1,n−1
approaches to Ω as t → 0;
t
n−2,n
(2) Ωt
and Ωn,n−2
approach to 0 as t → 0.
t
Recall that [50, Theomem 5.12] or [7, Corollary 3.7] says that if X0 satisfies the ∂∂lemma, so does the general fiber Xt . So we can choose an (n − 2, n − 1)-form Ψ1 and an
(n − 1, n − 2)-form Ψ2 on Xt such that
∂t ∂ t Ψ1 = ∂ t Ωn−1,n−1
= −∂t Ωtn−2,n ,
t

= −∂ t Ωn,n−2
,
−∂t ∂ t Ψ2 = ∂t Ωn−1,n−1

where Ψ1 and Ψ2 can be set as
Put

e t = Ωn−1,n−1

+ ∂t Ψ1 + ∂ t Ψ2 .
t
e
Obviously, Ωt is a d-closed (n − 1, n − 1)-form on Xt . Then J. Li, J. Fu and S. Yau proved
the following highly nontrivial estimates in [21, Sections 4 and 5]: for some 0 < α < 1
and similarly

k∂t Ψ1 kC 0 (ωt ) ≤ Ck∂t Ωtn−2,n kC 0,α (ωt )

kC 0,α (ωt ) ,
k∂ t Ψ2 kC 0 (ωt ) ≤ Ck∂ t Ωn,n−2
t

e t is
where C is a uniform constant. By use of these two estimates, one knows that Ω
n−2,n
n,n−2
indeed d-closed extension of Ω since ∂t Ωt
and ∂ t Ωt
approaches to zero uniformly
as t → 0.
It is easy to see that Theorem 1.5 is impossible to obtain by Fu-Yau’s result since the
proof would rely on the deformation openness of (n − 1, n)-th mild ∂∂-lemma, which
contradicts with Ugarte-Villacampa’s Example 3.13.
4.2. Un-obstruction of extension for transverse forms. In this subsection we study
some basic properties and local stabilities of p-Kähler structures, which seem more pertinent to the nature of the stability problem of complex structures.
Let V be a complex vector space of complex dimension n with its dual space V ∗ ,

After a basis {βi }i=1 of the complex vector space q,0 V ∗ is fixed, the canonical Plücker

definition, the fundamental form of a hermitian metric on a complex

all weakly positive forms are real. An element Ξ in p,p V ∗ is called transverse, if the

various names for this terminology and we refer to [3, Appendix] for a list.
34

These positivity notations on complex vector spaces can be extended pointwise to
complex differential forms on a complex manifold. Let M be a complex manifold of
dimension n. Then:
Definition 4.3 ([1, Definition 1.11], for example). Let p be an integer, 1 ≤ p ≤ n. Then
M is called a p-Kähler manifold if there exists a d-closed transverse (p, p)-form on M.
The duality between the weakly positive and strongly positive cones of forms is used
to define corresponding positivities for currents.
Definition 4.4. A current T of bidegree (q, q) on M is strongly positive (resp. positive)
if the pairing hT, ui ≥ 0 for all weakly positive (resp. strongly positive) test forms u ∈
Ap,p (M) at each point. Clearly, each positive current is real.
We are going to discuss several basics of transverse forms. Let V be furnished with
aV Hermitian inner V
product and V ∗ with the dual inner product, which will extend to
p,p
m
∗
∗
R V the (real) vector space of real (p, p)-forms of V , which consists
C V . Denote by
∗
of invariant complex
Vp,p ∗(p, p)-forms of V under conjugation. Then it is well known that,
for every Ω ∈ R V , there exist real numbers {λ1 , · · · , λN } and an orthogonal basis
V
{η1 , · · · , ηN } of p,0 V ∗ , satisfying |ηj |2 = 2p for 1 ≤ j ≤ N, such that
Ω = σp

N
X
j=1

λj ηj ∧ η̄j ,

which is called the canonical form for real (p, p)-forms (See [25] for more details). The
positive (resp. negative) index of Ω is the number of positive (resp. negative) ones in
{λ1 , · · · , λN }.
Proposition 4.5. Let Ω be a transverse (p, p)-form of V ∗ . Then the positive index of Ω
is no less than N − k, where k is given by (4.2).
Proof. It is clear that
Ω = σp (λ1 η1 ∧ η̄1 + · · · + λN ηN ∧ η̄N )

V
for some real numbers {λ1 , · · · , λN } and some orthogonal basis {η1 , · · · , ηN } of p,0 V ∗ ,
satisfying that |ηj |2 = 2p for 1 ≤ j ≤ N.
Suppose that the positive index Ω ≤ N − k − 1. Without loss of generality, we may
assume that {λN −k , · · · , λN } are all non-positive real numbers.
V
V
Apparently, p,0 V ∗ and q,0 V ∗ are dual vector spaces. And thus, the zero loci of
⊥
η1 , · · · , ηN −(k+1) define N −(k+1) hyperplanes in P(∧q,0 V ∗ ), denoted by η1⊥ , · · · , ηN
−(k+1) ,
⊥
respectively. Since the codimension of ρ(G(q, n)) is k and the complex plane η1 ∩ · · · ∩
⊥
ηN
−(k+1) is of dimension k, there exists some nonzero decomposable (q, 0)-form τ , which
⊥
lies in η1⊥ ∩ · · · ∩ ηN
−(k+1) . Then it follows that
Ω ∧ σq τ ∧ τ̄ ≤ 0,

which contradicts with the definition ”transverse”.



Corollary 4.6 ([1, Proposition 1.15]). A complex manifold M is 1-Kähler if and only if
M is Kähler; M is (n − 1)-Kähler if and only if M is balanced.
Proof. Both cases follow from the expression formula (4.2),
N − k = N − (N − 1) + (n − 1) · 1 = n.

Example 4.7. There exists a transverse (p, p)-form Ω of V ∗ , whose positive index is
exactly N − k.

Actually, let {η1 , · · · , ηN } stillVdenote the orthogonal basis of p,0 V ∗ as above. We

with λ1 , · · · , λN −k > 0. It is clear that the dimension of the complex plane η1⊥ ∩· · ·∩ηN

is k − 1. Hence, we can slightly change the orthogonal basis {η1 , · · · , ηN } to another one
⊥
with the same feature, such that η1⊥ ∩ · · · ∩ ηN
−k has no intersection with ρ(G(q, n)). Let
us check that Ω is transverse. It is easy to see that

Ω ∧ σq τ ∧ τ̄ ≥ 0

for each nonzero decomposable (q, 0)-form τ . Now suppose that Ω ∧ σq τ ∧ τ̄ = 0 for some
decomposable (q, 0)-form τ 6= 0. Then it follows that


ηN −k ∧ τ = 0,

⊥
which implies that τ ∈ η1⊥ ∩ · · ·∩ ηN
−k . This contradicts with the choice of the orthogonal
basis {η1 , · · · , ηN }. Therefore, Ω is a transverse (p, p)-form.

Example 4.8 (See also the example on [25, Page 50]). There exists a transverse (p, p)form Ω of V ∗ , whose negative index is larger than 0.
V
∗
In fact, let us slightly modify the example above. Consider the element in p,p
R V ,
(4.3)

Ω = σp (λ1 η1 ∧ η̄1 + · · · + λN −k ηN −k ∧ η̄N −k + λN −k+1ηN −k+1 ∧ η̄N −k+1 ),

where λ1 , · · · , λN −k > 0, λN −k+1 is some negative number to be fixed later, and the
⊥
q,0 ∗
complex plane η1⊥ ∩· · ·∩ηN
−k has no intersection with ρ(G(q, n)) in P(∧ V ). Construct
a function over ρ(G(q, n)), defined by
f ([τ ]) =

σp (λ1 η1 ∧ η̄1 + · · · + λN −k ηN −k ∧ η̄N −k ) ∧ σq τ ∧ τ̄
.
σp ηN −k+1 ∧ η̄N −k+1 ∧ σq τ ∧ τ̄

It is easy to check that f is well-defined on ρ(G(q, n)). The function f has positive
⊥
⊥
values when [τ ] ∈ ρ(G(q, n)) \ ηN
−k+1 and attains to +∞ when [τ ] ∈ ρ(G(q, n)) ∩ ηN −k+1 .
Then f can obtain its minimum value over ρ(G(q, n)) by an elementary analysis, which
is denoted by a > 0. Let −a < λN −k+1 < 0. Then Ω constructed in (4.3) is transverse.
In [2], Alessandrini-Bassanelli proved that (n − 1)-Kählerian property is not preserved
under the small deformations for balanced manifolds nor, more generally, for p-Kähler
manifolds (p > 1), while, based on the above argument on the p-Kähler structures and
Proposition 4.1, we have the following local stability theorem of p-Kählerian structures:
Theorem 4.9. For any positive integer p ≤ n − 1, any small differentiable deformation
Xt of a p-Kähler manifold X0 satisfying the ∂∂-lemma is still p-Kählerian.
Alessandrini and Bassanelli [4, Section 4] constructed a smooth proper modification
X̃ of CP5 , which will be p-Kähler for 2 ≤ p ≤ 5, but non-Kähler. It is clear that the
non-Kähler Moishezon 5-fold X̃ is p-Kähler for p = 2, 3 (the most interesting parts in this
theorem), satisfying the ∂∂-lemma due to [16], which indicates that Theorem 4.9 does
not just concern Kähler or balanced ∂∂-structures. It is worth noticing that Alssandrini
36

and Bassanelli conjectured on [4, Page 299] that a p-Kählerian complex manifold is also
q-Kähler for p ≤ q ≤ n. Besides, Theorem 4.9 might help to produce examples of pKähler ∂∂-manifolds, which are not in the Fujiki class, since being in the Fujiki class is
not an open property under deformations thanks to [11] and [31].
We will present two proofs for this theorem and use the following trivial lemma of
Calculus in both proofs.
Lemma 4.10. Let f (z,
 t) be a real continuous function on K × ∆ǫ , where K is a compact
set and ∆ǫ = {t ∈ Rk  |t| < ǫ}. Assume that
f (z, 0) > 0,

for z ∈ K.

Then there exists some positive number δ > 0, such that
f (z, t) > 0,
for z ∈ K and t ∈ ∆δ .

Proof. It is clear that for each z ∈ K, there exists an open neighborhood Uz in K and
some δz > 0, such that
f (z, t) > 0,
for z ∈ Uz and t ∈ ∆δz . Compactness of K enables us to find a finite open covering of
K, say Uz1 , · · · , Uzm . Then we may set δ to be
min{δz1 , · · · , δzm }.

Therefore, it follows that

f (z, t) > 0,
for z ∈ K and t ∈ ∆δ .



Next, we proceed to the first proof of Theorem 4.9, which is based on an equivalent
definition of transverse (p, p)-forms via strongly positive currents and their extension
property.
Let π : X → B be a differentiable family of compact complex manifolds with the
reference fiber X0 := π −1 (0) and the general fibers Xt := π −1 (t). It is known from [39,
Lemma 2.8] that the extension map in (1.2)

is a linear isomorphism, depending smoothly on t, and its inverse map e ϕ(t) ϕ(t) is
defined by (2.7). Since the dual spaces of An−p,n−q (X0 ) and An−p,n−q (Xt ) are exactly
the spaces of (p, q)-currents on X0 and Xt , set as D′p,q (X0 ) and D′p,q (Xt ), with the weak

is the natural pairing between currents and smooth complex differential forms of pure

as e ϕ(t) ϕ(t) Ω , for some (n − p, n − q)-form Ω on X0 , due to the linear isomorphism

which can be regarded as the defining formula of the adjoint map (4.4). It is easy to see
that this adjoint map is a linear homeomorphism, depending smoothly on t. Using this
map, one obtains the following extension proposition, to be also of independent interest.
ι

Proposition 4.11. The natural map e ϕ(t) ϕ(t) sends each kind of positive (p, p)-forms

e ϕ(t) ϕ(t) sends strongly positive and positive (p, p)-currents homeomorphically onto

ι

|ι

Proof. What we need to show is that the map e ϕ(t) ϕ(t) actually sends smooth forms or
currents, satisfying some positive condition, to the ones with the same positivity, since it
can be similarly proved that the inverse map of eιϕ(t) |ιϕ(t) shares the same property.
ι
|ι
It is clear that the map e ϕ(t) ϕ(t) sends strongly positive (p, p)-forms X0 to the strongly
positive ones on Xt , by the very definition of eιϕ(t) |ιϕ(t) and strong positivity. As to the
positive case, we may choose a positive (p, p)-form Ω on X0 , which can be locally written
as
X
Ω = σp
ΩI J¯dz I ∧ dz̄ J ,
|I|=|J|=p

where ΩI J¯ is a semi-positive hermitian matrix of the size N × N with N = Cnp everywhere and varies with respect to the local coordinates {z i }ni=1 . The local expression of

From the very definition of weakly positive (p, p)-form Ω on X0 , it follows that

The statements on the currents can be proved directly from the definition 4.4 for
the positivities of currents, the formula (4.6) and the results of smooth forms shown


To study local stabilities of transverse (p, p)-forms, we need an equivalent characterization of them, implicit in [1, The proofs of Lemma 1.22 and Theorem 1.17]: a (p, p)-form
Ω is transverse on an n-dimensional compact complex manifold M if and only if
Z
Ω ∧ T > 0,
M

for every nonzero strongly positive (n − p, n − p)-current T on it.
Proposition 4.12. Let π : X → B be a differentiable family of compact complex ndimensional manifolds and Ωt a family of real (p, p)-forms, depending smoothly on t.
Assume that Ω0 is a transverse (p, p)-form on X0 . Then Ωt is also transverse on Xt for
t small.
Proof. Fix a hermitian metric ω0 on X0 and define a real function f (T, t) as follows:

where T varies in the space of strongly positive (n − p, n − p)-currents on X0 , satisfying

and t ∈ ∆ǫ . As pointed out in [1, Propositon 1.7] or [42, Propositon
I.5], the space of
R
strongly positive (n − p, n − p)-currents T on X0 , satisfying X0 ω0p ∧ T = 1, is a compact
set, denoted by K here. Then it is obvious that the function f (T, t) is continuous on
K × ∆ǫ . The assumption that the real (p, p)-form Ω0 is transverse on X0 implies that
f (T, 0) > 0,
for each T ∈ K. Hence, Lemma 4.10 provides a positive number δ > 0, such that
f (T, t) > 0,
for T ∈ K and t ∈ ∆δ . This indeed shows that Ωt is transverse for t ∈ ∆δ , by Proposition
4.11 and the following application of the formula (4.6):

The first proof of Theorem 4.9. Let Ω0 be a d-closed transverse (p, p)-form on the pKähler manifold X0 . Proposition 4.1 assures that there exists a d-closed real extension
Ωt of Ω0 on Xt , depending smoothly on t. Therefore, by Proposition 4.12, Ωt is actually
a d-closed transverse (p, p)-form on Xt for small t, which implies that Xt is a p-Kähler
manifold.

Then one also has another proof:
39

The second proof of Theorem 4.9. Let Ω0 be a d-closed transverse (p, p)-form on X0 and
Ωt its d-closed real extension on Xt constructed in (4.1) by Proposition 4.1. To prove
the theorem, we just need: there exists a uniform small constant ε > 0, such that for
any t ∈ ∆ε and any nonzero decomposable (q, 0)-form τ at any given point x ∈ X0 with
p + q = n,
(4.7)

Ωt (x) ∧ σq eιϕ (τ ) ∧ eιϕ̄ (τ̄ ) > 0,

where ϕ := ϕ(x, t) is induced by the small differentiable deformation. Since eιϕ induces
an isomorphism between decomposable (q, 0)-forms of X0 and those of Xt , Ωt will be the
desired d-closed transverse (p, p)-form on Xt .
In fact, let ω be a Hermitian metric on X0 . For any fixed point x ∈ X0 , we define a
continuous function fx (t, [τ ]) on ∆ǫ × Yx by
(4.8)

fx (t, [τ ]) :=

Ωt (x) ∧ σq eιϕ (τ ) ∧ eιϕ̄ (τ̄ )
,
|τ |2ω(x) · ω(x)n

V
where Yx = ρ(G(q, n))|x ⊂ P( q,0 TX∗ 0 |x ) is compact. Notice that Ωt ∧ σq eιϕ (τ ) ∧ eιϕ̄ (τ̄ )
can be considered as an (n, n)-form on X0 . Then by the transversality of Ω0 ,
fx (0, [τ ]) =

Ω0 (x) ∧ σq τ ∧ τ̄
> 0.
|τ |2ω(x) · ω(x)n

Thus, by the continuity of fx (t, [τ ]) on t and [τ ], Lemma 4.10 gives rises to a constant
ǫx > 0 depending only on x, such that
f (x, ∆ǫx /2 , Yx ) := fx (∆ǫx /2 , Yx ) > 0.
V
Let {Uj }Jj=1 be trivializing covering of q,0 TX∗ 0 , and choose any x ∈ Uj for some j. Then
one can identify Yx and Yy for any point y ⊂ Uj , and fy is defined on Yx . So by Lemma
4.10, there exists an open neighbourhood Vx ⊂ Uj of x such that
f (Vx , ∆ǫx /2 , Yx ) > 0
since f is continuous on ∆ǫx /2 × Yx .
Noticing that X0 is compact, one obtains a finite open covering Vxi , i = 1, · · · , m,
X0 = ∪m
i=1 Vxi . Set
ε := min ǫxi /2 > 0.
1≤i≤m

Then
f (x, ∆ε , Yx ) = fx (∆ε , Yx ) > 0
for any x ∈ X0 .
Therefore, by the definition (4.8), for any |t| ≤ ε,

Ωt (x) ∧ σq eιϕ(x) (τ ) ∧ eιϕ̄(x) (τ̄ ) = fx (t, [τ ])|τ |2ω(x) · ω(x)n > 0

for any nonzero decomposable (q, 0)-form τ at x. This is exactly the desired inequality
(4.7).

Remark 4.13. Proposition 4.12 and the second proof of Theorem 4.9 actually show that
any smooth real extension of a transverse (p, p)-form is still transverse. So the obstruction
to extend a d-closed transverse (p, p)-form on a compact complex manifold lies in the dclosedness. Hence, by Remark 4.2, the condition of the ∂∂-lemma in Theorem 4.9 can
be replaced by the deformation invariance of (p, p)-Bott-Chern numbers. Moreover, this
condition may be weakened as some kind of the ∂∂-lemma if the power series method
works, just similarly to what we have done in the balanced case in Section 3.
40

Finally, we have to mention an interesting conjecture proposed by Demailly-Paun for
the ’global’ stability of Kähler structures, i.e., the Kähler property should be open for
the countable Zariski topology on the base.
Conjecture 4.14 ([18, Cojecture 5.1]). Let X −→ S be a deformation of compact complex manifolds over an irreducible base S. Assume that one of the fibres Xt0 is Kähler.
Then there exists a countable union S ′ ( S of analytic subsets in the base such that Xt
is Kähler for t ∈ S \ S ′ . Moreover, S can be chosen so that the Kähler cone is invariant
over S \ S ′ , under parallel transport by the Gauss-Manin connection.
