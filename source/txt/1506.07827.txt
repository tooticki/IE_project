Abstract. Let Sk be a random walk in Rd such that its distribution of increments does not
assign mass to hyperplanes. We study the probability pn that the convex hull conv(S1 , . . . , Sn )
of the first n steps of the walk does not include the origin. By providing an explicit formula,
we show that for planar symmetrically distributed random walks, pn does not depend on the
distribution of increments. This extends the well known result by Sparre Andersen (1949)
that a one-dimensional random walk satisfying the above continuity and symmetry assumptions stays positive with a distribution-free probability. We also find the asymptotics of pn
as n → ∞ for any planar random walk with zero mean square-integrable increments.
We further developed our approach from the planar case to study a wide class of geometric
characteristics of convex hulls of random walks in any dimension d ≥ 2. In particular, we
give formulas for the expected value of the number of faces, the volume, the surface area,
and other intrinsic volumes, including the following multidimensional generalization of the
Spitzer–Widom formula (1961) on the perimeter of planar walks:
n
X
EkSk k
,
EV1 (conv(0, S1 , . . . , Sn )) =

k=1

where V1 denotes the first intrinsic volume, which is proportional to the mean width.
These results have applications to geometry, and in particular, imply the formula by
Gao and Vitale (2001) for the intrinsic volumes of special path-simplexes, called canonical
orthoschemes, which are finite-dimensional approximations of the closed convex hull of a
Wiener spiral. Moreover, there is a direct connection between spherical intrinsic volumes of
these simplexes and the probabilities pn .
We also prove similar results for convex hulls of random walk bridges, and more generally,
for partial sums of exchangeable random vectors.
Key words: convex hull, random walk, distribution-free probability, random polytope,
intrinsic volume, spherical intrinsic volume, average number of faces, average surface area,
persistence probability, orthoscheme, path-simplex, Wiener spiral, uniform Tauberian theorem.

convex hull of the first n steps of the walk, does not include the origin? This is a natural
high-dimensional generalization of the classical problem to find the probability that a onedimensional random walk stays positive (or negative) by time n. In this paper we develop a
combinatorial approach that answers the question in some particular cases and, importantly,
allows one to obtain further results on expected geometric characteristics of the convex hull
including its expected number of faces, volume, surface area, and other intrinsic volumes.
Most of our main results are presented in the form of exact non-asymptotic formulas.
Our interest in the probabilities P(0 ∈
/ conv(S1 , . . . , Sn )) emerged from two different
topics. First, we were interested in a multidimensional version of the one-dimensional persistence problem of finding the probability that a stochastic process (the random walk, in
our case) stays above a certain level. Over the past ten years, such problems have drawn a
lot of attention from both mathematical and theoretical physics communities; see the survey
papers by Aurzada and Simon [2] and Bray at al. [5].
Second, we were aware of the direct connection to geometry: for random walks with
Gaussian increments, 21 P(0 ∈
/ conv(S1 , . . . , Sn )) equals the d-th spherical intrinsic volume
of a certain path-simplex in Rn called the canonical orthoscheme. This simplex is defined
as the convex hull of n vectors whose Gram matrix coincides with the covariance matrix
of a standard Brownian motion sampled at times 1, . . . , n. Spherical intrinsic volumes are
spherical analogues of classical Euclidean intrinsic volumes. The details on this connection
of our problem to geometry are explained below in Section 4, where we also discuss the other
geometric properties of canonical orthoschemes.
We were also inspired by two famous results. By Sparre Andersen [27, Theorem 2], for
any one-dimensional random walk with continuous symmetric distribution of increments,
P(S1 > 0, . . . , Sn > 0) =

(2n − 1)!!
.

(1)

That is, the probability to stay positive does not depend on the distribution. The other
distribution-free result, which is due to Wendel [36], also concerns symmetric distributions and describes convex hulls of independent identically distributed random vectors. Let
X1 , . . . , Xn be such random vectors in Rd that satisfy two additional assumptions:
P(X1 ∈ h) = 0 for any hyperplane h ⊂ Rd passing through the origin,

(H0 )

and the distribution of X1 is centrally symmetric, i.e.

Then

Wendel assumed (H0 ) to ensure that with probability one, X1 , . . . , Xn are in general
position, that is, any d of these vectors are a.s. linearly independent. We will need the
stronger assumption
P(X1 ∈ h) = 0 for any affine hyperplane h ⊂ Rd ,

(H)

which in particular guarantees that any one-dimensional projection of X1 has a continuous
distribution. We will use this assumption throughout the paper.
1.2. First results. There is a similarity between the results of Sparre Andersen and Wendel
that stems from the use of combinatorial arguments in their proofs. This motivated our first
result, a distribution-free two-dimensional version of (1):
Theorem 1. Let d = 2, and assume that (H) and (S) hold. Then

Let us discuss some corollaries. Here and below we consider the asymptotics as n → ∞.
For two positive sequences an and bn , the notation an ∼ bn means that limn→∞ an /bn = 1.
It is not hard to obtain from (3) (see Section 6 below) that

Further, since for symmetric random walks one has
P(0 ∈

/ conv(S1 − Sn , . . . , 0)) = P(Sn ∈
/ conv(0, S1 , . . . , Sn−1 )),

The other quantity, which is closely related to the probabilities P(0 ∈
/ conv(S1 , . . . , Sn )),
is the opening solid angle, denoted by Ωn , of the convex hull observed from the origin. In
the planar case we understand Ωn as the arc angle, and so here Ωn = 2π if 0 belongs to the
interior of the convex hull and Ωn ≤ π if otherwise.

The approach of the present paper does not allow one to generalize (3) to higher dimensions where it gives non-sharp upper bounds; see (18) and (16) in the next section. Based
on numerical simulations for dimensions d = 3 and 4, which were further supported by (8)
in dimension three, we suggested the following hypothesis.
Conjecture. Let d ≥ 3, and assume that (H) and (S) hold. Then the probabilities P(0 ∈
/
conv(S1 , . . . , Sn )) are distribution-free for any n ≥ 1.
Since the time passed from the publication on arXiv of the first version of this paper,
this conjecture was fully resolved in our subsequent paper [12, Theorem 2.3] coauthored with
Z. Kabluchko. This new work uses an entirely different method, which, however, applies only
for perfectly symmetric distributions of increments.
1.3. Asymptotic results for general planar random walks. On the contrary, the approach of the present paper allows us, with an additional effort, to obtain an asymptotic
version of Theorem 1 for asymmetric planar random walks. It also gives asymptotic upper
estimates of the probabilities P(0 ∈
/ conv(S1 , . . . , Sn )) in higher dimensions. Surprisingly, for
symmetric walks these bounds overestimate the true values merely by a constant factor, cf.
(18) and (21) below with [12, Theorems 2.3 and 5.1].
We now present an asymptotic result for general random walks assuming that the increments have zero mean and a finite covariance matrix Σ. This matrix must be non-degenerate
by assumption (H). For such walks, introduce the following definitions. For any non-zero
u ∈ Rd , denote by T (u) := inf{k ≥ 1 : Sk ∈
/ H(u)} the exit time from the half-space
d
H(u) := {z ∈ R : hz, ui ≥ 0}, and let
EhST (u) , ui
R(u) := − p
(9)
hΣu, ui
be the expected normalized distance from H(u) to the exit point ST (u) . It is easy to see that
this function is positive and angular, that is, independent of |u|. We will also show that
R(u) is bounded. For random walks with centrally symmetric distribution of increments

√
satisfying (H), we have R(u) ≡ 2/2. This becomes clear in the next paragraph if one uses
that T (u) is the exit time of the symmetrically distributed random walk hSn , ui from the
non-negative half-line.
In dimension one, R(1) and R(−1) are the expected values of ascending and descending,
respectively, ladder heights of the random walk normalized by standard deviation of its
increments. In this case it is well known (see the proof of Lemma 5 in the Appendix) that
R(±1) are finite and

(10)
πn
This is actually true even without (H) while under (H), all the inequalities above can be taken
to
√ be strict. The asymptotic order here is the same in the symmetric case (where R(±1) =
2/2, cf. (1) and (5)) but of course the probabilities are now distribution-dependent.

where U is a random vector distributed uniformly over the unit circle S1 and the expectation

1.4. Further results and references. We give a further development to the approach
used for our initial problem discussed above. This allows us to obtain new results on a very
wide class of geometric characteristics of convex hulls of general (not necessarily symmetric)
multidimensional random walks. In particular, we provide explicit exact formulas for expected
intrinsic volumes of the convex hull. For details we refer the reader directly to Section 3,
with its main result given in Theorem 4, and the applications presented in Section 3.2.
Mean geometric characteristics of convex hulls of planar random walks, for example, the
expected number of faces and the expected perimeter, were studied in many papers starting
with Spitzer and Widom [28] and followed by few other works that include Baxter [4], Snyder
and Steele [24], and one of the most recent by Wade and Xu [35]. It seems that higherdimensional versions were first considered by Barndorff-Nielsen and Baxter [3], whose work
was overlooked by most of the followers, including ourselves. To the best of our knowledge,
the probabilities P(0 ∈
/ conv(S1 , . . . , Sn )) were not considered until the very recent works by
Eldan [6] and Tikhomirov and Youssef [31], who obtain asymptotic estimates as dimension
d increases to infinity for a few special types of random walks.
The paper by Abramson et al. [1] gives an overview and the latest account on the very
fine description of the structure of the largest convex minorants of one-dimensional random
walks. There are many related papers that consider random walks as the initial step in
their studies of convex hulls of continuous time Lévy processes, and of course there is a huge
number of works on convex hulls of Brownian motions. These topics are beyond the scope
of our paper. A lot of references can be found in Pitman and Uribe Bravo [21]. There is a
survey of results on random convex hulls by Majumdar et al. [17].

1.5. Structure of the paper. This paper is organised as follows. In the next section
we present the main tool of our approach, a somewhat technical Proposition 1, which immediately implies Theorem 1 and its analogue for random walk bridges, Theorem 3. The
proposition also serves as the base for the further studies of geometric properties of convex
hulls. We also present an asymptotic version of Proposition 1 for general random walks
whose increments have zero mean and finite variance. This result is stated in Proposition 2
of Section 2, and it readily implies Theorem 2.
Section 3 contains Theorem 4, our general result on expected geometric characteristics
of convex hulls of multidimensional random walks. This theorem also holds true for random
walk bridges and more general, for partial sums of exchangeable random vectors. As the
main application of Theorem 4, we obtain explicit formulas for expected intrinsic volumes
of convex hulls of random walks. In Section 4 we consider the special case of random walks
with Gaussian increments and present a number of results that explain connections with
geometry.
All the proofs are contained in the last two sections. In Section 5 we present our
combinatorial results, which are used in Section 6 to prove Proposition 1 and Theorem 4.
This last section also contains the proof of Proposition 2, which is based on several rather
technical statements concerning uniform convergence. The proofs of these statements are
moved to the Appendix since they are very different from the purely combinatorial or semicombinatorial arguments used throughout the paper. However, we think that a uniform
version of Tauberian theorem (Theorem 5 of the Appendix) should deserve some attention.
To our surprise, we did not find a reference to any similar statement.
2. The main tool for multidimensional random walks
Denote by
Cn := conv(S0 , S1 , . . . , Sn )
the convex hull of the first n steps including the origin S0 := 0. In the following consideration
we will always refer to Cn as to the convex hull of the random walk. To avoid trivialities,
we assume that n ≥ d; we also recall our convention that (H) is always satisfied.
With probability one Cn is a convex polytope with boundary of the form
[
∂Cn =
f,
(11)
f ∈Fn

where Fn is the set of all (d − 1)-dimensional faces of Cn . Almost surely, each face f is a
(d − 1)-dimensional simplex of the form
f = conv(Si1 (f ) , . . . , Sid (f ) )

(12)

for some indices 0 ≤ i1 (f ) < · · · < id (f ) ≤ n. It is instructive to think that f is obtained by
shifting the simplex with vertices 0, Si2 (f ) − Si1 (f ) , . . . , Sid (f ) − Si1 (f ) by Si1 (f ) . We say that
the ordered (d − 1)-tuple (i2 (f ) − i1 (f ), . . . , id (f ) − i1 (f )) is the temporal structure of the
face and the ordered d-tuple (i1 (f ), . . . , id (f )) is the full temporal structure.
We shall express the probability that Fn contains a face of a given temporal or full
temporal structure. In order to stress the combinatorial nature of our result, we prove it in

a more general setting for the partial sums Sk = X1 + · · · + Xk , 1 ≤ k ≤ n, of n-exchangeable
increments X1 , . . . , Xn . Recalling the definition, this means that for any permutation σ of
length n, (Xσ(1) , . . . , Xσ(n) ) has the same distribution as (X1 , . . . , Xn ). We will assume that
P(S1 , . . . , Sn are in general position) = 1

(G)

to ensure that the faces of Cn still are simplexes with probability one. In other words,
any d vectors of S1 , . . . , Sn are linearly independent. This is true, for example, when the
exchangeable increments X1 , . . . , Xn have a joint density or when they are independent (so
Sk is a random walk) and satisfy (H).
Our main example of partial sums with dependent n-exchangeable increments is a random bridge of length n, where we assume by definition that the n-th partial sum is a.s. zero.
We will be interested in random walk bridges of two types. For a random walk Sk , the difference bridge is the sequence Sk − (k/n)Sn , 1 ≤ k ≤ n; and the distribution of the conditional
bridge is given by conditioning on Sn = 0. We understand
the

 latter as the well-defined limit
of the corresponding conditional distributions P · |Sn | ≤ r as r → 0+. For example, this
limit exists if the distribution of increments of the walk has continuous or bounded density
and the density of the distribution of Sn is positive at 0. It is easy to see that the first n
values of a random walk bridge of length n + 1 of either type satisfy (G) if the underlying
random walk satisfies (H).
It turns out that the probability that the convex hull Cn contains a face of a given full
temporal structure is distribution-free for random walk bridges and for random walks with
symmetrically distributed increments. Although this probability is not distribution-free for
general walks, the probability that Cn contains a face of a given temporal structure is. More
precisely, we have following result.
Proposition 1. For any d ≥ 1, let 0 ≤ i1 < · · · < id ≤ n be any indices.

(i2 − i1 ) · ... · (id − id−1 )(n − id + i1 + 1)

As explained in Section 6, (15) is true for the partial sums of n-exchangeable random vectors X1 , . . . , Xn
if (G) holds and all the 2n n-tuples (±X1 , . . . , ±Xn ) have the same distribution; note that Wendel’s result (2)
also holds true under these relaxed assumptions. Here is an example of such distributions: if d = 1 so are the
coordinates of any random vector X in Rn with a rotationally invariant distribution. In this case X1 , . . . , Xn
are not i.i.d. unless X is a multiple of a standard Gaussian vector.

The first application of this result concerns the expected number of faces of Cn that
contain the origin as a vertex. Denote the set of such faces by Fn0 and note that (under (G)!)

In higher dimensions, (16) gives only an upper bound, as follows by
P(0 ∈

By the same reasoning, from (14) we obtain the following version of Theorem 1 for
random walk bridges.

We stress that these formulas are valid under (G) only, and (S) is not required.
For d = 2, (22) was proved by Baxter [4]. We first generalized his argument to higher
dimensions, but then found a more direct and intuitive proof for Part 1 of Proposition 1
presented below in Section 6. Later we discovered that such generalization was already done
by Barndorff-Nielsen and Baxter [3] who extended the proof of [4].
We followed the steps of Baxter [4] and Snyder and Steele [24] (both papers considered
only the planar case) to obtain the following generalization of (22). Let g : Rd×(d−1) → R be
any non-negative Borel function. As we noted above, with probability one Cn is a convex
polytope with faces of the form (12), hence we can represent nearly any geometric property
of a face f of Cn in terms of

g Si2 (f ) − Si1 (f ) , . . . , Sid (f ) − Sid−1 (f )
for some symmetric function g. This quantity has the same expectation for all faces with the
same temporal structure, and a conditional version of (13) (see (43) below) readily yields
the following result.
Theorem 4. Let Sk be partial sums of n-exchangeable random vectors in Rd , d ≥ 1. If (G)
holds, then for

where Sn , . . . , Sn
are independent copies of the random walk Sn .
We proved Theorem 4 being unaware of the work of Barndorff-Nielsen and Baxter [3],
who gave no general statement of this type but did a similar consideration and obtained
many of the results discussed in the next section as applications of Theorem 4. Our proof
uses both combinatorial and probabilistic reasoning and in our opinion, is more transparent
than that of [3].
The latter proof rests on the smart combinatorial argument proposed by Baxter [4]. It
is based on the simple fact that none of the n! permutations of the increments X1 , . . . , Xn
change the distribution of the partial sums. Similarly, Wendel’s proof of (2) uses that all
the 2n possible n-tuples (±X1 , . . . , ±Xn ) have the same distribution. If this holds true, his
argument works for any random vectors X1 , . . . , Xn in general position (so our assumption
that Xi are i.i.d. is actually superfluous). Both proofs of Baxter and Wendel rely on the
corresponding properties of deterministic sequences. Sparre Andersen’s original proof of (1)
does not allow such a nice description as it combines a simple combinatorial argument with
some clever counting which rests on additivity of probability. The widely-known proof of
this result given by Feller [8, Sec. XII.6] offers much clearer combinatorial approach but
heavily uses the independence of increments.
3.2. Applications to intrinsic volumes of convex hulls. Let us give some corollaries
of Theorem 4. In this subsection we always assume that Sn is a random walk that satisfies
(1)
(d)
(H), and impose no other conditions. As in (24), let Sn , . . . , Sn be independent copies of
the walk Sn .
First of all, by considering g(x1 , . . . , xd−1 ) ≡ 1 in (24), we obtain the formula (22) for
the expected number of faces of the convex hull of Sn . Less trivial applications are as follows.

A version of this result was first obtained by Barndorff-Nielsen and Baxter [3].
Proof. Denote by 0 : Rd+1 → Rd the projection onto the first d coordinates. Let S̃n be any
(d + 1)-dimensional random walk such that S̃n0 = Sn and its last coordinate is distributed
continuously and independently of Sn . The convex hull C̃n of S̃n satisfies (∂ C̃n )0 = Cn , and
the pre-image under 0 of any point from Int(Cn ) consists of exactly two points. Together
with (11) this gives

where F̃n denotes the set of faces of C̃n .
Each face f ∈ F̃n a.s. is a d-dimensional simplex in Rd+1 with vertices S̃i1 (f ) , . . . , S̃id+1 (f )
and so f 0 a.s. is a d-dimensional simplex in Rd . Its volume is given by
Vold (f 0 ) = g(S̃i2 (f ) − S̃i1 (f ) , . . . , S̃id+1 (f ) − S̃i1 (f ) ),

The following approach unifies the examples considered above. The volume and the
surface area of a convex set are the special cases of so called intrinsic volumes V0 , . . . , Vd ,
which naturally arise as the coefficients in the Steiner formula: for any convex set K ⊂ Rd ,
Vold (K + rBd ) =

d
X

κd−k Vk (K)rd−k ,

r ≥ 0,

k=0

where Bd denotes a d-dimensional unit ball and κk := π k/2 /Γ( k2 + 1) is the volume of Bk .
In particular, V0 (K) = 1, Vd (K) = Vold (K), 2Vd−1 (K) = Vold−1 (∂K), and V1 (K) equals the
mean width of K divided by the constant 2κdκd−1
, which is the mean width of a unit segment in
d
d
R . The last statement readily follows from the other definition of intrinsic volumes, which
sometimes is called the Crofton formula:
 
Z
d
κd
Volk (K|L) dµk (L),
Vk (K) :=
k κk κd−k Ldk

(29)

where Ldk is the Grassmannian of all k-dimensional linear subspaces of Rd equipped with the
Haar probability measure µk , and K|L is the orthogonal projection of K onto L.
Intuitively, the k-th intrinsic volume of K equals, up to the constant factor, the mean
k-dimensional volume of the projection of K onto a uniformly
 κd chosen random k-dimensional
d
d
linear subspace of R . The normalization constant k κk κd−k is chosen so that the intrinsic
volumes of K do not depend on whether we consider K as a subset of Rd or embed it in any
higher-dimensional Euclidian space. For an extensive account on integral geometry we refer
the reader to the books Santaló [22] and Schneider and Weil [23].

the earlier paper by Kampf et al. [15].

4. Applications of Gaussian convex hulls to geometry
In this section we always assume that X1 , . . . , Xn are independent standard Gaussian
vectors in Rd .
4.1. Intrinsic volumes of canonical orthoschemes. Consider the Gaussian random d×n
matrix A with the columns X1 , . . . , Xn . Its rows Y1 , . . . , Yd are standard Gaussian vectors
in Rn . It is known that the linear span of Y1 , . . . , Yd (which are in general position with
probability one) is a random d-dimensional linear subspace of Rn uniformly distributed on
the Grassmannian Lnd with respect to the Haar probability measure. Using this fact and the
Crofton formula (29), it can be shown that for any convex body K ⊂ Rn
Vd (K) =

(2π)d/2
E Vold (conv({Ax : x ∈ K})).
d!κd

This equation is a finite-dimensional version of a general result of Sudakov [30] (for d = 1)
and Tsirelson [32, 33, 34] (for general d) on Gaussian measures in infinite-dimensional spaces.
Consider the simplex Tn ⊂ Rn with vertices
(0, 0, . . . , 0), (1, 0, . . . , 0), (1, 1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , (1, . . . , 1),
which we call Schläfli canonical orthoscheme. Such simplexes are also called path-simplexes.
Now
conv({Ax : x ∈ Tn }) = Cn ,

This result was first obtained by Gao and Vitale [10], who considered a direct geometric
√
approach using a formula for intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes. The simplex Tn / n ∈ Rn
is a finite-dimensional approximation of the closed convex hull T of a Wiener spiral 3 in a
Hilbert space, which was introduced by Kolmogorov in 1940; [10] calls T the Brownian
motion body. Note that T is isometric to the subset of non-increasing functions of L2 [0, 1]
that take values in [0, 1]. Gao and Vitale [10] used (31) to prove that
κd
Vd (T ) = .
d!
Due to Tsirelson [32, 33, 34], the normalized d-th intrinsic volume of T is equal to expected volume of the convex hull of a d-dimensional Brownian motion, see Kabluchko and
Zaporozhets [14] for details. The latter quantity was calculated by Eldan [7] using direct
methods.
4.2. Spherical intrinsic volumes of canonical orthoschemes. Let us consider the unit
sphere Sn in Rn+1 . By saying that K ⊂ Sn is convex we mean that the conic hull of K in
Rn+1 is convex and line-free. Following Santaló (see [22, Section IV.4]), for a convex body
K in Sn we can use a spherical counterpart of the Crofton formula (29) to define
Z

1{K∩s6=∅} dνn−k (s),
Uk (K) :=

where Skn denotes the space of k-dimensional great subspheres of Sn equipped with the
rotationally invariant probability measure νk . The functionals Uk can be considered as

space of square-integrable zero mean random variables.

spherical counterparts of Euclidean intrinsic volumes Vk . However, there are other possible
definition of spherical intrinsic volumes. For basic facts from spherical integral geometry we
refer the reader to Gao et al. [9], McCoy and Tropp [18], and Schneider and Weil [23, Sec.
6.5].
Similarly to (30), it can be shown (see Götze at al. [11] for details) that
1
Ud (T̃n ) = P(0 ∈ Cn ),
2
where T̃n denotes the intersection of the conic hull of Tn with Sn−1 . To eliminate any misunderstanding, by the spherical intrinsic volumes of the canonical orthoscheme Tn mentioned
in the abstract and Section 1 we meant exactly Ud (T̃n ). It follows from (1) and Theorem 1
that

U1 (T̃n ) = −

As we explained in the introduction, the exact values of the other spherical intrinsic volumes
of T̃n are not accessible by the method of this paper. They are available in our most recent
work [12] coauthored with Z. Kabluchko, where Uk are referred to as half-tail functionals.
5. Combinatorial arguments
For any x1 , . . . , xn ∈ Rd , denote by
s0 := 0, sk := x1 + · · · + xk ,

k = 1, . . . , n,

the sequence of partial sums. For any permutation σ = (σ(1), . . . , σ(n)), denote
s0 (σ) := 0, sk (σ) := xσ(1) + · · · + xσ(k) , k = 1, . . . , n.
We first proved a simple combinatorial statement, which generalizes two-dimensional
Lemma 1 from Baxter [4] to higher dimensions. Later we found this result in the paper
by Barndorff-Nielsen and Baxter [3]. The one-dimensional version is known as the “cycle
lemma”, for example, see Steele [29, Section 4] and references therein for further combinatorial applications. For the reader’s convenience we present the proof here.
Lemma 1. Let x0 , x1 , . . . , xn ∈ Rd , and let H be a closed half-space such that
x0 , x0 + sn ∈ ∂H

and

x0 + s j − s i ∈
/ ∂H, 0 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 1.

There exists exactly one cyclic permutation σ = (k + 1, . . . , n, 1, . . . , k) such that
x0 , x0 + s1 (σ), . . . , x0 + sn (σ) ∈ H.
n−1
Proof. By the asumption, there exists exactly one point x0 + sk among {x0 + si }i=0
∩
c
(Int(H)) that is at the maximum distance (possibly zero) from ∂H. Then σ := (k +
1, . . . , n, 1, . . . , k) is a required permutation, and it is unique by the uniqueness of k.


Our next goal is to obtain stochastic versions of this result. For any points x1 , . . . , xd ∈
Rd , define
H± (x1 , . . . , xd ) := {z ∈ Rd : ± det[x2 − x1 , . . . , xd − x1 , z − x1 ] ≥ 0}.

16

VLADISLAV VYSOTSKY AND DMITRY ZAPOROZHETS

If there is a unique hyperplane through these points, then this definition gives a rule to
distinguish between the two half-spaces H+ and H− lying on different sides of the hyperplane.
If such a hyperplane is not unique, then H± = Rd .
Lemma 2. Assume that the partial sums Sk of n-exchangeable random vectors X1 , . . . , Xn
in Rd , d ≥ 2, satisfy (G). For any indices 1 ≤ i1 < · · · < id−2 ≤ n − 1, we have

1
P S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H± (0, Si1 , . . . , Sid−2 , Sn ) =

i1 (i2 − i1 ) · ... · (n − id−2 )
and moreover,

P S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H± (0, Si1 , . . . , Sid−2 , Sn )Si1 , . . . , Sid−2 , Sn =
i1 (i2 − i1 ) · ... · (n − id−2 )
This is a little generalization of the well-known fact that the trajectory of any continuously distributed one-dimensional random walk Sn lies above the line joining (0, 0) and
(n, Sn ) with probability 1/n, see Feller [8, Sec. XII.9]. The fact follows from Lemma 2 if we
consider the two-dimensional walk S̃n := (n, Sn ) with deterministic first component.
Proof. With probability one, there exists a unique half-plane through 0, Si1 , . . . , Sid−2 , Sn
(otherwise we could add any other point Sk and arrive at a contradiction with (G).) Hence
almost surely,
H± (S) := H± (0, Si1 , . . . , Sid−2 , Sn )
are half-spaces.
For any permutation σ = (σ(1), . . . , σ(n)), introduce the partial sums
S0 (σ) := 0, Sk (σ) := Xσ(1) + · · · + Xσ(k) ,

k = 1, . . . , n.

Put i0 := 0, id−1 := n and denote by S the set of (i1 − i0 ) · ... · (id−1 − id−2 ) permutations of
length n that are products over j from 1 to d − 1 of cyclic permutations of the form
(kj + 1, . . . , ij , ij−1 + 1, . . . , kj ),

(32)

where ij−1 + 1 ≤ kj ≤ ij . Note that any σ ∈ S does not change H± , i.e. H± (S) = H± (S(σ)),
since for every k ∈ {i1 , . . . , id−2 , n} one has Sk = Sk (σ), and the sequences of partial sums S
and S(σ) have the same distribution by the exchangeability of the increments.
For any 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 2, the random vectors Sij , Xij +1 , . . . , Xij+1 and the half-space
H± (0, Si1 , . . . , Sid−2 , Sn ) satisfy the assumption of Lemma 1 with probability one. Indeed, if
for some ij ≤ m < ` < ij+1 , one has Sij + S` − Sm ∈ ∂H± (S) with positive probability, then
among the partial sums Sk (σ) with
σ = (1, . . . , ij , m + 1, . . . , `, ij + 1, ij + m, ` + 1, . . . , n)
there are d points Si1 (σ), . . . , Sid−1 (σ), Sij +`−m (σ) that belong to the hyperplane ∂H± passing
through 0, which contradicts (G) by the exchangeability of increments.
By Lemma 1, there exists an a.s. unique random permutation σ± = σ± (S) ∈ S such
that S1 (σ± ), . . . , Sn (σ± ) ∈ H± (S(σ± )) = H± (S). Hence the sum in r.h.s. of the equality

We conclude this section with a result on random bridges.
Lemma 3. Let Sk be a random bridge of length n + 1 in Rd , d ≥ 2, such that S1 , . . . , Sn
satisfy (G). For any indices 0 ≤ i1 < · · · < id−1 ≤ n, we have

1
P S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H± (0, Si1 , . . . , Sid−1 ) =
.
i1 (i2 − i1 ) · ... · (n − id−1 + 1)
The above also holds true if Sk is either the difference bridge or a well-defined conditional
bridge of a random walk in Rd that satisfies (H).
This is a multidimensional counterpart of the fact that in dimension one, a bridge of
length n of a continuously distributed random walk stays positive with probability 1/n.
Proof. As we already mentioned in Section 2, by our understanding of the conditioning it is
clear that a conditional random walk bridge satisfies (G) if the increments of the underlying
random walk satisfies (H). It is also easy to see that the difference bridge of such random
walk satisfies (G). Thus the latter assumptions holds true in all cases.
By repeating the argument used in the proof of Lemma 2, we see that (33) holds for
i0 = 0 and S defined to be the set of permutations of length n + 1 that are products of d
cyclic permutations of the form (32), where 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1 and id = n + 1.

6. Proofs
Proof of Proposition 1. Recall that 0 ≤ i1 < · · · < id ≤ n. By (11) and (12),
P(conv(Si1 , . . . , Sid ) ∈ Fn ) = P(0, S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H+ (Si1 , . . . , Sid ))
+ P(0, S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H− (Si1 , . . . , Sid )). (34)
Denote
H± := H± (0, Si2 − Si1 , . . . , Sid − Si1 ),
then by Sid − Si1 ∈ ∂H± , we have
H+ (Si1 , . . . , Sid ) = H± + Si1 = H± + Sid .

(35)

Proof of (14). Here Sk , 1 ≤ k ≤ n + 1, with Sn+1 := 0, is a random bridge of length
n + 1. Let us consider the transformation that translates the whole trajectory of the bridge
by moving the origin to Si1 . The transformed trajectory corresponds to the random bridge

of partial sums Sk (σ), 1 ≤ k ≤ n + 1, with σ = (i1 + 1, . . . , n + 1, 1, . . . , i1 ). By the first
equality in (35), we have

	
0, S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H± (Si1 , . . . , Sid )

	
= Sn+1 − Si1 , Sn+1 − Si1 + S1 , . . . , 0, Si1 +1 − Si1 , . . . , Sn − Si1 ∈ H±

hence
P(0, S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H± (Si1 , . . . , Sid )) = P(S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H± (0, Si2 −i1 , . . . , Sid −i1 )),
and then (14) follows by (34) and Lemma 3.
Proof of (15). Let us split the trajectory of Sn into three parts: by (35), we have
	

0, S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H± (Si1 , . . . , Sid )

	
= 0, S1 , . . . , Si1 ∈ H± + Si1 ; Si1 +1 , . . . , Sid ∈ H± + Si1 ; Sid +1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H± + Sid . (36)
Since Sn is a random walk, by conditioning on Xi1 +1 , . . . , Xid , which define H± , and using
the independence of increments, we obtain that

where Sn0 is an independent copy of the random walk Sn . Let us stress that we obtained (37)
assuming that Sn is a random walk satisfying (H) but not (S). Then (15) holds by (34),
Lemma 2, and the following simple result.
Lemma 4. Let Sn be a random walk in Rd , and let H be a half-space such that 0 ∈ ∂H.
Assume that (H) and (S) hold. Then
P(S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H) =

(2n − 1)!!

(2n)!!

Proof. Denote by u = uH the unit vector that is orthogonal to ∂H and belongs to H. The
(u)
distribution of increments of the one-dimensional random walk Sk := hSk , ui, k ≥ 1, is
continuous and symmetric, hence the result follows by (1) and
(u)

P(S1 , . . . , Sn ∈ H) = P(S1 > 0, . . . , Sn(u) > 0).

Proof of (13). If i1 6= 0, we transform the trajectory by interchanging its part from 1 to

where the parts are denoted by T1 , T2 , and T3 , respectively. The key observation is that
for the transformed trajectory, Sid becomes the most distant point from H± = H± (0, Si2 −
Si1 , . . . , Sid − Si1 ). Let us prove this formally.

For a fixed temporal structure, i.e., the tuple (i2 − i1 , . . . , id − i1 ), it remains to sum in (39)
over i1 from 0 to n−(id −i1 ). The argmin disappears, and (13) follows by (34) and Lemma 2.
Proposition 1 is now proved.
Remark on Footnote 2. Note that under assumptions made, (1) does hold true
in the one-dimensional case, see Sparre Andersen [25, Theorem 1] or [26, Theorem 4];
strictly speaking, both theorems are stated under slightly stronger assumptions which actually can be weakened to fit our requirements. The latter theorem yields (15) when applied for the partial sums of (n − id + i1 )-exchangeable one-dimensional increments Xk0 :=
± det[Si2 −i1 , . . . , Sid −i1 , Xid −i1 +k ] (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n − id + i1 ) with n − id + i1 substituted for
n and the first event in the r.h.s. of (39) substituted for the Cn of [26, Theorem 4].
Proof of Proposition 2. The main ingredient is the following asymptotic version of
Lemma 4. Recall that for any half-space H of Rd , by uH we denote the unit vector that
is orthogonal to ∂H and belongs to H, and conversely, for any non-zero u ∈ Rd , we put
H(u) = {z ∈ Rd : hz, ui ≥ 0}.
Lemma 5. Let Sk be a random walk in Rd , d ≥ 1, with increments that have zero mean, a
finite covariance matrix Σ, and satisfy (H). Then

uniformly over all half-spaces H of Rd such that 0 ∈ ∂H. The limit function R(u) is
continuous and positive on Sd−1 .
We will see that the pointwise convergence in (40) holds by a simple reduction to the
well-known one-dimensional result of fluctuation theory. The difficulty is in showing that the
convergence is uniform. Since this is quite a technical statement and the main message of our
paper is in combinatorial methods, we postpone the proof of Lemma 5 until the Appendix.
Let us conclude the proof of Proposition 2.
PdWe first recall that the cross product of
d
x1 , . . . , xd−1 ∈ R is given by x1 × . . . × xd−1 = k=1 det[x1 , . . . , xd−1 , ek ]ek , where e1 , . . . , ed

equation in (37) does not appear. Conditioning on Si2 , Si3 , . . . , Sid , which determine
u± := ±Si2 × . . . × Sid = ±(Si2 − Si1 ) × . . . × (Sid − Sid−1 )
and thus fix H(u± ) = H± (0, Si2 , . . . , Sid ), and using Lemma 2 for the third probability
in (37), we get

In particular, this shows that the distribution of N1 ×. . .×Nd−1 is invariant under orthogonal
transformations since the standard Gaussian distribution is so. Hence the angular component

but the rest is analogous and (20) follows easily.
4. The assertion (21) immediately follows from (19) once we check that in both summations resulting in these asymptotics, for any slowly varying sequence cn tending to infinity,
the contributions of the indices 1 ≤ i2 < i3 < . . . < id ≤ n with min(i2 , i3 − i2 , . . . , id −
id−1 , n − id ) ≤ cn are of a smaller order of asymptotics.
We already saw that the main contribution to the asymptotics of the sum in (44) comes
from the indices k = o(n). Consequently, the indices with n − id ≤ cn do not contribute to
the asymptotics in (19) and (21). On the other hand,

and the pointwise version of (40) follows by a Tauberian
theorem for power series of sequences
P
with monotone differences. In fact, U (n) := nk=0 P(T (u) > k) has monotone differences
U (n) − U (n + 1) = P(T (u) > n).
Now we explain how to modify the above argument to obtain the uniform asymptotics.
The key ingredient is that the Spitzer series converges absolutely4 uniformly in u ∈ Sd−1 . This
is true by Lemma 6 below applied to the family of random variables √ hX1 ,ui , u ∈ Sd−1 ,
hX1 ,ui2
Var(hX1 ,ui)

which is uniformly square integrable by the inequality

where σ1
denotes the smallest eigenvalue of Σ.
Since the Spitzer series converges absolutely uniformly in u and it dominates termwise
the absolute values of the series in (48), the convergence in (48) is uniform. Then the
equivalence in (49) is also uniform in u ∈ Sd−1 , and by the second assertion of the uniform
Tauberian Theorem 5 below, this implies (40).


(u)
Finally, note that each term of the Spitzer series, namely n−1 P(Sn > 0) − 1/2 ,
depends continuously on u ∈ Sd−1 . This is readily seen from the continuity of probability
measures and the fact that the distribution of Sn does not put mass on hyperplanes due to
assumption (H). Then R(u) is continuous on Sd−1 as a uniform limit of continuous functions.

Uniform absolute convergence of the Spitzer series. We present a statement stronger
than needed for the use in the current paper.
Lemma 6. Let {Yα }α∈I , where I is some index set, be random variables with zero mean and

unit variance. Let Sn , n ≥ 1, be a random walk with increments distributed as Yα , α ∈ I.

This statement fully rests on the series remainder estimate by Nagaev [20].
Proof. As in [20], for any α ∈ I denote n1 (α) = min(k ≥ 1 : EYα2 1{Yα2 <k} > 3/4) and
n0 (α) = max(8, n1 (α)). Putting together Eq.’s (6), (9) and (10) from [20] that estimate the
terms of the main bound Eq. (2) gives that for any k ≥ n0 (α),

our proof, it actually suffices to use uniform convergence rather than the uniform absolute convergence. Indeed, it can be shown using Abel’s uniform convergence test that the convergence in (48) is uniform
as required.

26

VLADISLAV VYSOTSKY AND DMITRY ZAPOROZHETS

The only difference with Nagaev’s estimates is that this inequality is obtained by summation
in Eq. (2) over n ≥ k rather than n ≥ n0 (α) as is [20]. We also introduced a minor correction
to Eq. (9).
Since n0 := supα n0 (α) is finite by the uniform square-integrability, the remainder estimate applies to all α ∈ I if k is large enough. The first term vanishes as k → ∞ and by
the uniform square-integrability, so does the second one uniformly in α ∈ I. For the fourth
term, use the Cauchy–Bunyakovsky–Schwarz inequality. For the remaining third term, for
any ε > 0, we have
1
√ E|Yα |3 1{|Yα |≤√k} ≤ εEYα2 1{|Yα |≤ε√k} + EYα2 1{ε√k≤|Yα |≤√k} ≤ ε + EYα2 1{ε√k≤|Yα |} ,

where the last term again vanishes uniformly.

A uniform Tauberian theorem. Although Tauberian theory is a very well studied subject
and there are many results on the remainder terms in asymptotics, to our surprise we did
not find any reference on uniform convergence. The next result is presented in a greater
generality than needed for the use in the current paper.
Theorem 5 (Uniform Tauberian theorem). Let {Uα }α∈I , where I is some index set, be
non-decreasing right-continuous functions on R with Uα (0−) = 0 for every α ∈ I, and let
{Lα }α∈I be slowly varying functions. Assume that for some ρ ≥ 0
Z ∞
e−sx dUα (x) ∼ s−ρ Lα (1/s), s → 0 + uniformly in α ∈ I.
Ûα (s) :=
0

Then
Uα (x) ∼

xρ Lα (x)
,
Γ(1 + ρ)

x → ∞ uniformly in α ∈ I.

If in addition, Uα is absolutely continuous with a monotone density uα and Lα (x) ≡ cα is a
positive constant for every α ∈ I, and ρ > 0, then
uα (x) ∼

xρ−1 Lα (x)
,
Γ(ρ)

x → ∞ uniformly in α ∈ I.

(50)

Remark. It is possible to show that (50) holds under the less strenuous (than Lα (x) ≡ cα )
assumption of uniform slow variation for {Lα }α∈I :

explicit estimates of Uα (x) as opposed to more elegant standard proofs (as in Feller [8,
Theorem XIII.5.2]) relying on the continuity theorem for Laplace transform.
Proof. For any positive integer m,
