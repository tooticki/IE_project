Abstract
We give a detailed, self-contained proof of Geoffrey Martin’s normal
form theorem for Lagrangian submanifolds of standard multisymplectic manifolds (that generalises Alan Weinstein’s famous normal form
theorem in symplectic geometry), providing also complete proofs for
the necessary results in foliated differential topology, i.e., a foliated
tubular neighborhood theorem and a foliated relative Poincaré lemma.

Introduction
It is well-known that Lagrangian submanifolds play a central role in symplectic geometry. This can easily be traced back to the search for so-called
"generating functions" of (local) symplectomorphisms in the framework of
the Hamilton-Jacobi method for integrating Hamilton’s equation (see the
classical reference [1], Sections 47-48). This method is closely connected to

the observations that the graph of a diffeomorphism between two symplectic
manifolds is Lagrangian if and only if the diffeomorphism is symplectic and
that the image of a one-form is Lagrangian (inside the cotangent bundle) if
and only if the form is closed. Alan Weinstein deduced from such classical
facts his famous symplectic creed: "Everything is a Lagrangian submanifold". Of course, from a modern perspective the main argument for this
creed is ... Weinstein’s fundamental result from 1971 (see [11]):
Weinstein’s normal form theorem. Let L be a Lagrangian submanifold
of a symplectic manifold (M, ω). Then there exist open neighborhoods U and
V of L in M respectively T ∗ L, and a diffeomorphism φ : U → V such that
∗
φ|L = idL and φ∗ (ω T L ) = ω on U.
Classical mechanics is geometrized by the Hamiltonian approach on cotangent bundles and more generally on symplectic manifolds, whereas its higher
dimensional analogue, classical field theory, can be formulated in a Hamiltonian way on multicotangent or jet bundles, and leads more generally to
multisymplectic manifolds (cf. [10], Section 2 for a recent account of this). A
multisymplectic manifold is a manifold together with a nondegenerate, closed
(k+1)-form ω with k in N; k = 1 being the symplectic case.
In a 1988 article ([8]) Geoffrey Martin extended Weinstein’s result to
an important class of multisymplectic manifolds including multicotangent
bundles. (Note that he reserves the term “multisymplectic" for the class of
multisymplectic manifolds where his theorem applies.) The proof of his main
result (Lemma 2.1) being rather cryptic, and in parts being reduced to mere
hints for the reader, his precocious results fell into oblivion, not receiving the
deserved attention.
The spanish school on differential-geometric methods in mathematical
physics revived multisymplectic geometry (in its modern definition) at the
end of the last century, and Manuel de Léon, David Martín de Diego and
Aitor Santamaría-Merino gave in [4] a rather detailed framework for Martin’s
normal form theorem. Unfortunately, the necessary condition that a certain
naturally associated subbundle of the tangent bundle of the ambient manifold should be integrable is not emphasised in their proof of Martin’s main
result (see the proof of Lemma 3.24 in the cited article).
Since multisymplectic geometry is by now emerging fast as the "right"
(higher) geometric formulation of classical field theory, thanks to the advent
of rather well-suited homotopical and homological methods, the interest in
2

Martin’s result is growing and we felt compelled to give a self-contained, detailed account of his result and techniques. It turns out that one crucially
needs "folkloristic" extensions of two standard theorems in differential topology to a foliated setting (these being of independent interest, in fact). Once
established, Martin’s ingenious idea that the path method of Jürgen Moser
(see [9]) applies though a multisymplectic form of degree k+1 does not yield
an isomorphism between the tangent bundle and the bundle of k-forms, goes
through and yields the following result:
Martin’s normal form theorem (Theorem 1 below). Let (M, ω) be
a standard k-plectic manifold, with k > 1. Let the distribution W ⊂ T M
be defined as W := ∪p∈M Wω (p) and let L be a k-Lagrangian submanifold
of M complementary to W (that is Tp M = Tp L ⊕ W |p , ∀p ∈ L). If W is
integrable, there exist open neighborhoods U and V of L in M and Λk (T ∗ L),
and a diffeomorphism φ : U → V such that:
φ|L = idL and φ∗ (ω Λ

k (T ∗ L)

) = ω on U.

Results of a related but more global nature were obtained by Frans
Cantrijn, Alberto Ibort and Manuel de Léon in 1999 (see Theorem 7.3 in
[3]) and Michael Forger and Sandra Z. Yepes in 2013 (see Theorem 7 in [5]).
In both cases the focus is shifted from the local situation near a Lagrangian
submanifold to the foliation associated to an involutive Lagrangian distribution and its leaf space, implying an important role for regularity assumptions
on the foliation, and for connections on the leaves.
We conclude the introduction by summarising the paper’s content. In
Section 1 we give the basic definitions, as multisymplectic vector spaces and
manifolds and their isotropic and Lagrangian subspaces respectively submanifolds. We also give here some examples of isotropic and Lagrangian
submanifolds of multisymplectic manifolds. Section 2 introduces the notions
of "standard" multisymplectic vector spaces and manifolds, central for this
article. We prove the fundamental properties of a standard multisymplectic
vector space (V, ω) (with ω a (k+1)-linear form and k > 1), notably the
existence of a unique subspace W ⊂ V that is isomorphic to Λk (V /W )∗ via
the natural contraction map (compare Lemma 1 and Proposition 1). On
the level of manifolds, we explain why multicotangent bundles are standard
multisymplectic manifolds. In Section 3 we give a detailed proof of Martin’s normal form theorem (see above), expanding and explaining Martin’s
extremely brief original proof. In an Appendix we give complete proofs for
3

the extension of two classical differential-topological results to foliated manifolds, more precisely, we show a foliated tubular neighborhood theorem and
a foliated relative Poincaré lemma (see Theorems 2 and 3).

Multisymplectic vector spaces and manifolds,
and Lagrangian submanifolds

In this section, we give the basic definitions used in the paper, together with
some examples. We will work over the real numbers and all manifolds will be
smooth. The algebraic considerations for vector spaces hold true over fields
of characteristic zero instead of the reals.
Definition 1. Let V be a vector space, k ≥ 1 and ω ∈ Λk+1 (V ∗ ). We say that
(V, ω) is a k-plectic vector space (or simply a multisymplectic vector space) if
ω is nondegenerate, in the sense that :
ω ♯ : V → Λk (V ∗ ); v 7→ ιv ω
is injective.
As in the symplectic case, we can define orthogonal subspaces with respect to ω, but in this setting we have more than just one "ω-orthogonal
complement" for a given subspace of V :
Definition 2. Let (V, ω) be a k-plectic vector space, U ⊂ V a subspace and
1 ≤ j ≤ k. We define the j-th orthogonal complement of U with respect to ω
as follows:
U ⊥,j := {v ∈ V | ιv∧u1 ∧...∧uj ω = 0, ∀u1 , ..., uj ∈ U}.
We say that U ⊂ V is a j-isotropic subspace (respectively, a j-Lagrangian
subspace) if U ⊂ U ⊥,j (respectively if U = U ⊥,j ).
Going to manifolds we have:
Definition 3. Let M be a manifold and ω ∈ Λk+1T ∗ M. We say that (M, ω)
is a k-plectic manifold, or simply a multisymplectic manifold, if the form ω
is closed and nondegenerate, in the sense that for all q ∈ M, the map :
ωq♯ : Tq M → Λk (Tq∗ M); vq 7→ ιvq ωq
is injective.
4

Analogously to the linear case, we will say that a regular submanifold L is
a j-isotropic respectively j-Lagrangian submanifold of M, if, for each p ∈ L,
Tp L is a j-isotropic respectively j-Lagrangian subspace of Tp M.
Before studying a special class of multisymplectic manifolds in Sections
2 and 3, we will give general examples of multisymplectic manifolds and
isotropic submanifolds. Note that if N is a submanifold of M of dimension
n, then N is j-isotropic for all j ≥ n in a trivial way. Thus in the following
examples, we will only consider "interesting" isotropic and Lagrangian submanifolds, where this is not the case.
Example 1. Let M be an orientable manifold of dimension m and ω a volume form on M. Then (M, ω) is a (m−1)-plectic manifold. In this case there
are no non-trivial examples (in the sense stated above) of isotropic submanifolds of M.
Example 2. Let Q be a manifold, k ≥ 1 and the dimension of Q being
greater or equal to k+1. Then the manifold M := Λk (T ∗ Q) is naturally
equipped with a k-plectic form. Indeed let θ ∈ Ωk (M) be defined by :
θαp (v1 , ..., vk ) := αp (π∗αp (v1 ), ..., π∗αp (vk )),
where αp ∈ M, vj ∈ Tαp (M), and π : M → Q is the canonical projection.
Then ω := −dθ is a k-plectic form on M. This construction is the generalization of the symplectic form on a cotangent bundle. The zero-section of
Λk (T ∗ M) is a k-Lagrangian manifold, and the fibers of π are 1-Lagrangian.
To see this, we can work in local coordinates. A direct computation shows
then that if (q i ) are coordinates on an open subset U ⊂ Q and (pI ) are
coordinates on the fibers of Λk (T ∗ U), we have :
X
ω|U = −
dpi1 ,...,ik ∧ dq i1 ∧ ... ∧ dq ik .
i1 ,...,ik

Using this local description it is easy to see that Q is k-Lagrangian and
the fibers are 1-Lagrangian. More generally, for α ∈ Ωk (Q), we have that
im(α) ⊂ M is a k-Lagrangian manifold if and only if α is closed. This follows
from α∗ θ = α (where, on the left-side, α is regarded as a map α : Q → M),
implying α∗ ω = −dα.
Example 3. Let (M, η) be a k-plectic manifold and ω ∈ Ωk+1 (M × M) the
form given by:
ω = p∗1 η − p∗2 η,
5

where for i = 1, 2, the map pi is the projection pi : M × M → M on the
i-th factor. Then (M × M, ω) is a k-plectic manifold. Considering a diffeomorphism φ : M → M, we claim that Γφ , the graph of φ, is k-Lagrangian
if and only if φ is a symplectomorphism in the sense that φ∗ η = η. Indeed T(q,φ(q)) (M × M) = {(uq , φ∗q (uq )) | uq ∈ Tq M}. Then for (ui , φ∗ (ui )) ∈
T(q,φ(q)) (M × M) (1 ≤ i ≤ k) we obtain:
ω(q,φ(q)) ((u1 , φ∗ (u1 )), ..., (uk , φ∗ (uk )) = ηq (u1 , ..., uk ) − ηφ(q) (φ∗ (u1), ..., φ∗ (uk ))
= ηq (u1 , ..., uk ) − (φ∗ η)q (u1 , ..., uk ),
showing the claim.
Example 4. Let M be a complex manifold with a holomorphic volume
form Ω. Then setting ω = ℜ(Ω), the real part of Ω, turns (M, ω) into a
multisymplectic manifold. To get a feeling of how Lagrangian submanifolds
may look in this case, we consider M = C3 = R6 and Ω = dz 1 ∧ dz 2 ∧ dz 3 =
dz 123 . We find:
ω = dx123 − dx156 − dx246 − dx345 ,
where we have omitted wedge products and xi are coordinates in R6 . Then
the manifold {x1 = x2 = x3 = 0} is 2-Lagrangian, and the manifold {x2 =
x3 = x5 = x6 = 0} is 1-Lagrangian.
Example 5. (Compare [3], Section 3.) Let M = R6 and
ω = dx145 + dx246 + dx356 + dx456 .
Then ω is a 2-plectic form, and L2 = {x1 = x3 = x4 = x6 = 0} and
L3 = {x4 = x5 = x6 = 0} are (linear) 1-Lagrangian submanifolds of (M, ω)
of different dimensions. (Note that (R6 , ω) is symplectomorphic to the multicotangent bundle Λ2 (T ∗ R3 ) with the multisymplectic form defined in Example 2 above.)
Example 6. Let G be a real semi-simple, compact Lie group. Consider the
Cartan form ω ∈ Ω3 (G), which is the bi-invariant form defined at the neutral
element e by :
ωe (ξ, η, ζ) := h[ξ, η], ζi ,
where ξ, η, ζ ∈ g (the Lie algebra of G) and < ., . > is the Killing form. The
form ω is closed because it is bi-invariant, and it is nondegenerate because
the Killing form is nondegenerate and [g, g] = g. Consider T ⊂ G, a torus.
6

Its Lie algebra t is abelian and thus T is 1-isotropic. Thus if T is a maximal
torus then it is 1-Lagrangian.

Standard multisymplectic vector spaces and
manifolds

In this section, we will be interested in a special class of multisymplectic
vector spaces and manifolds, important in applications of multisymplectic
geometry to classical field theories.
Definition 4. Let V be a vector space and k > 1. We say that V is a
standard k-plectic vector space, if (V, ω) is a k-plectic vector space and there
exists a subspace W ⊂ V such that:
(1) ∀u, v ∈ W, ιu∧v ω = 0
(2) dim(W ) = dim(Λk ((V /W )∗))
(3) codim(W ) > k .
Let us also consider the following condition :
(3’ )

dim(W ) ≥ codim(W ) .

Concentrating on the higher degree cases (k > 1) we then have the following relations between these conditions:
Lemma 1. Let (V, ω) be a k-plectic vector space with k > 1. Then :
(i) conditions (1) and (2) imply that the map ω ♯ |W : W → Λk V ∗ induces
a linear isomorphism :
χ : W → Λk (V /W )∗ ,
(ii) if conditions (1) and (2) are satisfied, then condition (3) is equivalent
to condition (3′ ),
(iii) if (V, ω) is standard, then dim(W ) ≥ 2.
Remark. In reference [4] these multisymplectic vector spaces are called of
type (k+1, 0).

Proof. We denote the projection V → V /W by π. Then the subspace
π ∗ (Λk (V /W )∗) ⊂ Λk V ∗ is given by :
π ∗ (Λk (V /W )∗ ) = {η ∈ Λk V ∗ | ιv η = 0, ∀v ∈ W }.
By condition (1), ω ♯ (w) ∈ π ∗ (Λk (V /W )∗) whenever w ∈ W ; thus ω ♯ induces
a unique injective linear map χ : W → Λk (V /W )∗ such that π ∗ ◦ χ = ω ♯ |W .
Moreover, χ is a linear isomorphism by condition (2) ; thus proving the first
assertion.
Now put d = dim(W ), c = codim(W ). Then dim(V ) = c + d. Assume

conditions (1) − (3) to hold, and d < c. By condition (2), d = kc , thus
d = c(c−1)...(c−(k−1))
≥ c. This contradiction shows that conditions (1) − (3)
k(k−1)...1
′
imply condition (3 ).
Now assume conditions (1), (2), (3′) to hold and c ≤ k. Since c < k is
easily seen to contradict (2), then c = k and d = 1. By (3′ ), dim(V ) = 2 and
thus 1 = dim(Λk (V /W )∗ ), implying k = 1, contradicting the assumptions.
Thus the conditions (1), (2), (3′) imply conditions (1) − (3), and the second
assertion is proven.
Now assume that d ≤ 1. If d = 0, then Λk V ∗ = {0}, contradicting
 the
dim(V )−1
fact that ω is nondegenerate. Now if d = 1, we have 1 =
and
k
therefore k + 1 = dim(V ), implying c = k ; this contradiction proves the last
assertion.
If (V, ω) is a standard k-plectic vector space, with k > 1, then the subspace W satisfying Definition 2 is unique as shows the following :
Proposition 1. Let (V, ω) be a standard k-plectic vector space, with k > 1,

that:

Furthermore :
dim(π(Z) ∧ Λk−1 (V /W )) = dim(Λk−1 (V /W )) > 1,
because codim(W ) > k. This shows a contradiction, and thus the Proposition.
The preceding proposition allows to denote such a subspace by Wω and
motivates the next definition :
Definition 5. Let M be a manifold, k > 1, and ω ∈ Λk+1 (T ∗ M). We say
that (M, ω) is a standard k-plectic manifold if (M, ω) is a k-plectic manifold
and if for each p ∈ M, (Tp M, ωp ) is a standard k-plectic vector space. For
all p ∈ M the unique subspace of Tp M satisfying Definition 4 is denoted by
Wω (p) or simply W (p).
The remainder of this section is dedicated to showing that standard multisymplectic vector spaces are in fact symplectomorphic to a canonical k-plectic
model that we will describe now.
Proposition 2. Let (V, ω) be a standard k-plectic vector space. Then the
subspace Wω is 1-Lagrangian. Moreover, there exists a k-Lagrangian vector
space L ⊂ V complementary to Wω and the map χ induces (for all choices
of such L) an isomorphism:
Wω ∼
= Λk (L∗ ).
Proof. Condition (1) in Definition 2 implies that Wω is 1-isotropic. Now if
w ∈ Wω⊥,1 but w ∈
/ Wω , then we can find η ∈ Λk (V /Wω )∗ such that ιw η 6= 0.
But, for all u ∈ Wω , ιu ιw ω = 0 and thus there cannot exist a u ∈ Wω
such that η = ιu ω. This property contradicts the fact that the map χ is an
isomorphism, and therefore proves that Wω is 1-Lagrangian.

V /Wω is an isomorphism. Thus we have a canonical isomorphism χ : Wω −→
e∗ ). We will search for a k-Lagrangian complement of the form L =
Λ k (L
e for some linear map A : L
e → Wω . For L to be k-Lagrangian,
{v +Av | v ∈ L}
e j = 1, ..., k+1 :
it has to verify that L ⊂ L⊥,k , i.e., for all vj ∈ L,
ω(v1 + Av1 , ..., vk+1 + Avk+1 ) = 0.

This condition suffices here because assuming that there exists an element
u ∈ L⊥,k \L, we may write u = v + w, with v ∈ L and w ∈ Wω . For
u1 , ..., uk ∈ L we compute then:
ω(u, u1, ..., uk ) = ω(v, u1, ..., uk ) + ω(w, u1, ..., uk )
= ω(w, u1, ..., uk ) = 0
because v ∈ L ⊂ L⊥,k , and u ∈ L⊥,k . Thus we obtain w ∈ Wω ∩ L⊥,k . But
then for all vj = xj + yj , vj ∈ V , xj ∈ L and yj ∈ Wω :
ω(w, v1, ..., vk ) = ω(v, u1, ..., uk ) + ω(w, u1, ..., uk )
= 0.
By the nondegeneracy of ω, we obtain w = 0, thus u = v ∈ L which is a
contradiction to u ∈ L⊥,k \L.
Now we return to the construction of the linear map A. We have:
ω(v1 + Av1 , ..., vk+1 + Avk+1 ) = ω(v1 , ..., vk+1 )

(−1)j+1 ω(Avj , v1 , ..., vbj , ..., vk+1).

Let Φ := χ ◦ A, then the Lagrangian condition reads as follows:

We denote by T the application T : L
k+1
then the above condition is verified. Thus the map A := (χ)−1 ◦ Φ has the
property that its graph L = ΓΦ is a k-Lagrangian space, complementary to
Wω .
Definition 6. Let V be a vector space and ωcan the canonical (k+1)-form
on the space V := V ⊕ Λk (V ∗ ) given by:
ωcan (v1 ⊕ α1 , ..., vk+1 ⊕ αk+1) =

X
i=1

(−1)i+1 αi (v1 , ..., vi−1 , vbi , vi+1 , ..., vk+1 ),
10

for all vj ∈ V , and αj ∈ Λk (V ∗ ). Then ωcan is a k-plectic form. We call
(V, ωcan ) a canonical k-plectic vector space.
Lemma 2. Let (V, ω) be a k-plectic vector space with k > 1. Then (V, ω)
is isomorphic to a canonical k-plectic vector space (L ⊕ Λk (L∗ ), ωcan ) if and
only if (V, ω) is standard.
Proof. Let (V, ω) be a standard k-plectic vector space, and L a k-Lagrangian
subspace complementary to Wω . We define ωcan as above on the space L ⊕
Λk (L∗ ). Let γ := idL ⊕χ : L⊕Wω → L⊕Λk (L∗ ), where we again canonically
identified V /Wω and L. Then γ is a linear isomorphism and furthermore we
find:
ωcan (γ(u1 ⊕ w1 ), ..., γ(uk+1 ⊕ wk+1)) = ωcan (u1 ⊕ ιw1 ω), ..., uk+1 ⊕ ιwk+1 ω))
X
(−1)j+1 ιwj ω(u1, ..., ubj , ..., uk+1)
=
j=1...k+1

= ω(u1 ⊕ w1 , ..., uk+1 ⊕ wk+1 ),

i.e. γ ∗ ωcan = ω. Therefore, the k-plectic space (V, ω) is symplectomorphic to
(L ⊕ Λk (L∗ ), ωcan ).
To show the converse, first note that if (L ⊕ Λk (L∗ ), ωcan ) is a canonical kplectic vector space, then the space L identified with L × {0} ⊂ L ⊕ Λk (L∗ ),
is k-Lagrangian, and the space Λk (L∗ ), identified with {0} × Λk (L∗ ) ⊂ L ⊕
Λk (L∗ ) is 1-Lagrangian. Indeed :
ωcan ((v1 , 0), ..., (vk+1, 0)) = 0,
and if ωcan ((v, α), (v1, 0), ..., (vk , 0)) = 0 for all vj ∈ L, then α(v1 , ..., vk ) = 0
and then α = 0. This shows that L is k-Lagrangian. Moreover :
ωcan ((0, α), (0, β), (v1, γ1 ), ..., (vk−2, γk−2) = 0,
and if ωcan ((v, α), (0, β), (v1, γ1 ), ..., (vk−2, γk−2 ) = 0 for all vj ∈ V and γj ∈
Λk (L∗ ), then ιv β = 0 and thus v = 0. This shows that Λk (L∗ ) is 1Lagrangian. Thus, if a k-plectic linear space (V, ω) is symplectomorphic to a
space (L ⊕ Λk (L∗ ), ωcan ), then, pulling back the 1-Lagrangian space Λk (L∗ )
to V with this symplectomorphism gives a linear subspace W ⊂ V satisfying
Definition 2.
Remark. Consider now a manifold Q, k > 1 and (Λk (T ∗ Q), ω Λ
k-plectic structure exposed in Example 2 of Section 1. We have :
T (Λk (T ∗ Q))|Q = T Q ⊕ Λk (T ∗ Q).

Normal forms of Lagrangian submanifolds of
standard multisymplectic manifolds

In this section we give a proof of the main result, that first appeared in
equivalent form as Lemma 2.1 in Geoffrey Martin’s 1988 article [8]:
Theorem 1. Let (M, ω) be a standard k-plectic manifold with k > 1. Let
the distribution W ⊂ T M be defined as W := ∪p∈M Wω (p) and let L be a kLagrangian submanifold of M complementary to W (that is Tp M = Tp L⊕Wp
for all p in L). If W is integrable, there exist open neighborhoods U and V
of L in M and Λk (T ∗ L), and a diffeomorphism φ : U → V such that:
φ|L = idL and φ∗ (ω Λ

k (T ∗ L)

) = ω on U.

Proof. It follows from the definition of a standard k-plectic manifold and the
results found in the linear case, that if L is complementary to W we have an
isomorphism of vector bundles :
χ : W |L → Λk (T ∗ L),
which is given by contraction of vectors in W with ω, using the identification
T M|L /W |L ∼
= T L. (Note that we write in the sequel often Wx for the fiber
of the vector bundle W → M over x in M.)
Using this map we construct the following vector bundle isomorphism :
Ψ : T M|L = T L ⊕ W |L ∼
= T L ⊕ Λk (T ∗ L) = T (Λk (T ∗ L))|L ,
acting as the identity on vectors of T L, and transforming vectors of W
via χ (i.e., Ψ = idT L ⊕ χ). Furthermore, this map is for each x ∈ L
12

an isomorphism between the multisymplectic vector spaces (Tx M, ωx ) and
k ∗
(Tx (Λk T ∗ L), ωxΛ T L ). We now wish to find a diffeomorphism f : U1 → U2 ,
where U1 , U2 are neighborhoods of L respectively in M and in Λk (T ∗ L), such
that f |L = idL and for every x ∈ L, Tx f = Ψx . Such a map f then fulfills
k
∗
(f ∗ ω Λ (T L) )|L = ω|L .
By the foliated tubular neighborhood theorem, we may find a neighborhood U of L in M, a neighborhood V of the zero-section in W |L , and a
diffeomorphism φ, which is the identity along L, maps each leaf of the foliation to a fiber of W |L → L, and has as its differential at any point of L the
identity. Let f := χ ◦ φ. Then f maps L to the zero section of Λk (T ∗ L),
and is a diffeomorphism onto an open subset U ′ ⊂ Λk (T ∗ L) which contains
L (as the zero section). Furthermore we have for x ∈ L, Tx f |Wx = χ and
Tx f |Tx L = idTx L (where we have identified Tx (Wx ) with Wx ). Thus we obtain
k
∗
for x ∈ L, Tx f = Ψx , and upon putting ω
e := f ∗ ω Λ (T L) ,we arrive, by the
above said, at ω
e |L = ω|L .
We now want to show that for any vector fields X, Y (defined in U) and
tangent to W , ιX∧Y ω
e = 0. Let p ∈ U and Fp be the leaf of the foliation
defined by W, which passes through p. This leaf also passes through a point
of L, say x. Then φ maps this leaf to the space Wx , and thus f maps
Fp to Λk (Tx∗ L). Thus if, Xp , Yp are vectors in Wp , we may consider that
Tp f (Xp ), Tp f (Yp ) are vectors of Λk (Tx∗ L). Since this space is 1-Lagrangian
k
∗
with respect to ω Λ (T L) , we find ιX∧Y ω
e = 0.
Working on an open neighborhood U of L in M, we adapt now the wellknown Moser path method (see [9]) to our situation. Let ωt = ω + t(e
ω − ω)
∂
′
′
for t ∈ [0, 1]. Then we have ωt |L = ω|L and ∂t ωt = ω
e − ω =: ω so ω |L = 0.
Thus for x ∈ L, ωt (x) is nondegenerate for all t ∈ [0, 1] and the set of points
(t, x) such that ωt (x) is nondegenerate is an open subset of R × M. So,
shrinking U if necessary, we may suppose that ωt is nondegenerate in U for
all t ∈ [0, 1]. We also have that dωt = dω ′ = 0. By the relative Poincaré
lemma, there exist a neighborhood U of L in M and µ ∈ Ωk (U) with dµ = ω ′
and µ|L = 0. Moreover -upon using Theorem 3- we can choose µ such that
ιv µ = 0 whenever v ∈ W , because ω ′ vanishes when contracted with two
vectors of W (because both ω and ω
e have this property). Therefore µ may
be interpreted as a section U → Λk (T M/W )∗ . Let us now take a look at the
map :
ωt♯ : W → Λk (T ∗ M),
given by contraction of ωt with vectors of W . For u, v ∈ W , lying over the
same point, ιu∧v ωt = 0 ; so ωt♯ may be seen as a map :
ωt♯ : W → Λk (T M/W )∗ ; u 7→ ιu ωt ,
13

and, by the nondegeneration of ωt , this map is injective, and thus is an
isomorphism for dimensional reasons. Then for each t ∈ [0, 1], there exists a
unique vector field Xt (which take values in W ) such that :
ιXt ωt + µ = 0
The association (t, x) → Xt (x) thus gives a (time-dependent) vector field
tangent to W . But µ|L = 0 so we deduce that for x ∈ L, for all t ∈
[0, 1], Xt (x) = 0 by the nondegeneration of ωt . Let φt be the curve of local
diffeomorphisms tangent to Xt . We have φt |L = id|L . So ∀t ∈ [0, 1] φt |L is
defined. But if D(φ) ⊂ [0, 1] × U is the domain of φ, then [0, 1] × L ⊂ D(φ)
so, by the openness of D(φ), we may suppose (again shrinking the domain
U if necessary), that φt is defined in U for all t ∈ [0, 1] . Now we compute :

Appendix: Two results in foliated differential
topology
In this appendix we give proofs for two "folkloristic" but subtle (and useful)
extensions of well-known results in differential topology. Both are used in [8]
but ask for a detailed proof. A brief sketch of a proof of the first result is
given on the pages 88-89 in [2].
We begin with the tubular neighborhood theorem, in the presence of a
foliation:
Theorem 2 (Foliated tubular neighborhood theorem). Let M be a manifold,
W ⊂ T M an integrable distribution, and N a submanifold complementary to
W in the sense that W |N ⊕ T N = T M|N . Then there exist an open neighborhood U of N in M, and a diffeomorphism φ from U onto an open subset
of W |N containing the zero section, such that φ|N = idN , the differential of
φ at any point of N is the identity, and φ maps for all p in N the leaf of
the foliation defined by W passing through it to the fiber φ(U) ∩ (W |p ) of
W |N → N, intersected with φ(U).
14

Proof. Let g be a fixed (auxiliary) Riemannian metric on the manifold M.
Given q ∈ M, the leaf Wq of the foliation W defined by the distribution W
and containing q is given as an injectively immersed submanifold jq : Fq → M
(with image jq (Fq ) = Wq ). The induced Riemannian metric jq∗ (g) defines
an exponential map expW , notably one has expW
q : Tq (Fq ) → Fq , defined
on an open neighborhood of 0. Since Tq (Fq ) is canonically identified with
Wq = Tq (Wq ) via the differential of jq , and jq is smooth, expW
q is a smooth
map from an open neighborhood of 0 in Wq to M, having values in Wq .
Restricting q to be an element of N we obtain a map expW,N from a subset
of W |N containing N to M.
Let us now show that expW,N is, in fact, smooth on an open neighborhood
ϕ
of N in W |N . Fix q in N and a coordinate chart M ⊃ U −
→ V1 × V2 ⊂
Rm−d × Rd , such that the fibers of π : V1 × V2 → V1 are the leaves of the
foliation W (d is the rank of this foliation). Furthermore, we can assume
that ϕ(q) = 0 and denote the elements of Rm−d resp. Rd by x resp. z.
We denote ϕ(U ∩N) by N and T ϕ(W ) by W if no ambiguities are possible.
By the assumption T M|N = T N ⊕ W |N we have ∀q ∈ N ⊂ V1 × V2 that
Rm = Tq (V1 ×V2 ) = Tq N ⊕Wq = Tq N ⊕Rd and thus the natural projection πq :
Tq N → Rm−d is a linear isomorphism. Thus π|N : N → V1 has everywhere
maximal rank equal to the dimension of V1 . Shrinking V1 and V2 if necessary,
we can assume that π|N : N → V1 is a diffeomorphism whose inverse is
described by (idV1 , f ) : V1 → V1 × V2 , where f : V1 → V2 is smooth and
N = Γf , the graph of f . The map ψ given by ψ(x, z) = (x, z −f (x)) =: (x, y)
is a diffeomorphism of V1 × V2 to an open subset of Rm . Restricting ψ to
an appropriate open neighborhood of 0, the image of ψ is a product of open
subsets of Rm−d and Rd . Furthermore, ψ(0) = 0, ψ preserves the leaves of
W, and maps N = Γf to {y = 0}.
Post-composing ϕ with ψ yields a chart of M near q compatible with the
foliation W and "adapted" to N. Obviously, we can construct a locally finite
covering of N by open subsets of M that are domains of such charts, again
denoted by ϕ : U → V1 × V2 for simplicity.
In these coordinates expW,N
(x,0) is given as the time-one value of the solution
of the following differential equation :

Standard results on smooth ordinary differential equations depending smoothly
e ⊂ W |N containing
on parameters imply that there exists an open subset O
15

N, where expW,N is uniquely defined and smooth.
e = Tq N ⊕ Wq = Tq M, we obtain that
Upon identifying, for q ∈ N, Tq O
W,N
D(expq ) = idTq M . By the below cited Proposition 3, it follows that there
e ⊂ W |N such that expW,N |O is a
exists an open neighborhood O of N in O
diffeomorphism onto its image U, an open neighborhood of N in M. Calling
its inverse φ, this latter map fulfills the conditions stated in Theorem 2.
The last argument relies on a standard result in differential topology (cf.,
e.g., Proposition 7.3 in [6]):
Proposition 3. Let Y and Y ′ be two manifolds, and X ⊂ Y , X ′ ⊂ Y ′ two
regular submanifolds. Let f : Y → Y ′ be a smooth map satisfying :
• f |X : X → X ′ is a diffeomorphism
• Tx f : Tx Y → Tf (x) Y ′ is an isomorphism for all x ∈ X
Then there exists an open neighborhood V of X in Y such that f (V ) is open
in Y ′ , and f |V is a diffeomorphism.
Now we show the relative Poincaré lemma, again in the presence of a
foliation:
Theorem 3 (Foliated relative Poincaré lemma). Let M be a smooth manifold
and N⊂M a submanifold. Let ω be a closed (k+1)-form on M which vanishes
when pulled back to N. Then there exists a neighborhood U of N in M, and
a k-form µ defined on U, such that dµ = ω|U and µ|N = 0. Moreover, if
there exists an integrable distribution W ⊂ T M complementary to N, and
such that ιu∧v ω = 0 whenever x is in M and u and v are in Wx ⊂ Tx M, we
may choose µ such that ιX µ = 0, for all vector fields X taking value in W
and defined on an open subset of U.
Proof. By the (standard) tubular neighborhood theorem, there exist U and
V neighborhoods of N in M respectively E (where E → N can be chosen
to be any vector bundle such that E ⊕ T N = T M|N ), and a diffeomorphism
φ : U → V fixing N pointwise. Thus in what follows, we can and will assume
to be in a open neighborhood U of N in M, which is also a vector bundle
π : E = U → N over N. Let us consider the map:
H : [0, 1] × U → U , (t, x) 7→ t · x = tx.
If we denote Ht (x) := H(t, x) then H0 = ι ◦ π (where ι : N → U = E
is the inclusion of N as the zero-section of E), and H1 = idE = idU . Let
16

Yt (x) := dtd Ht (x). The smooth map Yt is not a vector field since H is not a
flow, but the following formula still holds:
d
(H ∗ω) = d(Ht∗ ιYt ω) + Ht∗ ιYt dω,
dt t

(*)

where, for α a (k+1)-form, Ht∗ ιYt α is the following (well-defined!) k-form:
(Ht∗ιYt α)x (v1 , ..., vk ) = αtx (Yt (x), Tx Ht (v1 ), ..., Tx Ht (vk )),
for x ∈ U and vj ∈ Tx U. For a proof of (∗) see [7].
Since ι∗ ω = 0 and ω is closed we obtain:

where we set µ := [0,1] (Ht∗ιYt ω)dt. Moreover µ|N = 0 because Yt |N = 0.
To prove the last part of the theorem, we apply Theorem 2 in order to
choose a foliated tubular neighborhood U of N with respect to W . We can
thus assume that the fibers of U → N are the fibers of W |N → N. Then for
x ∈ U, Yt (x) ∈ Wtx , implying for X a vector field tangent to W :
(ιX Ht∗ ιYt ω)x (v1 , ..., vk−1 ) = (Ht∗ ιYt ω)x (X(x), v1 , ..., vk−1 )
= ωtx (Yt (x), Tx Ht (X(x)), Tx Ht (v1 ), ..., Tx Ht (vk−1))
=0
since Yt (x) and Tx Ht (X(x)) are both in Wtx .
