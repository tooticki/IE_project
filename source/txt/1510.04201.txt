A FREDHOLM ALTERNATIVE FOR QUASILINEAR ELLIPTIC
EQUATIONS WITH RIGHT HAND SIDE MEASURE
MICHELE COLTURATO AND MARCO DEGIOVANNI
Abstract. We consider a quasilinear elliptic equation, with right hand side
measure, which does not satisfy the usual coercivity assumption. We prove an
existence result in the line of the Fredholm alternative. For this purpose we
develop a variant of degree theory suited to this setting.

1. Introduction
Let Ω be a bounded and open subset of RN and let
a : Ω × RN → RN ,

b : Ω × (R × RN ) → R

be two Carathéodory functions. We are interested in the existence of solutions u
to the problem
(
−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u) = µ
in Ω ,
(1.1)
u=0
on ∂Ω ,
when µ is a Radon measure on Ω with bounded total variation.
If b = 0 and {u 7→ −div[a(x, ∇u)]} is a coercive Leray-Lions operator from
′
W01,p (Ω) into W −1,p (Ω), then the problem has been the object of several papers.
Let us mention in particular [7], where the existence and uniqueness of an entropy
solution is proved when µ is absolutely continuous with respect to the p-capacity,
and [12], where the existence and stability of renormalized solutions is proved for a
general µ. When µ is absolutely continuous with respect to the p-capacity, the two
concepts of entropy solution and renormalized solution agree. A sharper result is
proved, in the case p = N , in [18], while the case of µ absolutely continuous with
respect to the p-capacity is treated also in [19], provided that p > 2 − 1/N .
If p = 2 and the principal part is linear, then much more is known, both in
coercive and noncoercive situations (see e.g. [2, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 26]).
′
On the other hand, if µ ∈ W −1,p (Ω) and the operator
{u 7→ −div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u)}
is well defined and continuous from W01,p (Ω) into W −1,p (Ω), then the problem has
been treated, under various assumptions, also for p 6= 2 in the noncoercive case.
Let us mention, in particular, the results in the line of the Fredholm alternative
proved in [4] and then developed with detailed descriptions, when resonance occurs
at the principal eigenvalue (see [25] and references therein).

We are interested in a result in the same direction, when µ is a Radon measure
which has bounded total variation and is absolutely continuous with respect to the
p-capacity. More precisely, we assume that:
′

(i) there exist 1 < p < ∞, α0 , α2 ∈ L1 (Ω), α1 ∈ Lp (Ω), β ∈ R and ν > 0 such
that
a(x, ξ) · ξ ≥ ν|ξ|p − α0 (x) ,
|a(x, ξ)| ≤ α1 (x) + β|ξ|p−1 ,
|b(x, s, ξ)| ≤ α2 (x) + β|s|p−1 + β|ξ|p−1 ,
for a.e. x ∈ Ω and every s ∈ R, ξ ∈ RN ; such a p is clearly unique;
(ii) we have
[a(x, ξ) − a(x, η)] · (ξ − η) > 0
for a.e. x ∈ Ω and every ξ, η ∈ RN with ξ 6= η;
(iii) there exist two Carathéodory functions
a ∞ : Ω × RN → RN ,

b∞ : Ω × (R × RN ) → R ,

such that
[a∞ (x, ξ) − a∞ (x, η)] · (ξ − η) > 0 ,
for a.e. x ∈ Ω and every ξ, η ∈ RN with ξ 6= η, and such that

b(x, τk sk , τk ξk )
= b∞ (x, s, ξ) ,
τkp−1

for a.e. x ∈ Ω, whenever τk → +∞, sk → s and ξk → ξ.
It easily follows that
a∞ (x, ξ) · ξ ≥ ν|ξ|p ,
|a∞ (x, ξ)| ≤ β|ξ|

p−1

|b∞ (x, s, ξ)| ≤ β|s|
a∞ (x, τ ξ) = τ

We aim to prove the next result.
Theorem 1.1. Under hypotheses (i)–(iii), assume also that
a∞ (x, −ξ) = −a∞ (x, ξ) ,

b∞ (x, −s, −ξ) = −b∞ (x, s, ξ) ,

for a.e. x ∈ Ω and every s ∈ R and ξ ∈ RN .
Then one at least of the following assertions is true:
(a) the problem
(
u ∈ W01,p (Ω) \ {0} ,

−div[a∞ (x, ∇u)] + b∞ (x, u, ∇u) = 0

admits a solution;

(b) for every Radon measure µ, which has bounded total variation and is absolutely continuous with respect to the p-capacity, problem (1.1) admits an
entropy solution u (see the next Section 3 for the definition of entropy solution in this setting).
In order to prove Theorem 1.1, we first develop an adaptation of degree theory to
our setting. Since the problems with right hand side measure are usually treated by
an approximation procedure involving operators of Leray-Lions type, we choose a
development of the degree for maps of class (S)+ (see [10, 22, 24]), which naturally
acts in the same setting.
In Section 2 we recall the main facts concerning entropy solutions to problems
of the form
(
−div[a(x, ∇u)] = µ
in Ω ,
u=0
on ∂Ω ,
and prove some auxiliary results. Then we introduce, in Section 3, the adaptation of
the topological degree and state its properties. With this tool at hand, in Section 4
we prove Theorem 1.1. The subsequent sections are devoted to the construction of
such a degree and the proof of its properties.
′
Since each Radon measure with bounded total variation belongs to W −1,p if
p > N , we have no novelty in this case. Therefore, from now on we only consider
the case 1 < p ≤ N .
In the following, we denote by k kp the usual Lp -norm and by k k−1,p′ the norm in
−1,p′
W
(Ω) dual to the norm k∇ukp in W01,p (Ω). If s ∈ R, we set s± = max{±s, 0}.
2. Entropy solutions
From now on, Ω will denote a bounded and open subset of RN with N ≥ 2.
According to [7], if 1 < p ≤ N we denote by Mpb (Ω) the set of Radon measures µ
on Ω whose total variation |µ| is bounded and absolutely continuous with respect
to the p-capacity.
According to [3, 7], we also denote by T01,p (Ω) the set of (classes of equivalence of)
functions u : Ω → [−∞, +∞] such that |u| < +∞ a.e. in Ω and Tk (u) ∈ W01,p (Ω)
for any k > 0, where

s
if |s| ≤ k ,
s
Tk (s) =
if |s| > k .
k
|s|

If u ∈ T01,p (Ω), there exists one and only one measurable (class of equivalence)
∇u : Ω → RN such that g(u) ∈ W01,p (Ω) and ∇[g(u)] = g ′ (u)∇u a.e. in Ω,
whenever g : R → R is Lipschitz continuous with g(0) = 0 and g ′ (s) = 0 outside
some compact subset of R.
According to [12], any u ∈ T01,p (Ω) has a Borel and capp -quasi continuous representative ũ : Ω → [−∞, +∞], defined up to a set of null p-capacity, which we
still denote by u. Of course, the set {|u| = +∞} has null measure, but could have
positive p-capacity.
If u, u1 , u2 ∈ T01,p (Ω) and t ∈ R, it is easily seen that
tu ,

max{u1 , u2 } ,

min{u1 , u2 } ∈ T01,p (Ω)

4

with
∇(tu) = t∇u ,
∇u1 = ∇u2

a.e. in {u1 = u2 } ,

∇ max{u1 , u2 } = χ{u1 >u2 } ∇u1 + χ{u2 ≥u1 } ∇u2 ,
∇ min{u1 , u2 } = χ{u1 <u2 } ∇u1 + χ{u2 ≤u1 } ∇u2 .
On the contrary, one cannot say (see [3]) that u1 + u2 ∈ T01,p (Ω). For reader’s
convenience, we also provide a proof of the next result.
Proposition 2.1. Let u1 , u2 ∈ T01,p (Ω) with ∇u1 = ∇u2 a.e. in Ω. Assume also
that
Z
1
|∇u1 |p dx < +∞ .
lim inf p
k→+∞ k
{k<|u1 |<2k}
Then u1 = u2 a.e. in Ω.

Proof. Let ϑ : R → [0, 1] be a smooth function with ϑ(s) = 0 for |s| ≤ 1 and
ϑ(s) = 1 for |s| ≥ 2. Then we have
T2k (u1 ) , T1 (u2 − T2k (u1 )) , ϑ(u1 /k) ∈ W01,p (Ω) ∩ L∞ (Ω) ,
whence
T1 (u2 − u1 )(1 − ϑ(u1 /k))
= T1 (u2 − T2k (u1 ))(1 − ϑ(u1 /k)) ∈ W01,p (Ω) ∩ L∞ (Ω)
with
|∇[T1 (u2 − u1 )(1 − ϑ(u1 /k))]| ≤

kϑ′ k∞
χ{k<|u1 |<2k} |∇u1 | .
k

If (kj ) is a sequence with kj → +∞ and
Z
1
|∇u1 |p dx < +∞ ,
sup p
j∈N kj
{kj <|u1 |<2kj }
it follows that (T1 (u2 − u1 )(1 − ϑ(u1 /kj ))) is convergent both to T1 (u2 − u1 ) a.e.
in Ω and to 0 weakly in W01,p (Ω). Then T1 (u2 − u1 ) = 0 a.e. in Ω and the assertion
follows.


Then u1 , u2 ∈ T01,p (Ω) with ∇u1 = ∇u2 a.e. in Ω, but it is false that u1 = u2 a.e.
in Ω. One can also observe that −u1 ∈ T01,p (Ω), but u2 + (−u1 ) 6∈ T01,p (Ω).

We are also interested in a smaller space, suggested by the techniques of [5, 6, 23].
Let us denote by ϕp : R → R the increasing C ∞ -diffeomorphism such that
ϕ′p (s) =

1
{(1 +

s2 )[log(e

1

+ s2 )]4 } 2p

,

ϕp (0) = 0 .

Then we denote by Φ1,p
0 (Ω) the set of (classes of equivalence of) functions u : Ω → R
such that ϕp (u) ∈ W01,p (Ω). It is easily seen that
1,p
W01,p (Ω) ⊆ Φ1,p
0 (Ω) ⊆ T0 (Ω)

and that ∇[ϕp (u)] = ϕ′p (u)∇u a.e. in Ω, where ∇u has to be understood in the
sense of T01,p (Ω). Moreover, any u ∈ Φ1,p
0 (Ω) has a Borel and capp -quasi continuous
representative ũ : Ω → R, defined up to a set of null p-capacity, which we still denote
by u.
1,p
Since {u 7→ ϕp (u)} is bijective from Φ1,p
0 (Ω) onto W0 (Ω), there is a natural
1,p
structure of complete metric space on Φ0 (Ω) which makes {u 7→ ϕp (u)} an isometry. In particular, the distance function is given by
for any u, v ∈ Φ1,p
0 (Ω) .

d(u, v) = k∇[ϕp (u)] − ∇[ϕp (v)]kp

1,p
Proposition 2.3. Let u1 ∈ Φ1,p
0 (Ω) and u2 ∈ T0 (Ω) with ∇u1 = ∇u2 a.e. in Ω.
Then u1 = u2 a.e. in Ω.

Proof. Taking into account the behavior of ϕ′p at infinity, from

|ϕ′p (u1 )|p |∇u1 |p dx < +∞

we infer that

for every k ≥ 1, by Proposition 2.1 the assertion follows.

Now let a : Ω × RN → RN be a Carathéodory function such that:
′

(a1 ) there exist 1 < p ≤ N , α0 ∈ L1 (Ω), α1 ∈ Lp (Ω), β1 ∈ R and ν > 0 such
that
a(x, ξ) · ξ ≥ ν|ξ|p − α0 (x) ,
|a(x, ξ)| ≤ α1 (x) + β1 |ξ|p−1 ,
for a.e. x ∈ Ω and every ξ ∈ RN ;
(a2 ) we have
[a(x, ξ) − a(x, η)] · (ξ − η) > 0
for a.e. x ∈ Ω and every ξ, η ∈ RN with ξ 6= η.
Definition 2.4. Given µ ∈ Mpb (Ω), we say that u is an entropy solution of
(
−div[a(x, ∇u)] = µ
in Ω ,
(2.1)
u=0
on ∂Ω ,

If u is an entropy solution of (2.1), then u actually satisfies the equality and for
a much larger class of test functions. Following the original idea of [8], we aim to
prove a result in this direction.
If h, k ≥ 0, let Th,k : R → R be the odd function such that





Th,k (s) = s − h
if h < s < h + k ,

Then denote by Te01,p (Ω) the set of (classes of equivalence of) functions u : Ω →
[−∞, +∞] such that |u| < +∞ a.e. in Ω and Tε,k (u) ∈ W01,p (Ω) whenever ε > 0
and k > 0. It is easily seen that T01,p (Ω) ⊆ Te01,p (Ω). Moreover, if u ∈ Te01,p (Ω),
there exists one and only one measurable (class of equivalence) ∇u : Ω → RN such
that ∇u = 0 a.e. on {u = 0} and such that g(u) ∈ W01,p (Ω) with ∇[g(u)] = g ′ (u)∇u
a.e. in Ω, whenever g : R → R is Lipschitz continuous with g(0) = 0 and g ′ (s) = 0
outside some compact subset of ]−∞, 0[∪]0, +∞[. If u ∈ T01,p (Ω), then the gradient
of u in the sense of T01,p (Ω) agrees with that in the sense of Te01,p (Ω).
As in the case of T01,p (Ω), any u ∈ Te01,p (Ω) has a Borel and capp -quasi continuous
representative ũ : Ω → [−∞, +∞], defined up to a set of null p-capacity, which
we still denote by u. Finally, let us point out that, if u ∈ Te01,p (Ω), we have
|u|t−1 u ∈ Te01,p (Ω) whenever t > 0.

Remark 2.7. By Theorem 2.6, in the definition of entropy solution it is equivalent
to require u ∈ T01,p (Ω) or u ∈ Φ1,p
0 (Ω).
Now let us recall the main result on entropy solutions.
Theorem 2.8. For every µ ∈ Mpb (Ω), there exists one and only one entropy solution u of (2.1). Moreover, if µ1 , µ2 ∈ Mpb (Ω) satisfy

Then the existence and uniqueness of the entropy solution u can be proved as in [7]

specifically, the order preserving can be proved as in [19, Theorem 2.5], where the
condition p > 2 − 1/N is assumed. However, the same argument works in our case.
We sketch it for reader’s convenience.

whence ∇u1 = ∇u2 a.e. in {u1 > u2 }, namely ∇[max{u1 , u2 }] = ∇u2 a.e. in Ω.
Since max{u1 , u2 } ∈ T01,p (Ω) and u2 ∈ Φ1,p

max{u1 , u2 } = u2 , namely u1 ≤ u2 .

(c) if un , u ∈ Φ1,p

Proof. The argument is an adaptation of the techniques of [5, 6, 23]. If u ∈ Φ1,p

and p < N , we have ϕp (u) ∈ Lp (Ω). Since ϕ′p (s) behaves like

in W01,p (Ω) and a.e. in Ω. It follows that (un ) is convergent to u a.e. in Ω, so
that (|un |p−2 un ) is strongly convergent to |u|p−2 u in Lr (Ω), whenever r < NN−p .
Therefore, assertion (b) also holds. Then (c) easily follows.
Finally, if (un ) is convergent to u in Φ1,p
0 (Ω), then (ϕp (Tk (un ))) is strongly
convergent to ϕp (Tk (u)) in W01,p (Ω), so that (Tk (un )) is strongly convergent to
Tk (u) in W01,p (Ω).
If p = N , the arguments are similar.

Finally, up to minor variants due to the presence of α0 in assumption (a1 ), the
next regularity result can be proved as in [5, 6, 23].
Theorem 2.10. If µ ∈ Mpb (Ω) and u is the entropy solution of (2.1), then the
following facts hold:

(a) if µ ∈ Lm (Ω) with 1 < m < (p∗ )′ , we have |∇u|p−1 ∈ Lm (Ω) and |u|p−1 ∈

(b) if µ ∈ Mpb (Ω) ∩ W −1,p (Ω), we have u ∈ W01,p (Ω) and

We will also consider parametric problems, in which T is a metrizable topological

In Section 7 we will see that it is possible to define a topological degree
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, µ) ∈ Z
whenever U is a bounded and open subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such that (3.1) has no entropy
solution u ∈ ∂U . We state here the main properties, referring to Section 7 for the
proofs and further details.
Theorem 3.2. (Consistency property) Suppose that µ ∈ Mpb (Ω) ∩ W −1,p (Ω)

(b) every entropy solution of (3.1) belongs to W01,p (Ω) and every u ∈ W01,p (Ω)
is an entropy solution of (3.1) if and only if
−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u) = µ

′

in W −1,p (Ω) ;

(c) if U is a bounded and open subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such that (3.1) has no entropy
solution u ∈ ∂U , then the set
{u ∈ U : −div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u) = µ}
is compact in W01,p (Ω) and we have
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, µ)
= deg(S)+ (−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U ∩ V, µ) ,
whenever V is a bounded and open subset of W01,p (Ω) such that there are
no solutions of (3.1) in U \ V (we have denoted by deg(S)+ the degree for
maps of class (S)+ as defined in [10, 22, 24]).
Theorem 3.3. (Normalization property) Let
bounded and open subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) containing the
(
−div[a(x, ∇u)] = µ
u=0

µ ∈ Mpb (Ω) and let U be any
entropy solution u of
in Ω ,
on ∂Ω .

Then
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)], U, µ) = 1 .
Theorem 3.4. (Existence criterion) Let µ ∈ Mpb (Ω) and let U be a bounded
and open subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such that (3.1) has no entropy solution u ∈ U .
Then
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, µ) = 0 .

Theorem 3.5. (Additivity property) Let µ ∈ Mpb (Ω) and let U be a bounded
and open subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such that (3.1) has no entropy solution u ∈ ∂U . Assume
that U = U1 ∪ U2 , where U1 , U2 are two disjoint open subsets of Φ1,p
0 (Ω).
Then
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, µ)
= deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U1 , µ)
+ deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U2 , µ) .
Theorem 3.6. (Excision property) Let µ ∈ Mpb (Ω) and let V ⊆ U be two
bounded and open subsets of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such that (3.1) has no entropy solution u ∈
U \V.
Then
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, µ)
= deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), V, µ) .
Theorem 3.7. (Homotopy invariance property) Let
a : Ω × (RN × [0, 1]) → RN ,

b : Ω × (R × RN × [0, 1]) → R

be two Carathéodory functions satisfying (u1 ) – (u3 ) with respect to T = [0, 1] and
let µ0 , µ1 ∈ Mpb (Ω).
Then the following facts hold:
(a) for every bounded and closed subset C of Φ1,p
0 (Ω), the set of t’s in [0, 1]
such that
(
−div[at (x, ∇u)] + bt (x, u, ∇u) = (1 − t)µ0 + tµ1
in Ω ,
(3.2)
u=0
on ∂Ω ,
admits an entropy solution u ∈ C is closed in [0, 1];
(b) for every bounded and open subset U of Φ1,p
0 (Ω), if (3.2) has no entropy
solution with t ∈ [0, 1] and u ∈ ∂U , then
deg(−div[at (x, ∇u)] + bt (x, u, ∇u), U, (1 − t)µ0 + tµ1 )
is independent of t ∈ [0, 1].
Theorem 3.8. Let µ = 0 and let U be a bounded and open subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such
that (3.1) has no entropy solution u ∈ ∂U . Assume that U is symmetric with 0 ∈ U
and that
a(x, −ξ) = −a(x, ξ) , b(x, −s, −ξ) = −b(x, s, ξ) ,
for a.e. x ∈ Ω and every s ∈ R and ξ ∈ RN .
Then
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, 0)
is an odd integer.

from (b) of Theorem 3.7 we infer that
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, µ)

On the other hand,
deg(−div[a∞ (x, ∇u)] + b∞ (x, u, ∇u), U, 0)

deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, µ) 6= 0 .
By Theorem 3.4 there exists an entropy solution u ∈ U of

Then there exists a subsequence (unj ) converging in Φ1,p

Corollary 5.2. Let C be a bounded and closed subset of Φ1,p

Then (un ) is bounded in Φ1,p
0 (Ω) and there exist u ∈ Φ0 (Ω) and a subsequence
(unj ) such that (unj , ∇unj ) is convergent to (u, ∇u) a.e. in Ω.
Proof. If we set
ãn (x, ξ) = atn (x, ξ) − wn(1) ,
it is easily seen that each ãn satisfies (a1 )–(a2 ) for some α0 , α1 , β1 and ν independent of n. Since un is an entropy solution of

(0)
−div[ãn (x, ∇un )] = wn
in Ω ,
u=0
on ∂Ω ,
by (2.5) (un ) is bounded in Φ1,p
0 (Ω).
Therefore there exist u ∈ Φ1,p
0 (Ω) and a subsequence (unj ) such that (ϕp (unj ))
is convergent to ϕp (u) weakly in W01,p (Ω) and (unj ) is convergent to u a.e. in Ω.
It follows that (Tk (unj )) is weakly convergent to Tk (u) in W01,p (Ω).

(∇unj ) is convergent to ∇u a.e. in Ek . A standard diagonal argument shows that,

1,p
û ∈ Φ0 (Ω) such that, up to a subsequence, (un , ∇un ) is convergent to (û, ∇û)
a.e. in Ω. Since (ϕp (un )) is weakly convergent to ϕp (û) in W01,p (Ω), it follows that
(∇[Tk (un )]) is convergent to ∇[Tk (û)] weakly in Lp (Ω; RN ) and a.e. in Ω, for any
k > 0. For any k > 0 and v ∈ Cc∞ (Ω), it follows that

Proof of Theorem 5.1.
Since (un ) is bounded in Φ1,p
0 (Ω), from (b) of Proposition 2.9 and (u3 ) it follows that
(btn (x, un , ∇un )) is bounded in L1 (Ω). By Lemma 5.3 we infer that there exists
u ∈ Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such that, up to a subsequence, (un , ∇un ) is convergent to (u, ∇u) a.e.
in Ω.
From Proposition 2.9 and (u3 ) we deduce that (btn (x, un , ∇un )) is (strongly)
convergent to bt (x, u, ∇u) in L1 (Ω). By Lemma 5.4 we conclude that (un ) is convergent to u in Φ1,p

0 (Ω) and that u is an entropy solution of (5.1).
6. Degree theory in reflexive Banach spaces
Let X be a reflexive real Banach space.
Definition 6.1. A map F : D → X ′ , with D ⊆ X, is said to be of class (S)+ if,
for every sequence (un ) in D weakly converging to some u in X with
lim sup hF (un ), un − ui ≤ 0 ,
n

it holds kun − uk → 0.

A FREDHOLM ALTERNATIVE FOR QUASILINEAR ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS

21

More generally, if T is a metrizable topological space, a map H : D → X ′ , with
D ⊆ X × T , is said to be of class (S)+ if, for every sequence (un , tn ) in D with
(un ) weakly converging to u in X, (tn ) converging to t in T and
lim sup hHtn (un ), un − ui ≤ 0 ,
n

it holds kun − uk → 0 (we write Ht (u) instead of H(u, t)).
Assume now that U is a bounded and open subset of X, F : U → X ′ a continuous
map of class (S)+ and w ∈ X ′ .
Remark 6.2. It is easily seen that the set
	

u ∈ U : F (u) = w
is compact (possibly empty).

According to [10, 22, 24], if w 6∈ F (∂U ), one can define the topological degree
deg(S)+ (F, U, w) ∈ Z .
Let us recall some basic properties.
Proposition 6.3. If w 6∈ F (∂U ), then
deg(S)+ (F, U, w) = deg(S)+ (F − w, U, 0) .
Theorem 6.4. If w 6∈ F (∂U ), u0 ∈ U and
hF (u), u − u0 i ≥ hw, u − u0 i

for any u ∈ ∂U ,

then deg(S)+ (F, U, w) = 1.
Theorem 6.5. If w 6∈ F (U ), then deg(S)+ (F, U, w) = 0.
Theorem 6.6. If w 6∈ F (∂U ) and U = U0 ∪ U1 , where U0 , U1 are two disjoint open
subsets of X, then
deg(S)+ (F, U, w) = deg(S)+ (F, U0 , w) + deg(S)+ (F, U1 , w) .
Theorem 6.7. Let V be another open subset of X with V ⊆ U and assume that
w 6∈ F (U \ V ).
Then deg(S)+ (F, U, w) = deg(S)+ (F, V, w).
Theorem 6.8. Let H : U × [0, 1] → X ′ be a continuous map of class (S)+ . Then
the following facts hold:
(a) the set

	
(u, t) ∈ U × [0, 1] : Ht (u) = w
is compact (possibly empty);
(b) if w 6∈ H(∂U × [0, 1]), then deg(S)+ (Ht , U, w) is independent of t ∈ [0, 1].
Theorem 6.9. Assume that U is symmetric with 0 ∈ U and that F is odd with
0 6∈ F (∂U ).
Then deg(S)+ (F, U, 0) is an odd integer.
Let us also introduce a variant, more in the line of the degree for “compactly
rooted maps” of [14].
Assume that U is a (possibly unbounded) open subset of X, F : U → X ′ is
continuous and locally of class (S)+ and w ∈ X ′ .

MICHELE COLTURATO AND MARCO DEGIOVANNI

Proposition 6.10. If
{u ∈ U : F (u) = w} is compact (possibly empty) ,

(6.1)

then the following facts hold:
(a) there exists a bounded and open subset V of X such that V ⊆ U , F is of
class (S)+ on V and w 6∈ F (U \ V );
(b) if V0 and V1 are as in (a), it holds
deg(S)+ (F, V0 , w) = deg(S)+ (F, V1 , w) .
Proof. Assertion (a) is easy to prove. If V0 and V1 are as in (a), from Theorem 6.7
we infer that
deg(S)+ (F, V0 , w) = deg(S)+ (F, V0 ∩ V1 , w) = deg(S)+ (F, V1 , w)
and assertion (b) also follows.

Therefore, if (6.1) holds, one can define deg
(S)+ (F, U, w) as
g
deg
(S)+ (F, U, w) = deg(S)+ (F, V, w) ,

where V is any bounded and open subset of X as in (a) of Proposition 6.10.
The next results are easy consequences of the properties of the degree in the
previous setting.
Proposition 6.11. Assume that U is bounded, F : U → X ′ is continuous and of
class (S)+ and w ∈ X ′ \ F (∂U ).
Then (6.1) holds and we have
g
deg
(S)+ (F, U, w) = deg(S)+ (F, U, w) ,

Proposition 6.12. If (6.1) holds, then

g

deg
(S)+ (F, U, w) = deg(S)+ (F − w, U, 0) .

Theorem 6.13. If (6.1) holds, u0 ∈ U and

hF (u), u − u0 i ≥ hw, u − u0 i

for any u ∈ U ,

g
then deg
(S)+ (F, U, w) = 1.

Theorem 6.14. If

{u ∈ U : F (u) = w}
g
is empty, then deg(S)+ (F, U, w) = 0.

Theorem 6.15. If (6.1) holds and U = U0 ∪ U1 , where U0 , U1 are two disjoint
open subsets of X, then
g
g
g
deg
(S)+ (F, U, w) = deg(S)+ (F, U0 , w) + deg(S)+ (F, U1 , w) .

g
g
w 6∈ F (U \ V ), then deg
(S)+ (F, U, w) = deg(S)+ (F, V, w).
Theorem 6.17. Assume that H : U × [0, 1] → X ′ is continuous and locally of
class (S)+ and that
{(u, t) ∈ U × [0, 1] : Ht (u) = w}
is compact (possibly empty).
g
Then deg
(S)+ (Ht , U, w) is independent of t ∈ [0, 1].

Theorem 6.18. If (6.1) holds with w = 0, U is symmetric with 0 ∈ U and F is
g
odd, then deg
(S)+ (F, U, 0) is an odd integer.
7. The construction of the degree

Now consider again two Carathéodory functions
a : Ω × RN → RN ,

b : Ω × (R × RN ) → R

satisfying (a1 ) – (a3 ).
We first treat a particular case of (3.1), namely
(
−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u) = 0
u=0

in Ω ,
on ∂Ω .

(7.1)

If we set
aτ (x, ξ)

= a(x, ξ)

if 0 ≤ τ ≤ 1 ,

bτ (x, s, ξ) = T1/τ (b(x, s, ξ))

if 0 < τ ≤ 1 ,

bτ (x, s, ξ) = b(x, s, ξ)

if τ = 0 ,

it is easily seen that aτ , bτ satisfy (u1 )–(u3 ) with respect to T = [0, 1]. Therefore
we can consider the entropy solutions of
(
−div[a(x, ∇u)] + bτ (x, u, ∇u) = 0
in Ω ,
(7.2)
u=0
on ∂Ω .
Moreover, for every τ ∈]0, 1[, we have
1
|bτ (x, s, ξ)| ≤
whenever τ ≤ τ ≤ 1 .
τ
Therefore, we can define a continuous map
H : W01,p (Ω)×]0, 1] → W −1,p (Ω)
′

by
Hτ (u) = −div [a(x, ∇u)] + bτ (x, u, ∇u)
and, according to [10, 24], this map is of class (S)+ (see also [1, Theorem 3.5]).
1,p
Observe also that, if U is an open subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω), then U ∩ W0 (Ω) is an open
1,p
subset of W0 (Ω).
Proposition 7.1. Let U be a bounded and open subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such that (7.1)
has no entropy solution u ∈ ∂U .
Then the following facts hold:
(a) there exists τ ∈]0, 1] such that (7.2) has no entropy solution with 0 ≤ τ ≤ τ
and u ∈ ∂U ;
(b) if τ ∈]0, 1] is like in (a), then for every τ ∈]0, τ [ the set
n
o
(u, τ ) ∈ (U ∩ W01,p (Ω)) × [τ , τ ] : Hτ (u) = 0

g
deg
(S)+ (Hτ , U ∩ W0 (Ω), 0)

is constant for τ ∈]0, τ ].

24

MICHELE COLTURATO AND MARCO DEGIOVANNI

Proof. Since ∂U is closed and bounded in Φ1,p
0 (Ω), assertion (a) follows from Corollary 5.2.
On the other hand, for every τ ∈]0, τ [, if Hτ (u) = 0 with τ ∈ [τ , τ ] and u ∈
W01,p (Ω), it turns out that u solves a problem of the form
(
−div[a(x, ∇u)] = z
in Ω ,
u=0
on ∂Ω ,
with z ∈ L∞ (Ω) and kzk∞ ≤ 1/τ . Since {(u, τ ) 7→ Hτ (u)} is of class (S)+ , it easily
follows that
o
n
(u, τ ) ∈ W01,p (Ω) × [τ , τ ] : Hτ (u) = 0

is compact in W01,p (Ω) × [τ , τ ]. Moreover, Hτ (u) = 0 implies that (u, τ ) is an
entropy solution of (7.2), so that there are no solutions of Hτ (u) = 0 with u on the
boundary of U ∩ W01,p (Ω) in W01,p (Ω). Therefore
n
o
(u, τ ) ∈ (U ∩ W01,p (Ω)) × [τ , τ ] : Hτ (u) = 0
also is compact in W01,p (Ω) × [τ , τ ]. By Theorem 6.17 we conclude that
1,p
g
deg
(S)+ (Hτ , U ∩ W0 (Ω), 0)

is constant for τ ∈ [τ , τ ], whenever τ ∈]0, τ [.

deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, 0) = deg

Theorem 7.3. Suppose that α2 ∈ L1 (Ω) ∩ W −1,p (Ω) in assumption (a3 ).
Then the following facts hold:
(a) we have
(
b(x, u, ∇u)v ∈ L1 (Ω)

for any u, v ∈ W01,p (Ω)

is an entropy solution of (7.1) if and only if
−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u) = 0

in W −1,p (Ω) ;

(c) if U is a bounded and open subset of Φ1,p

is compact in W01,p (Ω) and we have
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, 0)
= deg(S)+ (−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U ∩ V, 0) ,
whenever V is a bounded and open subset of W01,p (Ω) such that there are
no solutions of (7.1) in U \ V .

Proof. First of all, it is easily seen that χ{α2 ≥k} α2 ∈ L1 (Ω) ∩ W −1,p (Ω) for any
k > 0. We claim that

Up to a subsequence, (vk ) is convergent to some v weakly in W01,p (Ω) and a.e.
in Ω, so that (|vk |) is convergent to |v| weakly in W01,p (Ω). Now (χ{α2 ≥k} α2 vk ) is
convergent to 0 a.e. in Ω and is dominated by (α2 |vk |), which is convergent to α2 |v|
a.e. in Ω. According to [8], we also have α2 |v| ∈ L1 (Ω) and

Now let bτ be as before and let
bτ,1 (x, s, ξ) = min {max {bτ (x, s, ξ), −α2 (x)} , α2 (x)} ,
bτ,2 (x, s, ξ) = bτ (x, s, ξ) − bτ,1 (x, s, ξ) .
It is easily seen that bτ,1 , bτ,2 are Carathéodory functions satisfying
bτ (x, s, ξ)

= bτ,1 (x, s, ξ) + bτ,2 (x, s, ξ) ,

|bτ,1 (x, s, ξ)| ≤ α2 (x) ,

Moreover, again by [8], we have α2 |v| ∈ L1 (Ω), hence bτ,1 (x, u, ∇u)v ∈ L1 (Ω), for
any v ∈ W01,p (Ω).
If we set

bτ,1 (x, u, ∇u) = div wu,τ
and kwu,τ kp′ is bounded by a constant independent of u and τ . Therefore, each
entropy solution of (7.2) is also an entropy solution of
(
−div[ã(x, ∇u)] + bτ,2 (x, u, ∇u) = 0
in Ω ,
u=0
on ∂Ω ,
with
ã(x, ξ) = a(x, ξ) − wu,τ (x) ,
and ã also satisfies (a1 ) and (a2 ), possibly with different α0 , α1 , β1 and ν, where
kα0 k1 , kα1 kp′ , β1 and 1/ν are bounded by a constant independent of u and τ .
By Theorem 2.10 and a standard bootstrap argument, we infer that u ∈ W01,p (Ω).
Moreover, if B is a bounded subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω), we have that
{(u, τ ) ∈ B × [0, 1] : (u, τ ) is an entropy solution of (7.2)}
is bounded in W01,p (Ω) × [0, 1].

As in [3], any u ∈ W01,p (Ω) is an entropy solution of (7.1) if and only if
−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u) = 0

′

in W −1,p (Ω)

and assertion (b) follows.
To prove assertion (c), observe that, since U is bounded in Φ1,p
0 (Ω), we have that
the set
{(u, τ ) ∈ U × [0, 1] : (u, τ ) is an entropy solution of (7.2)}
is bounded in W01,p (Ω) × [0, 1].
According to Proposition 7.1, let now τ ∈]0, 1] be such that (7.2) has no entropy
solution with 0 ≤ τ ≤ τ and u ∈ ∂U . Since the map
{(u, τ ) 7→ −div[a(x, ∇u) + bτ (x, u, ∇u)}
is continuous and of class (S)+ , the set
{(u, τ ) ∈ U × [0, τ ] : (u, τ ) is an entropy solution of (7.2)}
is even compact in W01,p (Ω)×[0, τ ]. Let V be a bounded and open subset of W01,p (Ω)
such that there are no solutions of (7.1) in U \ V and let W be a bounded and
open subset of W01,p (Ω) such that W ⊆ U and there are no solutions of (7.2) with
0 ≤ t ≤ τ and u ∈ U \ W . Combining Definition 7.2 with Theorems 6.7 and 6.8,
we conclude that
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, 0)

= deg
(S)+ (Hτ , U ∩ W0 (Ω), 0) = deg(S)+ (Hτ , W, 0)

= deg(S)+ (−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), W ∩ V, 0)
= deg(S)+ (−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U ∩ V, 0)

and assertion (c) follows.

Theorem 7.4. Let U be a bounded and open subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such that the equation (7.1) has no entropy solution u ∈ U .
Then
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, 0) = 0 .
Proof. Since U is closed and bounded in Φ1,p
0 (Ω), by Corollary 5.2 there exists
τ ∈]0, 1] such that (7.2) has no entropy solution with 0 ≤ τ ≤ τ and u ∈ U .
In particular, the equation Hτ (u) = 0 has no solution u ∈ U ∩ W01,p (Ω). By
Theorem 6.14 it follows
1,p
g
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, 0) = deg

In a similar way, Theorem 3.8 and the next two results can be proved taking
advantage of Theorems 6.18, 6.15, 6.16 and Corollary 5.2.
Theorem 7.5. Let U be a bounded and open subset of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such that (7.1)
has no entropy solution u ∈ ∂U . Assume that U = U1 ∪ U2 , where U1 , U2 are two
disjoint open subsets of Φ1,p
0 (Ω).

Then
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, 0)
= deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U1 , 0)
+ deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U2 , 0) .
Theorem 7.6. Let V ⊆ U be two bounded and open subsets of Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such
that (7.1) has no entropy solution u ∈ U \ V .
Then
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, 0)
= deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), V, 0) .
Let us see more in detail the homotopy invariance.
Theorem 7.7. Let
a : Ω × (RN × [0, 1]) → RN ,

b : Ω × (R × RN × [0, 1]) → R

be two Carathéodory functions satisfying (u1 )–(u3 ).
Then the following facts hold:
(a) for every bounded and closed subset C of Φ1,p
0 (Ω), the set of t’s in [0, 1]
such that
(
−div[at (x, ∇u)] + bt (x, u, ∇u) = 0
in Ω ,
(7.4)
u=0
on ∂Ω ,
admits an entropy solution u ∈ C is closed in [0, 1];
(b) for every bounded and open subset U of Φ1,p
0 (Ω), if (7.4) has no entropy
solution with t ∈ [0, 1] and u ∈ ∂U , then
deg(−div[at (x, ∇u)] + bt (x, u, ∇u), U, 0)
is independent of t ∈ [0, 1].
Proof. Assertion (a) is a particular case of Corollary 5.2. To prove (b), consider
at,τ (x, ξ)

= at (x, ξ)

if 0 ≤ τ ≤ 1 ,

bt,τ (x, s, ξ) = T1/τ (bt (x, s, ξ))

if 0 < τ ≤ 1 ,

bt,τ (x, s, ξ) = bt (x, s, ξ)

if τ = 0 ,

for (t, τ ) ∈ T = [0, 1] × [0, 1]. It is easily seen that at,τ and bt,τ satisfy (u1 )–(u3 ).
Define also
Ht,τ (u) = −div[at,τ (x, ∇u)] + bt,τ (x, u, ∇u) ,
for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, 0 < τ ≤ 1 and u ∈ W01,p (Ω).
Since [0, 1] × {0} is compact, by Corollary 5.2 there exists τ ∈]0, 1] such that
(
−div[at,τ (x, ∇u)] + bt,τ (x, u, ∇u) = 0
in Ω ,
u=0
on ∂Ω ,
has no entropy solution with (t, τ ) ∈ [0, 1] × [0, τ ] and u ∈ ∂U .
For any t ∈ [0, 1], it follows
1,p
g
deg(−div[at (x, ∇u)] + bt (x, u, ∇u), U, 0) = deg
(S)+ (Ht,τ , U ∩ W0 (Ω), 0) .

On the other hand, as before, the map {(u, t) 7→ Ht,τ (u)} is continuous and of
class (S)+ and the set
o
n
(u, t) ∈ (U ∩ W01,p (Ω)) × [0, 1] : Ht,τ (u) = 0

1,p
g
deg
(S)+ (Ht,τ , U ∩ W0 (Ω), 0)

Corollary 7.8. Let U be a bounded and open subset of
no entropy solution u ∈ ∂U . Let also
â : Ω × RN → RN ,



∀z, v ∈ W01,p (Ω) ∩ L∞ (Ω) .

= deg(−div[â(x, ∇u)] + b̂(x, u, ∇u), U, 0) .
Proof. Taking into account Remark 3.1, it is enough to apply Theorem 7.7 to
at (x, ξ) = (1 − t)a(x, ξ) + tâ(x, ξ) ,

bt (x, s, ξ) = (1 − t)b(x, s, ξ) + tb̂(x, s, ξ) .

for some w0 ∈ L (Ω) and w1 ∈ Lp (Ω; RN ). On the other hand, if w0 ∈ L1 (Ω) and

ã(x, ξ) = a(x, ξ) − w1 (x) ,

b̃(x, s, ξ) = b(x, s, ξ) − w0 (x)

still satisfy (a1 ) – (a3 ).
Proposition 7.9. Let µ ∈ Mpb (Ω) and let U be a bounded and open subset of

Φ1,p

Definition 7.10. Let µ ∈ Mpb (Ω) and let U be a bounded and open subset of
Φ1,p
0 (Ω) such that (3.1) has no entropy solution u ∈ ∂U .
We set
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)] + b(x, u, ∇u), U, µ)

Theorems 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 can be easily reduced to Theorems 7.3, 7.4,
7.5, 7.6 and 7.7, respectively. Let us see in detail the normalization property.
Proof of Theorem 3.3.
If we set
at (x, ξ) = a(x, ξ) − (1 − t)a(x, 0) ,

bt (x, s, ξ) = 0 ,

µ0 = 0 ,

µ1 = µ ,

it is easily seen that at , bt satisfy (u1 ) – (u3 ), possibly with ν, α0 , α1 and β1 replaced
by some ν̂, α̂0 , α̂1 and β̂1 . If we set
n
o
V = U ∪ v ∈ Φ1,p
0 (Ω) : ν̂k∇[ϕp (v)]kp < kψk∞ |µ|(Ω) + kα̂0 k1 + 1 ,

by (2.5) there is no entropy solution of (3.2) with t ∈ [0, 1] and u ∈ ∂V . By
Theorem 3.7, it follows
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)], V, µ) = deg(−div[a(x, ∇u) − a(x, 0)], V, 0)
and we also have
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)], V, µ) = deg(−div[a(x, ∇u)], U, µ)
by Theorem 3.6.
On the other hand, if W is any bounded and open neighborhood of 0 in W01,p (Ω),
by Theorem 3.2 it holds
deg(−div[a(x, ∇u) − a(x, 0)], V, 0)
= deg(S)+ (−div[a(x, ∇u) − a(x, 0)], V ∩ W, 0)
and, finally,
deg(S)+ (−div[a(x, ∇u) − a(x, 0)], V ∩ W, 0) = 1
by Theorem 6.4 with u0 = 0.
