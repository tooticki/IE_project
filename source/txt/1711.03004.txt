Introduction

The discharging method is an important proof technique in structural graph theory. It was first developed
in the study of planar graphs [3]. The most notable application of discharging is its central role in
two versions of the proof of the Four Color Theorem: one by Appel and Haken, and the other by
Robertson, Sanders, Seymour and Thomas.
With discharging, one can prove that some local structures of a graph are unavoidable given the
global properties of that graph. These local structures are called reducible configurations. Let me present
a more formal definition of reducible configurations: we define a graph property to be a property of
graphs that depends only on the abstract structure. A reducible configuration for a graph property P,
is a configuration that cannot occur in a minimal graph failing that property [3].
With that being said, the discharging method is usually used to prove a statement like this: "If a
graph has property P, then it contains reducible configurations S1 , S2 , S3 ..."
Discharging helps to show that if a graph does not contain reducible configuration S1 , S2 , S3 ...,
then it cannot have property P. The general process of discharging is this: we first assign charges to
elements (vertices, faces...) of a graph based on certain "charging rules." Then we discharge the graph
based on certain "discharging rules," during which some elements gain charges, and some elements
lose charges, while the sum of the charges stays constant. A successful discharging argument usually
shows that if a graph has property P, but it does not contain the required reducible configurations,
then the charge of the graph cannot be conservative.
In this survey essay, I will explore the application of the discharging method, including the
selection of charging rules and discharging rules, and the general characteristics of the discharging
method based on my observation.
The essay will be structured as follows:
Section 2 introduces some applications of the discharging method to planar graphs. I will introduce
different charging techniques such as vertex charging, face charging, and balanced charging. I will
present examples of these techniques.
Section 3 gives one application of discharging on graphs that are not necessarily planar.
The structure and the content of Section 2 and Section 3 are mostly based on [3], which is a very
comprehensive guide to the discharging method.
Section 4 briefly introduces the application of the discharging method in the proof of the Four
Color Theorem by Robertson et al, the section will be primarily based on [6] and [5].

Discharging on Planar Graphs

Definition. A graph is planar if it has a drawing without crossings. Such a drawing is a planar embedding of
G. A plane graph is a particular planar embedding of a planar graph [8].
As mentioned above, discharging was first developed for the study of planar graphs. Wernicke
is considered the first one to apply the discharging method. He used discharging to prove that for
1

a planar triangulation, with minimum vertex degree 5, the graph must either contain two adjacent
vertices with degree both 5, or two adjacent vertices, one of degree 5, and the other of degree 6 [7].
A unique character of discharging on planar graph is that not only can we assign charge to vertices,
but we can also assign charge to faces. As we will prove later, there exists three algebraic relationships
between the sum of the lengths of faces and the sum of the degrees of vertices in a planar graph,
namely vertex charging, face charging, and balanced charging [3]. These relationships are all derived
from Euler’s Formula.
Definition. F(G) is the set of all faces of a plane graph G. l(f) is the length of a face f.
Vertex charging: ∑v∈V (G) (d(v) − 6) + ∑ f ∈ F(G) (2l ( f ) − 6) = −12
Face charging: ∑v∈V (G) (2d(v) − 6) + ∑ f ∈ F(G) (l ( f ) − 6) = −12
Balanced charging: ∑v∈V (G) (d(v) − 4) + ∑ f ∈ F(G) (l ( f ) − 4) = −8
We are usually guided to assign the initial charges of vertices or faces based on these algebraic
relationships. For instance, if we decide to use vertex charging, then we assign each vertex with initial
charge d(v) − 6, and assign each face with initial charge 2l ( f ) − 6, so that we know that the sum of
the charges must be constant.
Sometimes it is intuitive to tell which type of charging is the simplest to use for a proof. For
instance, if 3-regularity is one of the graph properties, then it is clear that we should use face charging,
as each vertex will have charge 0. If triangulation is involved in the proposition we aim to prove, then
we should use vertex charging, so that each face will have charge 0 [3].
Let us define a "happy" element of a graph to be an element that has non-negative charges [3].
Notice that whichever initial charging we use, the sum of the charge must be negative. Therefore,
all elements are not "happy," both before and after discharging. Sometimes a discharging argument
shows that if a planar graph with property P lacks configurations S1 , S2 , S3 ..., then after discharging
all elements become "happy," which is a contradiction.
Proposition 2.1. [3] Let V(G) and F(G) be the sets of vertices and faces in a plane graph G, and let l(f) denote
the length of a face f. The following equalities hold for G.
Vertex charging: ∑v∈V (G) (d(v) − 6) + ∑ f ∈ F(G) (2l ( f ) − 6) = −12
Face charging: ∑v∈V (G) (2d(v) − 6) + ∑ f ∈ F(G) (l ( f ) − 6) = −12
Balanced charging: ∑v∈V (G) (d(v) − 4) + ∑ f ∈ F(G) (l ( f ) − 4) = −8
Proof. [3] By Euler’s Formula, |V ( G )| − | E( G )| + | F ( G )| = 2.
Notice that ∑v∈V (G) d(v) = ∑ f ∈ F(G) l ( f ) = 2 ∗ | E( G )|.
Multiply the two sides of the Euler’s Formula by -6 or -4, and split the terms, we get

−6|V ( G )| + 2| E( G )| + 4| E( G )| − 6| F ( G )| = −12
−6|V ( G )| + 4| E( G )| + 2| E( G )| − 6| F ( G )| = −12
−4|V ( G )| + 2| E( G )| + 2| E( G )| − 4| F ( G )| = −8
In each equation, replace the first E( G ) with 12 ∑v∈V (G) d(v) and the second E( G ) with 12 ∑ f ∈ F(G) l ( f ).
Then, we will get the desired equations.
We will now give one example for each type of charging.
Definition. A k− -vertex is a vertex with at most k degree. A k+ -vertex is a vertex with at least k degree [3].
d(G) denotes the minimum degree of a vertex in graph G.

2

Proposition 2.2. [8] For a planar triangulation G, with d(G) = 5, the graph must either contain
(C1) two adjacent vertices with degree both 5, or
(C2) two adjacent vertices, one of degree 5, and the other of degree 6.
Proof. We will use vertex charging. We give each vertex charge d(v) − 6, and each face charge 2l ( f ) − 6.
Since G is a triangulation, then each face has length 3 and 2l ( f ) − 6 = 0. Therefore, by vertex charging,
the sum of the charge will be -12.
Rule 1: Each vertex with negative charge distribute charge equally amongst its neighbors.
For purpose of contradiction, let us suppose the graph does not contain C1 and C2. Notice that in
this case all vertices with degree 5 are "happy," as they give their negative charge to their neighbors
and do not receive any negative charges from their neighbors. Similarly, all vertices with degree 6
are "happy," too. Now it suffices to show that all 7+ -vertices are "happy." For a 7-vertex, it must be
adjacent to at least 6 5-vertices to be "unhappy." However, by triangulation, this would result in two
adjacent vertices with degree both 5. Therefore, all 7-vertex are happy. For a 8+ -vertex u with degree
k, it requires 6(k − 6) adjacent 5-vertices to make u "unhappy." However, 6(k − 6) > k when k > 7.
Therefore, all vertices are "happy." A contradiction.
Remark. Since the proposition to be proven is related to triangulation, it is intuitive to use vertice charging. As
discussed above, for the sake of contradiction, we then tried to show that all vertices are "happy" if the reducible
configurations are forbidden.
Before we give an example of face charging, let me introduce a useful apparatus in discharging
method, "pot." A "pot" is a charge reservoir, which receives or gives away charge during discharging.
"Pot" provides another way charge can flow between elements, and it is usually used in discharging
with multiple and consecutive rules [3].
Definition. A k+ -face is a face with length at least k [3].
Proposition 2.3. [1] If G is a simple plane graph with d(G) >= 2, then G contains
(C1) an edge uv with d(u) + d(v) ≤ 15, or
(C2) a 2-alternating cycle.
Proof. [3] For purpose of contradiction, let us suppose that for each edge uv ∈ E( G ), d(u) + d(v) ≥ 16,
and G does not contain a 2-alternating cycle. Therefore, both neighbors of a 2-vertex are 14+ -vertices.
Let us use face charging. Assign initial charge 2d(v) − 6 to each vertex, and assign initial charge
l ( f ) − 6 to each face. We keep a pot of charge with 0 charge initially.
Rule 1: Each 14+ -vertex gives charge 1 to the pot, and each 2-vertex takes 1 from the pot.
Rule 2: Each 4+ -vertex distributes its charge remaining after Rule 1 equally to its incident faces.
Rule 3: Each 4+ -face gives charge 1 to each incident 2-vertex.
We will first show that the "pot" is "happy" after discharging. Let U be the set of 2-vetices and W
be the set of 14+ -vertices. Let H be the subgraph of U ∪ W and the edges between U and W. Since C2
does not occur, H must be a forest. Thus, 2|U | = | E( H )| < |U | + |W |. Therefore, |U | < |W |, which
means the "pot" is "happy."
A 2-vertex initially has charge -2. It takes charge 1 from the pot. Besides, since a 2-vertex must be
on 4+ -faces, it also takes charge 1 from an incident 4+ -face. Therefore, all 2-vertices are "happy." A
3-vertex starts with 0 charge and does not receive or give charge. All 4+ -vertex has charge 0 after Rule
2. Thus, all vertices end up "happy."
Now the remaining task is to show that all faces are "happy." A face f receives charge from incident
2j−7
4+ -vertices. From an incident 14+ -vertex with degree j, f receives charge j ; from an incident

3

2j−6

4+ -vertex with degree j, f receives charge j . Either way, f receives at least charge 12 from each
incident 4+ -vertices, as j ≥ 4.
l( f )
If f has no incident 3− -vertices, then it receives at least 2 charge, and gives no charge. Therefore,
3l ( f )

f ends with charge 2 − 6. Since l ( f ) ≥ 4, then f has non-negative charge.
If f has at least one incident 3− -vertices. Let k be the smallest degree of incident vertices of f. Since
(C1) is forbidden, f must be incident to two 13+ -vertices.
Case 1: f is a triangle. If f is incident to two 14+ -vertices, then it receives at least charge 2 ∗ (2 ∗
14 − 7)/14 = 3. If f is incident to two 13-vertices, it receives charge 2 ∗ (2 ∗ 13 − 6)/13 > 3. Therefore,
f starts with charge -3 and ends with non-negative charge.
Case 2: f is a 4+ -face. If f has exactly one incident 2-vertex, then f receives at least charge 3 and
gives charge 1. If f has at least two incident 2-vertices. It must have at least the same number of
14+ -vertices in f so that each 2-vertex has two 14+ -neighbors on f, which contributes charge at least
3
2 as shown above. Therefore, we can find a matching in f that saturates all 2-vertices. Each match
contributes charge at least 12 to f. Since G has no 2-alternating cycle, then there must be another
unmatched 14+ -vertex which contributes to at least 32 . Therefore, in total, a 4+ -face receives more than
charge 2. Since it starts with charge less than -2, f ends up with non-negative charge.
Therefore, In all cases, f ends up "happy."
We have shown that all elements end up "happy," a contradiction.
Proposition 2.4. [4] If G is a planar graph with girth at least 5 and δ( G ) ≥ 2, then G has
(C1) a 2-vertex with a 5− -neighbor, or
(C2) a 5-face whose incident vertices are four 3-vertices and a 5− -vertex.
Proof. For purpose of contradiction, let G be a counterexample with no specified configurations. Let
us use balanced charging, so that each vertex v has initial charge d(v) − 4, and each face f has initial
charge l ( f ) − 4.
4− d ( v )
Rule 1: each 3− -vertex v takes d(v) from each of its incident face.
d(v)−4

Rule 2: each 6+ -vertex v gives d(v) to each of its incident face [3].
After discharging, all vertices are "happy." Now it suffices to show that all faces are also "happy."
If a face f contains k 2-vertices, then it must also contain at least k 6+ -vertices. Each 2-vertex takes 12
d(v)−4

charge, and each 6+ -vertex gives at least charge d(v) , which is larger than 13 when d(v) ≥ 6. Since C1
is forbidden, there must be matching between 2-vertices and 6+ -vertices that saturates all 2-vertices
on each face. Each matching takes at most charge 16 from the face. On the other hand, a 3-vertex
takes 13 charge from an incident face. Let k denotes the number of 2-vertices on a face f, and m the
number of 3-vertices on f. Notice the final charge of f is at least l ( f ) − 4 − 61 k − 13 m, and 2k + m ≤ l ( f ).
Since 3− -vertices are the only vertices that take charge from face, the least charge of f occurs when
l ( f )−m
2k + m = l ( f ). In this case, k = 2 . Therefore, the final charge of f is at least
l( f ) − 4 −

When l ( f ) = 5, m ≤ 4 as C2 is forbidden. There are finite such cases, and it is easy to test that
whichever value m is, the final charge of f must be positive. I will leave this for the reader as an
exercise.
In conclusion, all faces and all vertices are "happy". A contradiction.

Discharging on other Graphs

Discharging can also be applied to graphs without the planarity property, and the application would
be in very different flavors. Since the nice property of constant charge sum resulting from the Euler’s
formula no longer exists, different charging rules are used, and the general strategy of discharging is
no longer making every element "happy." Here is an example of applying the discharging method to
sparse graphs.
Definition. d( G ) is the average degree of vertices of graph G. A l-thread is a path with length l + 1 such that
its l internal vertices have degree 2 in a graph G [3].
Proposition 3.1. [3] If d( G ) < 2 +
(2t − 1)-thread.

and G has no 2-regular component, then G contains a 1− -vertex or a

Proof. [3] Let p = 12 3t1−2 . Thus, d( G ) < 2 + 2p. For the charging step, give each vertex v a initial charge
of its degree d(v). Notice the total charge must be less than 2 + 2p.
We will now apply discharging rules to show that without the two configurations described, the
total charge will be at least 2 + 2p.
For purpose of contradiction, we suppose G contains neither 1− -vertices nor (2t − 1)-threads.
Rule 1: Each 2-vertex takes p from each end of the maximal thread containing it.
Each 2-vertex receives charge 2p and will have 2 + 2p charges after discharging. Since there is
no (2t − 1)-thread, each 3+ -vertex v loses at most charge d(v) ∗ (2t − 2) p. Therefore, the remaining
charge of each 3+ -vertex is d(v) − d(v) ∗ (2t − 2) p.
If d(v) − d(v) ∗ (2t − 2) p ≥ 2 + 2p, then d( G ) >= 2 + 2p. This would give us a contradiction
because since there is no 1− -vertex, all vertices will end with charge at least 2 + 2p, but the average
charge, which equals the average degree, is less than 2 + 2p.
d(v) − d(v) ∗ (2t − 2) p >= 3 −

3t − 3

= 2 + 2p

3t − 2

A contradiction.
Remark. The selection of the value of p might seem mysterious. In fact, in our thinking process, we design
the discharging rule first, then select p. With the presence of thread in the proposition, it is natural to let
internal 2-vertices of a thread to gain something from both ends of the thread. Since our goal is to make sure
that d( G ) ≥ 2 + 3t1−2 if we forbidden the reducible configurations, we want both internal vertices of a thread
and other vertices to have at least degree 2 + 3t1−2 . Therefore, we choose p = 12 3t1−2 , such that after receiving
charge p from the two ends of a thread, a 2-vertex will have exactly degree 2 + 3t1−2 [3]. The next step would be
showing that 3+ -vertices do not lose too much charge. In our case they do not.

The Four-color Theorem

Theorem 4.1. The Four-color Theorem: Every plane graph has a 4-coloring.
This section aims to provide a brief overview of the proof of the Four-color Theorem(4CT) by
Robertson, Sanders, Seymour and Thomas. I will answer the following three questions: How is the
discharging method applied in this proof? What are the reducible configurations used in the proof?
How are computer programs applied in the proof?
Definition. A graph G is internally k-connected if, for any vertex set V ⊂ G, where |V | < k, G − V is either
connected, or has only two components, one of which consists of a single vertex [6].
5

Figure 1: Four examples of configurations (graphs made based on [6])
The work of Robertson et al is based on the following result proven by Birkhoff.
Theorem 4.2. Every minimal counterexample to the Four-Color Theorem is an internally 6-connected triangulation [6].
The remaining task for Robertson et al is to show that there is no minimal internally 6-connected
triangular counterexamples to the 4CT.
This was proven by Robertson et al in two main steps, reducibility and unavoidability.
Concretely, for the first part, they presented a set of 633 configurations and showed that none of
them can occur in a minimal counterexamples to the 4CT, by arguing that if any of the configurations
occurred, a smaller counterexample can be derived. For the unavoidability part, they showed that an
internally 6-connected triangulation must contain at least one of the 633 configurations [5]. Therefore,
a minimal counterexample to the 4CT does not exist and the 4CT is true. The first part of the proof
was proven by a computer program, and the second part was proven using the discharging method.

4.1

Configurations

Unlike configurations talked about in the previous sections, a configuration K used in 4CT is not
simply a subgraph or an induced subgraph. Intead K is a tuple { G, γ}, where G is an induced
subgraph of a graph T, and γ is a mapping from V ( G ) to an integer, such that γ(v) is the degree of v
in T.
Each G of the 633 configurations is a near-triangulation, that is, a connected plane graph with one
special face, such that every face besides the special face is a triangle [6].
A configuration is visually represented in the way shown by Figure 1, with different shapes of
vertices denoting different values of γ(v). A black circle means γ(v) = 5; a dot means γ(v) = 6; a
hollow cycle means γ(v) = 7(an internally 6-connected triangulation has minimum degree 5)...[6] The
special face is the unbounded face.

4.2

Reducibility

In the first part of the proof, it is shown that none of the 633 configurations can exist in a minimal
counterexample of 4CT, because if any one of the configurations is present, we can find a smaller
6

Figure 2: Example of discharging rules (graphs made based on [6])
counterexample, contradicting minimality [6].
Let K be a configuration present in a minimal counterexample of 4CT T. Let G be an induced
subgraph of T. By minimality, there must exist a set of four-color proper coloring C of T − G. If there
exist a proper coloring c ∈ C that can extend to T, then we have a contradiction that shows K cannot
appear in a minimal counterexample of 4CT [6].
A computer program checks that we will get such contradiction for each configuration, which
settles the reducibility part of the proof.

4.3

Unavoidability

Dicharging is used in the second part of the proof to show that if G is an internally 6-connected
graph, then G must contain configurations K1 , or K2 ,or K3 ...or K633 ." Since G is a triangulation, vertex
charging is used in this proof. Robertson et al gave each vertex v initially charge 10(6 − d(v)), such
that the sum of the charge in G is 120 ([6]).
Robertson et al define a new type of configuration in the graph called "pass." The discussion of pass
is beyond the scope of this essay. In short, they divide passes into 32 classes and designed discharging
rules such that each class of passes only obeys one rule [2].
Based on my understanding of [2], [5], and [6], the discharging rules can be represented by a
5-tuple (S, r, c, u, v) stated in the following way: if G has a subgraph S’ isomorphic to a graph S, and S’
satisfies the degree specification r, then vertex u gives charge c to v. Figure 2 shows three discharging
rules. S is represented by the graph itself; the number of arrows denotes c; the direction of the arrows
and the edge where the arrows are located represents u and v. The shape of the vertices and the signs
near the vertices denotes r: a negative sign near a vertex v means the corresponding vertex in G has
degree at most the number indicated by the shape of v; a positive sign means the reverse; no sign near
a vertex v indicates that the corresponding vertex must have the same degree as v.
Due to the conservation of charge, there exists a vertex v ending with positive charge. Robertson
et al show that one of the 633 configurations appears in the second neighborhood of v, that is, the
induced subgraph formed by the vertices at distance at most 2 from v [6].
The discussion of the concretely discharging proof is beyond the scope of this essay. In short,
Robertson et al divided the degree of v into cases. When d(v) ≤ 6, or d(v) ≥ 12, it is comparatively
simple to show that 17 of the 633 reducible configurations must appear in the second neighborhood of
v. The rest of the cases, v = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, are much more complicated and are examined respectively
[6].
Remark. It seems that the way discharging method is used in the proof of the 4CT can be generalized and used
to prove other statements that, like the 4CT, are not explicitly involved with reducible configurations.
Suppose we aim to prove a statement, "all graphs with property P must have property S."
For purpose of contradiction, we suppose that there is a minimal counterexample with property P that does
not have property S. We can prove the result in two steps. First, argue that a minimal counterexample cannot
have configurations C1 , or C2 , or C3 ..., because we can obtain a smaller counterexample otherwise. Second, show
7

that configurations C1 , C2 , C3 ... are reducible for property P using the discharging method. Combining the
results of the two steps, we will obtain an contradiction. Therefore, there is no minimal counterexample of the
result we aim to prove.

5

Conclusion

As we have seen, the discharging rules allow charge to flow between adjacent vertices, or between
incident faces and vertices. This process and its local results seem to shed light on the global property
of a graph.
Discharging is a very unique and useful proving technique, which in its core is a proof by contradiction. This essay, as an introduction to discharging, has only covered a shallow and narrow range of
the application of discharging. Far more could be said on this very interesting topic.
