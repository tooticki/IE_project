Erratum for “Regularity structures
and renormalisation of FitzHugh-Nagumo SPDEs
in three space dimensions ”
Nils Berglund and Christian Kuehn
May 8, 2018
Abstract
Lemma 4.8 in the article [1] contains a mistake, which implies a weaker regularity estimate than the one stated in Proposition 4.11. This does not affect the
proof of Theorem 2.1, but Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 only follow from the given proof
if either the space dimension d is equal to 2, or the nonlinearity F (U, V ) is linear
in V . To fix this problem and provide a proof of Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 valid in
full generality, we consider an alternative formulation of the fixed-point problem,
involving a modified integration operator with nonlocal singularity and a slightly
different regularity structure. We provide the multilevel Schauder estimates and
renormalisation-group analysis required for the fixed-point argument in this new
setting.

Set-up and mistake in the original article [1]

In [1], we considered FitzHugh–Nagumo-type SPDEs on the torus Td , d ∈ {2, 3}, of the
form

∂t u = ∆x u + F (u, v) + ξ ε ,
∂t v = a1 u + a2 v ,

(1.1)

where F (u, v) is a cubic polynomial, ξ ε denotes mollified space-time white noise, and
a1 , a2 ∈ R are scalar parameters (in the case of vectorial v , a1 is a vector and a2 is a
square matrix). Duhamel’s formula allows us to represent (mild) solutions of (1.1) on
a bounded interval [0, T ] as

ut =

vt =

t

S(t − s) ξsε + F (us , vs ) ds + S(t)u0 ,
Q(t − s)us ds + eta2 v0 ,

(1.2)

where S denotes the heat semigroup and Q(t) := a1 eta2 χ(t), where χ : R+ → [0, 1] is
a smooth cut-off function supported on [0, 2T ] such that χ(t) = 1 for all t ∈ [0, T ].
In [1], we used a lift of (1.2) to a regularity structure of the form

Q

where Kγ̄ is the standard lift of the heat kernel (cf. [2, Sect. 5]), and Kγ is a new
operator lifting time-convolution with Q.
The problem is that [1, Lemma 4.8] is incorrect (it wrongly assumed translation
invariance of the model for space-time white noise). As a consequence, [1, ProposiQ
tion 4.11] does not prove that Kγ maps D γ,η into itself for any γ ∈ (0, η + 2). Instead,
′
Q
it only shows that Kγ maps D γ,η into D γ ,η for some γ ′ 6 γ that can at best be slightly
less than 1/2.
If we look for a fixed point of (1.3) with U ∈ D γ,η , we have in particular to determine the regularity of F (U, V ). Let α be the regularity of the stochastic convolution,
that is,
(
−κ
if d = 2 ,
(1.4)
α=
− 12 − κ if d = 3 .
Using [2, Prop. 6.12] and 2η + α > 3η ∧ (η + 2α), we find that U 3 ∈ D γ+2α,3η∧(η+2α) ,
while
′
′
′
V ∈ D γ ,η ,
V 2 ∈ D γ +α,2η∧(η+α) ,
V 3 ∈ D γ +2α,3η∧(η+2α) .
(1.5)
This implies that
′

1. If d = 2, then F (U, V ) is still in a space of modelled distributions D γ +2α,3η∧(η+2α)
with positive exponent γ ′ + 2α. This is sufficient to carry out the fixed-point
argument stated in [1, Prop. 6.5], which relies in particular on [2, Thm. 7.1],
that requires this exponent to be positive.
′
2. If d = 3 and F (U, V ) is linear in V , then F (U, V ) ∈ D (γ+2α)∧γ ,3η∧(η+2α) . Since
(γ + 2α) ∧ γ ′ > 0, the fixed-point argument again holds.

3. If d = 3 and F (U, V ) contains terms in V 2 or V 3 , however, we can no longer assume that F (U, V ) is in a space of modelled distributions with positive exponent,
and we cannot apply [2, Thm. 7.1].
We thus conclude that [1, Thm. 2.1], which concerns the standard FitzHugh–
Nagumo case with F (U, V ) = U + V − U 3 , still follows from the given proof. Theorems 2.2 and 2.3, however, are only proved if either d = 2 or F does not contain any
terms in V 2 or V 3 .

Corrected results

We now provide a different argument allowing to prove the results in full generality.
Consider the system (1.1) on the 3-dimensional torus, for a general cubic nonlinearity
of the form

F (u, v) = α1 u + α2 v + β1 u2 + β2 uv + β3 v 2 + γ1 u3 + γ2 u2 v + γ3 uv 2 + γ4 v 3 .

(2.1)

Its renormalised version is given by



∂t uε = ∆x uε + F (uε , v ε ) + c0 (ε) + c1 (ε)uε + c2 (ε)v ε + ξ ε ,
∂t v ε = a1 uε + a2 v ε ,

2

(2.2)

where ξ ε = ̺ε ∗ ξ is a mollification of space-time white noise, with mollifier ̺ε (t, x) =
ε−5 ̺(ε−2 t, ε−1 x) for a compactly supported function ̺ : R4 → R of integral 1. Below
we provide a proof of the following result, which is in fact a slight generalisation of [1,
Thm. 2.2].
Theorem 2.1. Assume u0 ∈ C η for some η > − 23 and v0 ∈ C γ for some γ > 1. Then
there exists a choice of constants c0 (ε), c1 (ε) and c2 (ε) such that the system (2.2)
with initial condition (u0 , v0 ) admits a sequence of local solutions (uε , v ε ), converging
in probability to a limit (u, v) as ε → 0. The limit is independent of the choice of
mollifier ̺.
This result is more general than [1, Thm. 2.2] because we do not assume that
γ2 = 0, even though we are in dimension d = 3. The renormalisation constants ci (ε)
are given by



c0 (ε) = −β1 C1 (ε) + 3γ1 C2 (ε) ,


c1 (ε) = −3γ1 C1 (ε) + 3γ1 C2 (ε) ,


c2 (ε) = −γ2 C1 (ε) + 3γ1 C2 (ε) ,

where

(2.4)

Here G denotes the heat kernel in dimension d = 3, and Gε = G ∗ ̺ε . It is known that
C1 (ε) diverges as ε−1 while C2 (ε) diverges as log(ε−1 ).
An analogous result holds for vectorial variables v , in the same way as in [1,
Thm. 2.3], but without the restriction on F (u, v) having no terms in u2 vi . In that case,
γ2 and c2 (ε) become row vectors of the same dimension as v . Since all arguments are
virtually the same, we do not present here the details for this situation.
The main idea for proving Theorem 2.1 is to replace (1.2) by another fixed-point
equation, which always involves convolution in space and time. The price to pay is
that this leads to an integral kernel with a singularity that is no longer concentrated
at the origin, but “smeared out” along the time axis. Therefore we need to rederive
the multilevel Schauder estimates for this type of kernel, which we do in Section 3.
The resulting fixed-point argument is then considered in Section 4, and the effect of
renormalisation is addressed in Section 5.

Alternative integral equation

There is an alternative to using the fixed-point equation (1.3). Indeed, substituting
the expression for ut in (1.2) in the expression of vt and rearranging, we find that vt
can also be represented as

for some suitable kernels Kγ̄ and Rγ . We already know that S is represented by
convolution with a kernel G = K + R. Hence S Q corresponds to convolution with a
kernel GQ = K Q + RQ , where the superscript Q always indicates time-convolution
Q
with Q. Thus we have to define the lift Kγ of K Q to the regularity structure, meaning
that it should map D γ,η into D γ̄,η̄ for some suitable γ̄ , η̄ and satisfy

3.1

Decomposition of the kernel

The difficulty is that since K Q is obtained by convolution in time of K with Q, its
singularity is no longer concentrated at the origin, but is “smeared out” along the
time axis. In fact, we have the following decomposition result replacing [2, Assumption 5.1]. Note that here and below, we write z = (t, x) for space-time points.
Proposition 3.1. Assume Q is supported on [0, 2T ] for a given T > 0, fix a scaling
s = (s0 , s1 , . . . , sd ), and let K be a regularizing kernel of order β (cf. [2, Ass. 5.1]). The
kernel K Q obtained by convoluting Q and K in time can be decomposed as

K Q (z) =

where N = {(n, m) ∈ Z2 : n > 0, −1 6 m 6 1 + 2T 2s0 n } and the Knm have the following
properties.

(3.8)

We give the proof in Appendix A. Note the extra s0 in the bound (3.7), which
compensates the fact that m takes of the order of 2s0 n values.
Remark 3.2. We only need these results in the case β = 2, and for the parabolic
scaling s = (2, 1, 1, 1). However, since there is no difficulty in dealing with this more
general setting, we may as well do so here.

Extension of the regularity structure

In order to lift convolution with K Q to the regularity structure, we need to enlarge
the model space of the Allen–Cahn equation (cf. [1, Sec. 3 and Table 1]) by adding
new elements of the form I Q (τ ) whenever |τ |s ∈
/ Z. By convention, I Q (τ ) then has
homogeneity |I Q (τ )|s = |τ |s + β .
In order to extend the model, we proceed as in [2, Sect. 5] by first introducing
functions

(Πz I Qτ )(z̄) = Πz τ, K Q (z̄ − ·) − (Πz J Q (z)τ )(z̄) .

(3.10)

The precise formulation of this relation is that for any test function ψ ,

(3.11)

(3.12)

We still need to verify that all these definitions make sense for the new kernel. We can
however exploit the fact that in practice, we will only need to apply this construction
to symbols τ whose model is base-point independent, in the sense that Πz τ = Πz̄ τ for
every z, z̄ ∈ Rd+1 .
Lemma 3.3. Assume that τ ∈ Tα is such that Πz+hnm τ = Πz τ for all time shifts hnm
and that α + β 6∈ N. Then the series in (3.9) and (3.11) are absolutely convergent.

The proof of this result is very similar to the proof of [2, Lem. 5.19], but there are a
few differences due to the nonlocal singularity of K Q which we explain in Appendix B.
The constant in (3.13) does not depend on kΓk owing to the fact that Π is base-point
independent.
In order to also extend the structure group, we first extend the coproduct via

∆(I Q τ ) = (I Q ⊗ Id)∆(τ ) +

(3.15)

Recall that the fz are linear forms allowing to define the structure group by setting
Γz z̄ = Fz−1 Fz̄ , where
Fz τ = (Id ⊗fz )∆τ .
(3.16)
In the particular case τ = Ξ, we obtain that I Q τ =:

Fz =

Γz z̄ =

.

(3.17)

The model space can then be extended in the usual way to monomials in and , with
the usual additivity rule of homogeneities and product rule for the canonical model.
Then we can again apply I and I Q to these monomials.
In what follows, it will be useful to have explicit expressions for the action of
the structure group on such monomials. Such an expression is provided by the next
result, proved in Appendix C.
Lemma 3.4. Assume that τ ∈ Tα has a base-point independent model Πz τ = Πτ and
satisfies ∆(τ ) = τ ⊗ 1. Then the structure group acts via

invariant.

3.3

Lifting the convolution operator

Following the strategy in [2, Section 5], it is natural to look for a lift of the operation
of convolution with K Q given for f ∈ D γ,η by

(KγQ f )(z) = I Qf (z) + J Q (z)f (z) + (NγQ f )(z) ,

(3.20)

(3.21)

The problem with this definition is that in general, if f is defined on a sector of regularity α, we can only prove a bound of the form




Q
 Rf − Πz f (z), Dk Knm
(z − ·)  . 2(|k|s −s0 −α−β)n ,

(3.22)

instead of 2(|k|s −γ−β)n as in [2, Eq. (5.42)]. The reason for this weaker bound is that
Q
in general Knm (z − ·) is not supported near the origin, so that shifting the model as
6

γ−α

in the proof of [2, Lem. 5.18] produces an additional factor of order khnm ks , which
can have order 1 instead of order 2−(γ−α)n as in that Lemma.
The bound (3.22) proves convergence of the sum in (3.21) only for |k|s < α + β . If
for instance f (z) = a(z) , in dimension d = 3 the sector has regularity α = −1 − 2κ,
and thus only the term with k = 0 is well-defined. Restricting the sum over k to only
Q
the term k = 0, however, results in Kγ f belonging only to some D γ̄,η̄ with γ̄ < 1, which
is not sufficient to carry out the fixed-point argument for a general cubic F (U, V ) for
d = 3.
A way out of this situation is to work with shift operators. Define, for any h ∈ Rd+1 ,
an operator Th : Csα → Csα by

hTh υ, ψi = hυ, ψ(· − h)i

(3.23)

for any test function ψ . In case υ is a function, this amounts to setting Th υ(z) =
υ(z + h). Denote the shifted model Th Π by Πh and assume we can define, on some
sector of D γ,η (Π), a map Th taking values in D γ,η (Πh ) and satisfying

Rh Th = Th R ,

(3.24)

where Rh is the reconstruction operator on D γ,η (Πh ). Setting Rnm := Rhnm we have

Q

K̂nm

(z + hnm )

(3.26)

is a shifted kernel, supported in a ball of radius of order 2−n around the origin. Finally,
let Πnm = Πhnm = Thnm Π denote the time-shifted models, and assume that for each
Q
hnm , we can define an operator Kγ,nm
from D γ,η (Πnm ) to D γ+β,η̄ (Π) satisfying

maps D γ,η (Π) into D γ+β,η̄ (Π) and satisfies the required identity RKγ = K Q ∗ R.
Q
The property (3.27) can be achieved by defining Kγ,nm as in (3.20), but replacing
the model, kernel and reconstruction operator in (3.21) and (3.9) by their shifted
Q
versions. This has the advantage of improving the bound (3.22), since the kernel K̂nm
is now supported near the origin. A drawback is that this forces us to introduce a
Q
countable infinity of new symbols Inm τ , for τ in the sector under consideration. We
will now show that in the case of FitzHugh–Nagumo-type SPDEs of the form (1.1),
one can indeed construct a shift map realising (3.24) on a specific sector of negative
homogeneity. Then we will check that the introduction of infinitely many new symbols
does not pose a problem for the renormalisation procedure.

Multilevel Schauder estimates for FitzHugh–Nagumo-type SPDEs

We now particularise to the FitzHugh–Nagumo-type SPDE (1.1) in dimension d = 3.

and F3 is such that any τ ∈ F3 satisfies the diagonal identity

lim hΠz τ, ψzλ i = 0 .

(3.31)

λ→0

The reason why we only include polynomial elements Xi in the spatial directions in F2
is that owing to the polynomial scaling, |X0 |s = 2 and thus |X0 |s > 0. By linearity,
Q
we may define separately the action of Kγ on f1 , f2 , ϕ1, and f3 . In the case of f1 and
ϕ1, we use the standard definition (3.20), which takes here the form

P

Here we have set Nγ f1 = 0, since we may choose Rf1 = Πz f1 (z) = τ ∈F1 cτ Πτ , owing
to the fact that f1 does not depend on z . Furthermore, we have used the fact that
thanks to the vanishing-moments condition, J Q (z)1 = 0 and hΠz 1, Dk K Q (z − ·)i = 0.
For f3 we simply set
KγQ f3 (z) = 0 ,
(3.34)
which is allowed thanks to the diagonal identity (3.31).
Q
It thus remains to define Kγ f2 (z). Here we use the procedure based on shift
operators, as outlined above. Owing to the fact that the only polynomial terms Xi
occurring in F2 are purely spatial, all τ ∈ F2 satisfy the time-homogeneity relation
Πz+hnm τ = Πz τ . As a consequence, one can check that the map Thnm can be realised
by

Since T|τ |s +β is now infinite-dimensional for τ ∈ F2 , the choice of norm on these
subspaces matters, and we choose it to be the supremum norm.
In this setting, we can now state our central result, which is the following extension of the multilevel Schauder estimates in [2, Thm. 5.12]. Here the notations for
|||f |||γ,η;T , |||f ; f¯|||γ,η;T and |||Z ; Z̄|||γ;O are as in [2, Def. 6.2] and [2, Sec. 7.1] with P the
hyperplane {t = 0}, see also [1, Sec. 4.3].
Theorem 3.6. Let α0 = | |s be the regularity of the sector defining f . Assume
f ∈ D γ,η is of the form (3.29), where η < α0 ∧γ , and γ +β, η+β 6∈ N. Then R+KγQ R+f ∈
D γ+β,η+β and
(RKγQ R+f )(z) = (K Q ∗ RR+f )(z)
(3.39)

holds for every z = (t, x) such that t > 0. Furthermore, we have

|||R+KγQ R+f |||γ+β,η̄;T . T κ/s0 |||f |||γ,η;T

(3.40)

whenever η̄ = η + β − κ with κ > 0. Finally, if Z̄ = (Π̄, Γ̄) is a second model satisfying
Π̄z+hnm τ = Π̄z τ for all τ ∈ F1 ∪ F2 and all (n, m) ∈ N, and f¯ ∈ D γ,η (Γ̄) is of the
form (3.29), then

|||R+KγQ R+f ; R+K̄γQ R+f¯|||γ+β,η̄;T . T κ/s0 |||f ; f¯|||γ,η;T + |||Z ; Z̄|||γ;O .

(3.41)

The proof is given in Appendix D. Note that we have assumed η < α0 to simplify
the notation (otherwise we need to take η̄ = (η ∧α0 )+β −κ). Note also the extra factor
R+(t, x) = 1{t>0} , which is needed because the translation operators shift singularities
along the time axis.

Fixed point argument

Assume the nonlinearity has the general cubic form (2.1). Note in particular that if
p(z) and q(z) are polynomial terms, and Φ(z) and Ψ(z) are terms of fractional, strictly
positive homogeneity, then

F ( + p(z) + Φ(z), + q(z) + Ψ(z)) = f1 (z) + f2 (z) + F (p(z), q(z)) + f3 (z) ,

(4.1)

where

f1 (z) = γ1
f2 (z) = b1 (z)

+ γ2

,
+ a1 (z) + a2 (z) ,

(4.2)

with

b1 (z) = β1 + 3γ1 p(z) + γ2 q(z) ,
b2 (z) = β2 + 2γ2 p(z) + 2γ3 q(z) ,
b3 (z) = β3 + γ3 p(z) + 3γ4 q(z) .
a1 (z) = α1 + 2β1 p(z) + β2 q(z) + 3γ1 p(z)2 + 2γ2 p(z)q(z) + γ3 q(z)2 ,
a2 (z) = α2 + β2 p(z) + 2β3 q(z) + γ2 p(z)2 + 2γ3 p(z)q(z) + 3γ4 q(z)2 .

(4.3)

Furthermore, all terms of f3 (z) contain at least a factor Φ(z) or a factor Ψ(z). Thus if
the model Π satisfies the two properties
|τ |

|Πz τ (z̄)| . kz − z̄ks s kτ k ,

Πz (τ1 τ2 ) = Πz (τ1 )Πz (τ2 )

(4.4)

for all τ, τ1 , τ2 ∈ T , then f3 satisfies the diagonal identity (3.31).
γ,η
Let D∗ (Π) denote the subspace of modelled distributions in D γ,η (Π) whose components of negative homogeneity are of the form c1 + c2 for constants c1 , c2 ∈ R.
γ,η

Consider the map M(U, V ) = (M1 (U, V ), M2 (U, V )) defined on D∗ (Π) × D∗ (Π) by

M1 (U, V ) = R+(Kγ̄ + Rγ R)R+F (U, V ) + W1 ,

M2 (U, V ) = R+(Kγ̄Q + RγQ R)R+F (U, V ) + W2 ,

(4.5)

where W1 and W2 are placeholders for the stochastic convolution and the initial conditions (we only need the case where W1 − and W2 − take values in the polynomial
part of the regularity structure). By iterating the map (4.5), we find that if it admits a
fixed point, then it necessarily has the form

U (z) =
V (z) =

+
(n,m)∈N

where the bi (z) are as in (4.3) with p(z) = ϕ(z), q(z) = ψ(z), and the dots indicate
terms of homogeneity at least 1. As in [1, Prop. 5.2], it is rather straightforward to
show that if (U, V ) satisfies the fixed-point equation (3.3) with U and V in some D γ,η
then (u, v) = (RU, RV ) satisfies (1.2).
[1, Prop. 5.6] is then replaced by the following result, which is all we need for the
fixed-point argument to work. Its proof is very similar to the proof of [1, Prop. 5.6],
so we omit it here.
Proposition 4.1. Let Π be a model satisfying (4.4), and assume − 23 < η < α < − 21 ,
η + 2α > −2 and γ > −2α. Then for any W1 , W2 ∈ D∗γ,η (Π) of regularity α, there exists
γ,η
γ,η
a time T > 0 such that M admits a unique fixed point (U ∗ , V ∗ ) ∈ D∗ (Π) × D∗ (Π) on
(0, T ). Furthermore, the solution map ST : (W1 , W2 , Z) 7→ (U ∗ , V ∗ ) is jointly Lipschitz
continuous.
Note that in the case

W1 = (Kγ̄ + Rγ R)R+Ξ + Gu0 ,

b 0,
W2 = (Kγ̄Q + Rγ R)R+Ξ + GQ u0 + Qv
10

(4.7)

the fixed point (U ∗ , V ∗ ) of M is indeed a fixed point of (3.3). As pointed out in [1,
Rem. 5.7], the assumptions on u0 and v0 guarantee that W1 and W2 belong to the
right functional space.

Renormalisation

It remains to check that the fact that we have modified the regularity structure by
adding a countable infinity of symbols does not cause any problems as far as the
renormalisation procedure is concerned, and to derive the renormalised equations.
We define a renormalisation transformation, depending on two parameters, given
by
n
o

Mε τ = exp −C1 (ε)L1 τ − C2 (ε)L2 τ

,

(5.1)

where the generators L1 and L2 are defined by applying the substitution rules (called
contractions)
L1 :
7→ 1 ,
L2 :
7→ 1
(5.2)
as many times as possible, so that for instance L1

Mε

= 3 . In particular, we obtain

− C1 (ε)

(5.3)

Other examples of the action of Mε are given in [1, (6.12)]. Note that there are no
generators acting by contracting symbols that contain at least one edge associated to
=
and Mε
I Q , implying that for instance Mε
nm =
nm . The fact that these
symbols do not require additional renormalisation constants is a consequence of [1,
Lem. 6.2] and Lemma 5.1 below.

The renormalised models of other symbols are obtained in a similar way, using the
expressions given in [1, (6.13)].
11

We now have to show that the renormalised models converge, for an appropriate
choice of the renormalisation constants C1 (ε) and C2 (ε), to a well-defined limiting
model. This amounts to showing that the Wiener chaos expansions of the renormalised models satisfy the bounds [1, (6.20)]. To a large extent, the computations
have already been made in [1, Prop. 6.4], so that we only discuss one representative
case involving an infinite collection of symbols. Proceeding as in [1, (6.39)], we find

Note that if Knm is replaced by K , we obtain the renormalisation constant C2 (ε),
which diverges like log(ε−1 ), cf. (2.4). The following lemma implies that no renormalisation is needed in the case of
nm .
Lemma 5.1. For all (n, m) ∈ N, the bound

holds uniformly in ε ∈ [0, 1].

(5.9)

The proof is given in Appendix E.1. The important point is that the bound (5.9) is
square-summable over all (n, m) ∈ N, which is related to the fact that K Q (z1 )Qε0 (z1 )2
is integrable uniformly in ε. This is essential in establishing the following convergence
result.
Proposition 5.2. Let C1 (ε) and C2 (ε) be the constants defined in (2.4). Then there

provided γ < ζ , where ζ is such that all moments of K up to parabolic degree ζ vanish.
Proof. The proof follows along the lines of [1, Prop. 6.4], which is closely based on [2,
Thm. 10.22]. The crucial point to note here is that [2, Thm. 10.7] can still be applied
in this case, even though there is a countable infinity of symbols such as
nm that
need to be renormalised. Indeed, the bound [2, (10.4)] involves a sum, over all basis
b 0 τ, ψ λ i. To

This in turns follows from the square-summability of integrals such as (5.9).
The final step is to compute the renormalised equations corresponding to the
renormalisation map Mε . It is straightforward to check that Lemma 6.5 and Proposition 6.7 in [1] still hold in the present situation. It is thus sufficient to compute the
b (U, V ) of Mε F (U, V ), for a cubic nonlinearity F as
non-positive-homogeneous part F
in (2.1). This yields the following result, which is proved in Appendix E.2.
Proposition 5.3. In the situation just described, we have

Fb(u, v) = F (u, v) + c0 (ε) + c1 (ε)u + c2 (ε)v ,

(5.13)

where the ci (ε) are defined in (2.3).

The proof of Theorem 2.1 now follows in the same way as in [1, Sec. 7].

A Proof of Proposition 3.1
Let ϕ : R → [0, 1] be a partition of unity, i.e., a function satisfying
• ϕ is of class C ∞ and of compact support, say [−1, 1];
• for any t ∈ R one has

X

ϕ(m + t) = 1 .

(A.1)

m∈Z

Remark A.1. An example of such a function would be a smooth even function, satisfying ϕ(θ) = 1 − ϕ(1 − θ) for any θ ∈ [0, 1]. For instance one can take



ϕ(θ) = + tanh

∀θ ∈ (0, 1)

and set ϕ(0) = 1, ϕ(θ) = 0 for θ > 1 and ϕ(−θ) = ϕ(θ) for all θ .

13

(A.2)

♦

Given such a function ϕ, we set

ϕn (θ) = ϕ(2s0 n θ)

(A.3)

for all n ∈ N0 . Then ϕn is supported on [−2−s0 n , 2−s0 n ]. Observe that for any n ∈ N0
and any t ∈ R, we have
X
ϕn (2−s0 n m + t) = 1 ,
(A.4)
m∈Z

and thus

X

Qnm (t) = Q(t)

Qnm (t) = Q(t)ϕn (2−s0 n m + t) .

where

(A.5)

m∈Z

Since Q is compactly supported, the above sum only contains a finite number of terms,
of order 2s0 n . In fact, for any given t, there are at most two nonzero terms in the sum,
and Qnm is supported on the interval

[(m − 1)2−s0 n , (m + 1)2−s0 n ] .

(A.6)

Recall that the kernel K being regularizing of order β means that K and its derivatives
satisfy the bounds given in [2, Assumption 5.1]. Thus if we define for n ∈ N0 , m ∈ Z

where the range of m is due to (A.6) and the fact that Q is supported on [0, 2T ].

First note that since Qnm is supported on the interval given in (A.6), Knm (t, x) can
be nonzero only if
(m − 2)2−s0 n 6 t 6 (m + 2)2−s0 n
(A.8)
and x is in a ball of radius 2−n . The condition on t is equivalent to |t−m2−s0 n | 6 21−s0 n ,
from which (3.6) follows.
Since ϕ takes values in [0, 1], we have

|Qnm (t)| 6 |Q(t)| 6 kQk∞ := sup |Q(t)| .

It follows from Condition (5.5) in [2, Assumption 5.1], applied to all ℓ′ of degree less
or equal ℓ, that there exists a constant C ′ , depending only on k and ℓ, such that
the absolute value of the integral over Rd+1 is bounded by C ′ 2−βn uniformly in n.
Therefore, (3.8) follows with CQ = 2C ′ .

(C.4)

while T∗ (z) is a column vector given by the coefficients of X k in the sum on the righthand side of (C.2). It follows that Γz z̄ is represented by the matrix

has T (z)−1 = T (−z). A direct computation of the upper right matrix element then

Note that this is exactly the point where the introduction of shifted models is necessary, since otherwise bknm would only satisfy a weaker bound of the form (3.22), which
guarantees summability only for |k|s < α + β .

D.1 Bounds on |||R+KγQ R+f |||γ+β,η̄;T

(D.9)

Q

For η̄ = η + β , this provides the first bound required to obtain R+Kγ R+f2 ∈ D γ+β,η+β .
Note that the factor 1{t>0} , which is due to the first R+, is required to kill the singularities of a+ (z +hnm ) for negative time. In the particular case K = OT = (−∞, T ]×Rd ,
we can further bound the factor (1 ∧ t+ )(η−α)/s0 1{t>0} by T κ/s0 (1 ∧ t+ )(η−α−κ)/s0 1{t>0} ,
with OT instead of K̄ since the kernel is non-anticipative. This yields one of the bounds
required to prove (3.40). The case δ = α + β + 1 is treated similarly.
For polynomial components of exponent ℓ ∈ N, (3.36) implies

which follow directly from (D.4), (D.5) and (D.7). Using (D.6) and summing over the

the case K = OT we can again extract a factor T κ/s0 by decreasing η̄ .

so that a bound of the same order follows by combining the two previous estimates.
The case ℓ > α + β + 1 is treated similarly.
It remains to obtain estimates involving two different points z, z̄ . Here we first
note that the definition of KP entering the definition of |||f ||| implies that if (z, z̄) ∈ KP
then t and t̄ necessarily have the same sign and are comparable. Thus we only need
to consider the case where both t and t̄ are strictly positive, and we may drop one of
the factors R+.

for (z, z̄) ∈ KP we always have kz − z̄ks 6 (1 ∧ t+ ∧ t̄+ )1/s0 ). In the case 2−n 6 kz − z̄ks ,

For the first term on the right-hand side, we apply again the improved reconstruction
theorem [2, Lem. 6.7] to obtain a bound of order (1∧ t̃+ ) (η−γ)/s0 2(|k+ℓ|s −s0 −γ−β)n . Since
Qℓ (z̄ − z, ·) is supported on values of h such that khks 6 kz − z̄ks 6 12 (1 ∧ t+ ∧ t̄+ )1/s0 ,
we can replace t̃+ by t+ ∧ t̄+ in this expression. For the second term, we use the fact
that

Again, we can replace t̃+ by t̄+ , and also bound kz̃ − zks

Summing over the relevant values of (n, m) yields again a bound of the form (D.18).
Q
This completes the proof of the fact that R+Kγ R+f2 ∈ D γ,η . As before, a factor T κ/s0
can be extracted when K = OT , which also completes the proof of (3.40).
The proof of (3.41) is very similar to the one just given, using the estimate [2,
(3.4)] of the reconstruction theorem in place of [2, (3.3)].

D.2 Convolution identity
It remains to prove that the convolution identity (3.39) holds. This will follow from
the next result, combined with the reconstruction theorem.
Lemma D.1. For every z = (t, x) ∈ Rd+1 such that t > 0, the bound

Here we obtain bounds similar to (B.9), but with γ instead of α and an extra factor

of (D.32).
Combining (D.27) with [2, Lem. 6.7], we obtain

theorem.
To complete the proof of Theorem 3.6, we have to show that (K Q ∗ RR+f3 )(z) = 0
for all z = (t, x) such that t > 0. Here we use the fact that

Proof of Proposition 5.3

It suffices to apply the renormalisation map Mε to all monomials in U and V of degree
2 and 3, when U and V are given by (4.6). Using the expressions [1, (6.12)] for the
action of Mε , one obtains

Mε U 2 = U 2 − C1 (ε)1 ,




Mε U 3 = U 3 − 3 ϕC1 (ε) + b1 C2 (ε) 1 − 3 C1 (ε) + 3γ1 C2 (ε) − 9γ2 C2 (ε) + ̺U 3 (U, V ) ,

Mε U 2 V = U 2 V − ψC1 (ε)1 − C1 (ε) + ̺U 2 V (U, V ) ,

(E.3)

where ̺U 3 (U, V ) and ̺U 2 V (U, V ) are remainder terms of strictly positive homogeneity.
All other monomials are invariant under Mε up to remainders of strictly positive homogeneity. The result follows, using the expression (4.3) for b1 with p = ϕ and q = ψ ,
and the expansion (4.6) in order to express and in terms of U and V .
