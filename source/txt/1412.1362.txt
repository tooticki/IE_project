Abstract
In this article, we prove the existence of common fixed points for a
pair of maps on a q-spherically complete T0 -ultra-quasi-metric space. The
present article is a generalization, in the assymmetric setting of the paper
of Rao et al.[11]. The key point in the proof is the use of Zorn’s lemma. We
construct an appropriate chain and show that it has a maximal element,
from which we extract the fixed point we are looking for. The choice of
the sets, here open balls, is characteristic of this type of problems and the
contraction condition are essential, specially when we are to establish the
uniqueness of the fixed point.
Keywords-q-spherical completeness; T0 -ultra-quasi-metric space; common
fixed point.

INTRODUCTION

To prove results about fixed points or common fixed points for maps in T0 -ultraquasi-metric space satisfying some strict contractive conditions, supcontinuity
of the maps is assumed as well as the space is required to be joincompact. It
turns out that this is not the case for q-spherically complete T0 -ultra-quasimetric space. In this situation, supcontinuity of maps is not necessary to obtain
fixed points. A fixed points theorem for maps in T0 -ultra-quasi-metric space
had been proved recently (compare [3]) and the result has been extended in [9]
for multi-valued maps.
For recent results in the area of Asymmetric Topology, the reader is adviced to
consult [4, 5].

PRELIMINARIES

Definition 2.1 (Compare [2, page 2]) Let X be a set and d : X × X → [0, ∞)
be a function mapping into the set [0, ∞) of non-negative reals. Then d is an
ultra-quasi-pseudometric on X if
(a) d(x, x) = 0 for all x ∈ X, and
(b) d(x, z) ≤ max{d(x, y), d(y, z)} whenever x, y, z ∈ X.
1

The conjugate d−1 of d where d−1 (x, y) = d(y, x) whenever x, y ∈ X is also an
ultra-quasi-pseudometric on X.
If d also satisfies the following condition (known as the T0 -condition):
(c) for any x, y ∈ X, d(x, y) = 0 = d(y, x) implies that x = y, then d is called a
T0 -ultra-quasi-metric on X. Notice that ds = sup{d, d−1 } = d ∨ d−1 is an ultra
metric on X whenever d is a T0 -ultra-quasi-metric on X .
In the literature, T0 -ultra-quasi-metric spaces are also know as non Archimedean
T0 -quasi-metric spaces. The set of open balls {{y ∈ X : d(x, y) < ǫ} : x ∈ X, ǫ >
0} yields a base for the topology τ (d) induced by d on X.
Example 2.2 (Compare [13, Example 3]) Let X = [0, ∞). Define for each
x, y ∈ X, n(x, y) = x if x > y, and n(x, y) = 0 if x ≤ y. It is not difficult to
check that (X, n) is a T0 -ultra-quasi-metric space.
Notice also that for x, y ∈ [0, ∞), we have ns (x, y) = max{x, y} if x 6= y and
ns (x, y) = 0 if x = y. The ultra metric ns is complete on [0, ∞) since n and
n−1 are complete on [0, ∞) (compare [2, Example 2]).
Definition 2.3 Let (X, d) and (Y, m) be two ultra-quasi-pseudometric spaces.
We say that a map f : (X, d) → (Y, m) is supcontinuous if f : (X, ds ) → (Y, ms )
is continuous.
Let (X, d) be an ultra-quasi-pseudometric space. Let x ∈ X and
r ∈ [0, ∞). By Cd (x, r) we mean the closed ball
Cd (x, r) = {y ∈ X : d(x, y) ≤ r}
of radius r centred at x.
Lemma 2.4 (Compare [2, Lemma 9]) If (X, d) is an ultra-quasi-pseudometric
space and x, y ∈ X and r, s ∈ [0, ∞), then we have that
Cd (x, r) ∩ Cd−1 (y, s) 6= ∅
if and only if
d(x, y) ≤ max{r, s}.
Definition 2.5 (Compare [2, Definition 2]) Let (X, d) be an ultra-quasi-pseudometric
space. Let (xi )i∈I be a family of points in X and let (ri )i∈I and (si )i∈I be families of non-negative real numbers. We shall say that the family (Cd (xi , ri ), Cd−1 (xi , si ))i∈I
has the mixed binary intersection property provided that
d(xi , xj ) ≤ max{ri , sj }
whenever i, j ∈ I.
Definition 2.6 We say that (X, d) is q-spherically complete provided that each
family (Cd (xi , ri ), Cd−1 (xi , si ))i∈I possessing the mixed binary intersection property also satisfies
\
(Cd (xi , ri ) ∩ Cd−1 (xi , si )) 6= ∅.
i∈I

For an example of a q-spherically complete ultra-quasi-metric space, the reader
is adviced to check [2, Example 2].

Proposition 2.7 (Compare [2, Proposition 2])
(a) Let (X, d) be an ultra-quasi-pseudometric space. Then (X, d) is q-spherically
complete if and only if (X, d−1 ) is q-spherically complete.
(b) Let (X, d) be a T0 -ultra-quasi-metric space. If (X, d) is q-spherically complete, then (X, ds ) is spherically complete.
Definition 2.8 An ultra-quasi-pseudometric space (X, d) is called bicomplete
provided that the ultra-pseudometric ds on X is complete.
Proposition 2.9 (Compare [2, Proposition 3]) Each q-spherically complete T0 ultra-quasi-metric space (X, d) is bicomplete.
In [3], Agyingi proved the following:
Theorem 2.10 Let (X, d) be a q-spherically complete T0 -ultra-quasi-metric space.
If T : X → X is a mapping such that
d(T x, T y) < max{d(x, y), d(T x, x), d(y, T y)},
for all x, y ∈ X, with 0 < min{d(x, y), d(y, x)}, then T has a unique fixed point.
Now, we extend this theorem for a pair of maps of Jungck type.

Main Results

Definition 3.1 Let (X, d) be an ultra-quasi-pseudometric space, f : X → X
and T : X → X be two self maps on X. We say that f and T coincidentally
commute at z ∈ X if T f z = f T z.
Theorem 3.2 Let (X, d) be a q-spherically complete T0 -ultra-quasi-metric space.
If f and T are self map on X satisfying
T (X) ⊆ f (X),

(1)

d(T x, T y) < max{d(f x, f y), d(T x, f x), d(f y, T y)},

(2)

for all x, y ∈ X, with 0 < min{d(x, y), d(y, x)}, then there exists z ∈ X such
that f z = T z.
Further, if f and T coincidentally commute at z, then z is the unique fixed point
of f and T .
Proof.
Let a ∈ X. Let us denote by
Cda = Cd (f a, αa ) and Cda−1 = Cd−1 (f a, αa ),
with αa := ds (f a, T a) = max{d(T a, f a), d(f a, T a)} and set
C a = Cda ∩ Cda−1 .
Let A := {C a : a ∈ X}. Define the relation  on A by
C a  C b if and only if C b ⊆ C a .
Then (A, ) is a partially ordered set. Since the verification of this fact is trivial,
we leave it to the interested reader.
3

Let A1 be a nonempty chain in A. Then by q-spherical completeness of (X, d),
we have that
\
C a = C 6= ∅.
C a ∈A1

Clearly, C ∩ f (X) 6= ∅. It follows from the mature of the balls considered, the
centers are of the form f a, a ∈ X. Moreover, we consider a totally ordered
family of such balls. In fact,
\
Ca = Cy
C a ∈A1

for some y ∈ X. For more clarity in this part, we refer the reader to [11].
Let f b ∈ C and C a ∈ A1 . Then we have
d(f a, f b) ≤ αa and d(f b, f a) ≤ αa .
Let now x ∈ C b . Then
d(f b, x) ≤ αb and d(x, f b) ≤ αb .

d(f b, x) ≤ max{d(T b, f b), d(f b, T b)}
≤ max{d(T b, T a), d(T a, f a), d(f a, f b), d(f b, f a), d(f a, T a), d(T a, T b)}
≤ max{d(T b, T a), d(T a, T b), αa}
≤ max{d(T b, f b), d(f b, f a), d(f a, T a), d(T a, f a), d(f a, f b), d(f b, T b)}
≤ αa
From the above inequality, we have now that
d(f a, x) ≤ max{d(f a, f b), d(f b, x)}
= αa
which means that x ∈ Cd (f a, α) . We have thus shown that
Cd (f b, αb ) ⊆ Cd (f a, αa ).

(3)

By a similar computation, one can show that
Cd−1 (f b, αb ) ⊆ Cd−1 (f a, αa ).

(4)

By Equations (3) and (4), we have that for all C a ∈ A1 , C b ⊆ C a , which
means that C a  C b for all C a ∈ A1 . Thus C b is an upper bound in A for the
chain A1 . By Zorn’s lemma we conclude that A has a maximal element, say,
C u , u ∈ X. We claim that T u = f u.
Suppose on the contrary that f u 6= T u. Since T u ∈ T (X) ⊆ f (X), there exists
w ∈ X such that T u = f w. From (2), we have
d(f w, T w) = d(T u, T w)
< max{d(f u, f w), d(T u, f u), d(f w, T w)}
< max{d(f u, f w), d(f w, f u), d(f w, T w)}
= max{d(f u, f w), d(f w, f u)}.
4

and
d(T w, f w) = d(T w, T u)
< max{d(f w, f u), d(f u, T u), d(T w, f w)}
< max{d(f w, f u), d(f u, f w), d(f w, T w)}
= max{d(f u, f w), d(f w, f u)}.
Thus f u ∈
/ C w and hence C u ( C w . It is a contradiction to the maximality of
u
C . We therefore conclude that T u = f u.
Moreover, if f and T coincidentally commute at u, then f 2 u = f (f u) = f (T u) =
T (f u) = T 2 u.
Suppose that f u 6= u. From condition (2)), we have that
d(T f u, T u) < max{d(f 2 u, f u), d(T f u, f 2u), d(f u, T u)}
= d(f 2 u, f u) = d(T f u, T u),
since d(T f u, f 2u) = d(f u, T u) = 0.
Similarly we can prove that d(T u, T f u) < d(T u, T f u). The above inequalities
gives a contradiction and so we must have that u = f u = T u.
Let us now prove uniqueness.
Suppose that there is another common fixed point, i.e., there exists z ∈ X such
that f (z) = z = T z and z 6= u. We shall examine two cases.
Case 1: Suppose d(z, u) > 0. Then we have that
d(z, u) = d(T z, T u) < max{d(f z, f u), d(T z, f z), d(f u, T u)} = d(z, u),
which is a contradiction.
Case 2: Suppose now that d(u, z) > 0. Then we get
d(u, z) = d(T u, T z) < max{d(f u, f z), d(u, z), d(f z, T z)} = d(u, z),
which is a contradiction.
Thus we must have that z = u.

Corollary 3.3 Theorem 3.2 holds if inequality (2) is replaced by
d(T x, T y) < max{d(T x, T y), d(T x, f x), d(f y, T y), d(f x, T y), d(T x, f y)}, (5)
for all x, y ∈ X, with 0 < min{d(x, y), d(y, x)}.
Proof.
Since d(f x, T y) ≤ max{d(f x, f y), d(f y, T y)} and d(T x, f y) ≤ max{d(T x, f x), d(f x, f y)},
hence inequality (5) implies inequality (2).

Corollary 3.4 Taking f = I (the identity map), we obtain Theorem 1 of [3].

MULTI-VALUED MAPS

Now we generalize Theorem 3.2 when T is a multi-valued map.
Let P0 (X) := 2X \ ∅ where 2X denotes the power set of X. For x ∈ X and
A, B ∈ P0 (X), we set:
d(x, A) = inf{d(x, a), a ∈ A} and d(A, x) = inf{d(a, x), a ∈ A},
and define the Hausdorff ultra-quasi-pseudometric H by


H(A, B) = max sup d(a, B), sup d(A, b) .
a∈A

b∈B

Then H is an extended ultra-quasi-pseudometric on P0 (X). Moreover, we know
from [?] that the restriction of H to Scl = {A ⊆ X : A = clτ (d) A ∩ clτ (d−1 ) A} is
an extended T0 -ultra-quasi- metric.
Definition 4.1 For a non Archimedian T0 -quasi-metric space(X, d), we denote
by 2X
j the space of all nonempty joincompact subsets in X with the Hausdorff
ultra-quasi-metric H.
We have the following result due to Agyingi [3].
Theorem 4.2 (compare [3]) Let (X, d) be a q-spherically complete T0 -ultraquasi-metric space. If T : X → 2X
j is a mapping such that
H(T x, T y) < max{d(x, y), d(T x, x), d(y, T y)} for all x, y ∈ X, x 6= y,
then T has a unique fixed point, i.e there exists x ∈ X such that x ∈ T x.
Definition 4.3 Let (X, d) be an ultra-quasi-pseudometric space, f : X → X
and T : X → 2X
j . f and T are said to be coincidentally commuting at z ∈ X if
f z ∈ T z implies that f T z ⊆ T f z.
Theorem 4.4 (compare [11, Theorem 9]) Let (X, d) be a q-spherically complete
T0 -ultra-quasi-metric space. Let f : X → X and T : X → 2X
j be two maps
satisfying
T x ⊆ f (X) ∀x ∈ X,
(6)
H(T x, T y) < max{d(f x, f y), d(T x, f x), d(f y, T y)},

(7)

for all x, y ∈ X, with 0 < min{d(x, y), d(y, x)}. Then there exists z ∈ X such
that f z ∈ T z.
Further, assume that
ds (f u, f x) ≤ min{H(T u, T f y), H(T f y, T u)} ∀x, y, u ∈ X with f x ∈ T y, (8)
and
f and T are coincidentally commuting at z.
Then f z is the unique fixed point of f and T .
Proof.
Let a ∈ X and denote by
Cad = Cd (f a, βa ) and ; Cad
6

−1

= Cd−1 (f a, d(f a, T a))

(9)

the closed balls with centers at f a ∈ X and
radius
βa := max{d(T a, f a), d(f a, T a)}
with
d(T a, f a) = inf{d(z, f a) : z ∈ T a}
and
d(f a, T a) = inf{d(f a, z) : z ∈ T a}.
Put
−1

Ca = Cad ∩ Cad .
Let A be the collection of all such closed balls Ca such that a runs over X.
Define  on A by
Ca  Cb if and only if Cb ⊆ Ca .
Then (A, ) is a partially ordered set. We leave the verification of this fact to
the interested reader.
Let A1 be a nonempty chain in A. Then by q-spherical completeness of (X, d),
we have that
\
Ca = C 6= ∅.
Ca ∈A1

Here again , it is clear that C ∩ f (X) 6= ∅.
Let f b ∈ C and Ca ∈ A1 . Then we have
d(f a, f b) ≤ βa and d(f b, f a) ≤ βa .
Let us choose u ∈ T a such that ds (f a, u) = ds (f a, T a). Notice that this is
possible since the map : T a → R defined by u 7→ d(x, u) is uniformly continuous
with respect to the usual metric on R
With u ∈ T a satisfying the above condition and f b ∈ C, we have
d(f b, T b) = inf{d(f b, c) : c ∈ T b}
≤ max{d(f b, f a), d(f a, u), inf{d(u, c) : c ∈ T b}}
≤ max{βa , H(T a, T b)}
< max{βa , d(T a, f a), d(f b, T b), d(f a, f b)}
= max{βa , d(f b, T b)}
which is possible only when d(f b, T b) < βa .
By a similar computation, we have that d(T b, f b) < max{βa , d(T b, f b)} which
is possible only when d(T b, f b) < βa .
Let now x ∈ Cb . Then
d(f b, x) ≤ βb < βa ; and d(x, f b) ≤ βb < βa .
We have now that:
d(f a, x) ≤ max{d(f a, f b), d(f b, x)}
≤ βa
7

which means that x ∈ Cd (f a, βa ). We have thus shown that
Cd (f b, βb ) ⊆ Cd (f a, βa ).

(10)

Cd−1 (f b, βb ) ⊆ Cd−1 (f a, βa ).

(11)

Similarly we can show that

Equations (10) and (11) imply that for all Ca ∈ A1 , Cb ⊆ Ca . In other words,
this says that Ca  Cb for all Ca ∈ A1 . Thus Cb is an upper bound in A
for the chain A1 . We therefore conclude by Zorn’s lemma that A has a maximal element, say, Cz , z ∈ X. We shall prove that f z ∈ T z. We do this by
contradiction.
Suppose on the contrary that f z 6∈ T z. Then from (6) there exists f z ∗ ∈
T z, f z ∗ 6= f z, such that ds (f z, f z ∗) = ds (f z, T z).
d(f z ∗ , T z ∗) ≤ H(T z, T z ∗)
< max{d(f z, f z ∗), d(T z, f z), d(f z ∗, T z ∗)}
≤ {βz , d(f z ∗ , T z ∗ )}
which is possible only if d(f z ∗ , T z ∗ ) < βz .
Similarly we have that d(T z ∗ , f z ∗ ) < max{βz , d(T z ∗ , f z ∗ ) which is possible only
if d(T z ∗ , f z ∗ ) < βz .
Let y ∈ Cz∗ . Then
d(y, f z ∗ ) ≤ βz∗ < βz ; and d(f z ∗ , y) ≤ βz∗ < βz .
Also
d(y, f z) ≤ max{d(y, f z ∗ ), d(f z ∗ , f z)} ≤ βz
and
d(f z, y) ≤ max{d(f z, f z ∗), d(f z ∗ , y)} ≤ βz .
This just means that y belongs to the ball Cz , so that Cz∗ ⊆ Cz .
The inequality ds (f z, f z ∗) = ds (f z, T z) > ds (f z ∗ , T z ∗ ) implies that z does not
belong to the ball Cz∗ and this implies that Cz∗ ( Cz which contradicts the
maximality of Cz . So we must have that f z ∈ T z.
Further, assume (8), and (9). Form (8), we have
d(f z, f 2 z) ≤ H(T f z, T f z) = 0,
and
d(f 2 z, f 2 z) ≤ H(T f z, T f z) = 0.
This means that d(f z, f 2 z) = 0 = d(f 2 z, f 2 z), hence f 2 z = f z. From (9),
f z = f 2 z ∈ f T z ⊆ T f z. Thus f z is a common fixed point of f and T .
We shall now prove uniqueness.
Suppose there is z ∗ such that f z ∗ 6= f z and f z ∗ = f 2 z ∗ ∈ T f z ∗. From (7), (8),
we have
d(f z, f z ∗) = d(f 2 z, f 2 z ∗ ) ≤ H(T f 2 z, T f z ∗)
≤ H(T f z, T f z ∗)
< max{d(f 2 z, f 2 z ∗ ), d(f 2 z, T f z), d(f 2z ∗ , T f z ∗)}
= d(f z, f z ∗)
8

and
d(f z ∗ , f z) = d(f 2 z ∗ , f 2 z) ≤ H(T f 2 z ∗ , T f z)
≤ H(T f z ∗, T f z)
< max{d(f 2 z ∗ , f 2 z), d(f 2 z ∗ , T f z ∗), d(f 2 z, T f z)}
= d(f z ∗ , f z).
This implies that f z ∗ = f z. Thus z = f 2 z is the unique common fixed point of
f and T .

Remark 4.5 If f = I (Identity map), then the first part of Theorem 4.4 is the
main theorem of Agyingi [9].
