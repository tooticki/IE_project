Abstract
The Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) is a non-equilibrium particle
model on a finite one-dimensional lattice with open boundaries. In our earlier paper, we obtained
a determinantal formula that computes the steady state probabilities of this process by the
enumeration of “Catalan alternative tableaux”, which are certain fillings of Young diagrams.
Here, we present a new, more illuminating bijective proof of this determinantal formula using
the Lindström-Gessel-Viennot Lemma.

The TASEP and Catalan alternative tableaux

The totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) is a version of the well-studied non-equilibrium
particle model from statistical mechanics. In a TASEP of size n, particles hop to the right along
a line with locations labelled 1 through n such that there is at most one particle per location, and
particles can enter at location 1 and exit from location n with respective rates α and β. A state
of the TASEP is described by a word τ = τ1 . . . τn in {0, 1}n where τi = 1 if there is a particle in
location i, and τi = 0 otherwise. The discrete Markov process can be defined as follows, for τ 0 and
τ 00 arbitrary words in {0, 1}∗ : at each time step,

where X * Y means that the transition from X to Y occurs with probability n+1
where n is the
length of X and Y . We use the notation P r(τ ) to denote the stationary probability of state τ .

A large number of related combinatorial objects interpret the
stationary probabilities of the TASEP, and an explicit determinantal formula was given in [4] for Pr(τ ). In this work, we present
a simple bijective proof for that formula that uses the LindströmGessel-Viennot Lemma. We begin by defining the main object,
the Catalan alternative tableau.

Definition 1.1. A Catalan alternative tableau T of size

(n, k) is a Young diagram Y = Y (T ) contained in a k × n − k

and weight α8 β 12 .
boxes of Y with α’s and β’s according to the following rules:
i Every box in the same column and above an α must be empty.
ii Every box in the same row and left of a β must be empty.
iii Every box that does not lie above an α or left of a β must contain an α or a β.
We associate to T a lattice path L = L(T ) with steps south and west, which starts at the northeast
corner of the rectangle and ends at the southwest corner, and follows the southeast border of Y .
The type of T is the word τ in {0, 1}∗ that we obtain by reading L from northeast to southwest
and assigning a 1 to a south-step and a 0 to a west-step.

We also associate to Y the partition λ = λ(T ) = (λ1 , . . . , λk ), where λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λk ≥ 0 and λi
is the number of boxes in Y in the ith row of the rectangle. We call λ the shape of T and of Y .
Definition 1.2. For a Catalan alternative tableau T with associated shape λ(T ) and of type τ with
exactly k 1’s, we make the equivalent definition λ(τ ) = (λ1 , . . . , λk ). Here λi is the number of 0’s
following the i’th 1 in the word τ . It is easy to see that λ(T ) = λ(τ ).
Definition 1.3. For a Catalan alternative tableau T of size (n, k) and its associated Young diagram
Y , an α-free column is a column of the k × n − k rectangle containing Y that does not contain an
α. Similarly, a β-free row is a row of the rectangle that does not contain a β.

diagram Y is

Example. Figure 1 shows a Catalan alternative tableau of type 0001001100100, weight α8 β 12 with
λ(T ) = (6, 4, 4, 2).
Catalan alternative tableaux are a specialization of “alternative tableaux”, which are more general
objects connected to the combinatorics of the PASEP (an exclusion process in which particles are
allowed to hop both left and right). The alternative tableaux are related by simple bijections to several similar objects in the literature, such as permutation tableaux, staircase tableaux, and tree-like
tableaux. Some references for these objects can be found in [9, 10] (thus we could similarly define
Catalan permutation tableaux, Catalan staircase tableaux, and Catalan tree-like tableaux). Furthermore, connections to the combinatorics of the (P)ASEP are explored in an expansive collection
of slides from lectures given by Viennot in [7]. The author recommends these slides and references
therein as a source for further reading on this topic. For the rest of this paper, we will refer to the
Catalan alternative tableaux simply as “Catalan tableaux”.

We give the proof in Section 3.1. Instead, here we demonstrate the importance of the above in
connection with the TASEP. From the following theorem, we obtain that P (τ ) plays a central role

Duchi and Schaeffer in [5] provide the first combinatorial interpretation for probabilities of the TASEP, which is
in terms of a different combinatorial object that resembles two rows of particles. However, an important advantage
of this theorem is that its formulation in terms of tableaux can be extended to the setting of the ASEP, which is a
more general exclusion process in which particles can hop both left and right, as well as hop in and out of the lattice
from both sides. See [1, 2] for details.

Bijection from Catalan tableaux to weighted Catalan paths

In this section, we present a canonical bijection from a filling of the Catalan tableau with associated
Young diagram Y to a lattice path on a Young diagram of the same shape. Viennot describes
an analogous bijection from Catalan permutation tableaux (which are in bijection to the Catalan
tableaux) to weighted lattice paths in [6]. We reformulate this bijection for the Catalan tableaux
and assign the weights to the resulting lattice path in a particular way.

2.1

Weighted Catalan path

Let Y be a Young diagram contained within a k × n − k rectangle. A lattice path constrained by
Y is a path that begins in the northeast corner and ends at the southwest corner of rectangle, and
takes the steps south and west in such a way that it never crosses the southeast boundary of Y .
Definition 2.1. A Catalan path C of size (n, k) with associated Young diagram Y is a lattice path
constrained by Y with the following weights on its edges:
• A south edge that coincides with the east border of the rectangle receives a

1
β.

• A south edge that does not coincide with the east border of the rectangle receives a 1.
• A west edge that coincides with the south boundary of Y receives a

1
α.

• A west edge that does not coincide with the south boundary of Y receives a 1.
Definition 2.2. The path weight p wt(C) of the Catalan path C is the product of the weights on
its edges. We call the total weight of the Catalan path wt(C), with wt(C) = (αβ)n p wt(C).

The following lemma describes a natural correspondence between the Catalan tableaux and the
Catalan paths.
Lemma 2.1. There is a weight-preserving bijection between the set of Catalan paths of size (n, k)
constrained by the Young diagram Y to the set of Catalan tableaux of size (n, k) of type τ such that
λ(τ ) is the same partition that describes Y .
Proof. Let a Catalan path C of size (n, k) constrained by a Young diagram Y of shape λ =
(λ1 , . . . , λk ) be described by the partition (C1 , . . . , Ck ) that is weakly smaller than λ. In other
words, C1 ≥ C2 · · · ≥ Ck and 0 ≤ Ci ≤ λi , and Ci is the position of the south step of the lattice
path that occurs in row i of the k × n − k rectangle.
We map (C1 , . . . , Ck ) to a Catalan tableau T as follows. First we label the columns of the k × n − k
rectangle with 1 through n − k from left to right. Then, for i in {1, . . . , k}, if Ci > 0, we place a
β in column Ci of Y such that it is the south-most position possible with the condition that there
is at most one β per row. We now place an α in the lowest possible β-free row of every column.
(Consequently, a column does not receive an α if and only if it has zero β-free rows.) It is easy to
check that this construction results in a valid Catalan tableau.
Conversely, to map a Catalan tableau T to the partition (C1 , . . . , Ck ), we label the β’s in the filling
of Y from left to right and top to bottom with 1, . . . , ` where ` is the number of β’s, and we let Ci be
the label of the column containing the i’th beta. We let C`+1 = · · · = Ck = 0. In this construction,
the labels on the β’s decrease as the labels on the columns decrease, as in the left image of Figure
2, so Ci ≥ Ci+1 . The partition (C1 , . . . , Ck ) is then directly mapped to the Catalan path P .
Now we show the weight wt(C) of the Catalan path C is the same as the weight wt(T ) of the
Catalan tableau T . Let {Ci1 , . . . , Cim } be the subset of {C1 , . . . , Ck } that
 represents the south steps
that touch the south boundary of Y . Then the contribution of the α1 to the weight of the path

Q

. This is because, for each j, if Cij touches the south boundary of Y , we know
j=1 α
that there are zero β-free rows in the column ij . In particular, no column of the Catalan tableau
between λij +1 and ij can contain an α, so every west-edge of the path in those columns carries a
weight of α1 . It follows that both the Catalan tableau and the Catalan path have the same power of

Bijection from a weighted lattice path on a Young diagram of k
rows to k disjoint weighted paths

Let D be a digraph where we assume finitely many paths between any two vertices. Let e =
(e1 , . . . , ek ) and v = (v1 , . . . , vk ) be k-tuples of vertices of D. Let every edge of D be assigned a
weight.
Definition 3.1. A k-path from e to v is a k-tuple of paths P(e, v) = (P1 , . . . , Pk ) where for some
fixed π ∈ Sk , Pi is a path from ei to vπ(i) . The k-path P is disjoint if the paths Pi are all vertex
disjoint.
Definition 3.2. The weight wt(Pi ) of a path Pi is the product of the weights on its edges. The
weight wt(P) ofP
the k-path P = (P1 , . . . , Pk ) is the sum of the weights of its components, in other
words wt(P) = ki=1 wt(Pi ).
Theorem 3.1 (Lingström, Gessel-Viennot). Let D be a digraph, and let u = (u1 , . . . , uk ) and
y = (yP
1 , . . . , yk ) be k-tuples of vertices of D. Let Pij be the set of paths from ui to yj . Define
wij = p∈Pij wt(p). Then
XX
sgn(π) wt(P) = det (wij )1≤i,j≤k .
π∈Sk P

where P ranges over all disjoint k-paths P(u, π(y)).
In this section, we provide a bijection from a Catalan path on a Young diagram Y to a disjoint
k-path on a corresponding digraph with appropriately assigned weights on the edges. Ignoring the
weights, we obtain the canonical bijection from lattice paths constrained by a Young diagram to
disjoint k-paths.2 This bijection allows us to enumerate the Catalan paths as an application of the
Lindström-Gessel-Viennot Lemma.
Let C be a Catalan path of size (n, k) with associated Young diagram Y of shape λ = (λ1 , . . . , λk ).
We label the vertical lines in the k × n − k rectangle from left to right with {0, 1, . . . n − k}. Let
C be described by the partition (C1 , . . . , Ck ) where Ci is the label of the south-step of C in row i.
Since C consists of only south- and west- steps, we necessarily have C1 ≥ · · · ≥ Ck ≥ 0.
Now we define a twisted tableau Ỹ from Y as follows: for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, draw a row of λi parallelograms
consisting of east and southeast edges, and left-justify the rows as in the middle image of Figure 3.
In each row, we label the southeast edges of the parallelograms with 0, 1, 2, . . . from left to right.
We put weights on the edges of the parallelograms in the following way:
2
We can treat the Catalan path and the Young diagram that contains it simply as nested lattice paths. The duality
of nested lattice paths with disjoint k-paths is known in the literature and is described as the Kreweras-Narayana
determinant. In particular, this duality is described in slides by Viennot [8], and the case for α = β = 1 of our problem
is solved therein.

Every other edge receives a weight of 1.

We mark the left-most vertices of each row of parallelograms as the k special points e1 , . . . , ek from
top to bottom. We also mark the right-most vertices of each row of parallelograms as the k special
points v1 , . . . , vk . Finally, we convert Ỹ into a digraph by directing all its edges from northwest to
southeast. We denote by Pij the set of weighted paths from ei to vj .

Figure 3: A Catalan path represented by partition (7, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0) on a Young Diagram with rows
(C1 , . . . , C6 ) = (1, . . . , 6) and the corresponding set of paths {pii }1≤i≤6 where pii ∈ Pii has a single
diagonal step at edge labeled Ci . This Catalan path is the same one as in Figure 2.
We map the partition (C1 , . . . , Ck ) on Y to a k-path P(C) = P(e, v) on Ỹ in the following way. We
write P(C) = (p11 , . . . , pkk ) where pii ∈ Pii . For each i in {1, . . . , k}, we define pii as follows: let
the single diagonal step in pii be the southeast edge in row i with label Ci . The rest of the edges
in pii must necessarily be the horizontal edges that connect that diagonal step from ei to vi . From
Figure 3, it is easy to see this is a one to one correspondence.
Remark 3.1. It is important to note that the segment of C that lies in the columns {λ1 +1, . . . , n−k}
is ignored in the construction of P(C). This is permissible since any Catalan path constrained by λ
must necessarily have the same such segment. Thus it suffices to simply adjust the weight of P(C)
n−k−λ1
by the weight contribution of that segment, which is α1
.
Lemma 3.2. Based on the construction of the k-path P(C) above, we claim that (i.) P(C) is
n−k−λ1
disjoint if and only if C1 ≥ · · · ≥ Ck and (ii.) p wt(C) = α1
wt(P(C)).
Proof. [i.] It is easy to see from the construction that Ci ≥ Ci+1 if and only if the diagonal edge
in row i is strictly to the right of the diagonal edge in row i + 1. That implies pii is strictly to the
northeast of pi+1 i+1 . Since the pii ’s are nested paths, this implies P(C) is disjoint.
[ii.] We prove the equality by comparing wt(pii ) to the weight contribution of the segment of C that
is in row i (including the south border of the row), and showing they are equal for each 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
• First, if Ci = 0, then wt(pii ) = β1 , and also the weight contribution of row i in C is
rows 3-6 in the example in Figure 3.

β.

See

• When Ci > 0, there is no contribution of β1 to the segment of C in row i or to pii , so we
consider only the contribution of α1 . If 0 < Ci ≤ λi+1 , the south-step of C in row i does not
touch the south boundary of Y , so there is no contribution of α1 from that segment of the path,
and hence the total weight contribution is 1. Similarly, pii does not contain any edges with
non-unit weight and so wt(pii ) = 1. See rows 2-3 in the example in Figure 3.
• If Ci > λi+1 , the south-step of C in row i touches the south boundary of Y , so that segment
of the path has Ci − λi+1 west-edges that coincide with the south boundary of Y and thus
carry the weight α1 . Thus the total contribution to the weight of the segment of C in row i
C −λ
C −λ
is α1 i i+1 . By the construction, pii has weight α1 i i+1 on its diagonal edge, and that
also equals wt(pii ). See row 1 in the example in Figure 3.
From the above, for each i, the contribution of the weight of the segment of C in row i equals wt(pii ).
By Remark 3.1, we have excluded from P(C) the contribution of the weight of the segment of C that
n−k−λi
lies to the northeast of Y . Consequently, we have p wt(C) = α1
wt(P(C)) as desired.

3.1

Proof of Theorem 1.1

We make the simple observation that a k-path (Pi P
, . . . , Pk ) from the e to v is disjoint if and only if
each path Pi is from ei to vi . As before, let wij = p∈Pij wt(p) for Pij the collection of paths from
ei to vj . Then from the bijection above and from Theorem 3.1, we obtain

where C ranges over the Catalan tableaux constrained by Y , and P ranges over the disjoint k-paths
from e to v on Ỹ .
It is not difficult to check that wij for i, j > 0 equals precisely the entry Aij from Theorem 1.1. We
describe the calculations below.
Consider the paths from ei to vj that have weight generating function wij . First, if i > j + 1, there
are zero such paths since all paths can only take east and southeast steps. Next, if i = j + 1, there
is exactly one path, namely the one that takes only horizontal steps from ei , and so the weight on
that path is 1, and thus wi,i−1 = 1. Finally, assume i ≤ j. Then any path in Pij takes j − i + 1
southeast steps, of which at most one step could have a weight of β1 , and at most one other step
`
could have a weight of α1 for some ` > 0. Thus we count four cases for paths in Pij :
1. A path has all its steps of weight 1. The path necessarily takes the first step east and goes to
λi+1
the right-most vertex of parallelogram number λi+1 in the ith row. This can happen in j−i+1
ways, and every such path has weight 1.
2. A path has one step of weight β1 and the rest of weight 1. The path necessarily takes the first
step southeast and goes tothe right-most vertex of parallelogram number λi+1 in the ith row.
λi+1
This can happen in j−i+1
ways, and every such path has weight β1 .

first step east and goes to the right-most vertex of parallelogram number λi+1 + ` − 1 in

row i − 1. This can happen in λi+1
ways, and every such path has weight α1 , where

number λi+1 + ` − 1 in row i − 1. This can happen in λj−i−1
ways, and every such path has

weight β1 α1 , where 1 ≤ ` ≤ λi − λi+1 .
We combine the above to obtain Aλ = (wij )1≤i,j≤k as desired.
Finally, if C is the Catalan path corresponding to the Catalan tableau T , since wt(T ) = wt(C) =
(αβ)n p wt(C) = β n αk+λ1 wt(P(C)), we obtain the desired formula.
