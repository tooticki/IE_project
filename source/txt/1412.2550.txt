Abstract
We are interested in the upper bound of the lifespan of solutions
of semilinear wave equations from above. For the sub-critical case
in high dimensions, it has been believed that the basic tools of its
analysis are Kato‚Äôs lemma on ordinary differential inequalities and
the rescaling argument in the functional method. But there is a small
lack of delicate analysis and no published paper about this. Here we
give a simple alternative proof by means of improved Kato‚Äôs lemma
without any rescaling argument.

Introduction

We consider the initial value problem,

utt ‚àí ‚àÜu = |u|p , in Rn √ó [0, ‚àû),
u(x, 0) = Œµf (x), ut (x, 0) = Œµg(x)

(1.1)

assuming that Œµ > 0 is ‚Äúsmall.‚Äù Let us define a lifespan T (Œµ) of a solution of
(1.1) by
T (Œµ) = sup{t > 0 : ‚àÉ a solution u(x, t) of (1.1) for arbitrarily fixed (f, g).},

where ‚Äúsolution‚Äù means classical one when p ‚â• 2. When 1 < p < 2, it
means weak one, but sometimes the one given by associated integral equations to (1.1) by standard Strichartz‚Äôs estimate. See Sideris [11] or Georgiev,
Takamura and Zhou [2] for example on such an argument.
When n = 1, we have T (Œµ) < ‚àû for any power p > 1 by Kato [6]. When
n ‚â• 2, we have the following Strauss‚Äô conjecture on (1.1) by Strauss [12].
T (Œµ) = ‚àû if p > p0 (n) and Œµ is ‚Äúsmall‚Äù (global-in-time existence),
T (Œµ) < ‚àû if 1 < p ‚â§ p0 (n)
(blow-up in finite time),
where p0 (n) is so-called Strauss‚Äô exponent defined by positive root of the
quadratic equation, Œ≥(p, n) = 0, where
Œ≥(p, n) := 2 + (n + 1)p ‚àí (n ‚àí 1)p2 .

That is,

We note that p0 (n) is monotonously decreasing in n. This conjecture had
been verified by many authors with partial results. All the references on the
final result in each part can be summarized in the following table.

In the blow-up case, i.e. 1 < p ‚â§ p0 (n), we are interested in the estimate
of the lifespan T (Œµ). From now on, c and C stand for positive constants but
independent of Œµ. When n = 1, we have the following estimate of the lifespan
T (Œµ) for any p > 1.

When 1 < p < p0 (n) (n ‚â• 3) or 2 < p < p0 (2) (n = 2), we have the
following conjecture.

where Œ≥(p, n) is defined by (1.2). We note that (1.8) coincides with the
second line in (1.4) if we define Œ≥(p, n) by (1.2) even for n = 1. All the
results verifying this conjecture are summarized in the following table.

We note that, for n = 2, 3,
‚àÉ lim Œµ2p(p‚àí1)/Œ≥(p,n) T (Œµ) > 0
Œµ‚Üí+0

is established in this table. Moreover, it has been believed that the upper
bound in the case where n ‚â• 4 easily follows from the rescaling method
applied to the proof in Sideris [11] which proves T (Œµ) < ‚àû. Such an argument
is actually employed in Georgiev, Takamura and Zhou [2] for the analysis on
the system and in Zhou and Han [19] for the analysis on the boundary value
problem in the exterior domain. But it requires more delicate analysis in
the following sense. The conclusion of the original Kato‚Äôs lemma in [6] is
that the integral in full space of unknown function blows-up in finite time.
The rescaling argument uses this blow-up time as a coefficient in front of the
order of Œµ with a negative power. To do this, we have to clarify that such a
blow-up time of the rescaled solution does not depend on Œµ while the initial
data of the rescaled solution has some order of Œµ. Of course, it is true as in
3

Lemma 2.1 in Section 2 below. But we do not need the rescaling argument
as we see later if we employ such an improved Kato‚Äôs lemma. The purpose
of this paper is to show this story.

Our motivation of this work comes from [13], in which the improved Kato‚Äôs
lemma in the critical case is one of the keys for the success to finalize this
part.
This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we improve Kato‚Äôs
lemma showing estimates of the existence time of unknown functions in terms
of the holding time of the key inequality. In Section 3, the improved Kato‚Äôs
lemma is applied to semilinear wave equations. In Section 4 and 5, some
improvements of the estimates are given in two and one dimensional cases.

(2.6)

Remark 2.1 The statement of the original version of this lemma in Kato
[6] is simply that T < ‚àû without (2.2), but there is no restriction on F (0).
The first paper to put an additional assumption (2.2) and to get a sharp
blow-up result of solutions of semilinear wave equations for n ‚â• 2 is Glassey
[3] in two space dimensions. See also Lemma 4 in Sideris [11] for other
dimensions.
Proof of Lemma 2.1. Since (2.3) and (2.4) imply F ‚Ä≤ (t) ‚â• F ‚Ä≤ (0) > 0, we
have
F (t) ‚â• F ‚Ä≤ (0)t + F (0) ‚â• F (0) ‚â• 0 for t ‚â• 0.
(2.7)
Multiplying (2.3) by F ‚Ä≤ (t) > 0, we get

for t ‚â• 0.
If F (0) > 0, then we shall assume that t ‚â• F (0)/F ‚Ä≤(0) which implies
F (t) ‚â• 2F (0). Hence we have

We note that it is trivial that this inequality also holds for F (0) = 0.
From now on, we assume that t ‚â• T1 . Then, (2.2) is available, so that

Therefore the proof of the lemma is now completed.

‚ú∑

We have one more lemma with a different assumption on the initial data.
Lemma 2.2 Assume that (2.4) is replaced by
F (0) > 0, F ‚Ä≤ (0) = 0

(2.8)

and additionally that there is a time t0 > 0 such that
F (t0 ) ‚â• 2F (0).
6

(2.9)

Then, the conclusion of Lemma 2.1 is changed to that there exists a positive
constant C0 = C0 (p, a, q, B) such that
T < 22/M T2

(2.10)

T2 := max {T0 , t0 , R} ‚â• C0 A‚àí(p‚àí1)/(2M ) .

(2.11)

holds provided

Remark 2.2 The statement of the original version of this lemma in Kato
[6] is simply that T < ‚àû without (2.2), but the assumption on the data is
only F (0) 6= 0 and there is no restriction such as (2.9).
Proof of Lemma 2.2. It follows from (2.3) with t = 0 and (2.8) that
F ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ (0) > 0 which implies F ‚Ä≤ (t) > F ‚Ä≤ (0) = 0 for small t > 0. Hence F ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ (t) ‚â• 0
for t ‚â• 0 from (2.3) yields that
F ‚Ä≤ (t) > 0 and F (t) > F (0) > 0 for t > 0.
Hence, similarly to the proof of Lemma 2.1, we obtain that
1 ‚Ä≤ 2
B
F (t) ‚â•
(t + R)‚àíq F (t)p {F (t) ‚àí F (0)}
2
p+1

for t > 0.

Then taking into account of (2.9) and F (t) ‚â• F (t0 ) for t ‚â• t0 , we have that
s
B
F ‚Ä≤ (t) >
(t + R)‚àíq/2 F (t)(p+1)/2 for t ‚â• t0 .
p+1
Therefore, after assuming t ‚â• T2 , one can readily establish the same argument as in the proof of Lemma 2.1 in which T1 is replaced by T2 .

Upper bound of the lifespan

In this section, we prove the expected theorem on the upper bound of the
lifespan in high dimensional case.
Theorem 3.1 Let 1 < p < p0 (n) for n ‚â• 2. Assume that both f ‚àà H 1 (Rn )
and g ‚àà L2 (Rn ) are non-negative and have compact support, and that g
does not vanish identically. Suppose that the problem (1.1) has a solution
(u, ut ) ‚àà C([0, T (Œµ)), H 1(Rn ) √ó L2 (Rn )) with
supp(u, ut) ‚äÇ {(x, t) ‚àà Rn √ó [0, ‚àû) : |x| ‚â§ t + R}.
7

(3.1)

Then, there exists a positive constant Œµ0 = Œµ0 (f, g, n, p, R) such that T (Œµ) has
to satisfy
T (Œµ) ‚â§ CŒµ‚àí2p(p‚àí1)/Œ≥(p,n)
(3.2)
for 0 < Œµ ‚â§ Œµ0 , where C is a positive constant independent of Œµ.
Remark 3.1 In view of (1.6), (3.2) is not optimal for n = 2 and 1 < p ‚â§ 2.
In Section 4 and 5, by improving estimate (3.5), optimal estimates for the
upper bound for the lifespan are obtained for n = 2 and n = 1.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. In order to employ Lemma 2.1, let us set
Z
F (t) =
u(x, t)dx.

Then, (2.4) immediately follows from the assumption of the theorem as

For the key inequality (2.2), we employ the following proposition.
Proposition 3.1 Suppose that the assumption in Theorem 3.1 is fulfilled.
Then, there exists a positive constant C1 = C1 (f, g, n, p, R) such that F (t) =

u(x, t)dx satisfies

F ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ (t) ‚â• C1 Œµp t(n‚àí1)(1‚àíp/2)

(3.5)

This estimate is valid also for the case where f (x) ‚â• 0(6‚â° 0) and g(x) ‚â° 0.
Remark 3.2 This is a slightly modified estimate of (2.5‚Äô) in Yordanov and
Zhang [14] in which C1 = 0 when f (x) ‚â° 0.

Combining this estimate and (2.4) in [14], we immediately obtain (3.5). We
note that there is no restriction on n in the argument.

The proof of the theorem is now completed.

Theorem 3.2 Let 1 < p < p0 (n) for n ‚â• 2. Assume that f ‚àà H 1 (Rn )
is non-negative, does not vanish identically and g ‚â° 0. Suppose that the
problem (1.1) has a solution (u, ut) ‚àà C([0, T (Œµ)), H 1(Rn ) √ó L2 (Rn )) with
(3.1). Then, there exists a positive constant Œµ1 = Œµ1 (f, n, p, R) such that
T (Œµ) has to satisfy
T (Œµ) ‚â§ CŒµ‚àí2p(p‚àí1)/Œ≥(p,n)
(3.9)
for 0 < Œµ ‚â§ Œµ1 , where C is a positive constant independent of Œµ.

Remark 3.3 We have no new estimate for high dimensional case in this
theorem, but it especially covers the optimality on n = 2 and p = 2. See
(1.6).
Proof of Theorem 3.2. Note that Proposition 3.1 is also available in this
case. Hence we have (3.7) again. Assume that

Note on 2 dimensional case

The optimal estimate in n = 2 and p = 2 in the case where g(x) ‚â• 0(6‚â° 0) is

Theorem 4.1 Let n = 2, 1 < p ‚â§ 2 and f ‚â° 0. Assume that g ‚àà C 1 (R2 ) is

Remark 4.1 (4.1) is a weaker result than (1.6) in the sense that the constant
C is not of the optimal choice and that the assumption on the data is stronger
than Lindblad [8]. Moreover, we note that the optimality of (4.1) for 1 < p <

So we shall have another opportunity to study this part.

Note that |y| ‚â§ R and |x| ‚â§ t + R due to the support property in the
first term on the right-hand side. Then, neglecting the second term on the
right-hand side and making use of inequalities;
t ‚àí |x ‚àí y| ‚â§ t ‚àí ||x| ‚àí |y|| ‚â§ t ‚àí |x| + R for |x| ‚â• R,
t + |x ‚àí y| ‚â§ t + |x| + R ‚â§ 2(t + R),
we obtain that

If we assume |x| + R ‚â§ t which implies |x ‚àí y| ‚â§ t for |y| ‚â§ R, we get
Z
g(y)dy = kgkL1 (R2 ) .

Therefore we have that

Note on one dimensional case

The optimal estimate in n = 1 in the case where g(x) ‚â• 0(6‚â° 0) is also
obtained by a better estimate than (3.5) as announced in Remark 3.1.
Theorem 5.1 Let p > 1 for n = 1. Assume that both f ‚àà C 2 (R) and
g ‚àà C 1 (R) have compact support as supp (f, g) ‚äÇ {x ‚àà R : |x| ‚â§ R}.
Suppose that the problem (1.1) has a solution u ‚àà C 2 (R √ó [0, T (Œµ))) Then,
there exists a positive constant Œµ3 = Œµ3 (f, g, p, R) such that T (Œµ) has to satisfy
Z
‚àí(p‚àí1)/2

T (Œµ) ‚â§ CŒµ
if f ‚â• 0(6‚â° 0), g ‚â° 0
for 0 < Œµ ‚â§ Œµ3 , where C is a positive constant independent of Œµ.
Remark 5.1 The assumption of this theorem is stronger than Zhou [15].
But for the sake of completeness of applications of our lemma, we shall prove
it here.
Proof of Theorem 5.1. First, we note that the assumption on the support
of the initial data implies that the solution u ‚àà C 2 (R √ó [0, T (Œµ)) of (1.1) has
to satisfy
supp u(x, t) ‚äÇ {x ‚àà R : |x| ‚â§ t + R}.
Z
Hence, integrating the equation in R, we have that F (t) =
u(x, t)dx
R

satisfies

F (t) =

It is well-known that u has a representation formula of the form,

Case of

g(x)dx > 0. In view of (5.4), we find that the support condition

17

where

g(x)dx > 0.

Plugging this estimate into (5.2), we have that

p
‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
F (t) ‚â• (GŒµ)
dx = Gp Œµp (t ‚àí R) for t ‚â• R.

This is a better estimate than (3.5). Integrating this inequality twice in [R, t]
and making use of
F ‚Ä≤ (R) ‚â• F ‚Ä≤ (0) > 0,
we obtain that
F (t) >

F (R) > F (0) ‚â• 0,

Gp p
Œµ (t ‚àí R)3
6

for t ‚â• R

which implies that

Gp p 3
Œµ t for t ‚â• 2R.
48
In view of this estimate and (5.3), we are in a position to apply Lemma
2.1 with
Gp p
A=
Œµ , B = 21‚àíp , a = 3, q = p ‚àí 1.
48
Noticing that

one can set
Gp
T0 = C0 A‚àí(p‚àí1)/(2M ) = C0 Œµ‚àí(p‚àí1)/(2p) .
48
Therefore the first conclusion of the theorem follows.
F (t) >

Case of f ‚â• 0(6‚â° 0), g ‚â° 0. In view of (5.4), we find that the support
condition implies
u(x, t) ‚â•

f (x ‚àí t)
Œµ for x + t ‚â• R and ‚àí R ‚â§ x ‚àí t ‚â§ R.

Plugging this estimate into (5.2), we have that

This is the same estimate as (3.5). Therefore the second conclusion of the
theorem immediately follows in the same manner as in the proof of Theorem
3.2 because of Œ≥(p, 1) = 2 + 2p.
