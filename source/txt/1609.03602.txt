Abstract. We define an integer-valued invariant of special cube complexes called the
genus, and prove that having genus one characterizes special cube complexes with abelian
fundamental group. Using the genus, we obtain a new proof that the fundamental group
of a special cube complex is either free abelian or surjects onto a non-cyclic free group.
We also investigate automorphisms of special cube complexes, and give a new geometric
proof that the Torelli subgroup for a right-angled Artin group is torsion-free.

1. Introduction
Non-positively curved (NPC) cube complexes were introduced by Gromov [10] as a
large source of easily constructible examples of locally CAT(0) spaces. These spaces are
built by identifying Euclidean n-cubes [−1, 1]n along their faces by isometries, subject to
certain local combinatorial conditions. Recently, NPC cube complexes have come into
prominence in geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology through their rôle in
Agol’s solution [1] to the virtually Haken and virtually fibered conjecture for hyperbolic
three-manifolds. More generally, NPC cube complexes naturally arise when one considers
(relatively) hyperbolic groups which can be built up from the trivial group by iterated
amalgamation over (relatively) quasi-convex subgroups ([21], [1], [2]).
Haglund and Wise [11] introduced a restricted class of cube complexes called special
cube complexes. Special groups, or groups which arise as fundamental groups of finitedimensional special cube complexes, are known to enjoy many nice properties; in particular,
when the cube complex is compact, they embed in SL(n, Z) and are residually torsion-free
nilpotent [11]. The latter implies moreover that such groups are indicable, i.e. they surject
onto Z. Both of the above stated properties are consequences of the fact that fundamental
groups of compact special cube complexes embed into right-angled Artin groups (raags).
Raags are in some sense the prototypical examples of compact special groups, and are
characterized by having presentations in which any two generators either commute or
generate F2 .
Let G be a special group. In this paper we will be interested in how the abelianization
H1 (G) determines the geometry of a special cube complex X with π1 (X) ∼
= G. It was shown
by Wise [21] (see also Koberda–Suciu [14]) that special groups which are not virtually
abelian are large; they have finite index subgroups which surject onto the non-abelian free
group F2 . In particular, the rank of H1 grows at least linearly after passing to finite index
subgroups. Wise further asked ([21], pg. 143) whether any special group is either abelian

or surjects onto a non-cyclic free group. Our main theorem answers this question in the
affirmative
Theorem 1.1. Let G be the fundamental group of a finite dimensional special cube complex.
Then either G is abelian or surjects onto F2 .
Theorem 1.1 was originally proved by Antolı́n and Minasyan [3] who, using different
methods, showed that any subgroup of a (finitely or infinitely generated) right-angled
Artin group is either abelian or surjects onto F2 . In our proof, we introduce an invariant of
special cube complexes which we call the genus. This definition has a classical motivation,
namely the original combinatorial genus of a surface due to Betti and Poincaré [16]: The
genus of a closed surface Σ is the maximal number of disjoint non-separating simple closed
curves whose union does not disconnect Σ. Analogously, if X is special then g(X) is defined
to be the number of pairwise disjoint, non-separating hyperplanes whose union does not
disconnect X. We extend this definition to special groups by defining g(G) to be the
maximum genus over all X with π1 (X) = G (cf. §3). Clearly if g(G) = n then G = π1 (X)
surjects onto Fn . The geometric analogue of Theorem 1.1 characterizes low values of the
genus explicitly:
Theorem 1.2. Let X be special and finite dimensional. Then
(1) g(X) = 0 if and only if X is CAT(0).
(2) g(X) = 1 if and only if π1 (X) is abelian.
(3) If Σg denotes the closed orientable surface of genus g, then g(π1 (Σg )) = g.
In particular, the classical definition of genus agrees with ours. The geometric content
of this theorem is that if G is special and not abelian, and X is any special cube complex
with π1 (X) = G, there exists a map of cube complexes X → S 1 ∨ S 1 . We remark that
for a general group G a notion related to the genus is the corank, i.e. the largest rank of
a free group onto which G surjects. If G = π1 (M ) for some smooth manifold M , then the
corank is the same as the cut number, the largest number of disjointly embedded, 2-sided
hypersurfaces in M whose union does not separate. This follows from the fact that the
wedge of n circles is a K(Fn , 1). Thus the genus of a special group G gives a lower bound
for the corank. It would be interesting to know whether the genus is always equal to the
corank.
In the second half of the paper we investigate automorphisms of special groups and the
action of the automorphisms of a cube complex on first homology. There are two parts
to this problem: (1) which automorphisms of G can be realized as an automorphism of
X, a compact cube complex with π1 (X) = G, and (2) when does an automorphism of X
act non-trivially on H1 (X) = H1 (G). Denote by Aut(G) the group of automorphisms of
G, Out(G) the group of outer automorphisms of G, and I(G) ≤ Out(G) the subgroup of
automorphisms acting trivially on H1 (G).
The motivation for answering these questions comes from classical results on Riemann
surfaces and free groups. Let Σ = Σg be a surface of genus g ≥ 2, and denote by Mod(Σ)
its mapping class group, i.e. the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of Σ up
to homotopy. The Dehn–Nielsen–Baer theorem identifies Mod(Σ) as an index 2 subgroup

AUTOMORPHISMS AND HOMOLOGY OF NON-POSITIVELY CURVED CUBE COMPLEXES

of Out(π1 (Σ)). If φ ∈ Mod(Σ) has finite order, it is a classical result that there exists a
hyperbolic surface X diffeomorphic to Σ and an isometry f : X → X which realizes the
homotopy class of φ (see for example, [9]). This fact can be used to show that the Torelli
subgroup I(π1 (Σ)) is torsion-free, by showing that any isometry of a constant curvature
surface acts non-trivially on first homology. The theorem reduces an algebraic question
about subgroups of the mapping class groups to a geometric question about isometries of
a compact surface.
Similarly, for free groups, Culler [7], Zimmermann [22], and Khramtsov [13] each independently showed that any finite order automorphism φ ∈ Out(Fn ) can be realized as
an automorphism of a simplicial graph Γ of rank n . An easy geometric argument then
recovers the result of Baumslag-Taylor that I(Fn ) is torsion-free for all n [4].
Recently, for each raag AΓ , Charney, Stambaugh and Vogtmann [5] defined a contractible
simplicial complex KΓ on which a subgroup of Out(AΓ ) acts properly discontinuously,
cocompactly by simplicial automorphisms. Their space is defined in analogy with outer
space for free groups, and if AΓ = Fn , KΓ is just the spine of outer space. Using KΓ , we
show
Theorem 1.3. Let φ ∈ Out(AΓ ) have finite order. Then φ acts non-trivially on H1 (AΓ ).
In particular, I(AΓ ) is torsion-free.
This theorem is originally due to Wade [19], and independently Toinet [18], who proved
the stronger result that the Torelli subgroup associated to Out(AΓ ) is residually torsion-free
nilpotent. However, both these proofs are almost entirely algebraic, while ours is geometric
in the same spirit as those outlined for mapping class groups and free groups above. To
prove Theorem 1.3, we first realize φ as a finite order automorphism of a compact special
cube complex X whose fundamental group is AΓ , then prove that any such automorphism
acts non-trivially on H1 (X) = H1 (AΓ ).
We also include a realization result for automorphisms of special groups which are δhyperbolic, and the following result about large groups which is elementary but which we
nevertheless could not find in the literature.
Theorem 1.4. Suppose G surjects onto F2 and let φ ∈ Out(G) have finite order. Then
there exists a finite index normal subgroup N E G and an outer automorphism ψ ∈ Out(N )
such that ψ acts non-trivially on H1 (N ) and ψ∗ = φ∗ ◦ι∗ , where ι : N → G is the inclusion.
Rephrased in terms of spaces, if X is a K(G, 1) and φ ∈ Out(G) we can represent φ as
b → X, a
a homotopy equivalence f : X → X. Then there exists a finite regular cover p : X

Outline: In section 2, we discuss basic facts and terminology concerning NPC cube complexes, hyperplanes, and cohomology. This is where we introduce one of our main technical
tools, namely collapsing hyperplanes. In section 3, we define the genus of a special cube
complex, compute the genus for several examples of groups, and prove Theorem 1.2. In
section 4, we discuss automorphisms of cube complexes, and determine a criterion which

guarantees that any automorphism acts non-trivially on first homology. We also give a
proof of Theorem 1.4 and some of its applications. Finally, in section 5 we review the
construction of Charney–Stambaugh–Vogtmann’s outer space for raags and apply the criterion of section 4 to blow-ups of Salvettis to prove Theorem 1.3.

2. Hyperplanes and cohomology
Let X be a non-positively curved (NPC) cube complex. X is a path-metric space obtained by gluing together standard Euclidean cubes of the form [−1, 1]n by identifying faces
by isometries. For us, X will always be finite dimensional. Recall that NPC means the
e of X is a CAT(0) cube complex, and is equivalent to Gromov’s condition
universal cover X
that the link of each vertex is a flag simplicial complex [20]. If x ∈ X (0) denote the link of
x by lk(x).
We recall that a midcube of a cube C = [−1, 1]n is a subset of C obtained by restricting
one of the coordinates to 0. A hyperplane of X is a maximal connected subset of X which
meets each cube in a midcube. Hyperplanes are important subsets of cube complexes and
will play a key role in what follows. If H ⊂ X and r > 0, we will use the notation Nr (H)
to denote the open r-neighborhood of H, and Nr (H) to denote the closed r-neighborhood.
e comes equipped with both a CAT(0) metric and a combinatorial
The universal cover X
metric defined on its 0-skeleton, where the distance between two vertices is the number of
e is a path in the 1-skeleton
hyperplanes which separate them. A combinatorial geodesic in X
e
of X which crosses each hyperplane at most once (see [20]). A combinatorial geodesic in
X is a path in the 1-skeleton of X which lifts to a combinatorial geodesic in X.
Definition 2.1. A map of cube complexes f : X → Y is called a local isometry if the
following two conditions hold:
(1) For every x ∈ X (0) , the map f : lk(x) → lk(f (x)) is injective.
(2) If u, v ∈ lk(x)(0) and f (u) and f (v) are adjacent in lk(f (x)), then u and v are
adjacent in lk(x).
Local isometries lift to convex embeddings of universal covers:
Lemma 2.2. ([20], Lemma 3.12 ) If f : X → Y is a local isometry, then the induced map
e → Ye is a convex embedding of CAT(0) spaces. In particular,
on universal covers fe : X
f∗ : π1 (X) ,→ π1 (Y ) is an injection.
2.1. Special cube complexes. Recall that X is called special if X is NPC and that none
of the following hyperplane pathologies occur in X:
(1) One-sided hyperplanes,

AUTOMORPHISMS AND HOMOLOGY OF NON-POSITIVELY CURVED CUBE COMPLEXES

5

(2) Self-intersecting hyperplanes,
(3) (Directly) Self-osculating hyperplanes,
(4) Interosculating hyperplanes.
For more details, see [11] and [20]. In particular, for any hyperplane H ⊂ X, conditions
(1) and (2) imply that a -neighborhood N (H) of H is isometric to a product H × [−, ]
for some  > 0 ( = 1/2 will do). Choosing an orientation on H we can consistently orient
the 1-cubes dual to a midcube of H. We say that two oriented 1-cubes e and e0 are parallel
if they are dual to the same hyperplane with the same orientation, denoted eke0 . We use
square brackets [e] to designate the equivalence class of oriented edges parallel to e.
In the sequel, we will often cut open cube complexes along hyperplanes and consider the
resulting cube complex. Define X split along H to be the complex X|H defined as follows.
X \ N1 (H) is a closed subcomplex of X, hence is compact special ([11], Corollary 3.9) .
There are natural inclusions ι+ , ι− : H → X \ N1 (H). Note that it may be the case that
X = H × S1 in which case ι+ = ι− . Then define
a
a

X|H = H × [0, 2]
X \ N1 (H)
H × [3, 5]/ H × {2} ∼ ι− (H), H × {3} ∼ ι+ (H) .
We denote by H − the image of H × {0} and by H + the image of H × {5} under this
construction.
Definition 2.3. A finitely generated group G is (NPC) cubulated if G = π1 (X) for
some compact NPC cube complex X. We say further that G is compact special if X is
compact special.
The prototypical examples of compact special groups are right-angled Artin groups
(raags), defined as follows.
Definition 2.4. Let Γ = (V, E) be a finite simplicial graph. If V = {v1 , . . . , vn }, the
right-angled Artin group AΓ associated to Γ is the group with presentation



AΓ = v1 , . . . vn [vi , vj ], if vi , vj share and edge in Γ .
To each raag AΓ is associated a canonical NPC compact special cube complex called the
Salvetti complex SΓ . The Salvetti complex has the following cell structure:
(1)

• SΓ : Take a wedge of n circles, one for each vertex v1 , . . . , vn ∈ V .
(2)
• SΓ : For each edge (vi , vj ) ∈ E, attach a square [−1, 1]2 along vi vj vi−1 vj−1 . Its
(2)

image is a torus T2 ⊆ SΓ .
(k)
• SΓ : For each complete k-subgraph K of Γ, attach a k-cube [−1, 1]k by identifying
(k−1)
its boundary with the k-many (k − 1)-tori in SΓ
corresponding to complete
(k − 1)-subgraphs of K.
In fact, Salvetti complexes are universal receptors for compact special cube complexes:
Theorem 2.5. ([20], Theorem 4.4.) Let X be compact special. Then there is a Salvetti
complex SX and a local isometry fX : X → SX .
Corollary 2.6. Every compact special group is the subgroup of a raag.

6

COREY BREGMAN

The corollary follows directly from Lemma 2.2 above. The Salvetti complex SX arises
from the raag with defining graph Γ(X) equal to the crossing graph of X: the vertices of
Γ(X) are in bijection with the hyperplanes of X, and there is an edge between two vertices
if their corresponding hyperplanes cross.
2.2. Collapsing separating hyperplanes.
Definition 2.7. A hyperplane H is separating if X \ H has more than one connected
component. Otherwise, H is non-separating.
If H is separating then N1 (H) ∼
= H × [−1, 1]. We will now describe a way of collapsing
X along these product neighborhoods to obtain a NPC cube complex with no separating
hyperplanes. We first learned of the technique of collapsing hyperplanes in [5] and then
adapted it to our setting.
Definition 2.8. Let H ⊂ X be a separating hyperplane, and N1 (H) be its closed unit
neighborhood. We define the collapse X/H of X along H to be the cube complex
obtained by the identification X H = X/{(x, t) ∼ (x, s)} where (x, t), (x, s) ∈ N1 (H) ∼
=
H × [−1, 1]. Let π : X → X/H denote the quotient map.
Proposition 2.9. If X is special and H is separating, then the collapse X/H is special.
Proof. The fact N1 (H) ∼
= H × [−1, 1] implies that X/H has a cube complex structure.
First we check that X/H is NPC. For this it suffices to check the Gromov link condition
at each vertex. If a vertex does not meet N1 (H) then its link passes isometrically to the
quotient, hence the link condition is still satisfied. If a vertex v0 lies in N1 (H), then in the
quotient v0 is identified with exactly one other vertex v1 which lies at the other end of an
edge dual to H. Call e the edge joining v0 and v1 .
Denote the link of v0 by lk(v0 ), and the full subcomplex of lk(v0 ) generated by cubes
other than e which meet N1 (H) by lkH (v0 ). Finally denote the full subcomplex generated
by cubes in lk(v0 ) other than e by lke (v0 ). We similarly obtain complexes lk(v1 ), lkH (v1 )
and lke (v1 ). Note that lkH (vi ) are exactly the edges in link of vi which lie on the boundary
of a cube containing e, for i = 0, 1. If m is the midpoint of e, then m is a vertex of H and
lk(m) ∼
= lkH (v0 ) ∼
= lkH (v1 ). Since H is NPC, kH (vi ) is a flag simplicial complex, and hence
a full subcomplex of lk(vi ) and lke (vi ). There are no monogons in the quotient because H
does not self-intersect, and there are no bigons because X is NPC. Thus, in the quotient
the link`of the vertex corresponding to the equivalence class of v0 , v1 can be described as
lke (v0 ) lke (v1 ) identified along lkH (v0 ) ∼
= lkH (v1 ). This is flag because it is made from
two flag complexes glued along a full subcomplex.
No one-sided hyperplanes: Let ±[eH ] denote the equivalence class of parallel edges in
X which are dual to H. Then in the quotient this class vanishes, and all other classes are
preserved. Suppose the e|| − e in X/H. Then e, −e are dual to some hyperplane K and
there is a path γ between the endpoints of e lying entirely within N1 (K) \ K. Let H0 be
the image of H under the collapse π : X → X/H. Any path which meets H0 has a lift
to X, since the pre-image of any segment I lying in H0 is a rectangle I × [−1, 1]. Thus,

AUTOMORPHISMS AND HOMOLOGY OF NON-POSITIVELY CURVED CUBE COMPLEXES

7

π −1 (K) is not 2-sided.
No self-intersection: Suppose K is a hyperplane in X which intersects itself in X/H.
Then there are two squares in X with edges e, e0 dual to K connected by an edge e0 ∈ [eH ].
Then these two squares are opposite faces of a cube C containing e0 as a dual edge, and
e, e0 extend to C to intersect in C. Thus K intersected itself in X.
No self-osculation: Suppose K is a hyperplane in X which self-osculates in X/H. Then
there are two edges e, e0 in X dual to K, and lying on opposite sides of an edge e0 dual
to H. If H and K do not intersect, then H is not separating. If they do intersect, then
the fact that X is special implies that they meet in a square in X. Since it is not possible
for K to self-intersect or self-osculate, there is a single square bounded on parallel sides
by edges dual to K and on the other by H. It follows that after collapsing H, K does not
self-osculate in the quotient.
No interosculation: Suppose K1 and K2 are hyperplanes of X which interosculate in
the quotient. Note that as in the case of no-self-intersection, it is not possible for K1 and
K2 to intersect in the quotient if they did not in X. Thus, K1 and K2 cross in X, and
there are a pair of edges e1 and e2 , dual to K1 and K2 respectively, which lie at either ends
of an edge e0 dual to H. There are three cases, depending on whether or not K1 and K2
intersect or osculate H in X. If both K1 and K2 osculate H, then H does not separate.
If exactly one of K1 and K2 intersects H, say K1 , then K1 and H cross in a square with
boundary e0 and e1 . Then K1 and K2 interosculate in X, or they cross in a square at the
other end of e0 . It follows that under the collapse, no interosculation occurs. In the case
where all three intersect, then in X there is a 3-cube containing e0 , e1 and e2 and hence
π(K1 ) and π(K2 ) cross in X/H.
Since none of the four hyperplane pathologies can occur in the quotient, X/H is NPC and
special.

Remark 2.10. Note that if K and H separate X then π(K) still separates in X/H.
Definition 2.11. A special cube complex X is called irreducible if it has no separating
hyperplanes. Otherwise X is reducible.
Proposition 2.12. Every compact special cube complex X is homotopy equivalent to an
irreducible compact special cube complex.
Proof. An easy application of van-Kampen’s theorem shows that collapsing separating
hyperplanes in Proposition 2.9 induces an isomorphism on π1 . Since both X and the
quotient are NPC, they are each K(π1 , 1)’s, hence homotopy equivalent. By compactness,
there are only finitely many separating hyperplanes, and by Remark 2.10, we can collapse
them in order.

2.3. The cohomology group H 1 (X). Let X be an NPC cube complex and suppose that
every hyperplane is embedded and two-sided. If H is non-separating, then H defines a

8

COREY BREGMAN

surjection φH : π1 (X) → Z as follows. First, choose an orientation on 1-cubes dual to H.
This is possible since H is two-sided. For each 1-cube e ∈ X define φf
H (e) to be the signed
intersection of e with H and extend to 1-chains C1 (X) by linearity. To see that φf
H is a
cocycle, observe that the signed sum around any square, again by two-sidedness of H, is
0. Since H is non-separating, there exists a cycle in X (1) which meets H exactly once with
positive orientation. For any α ∈ H1 (X), we define the intersection product α.H = φH (α).
Combining the above observation with Proposition 2.9 we can characterize exactly when
a special cube complex is CAT(0):
Corollary 2.13. Suppose X is connected and special. Then the following are equivalent
(1) X is CAT(0).
(2) H1 (X) = 0.
(3) Every hyperplane is separating.
Proof. If X is CAT(0) then π1 (X) is trivial and hence H1 (X) is as well. If X has a
non-separating hyperplane then by the observation H 1 (X) is non-trivial. Finally, suppose
every hyperplane is separating. Any compact subset K ⊂ X is contained in the closed unit
neighborhoods of only finitely many hyperplanes hence Proposition 2.9 and Remark 2.10
imply that K can be collapsed to a point. In particular, π1 (X) is trivial and hence X is
CAT(0).

As a final corollary, we have the following curious observation about quasiconvex hierarchies for hyperbolic special groups.
Corollary 2.14. If G is δ-hyperbolic and G = π1 (X) for some compact special cube complex, then G has a quasiconvex hierarchy consisting only of HNN-extensions.
Proof. Let H be a non-separating hyperplane. Then π1 (H) is quasiconvex in G, and
G∼
= π1 (X|H)∗π1 (H) . Now collapse separating hyperplanes in X|H and repeat. Note that
+
H and H − are separating in X/H. Eventually we will end up with a complex which only
has separating hyperplanes, since the total number of cubes decreases every time we split
along hyperplanes and collapse.

3. The genus of a special group
As we saw in the previous section, each non-separating hyperplane of a special cube
complex X contributes a free factor to H 1 (X), but in general these free factors may not
be distinct. For example, if K1 and K2 are two disjoint non-separating hyperplanes such
that K1 ∪ K2 separates X, then every homology class which meets K1 also meets K2 and
with the same algebraic intersection, hence φK1 = φK2 . Based on this observation we have
the following
Definition 3.1. Let X be special. The genus g(X) is the maximum number of disjoint
hyperplanes in X whose union does not separate. If no maximum exists we say g(X) = ∞.
If Γ is the fundamental group of a special cube complex, we define the genus
g(Γ) = sup{g(X) : X is special and π1 (X) = Γ}.

AUTOMORPHISMS AND HOMOLOGY OF NON-POSITIVELY CURVED CUBE COMPLEXES

The definition is motivated by the classical definition genus of compact surface: namely,
the largest number of disjoint simple closed curves whose union does not disconnect the
surface. The next proposition lists some properties of the genus.
Proposition 3.2. Let X be a special cube complex (resp. special group). The genus enjoys
the following properties:
(1) g(X) ≤ rk(H1 (X)). In particular, g(X) is finite whenever X is compact (resp.
finitely generated).
(2) g(X) = 0 if and only if X is CAT(0) (resp. X = {1}).
Proof. Let X be a special cube complex. If K1 and K2 are disjoint and do not separate,
there are homology classes γ1 and γ2 in H1 (X) such that Ki .γj = δij for i, j = 1, 2. Hence
the Ki correspond to distinct free factors of H1 (X). This proves (1). Property (2) follows
directly from Corollary 2.13.

We calculate the genus of some basic examples of special groups:
Example 3.3. g(Fn ) = n. Take the standard rose Rn as a cube complex with π1 = Fn .
Then g(Rn ) = 1 and property (1) implies this is best possible. In fact, any graph with
π1 = Fn works.
Example 3.4. g(Zn ) = 1. This follows from the fact that if g(Γ) = n then Γ surjects onto
Fn .
Example 3.5. g(π1 (Σg )) = g, where Σg is the closed surface of genus g. Note that
this is not entirely obvious from the definition, since there may well be high-dimensional
cube complexes with the same fundamental group as Σg . We observe, however, that if
K1 , . . . , Kn are disjoint hyperplanes of X, then φKi ∪ φKj = 0 ∈ H 2 (X) for all i, j. Hence,
the φKi span a Lagrangian subspace of H 1 (X) = H 1 (Σg ). The maximal possible dimension
of such a subspace is of course g, and it is not hard to construct explicit 2-D cube complex
structures on Σg which realize this maximum.
Definition 3.6. Hyperplanes K and L are called parallel if K and L do not meet.
Theorem 3.7. Let X be compact special. Then g(X) = 1 if and only if π1 (X) = Zn .
Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume X is irreducible by Proposition 2.12,
since collapsing separating hyperplanes does not change the genus. Let K be a hyperplane
of X. Since X has genus one, we know that if L is any hyperplane parallel to K, then
K ∪ L separates. The idea is to imitate the proof of Proposition 2.9 by collapsing all
hyperplanes parallel to K, while maintaining non-positive curvature and specialness. Define
an equivalence relation on hyperplanes as follows. K ∼ L if K and L are parallel. As
defined, this is just a symmetric relation, but we will consider the equivalence relation ∼∗
that it generates and say that if K ∼∗ L then K and L are ultra-parallel. If K and L are
ultra-parallel and X has genus one, then every minimal combinatorial loop which meets
K once also meets L once. Moreover, we note that if K and L are ultra-parallel but not
parallel, then K and L intersect.

Let K1 , . . . , Km be the set of hyperplanes other than H which are ultra-parallel to H.
We want to show that result of collapsing all of K1 , . . . , Km is NPC and special. We remark
that it may be the case that some subset of collapses fails to be special. The important
point is that the full collapse is special and homotopy equivalent to X. First we need a
lemma which implies that we can collapse hyperplanes at all.
Lemma 3.8. If K, L ⊂ X are distinct parallel hyperplanes, then N1 (K) ∼
= K × [−1, 1] and
∼
N1 (L) = L × [−1, 1].
Proof. The lemma is symmetric in K and L. If N1 (K) is not embedded, then K ∪ L does
not separate.

From the lemma, if L is a hyperplane in an ultra-parallelism class [H], H 6= L, we know
that N1 (L) is embedded. A slight issue arises when we repeatedly collapse hyperplanes.
Namely, if we collapse all the hyperplanes in [H] which are actually parallel to L, then
N1 (L) ceases to be embedded. However, by the next lemma, we can always collapse in
such a way that every hyperplane neighborhood is embedded.
Lemma 3.9. Given an equivalence class [H] with |[H]| ≥ 2, there always exists a sequence of collapses in which, at each stage, the remaining hyperplanes have embedded unit
neighborhoods.
Proof. Given a collection of hyperplanes H in X, let ∆(H) be the graph obtained in
the following way. The vertices of ∆(H) will be the elements of H, and two vertices are
connected if their corresponding hyperplanes are disjoint. If H = [H] is an ultra-parallelism
class, then ∆([H]) is connected. Suppose X 0 is obtained from X by collapsing a hyperplane
L and let [H]0 be the image of [H] in X 0 . Observe that ∆([H]0 ) can be obtained from ∆([H])
by deleting the vertex corresponding to L, and all of its incident edges. In particular, if
L∈
/ [H], then ∆([H]) = ∆([H]0 ).
The lemma, translated in terms of ∆([H]), states that there is a sequence of vertex
deletions such that, at each stage the complement is connected. The latter follows by
induction and the well-known graph theoretic result that a connected graph always has at
least two vertices which are not cut vertices, i.e. they do not disconnect the graph.

From the two previous lemmas, we know that if [H] is an ultra-parallelism class, we
can find H ∈ [H] and an ordering of the hyperplanes K1 , . . . , Km ∈ [H] \ {H} such that
when we collapse each Ki in order, the result at each stage will be an NPC cube complex
homotopy equivalent to X. We remark that as before, two hyperplanes cannot cross in
the quotient if they did not originally. The proof that in the quotient every hyperplane is
two-sided and that no hyperplane self-intersects is exactly the same as above, and we do
not need the hypothesis that X has genus one. The next lemma implies no self-osculation
occurs in the quotient.
Lemma 3.10. Fix an ultra-parallelism class [H] which has cardinality at least 2. Then for
all L ∈ [H], and for every two vertices v1 and v2 in N1 (L) lying on the same side of L,
there does not exist a combinatorial geodesic from v1 to v2 which crosses some edge dual
to a hyperplane parallel to L.

AUTOMORPHISMS AND HOMOLOGY OF NON-POSITIVELY CURVED CUBE COMPLEXES

Proof. We claim that either g(X) ≥ 2 or no such path exists for any L ∈ [H]. Define S to
be the set of combinatorial geodesics γ such that there exists some L ∈ [H] and satisfying
(1) γ does not cross L
(2) The endpoints of γ lie on the same side of some hyperplane L
(3) γ crosses some hyperplane K parallel to L
We will show that if g(X) = 1 then S is empty, by induction on a least length counterexample. For reasons of parity, we consider two base cases, when the length l(γ) = 1 and
l(γ) = 2. Let v1 and v2 be the endpoints of γ. If l(γ) = 1 then by condition (3), the single
hyperplane K which γ crosses must be parallel to L. Hence, we can complete γ to a loop
γ 0 by adding a path between v1 and v2 in N1 (L) which meets K exactly once. Since L is
non-separating, we conclude that g(X) ≥ 2, a contradiction. If l(γ) = 2, then γ crosses
two hyperplanes K1 and K2 . If K1 6= K2 , then as in the previous case, since one of K1
and K2 is parallel to L, we conclude that g(X) ≥ 2. If K1 = K2 , then K1 is parallel to L
and we must consider the orientations with which γ crosses K1 . If γ crosses K1 with the
same orientation each time, then we again conclude that g(X) ≥ 2. If, on the other hand,
γ crosses K1 first with one orientation, then the opposite we invoke the fact that K1 does
not directly self-osculate to conclude that γ backtracks, and hence is not a combinatorial
geodesic.
Now suppose γ is a least length counterexample of length n ≥ 3 occurring along a hyperplane L ∈ [H]. Let v1 and v2 be the endpoints of γ. Then γ crosses a sequence of edges
dual to hyperplanes Ki11 , . . . , Kirr , where j = ±1 depending on the orientation with which
γ crosses Kij .
Claim 1: L is parallel to Ki1 .
Otherwise, by no interosculation, there is a square with corner v1 where Ki1 and L cross.
Then both endpoints of the first edge e1 of γ lie in N1 (L). Writing γ = e1 γ 0 , we see that
γ 0 is a shorter length counterexample.
Claim 2: γ crosses Ki1 algebraically (i.e. counted with sign) 0 times.
If not, then we can complete γ to a loop γ 0 as above, which crosses Ki1 algebraically nonzero times and crosses L geometrically 0 times. Since L is assumed non-separating, we
conclude that g(X) ≥ 2, a contradiction.
At this point, we can assume that γ must cross Ki1 algebraically 0 times. If we consider
the sequence of crossings we can find an innermost pair with opposite sign, i.e. a subpath
e1 αe2 ⊂ γ such that e1 and e2 are both dual to Ki1 but with opposite orientation, and such
that α does not cross Ki1 . Clearly α is not empty, otherwise γ would have backtracking.
We claim that either γ is not a combinatorial geodesic, or α is a shorter length counterexample. If α crosses some hyperplane parallel to Ki1 then α ∈ S, since it connects two
vertices on the same side Ki1 , is a combinatorial geodesic since it is a subpath of γ and
satisfies l(α) ≤ l(γ)−2. It is therefore a shorter element of S, contradicting our assumption
on γ. Otherwise, Ki1 meets every hyperplane crossed by α. In this case however, we can

12

COREY BREGMAN

replace γ by a combinatorially isotopic path with backtracking. To see this, consider the
first edge f1 of α. By no interosculation we can find a square C bounded at a corner by
e1 and f1 . We therefore replace e1 α by α0 = f10 e01 α00 , where e01 and f10 are the opposite
edges of C, and α00 is the remainder of α after f1 . Continuing in this way, we replace e1 αe2
by α0 e0 e0 , where e0 is dual to Ki1 . Since γ was isotopic to a path with backtracking, we
conclude that γ was not combinatorially geodesic, contradicting our assumption. Therefore
S is empty, as desired.

No self-osculation: Suppose that a hyperplane L directly self-osculates after collapsing
some collection of the Ki . Then there is a path γ consisting of edges dual to some subcollection K1 , . . . , Km , which connects two vertices lying on the same side of N1 (L). If L
intersects each of K1 , . . . , Km , then no self-osculation occurs in the quotient. Otherwise,
L is parallel to some Kj . But then Lemma 3.10 implies that this is impossible.
At this point we have checked that after collapsing each of the Ki , the resulting space
immerses in a Salvetti complex. For a local isometry, we need to further check that no
interosculation occurs.
No interosculation: By the remark about intersecting hyperplanes above, we need only
consider the case where hyperplanes L1 and L2 intersect in X and osculate in the quotient.
In this case there is a path γ dual to hyperplanes K1 , . . . , Km which are ultra-parallel to
H1 and edges f1 and f2 dual to L1 and L2 , respectively at either end of γ. Moreover, L1
and L2 meet in some other square. If at least one of L1 and L2 intersects all of the Ki , then
by no interosculation of X, after collapsing there is a square containing f1 and f2 . Finally,
we have the case where both L1 and L2 are parallel to one of the Ki . There are three cases
depending on which sides of L1 and L2 that γ connects. See Figure 1 for a schematic. Note
that in this case all hyperplanes have embedded closed unit neighborhoods.
At most one of L1 and L2 is the chosen hyperplane H1 . In the case that neither L1
nor L2 is H1 then L1 and L2 are both eventually collapsed and no interosculation occurs
in the quotient. Then assume that L1 = H1 . In either case (1), (2), or (3) we find that
no interosculation occurs in the quotient and either H1 directly self-osculates, which we
have already shown is impossible, or H1 indirectly osculates which does not contradict
specialness of the quotient.
Let X 0 denote the result of collapsing all hyperplanes ultra-parallel to H, this is still
NPC by Lemma 3.9. To see that X 0 has genus one, note that if H is the set of hyperplanes
of X, then H \ {Ki } is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of hyperplanes of X 0 and
that if L1 ∈
/ {Ki } and L2 ∈
/ {Ki } are disjoint and separate X, then their images under the
collapse are disjoint and separate X 0 . In X 0 , the image of H meets every other hyperplane.
To finish the proof, we proceed as follows. Choose some ultra-parallelism class [H]. If [H]
is a singleton, then H meets every hyperplane of X and we don’t do anything. If |[H]| ≥ 2,
then by Lemma 3.9 we can find H ∈ [H] such that if K1 , . . . , Km are hyperplanes ultraparallel to H, we can collapse the Ki in some order such that the resulting cube complex

X 0 is NPC special, has genus one, and every hyperplane of X 0 meets the image of H.
Now choose another ultra-parallelism class and repeat. Since X has only finitely many
hyperplanes, in the end we obtain a special cube complex Y homotopy equivalent to X
with the property that any two hyperplanes meet. It follows that the corresponding Salvetti
SY is a torus, and hence π1 (X) = π1 (Y ) ≤ Zn for some n, by Lemma 2.5. In fact, since Y
is compact, the map fY : Y → SY is a surjective, combinatorial local isometry, hence must
be a finite covering.

Remark 3.11. If X is non-compact but has finitely many hyperplanes, the same proof as
above works. However, it may be the case that the quotient complex Y is non-compact.
Then the characteristic map fY : Y → SY will be a surjective, combinatorial local isometry,
but all we can conclude is that it is a covering map. Thus the image of π1 (Y ) ,→ π1 (SY ) ∼
=
Zn may be a subgroup of infinite index.
As an immediate corollary we obtain:
Corollary 3.12. If Γ is non-abelian then every compact special cube complex with π1 (X) =
Γ satisfies g(X) ≥ 2.
We can extend this result to the finite-dimensional case to give a proof of Theorem 1.1:
Corollary 3.13. If X is special and finite-dimensional then either π1 (X) is abelian or
surjects onto F2 .
Proof. The compact case follows from Theorem 3.7 . In the non-compact case, we observe that if there are infinitely many non-separating hyperplanes, then since X is finitedimensional there are infinitely many disjoint non-separating hyperplanes. Take a loop γ
which meets some non-separating hyperplane exactly once. Then γ only intersects finitely
many non-separating hyperplanes. Thus we must have at least two disjoint non-separating
hyperplanes whose union does not disconnect X and g(X) ≥ 2. Otherwise, there are only
finitely many non-separating hyperplanes and if g(X) = 1, we can apply the procedure of
Theorem 3.7 to these hyperplanes. We obtain a homotopy equivalent special cube complex
Y in which all non-separating hyperplanes meet.
Suppose γ1 and γ2 are two loops in the 1-skeleton Y (1) based a point p ∈ Y . Choose a
compact subcomplex K containing γ1 ∪ γ2 . By collapsing all the separating hyperplanes
which meet K, we get a complex Y 0 homotopy equivalent to Y , and in which the images
γ10 and γ20 , of γ1 and γ2 respectively, only cross non-separating hyperplanes. Since the
non-separating hyperplanes of Y 0 all cross we conclude that the homotopy classes [γ10 ] and
[γ20 ] commute in π1 (Y 0 ). We conclude that π1 (Y ) = π1 (X) is abelian.

The characterization of genus 1 special groups also has some immediate corollaries for
groups with genus ≥ 2.
Corollary 3.14. Let Γ be a non-abelian special group. Then
(1) rk(H1 (Γ)) ≥ 2.
(2) Γ retracts onto F2 .
(3) The rank of H1 grows at least linearly in finite index subgroups.

AUTOMORPHISMS AND HOMOLOGY OF NON-POSITIVELY CURVED CUBE COMPLEXES

15

(4) The growth of finite index subgroups in Γ is at least superexponential ( nen log(n)−n )
in index.
Moreover, if Γ is not virtually abelian but is virtually special, (3) and (4) still hold.
Proof. Statements (1) and (2) follow from Corollary 3.13 and the fact that any surjection
onto a free group splits. Statements (3) and (4) follow from the corresponding result for
F2 . The growth of finite index subgroups in a free group is due to Hall [12].

Note that from (2) we get a quick proof of the Tits alternative for virtually special groups:
either Γ contains a non-abelian free group, or it is virtually abelian. The genus also restricts
which groups can arise as fundamental groups of special cube complexes. Recall that if
Σg is the closed surface of genus g, the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of
Σg is denoted Diff+ (Σg ). The mapping class group Modg is defined to be π0 (Diff+ (Σg )),
the group of connected components of Diff+ (Σg ). Thus, two diffeomorphisms are identified
if they are isotopic. The abelianization map π1 (Σg ) → Z2g induces a surjective map
Modg → Sp2g (Z). We say φ ∈ Modg has full rank if the action of φ on H1 (Σg ) has finite
quotient.
A theorem of Thurston and Nielsen states that every mapping class φ ∈ Modg falls into
one of three categories: finite order, reducible, or pseudo-Anosov (see [9], Theorem 13.2).
Reducible means that φ has a lift to Diff+ which fixes some 1-submanifold. Pseudo-Anosov
means that φ does not preserve any conjugacy class in π1 (Σg ). Finite order and reducible
are not mutually exclusive, but both are disjoint from pseudo-Anosov. Thurston showed
that if φ is pseudo-Anosov, then the mapping torus Mφ corresponding to any lift of φ to
Diff+ supports a constant curvature-(–1) Riemannian metric. This construction provides
many examples of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
Corollary 3.15. If Γ is any one of the following, then Γ is virtually compact special but
not compact special:
(1) virtually abelian but not abelian.
(2) the fundamental group of a hyperbolic QHS3 .
(3) π1 (Mφ ) where φ is pseudo-Anosov and has full rank.
Proof.

(1) If Γ is virtually abelian and compact special then it does not contain F2 ,
hence g(Γ) = 1. Theorem 3.7 then implies that Γ ∼
= Zn for some n.
(2) Results of Agol ([1], Theorems 1.1 and 9.3) imply that every closed hyperbolic
3-manifold group is virtually compact special. A hyperbolic rational homology 3sphere has rk(H1 ) = 0, hence cannot be compact special. We remark that it was
already known that rk(H1 ) ≥ 1 for compact special cube complexes.
(3) A straightforward application of Mayer-Vietoris shows that rk(H1 (Mφ )) = 1. Thurston’s
theorem and Agol’s theorem show that π1 (Mφ ) is virtually compact special, but
obviously π1 (Mφ ) contains F2 and hence is not virtually abelian.

4. Automorphisms of special cube complexes
In this section we investigate the action of cube complex automorphisms on homology.
Our starting point comes from two well-known examples:
(1) Every non-identity torsion element of Out(Fn ) acts nontrivially on H1 (Fn ).
(2) Every non-identity torsion element of Modg acts nontrivially on H1 (Σg ).
Observe that both Fn and π1 (Σg ) are compact special. This motivates the following
Question 4.1. Suppose Γ is compact special. Does every non-identity finite order element
of Out(Γ) act non-trivially on H1 (Γ)?
The first step is to ensure that H1 (Γ) is non-trivial, but as we have seen, this is satisfied as
soon as Γ 6= 1. We do not propose to answer this question fully here, but we will generalize
the results above to cubulated hyperbolic and right-angled Artin groups. Our strategy will
be two-fold. First, realize elements of Out(Γ) as automorphisms of compact special cube
complexes with fundamental group Γ. Second, use the geometry of the compact special
cube complex to show certain automorphisms act non-trivially on homology. A question
closely related to the one above is thus
Question 4.2. When does an automorphism of a compact special cube complex X act
non-trivially on H1 (X)?
Since there are compact CAT(0) cube complexes with arbitrarily large (finite) automorphism groups, the answer to this question is not, in general, “Always.” Nevertheless,
we will provide circumstances under which every automorphism acts non-trivially on first
homology.
4.1. A criterion for non-triviality. The following proposition gives a useful criterion to
guarantee that every automorphism acts non-trivially on H1 (X).
Proposition 4.3. Let X is compact special f : X → X is an automorphism. Suppose X
satisfies the following three conditions for hyperplanes K1 and K2
(1) If K1 ∩ K2 6= ∅, there exists α ∈ H1 (X) such that α.K1 6= α.K2 .
(2) If K1 ∩ K2 = ∅ and K1 ∪ K2 separate X, every component of X \ (K1 ∪ K2 ) contains
a non-separating hyperplane which does not meet K1 or K2 .
(3) If f (K1 ) = K1 for all K1 then f is the identity.
Then if f acts trivially on H1 (X), f is the identity.
Proof. Let f : X → X be an automorphism and suppose f∗ : H1 (X) → H1 (X) is the
identity. Assume for contradiction that f is not the identity. The order of f is finite,
and by passing to a power we may assume it is a prime p. By condition (1) we know
that for any hyperplane K0 , the image f (K0 ) does not meet K0 transversely, or else f∗
would not be the identity. Then for every hyperplane K0 , we have that f (K0 ) ∩ K0 = ∅
or f (K0 ) = K0 . Note that it is not possible for every hyperplane to be mapped to itself
setwise without being the identity. Therefore, either f = idX and we are done or there
exists some hyperplane K0 such that f (K0 ) ∩ K0 = ∅.

AUTOMORPHISMS AND HOMOLOGY OF NON-POSITIVELY CURVED CUBE COMPLEXES

17

As we observed, the images K0 = f 0 (K0 ), K1 = f (K0 ), . . . , Kp−1 = f p−1 (K0 ) are all
disjoint and f permutes the components of X\∪p−1
i=0 N1 (Ki ). We can assume that every cycle
which meets K0 algebraically non-trivially also meets each Ki with the same intersection.
In particular, since K0 is non-separating, there is a cycle which meets K0 geometrically
once. We conclude that any pair Ki , Kj with 0 ≤ i 6= j ≤ p − 1 separate X. We may also
assume, after reordering and passing to a power, that for each i, 0 ≤ i ≤ p − 1, one of the
components of X \ (Ki ∪ Ki+1 ) does not contain any Kj , where j 6= i, i + 1 and Kp = K0 .
For if Kj lies in some component Y of X \ (Ki ∪ Ki+1 ), then it does not meet Ki or Ki+1
and it must separate Ki from Ki+1 . Otherwise there is a path in X which meets all of the
Ki except Kj geometrically once. Then we can assume that the Ki are permuted in order,
and that one component of X \ (Ki ∪ Ki+1 ) does not contain any other Kj .
By condition (2), we know that each component of X \ (Ki ∪ Ki+1 ) contains a nonseparating hyperplane which does not meet Ki or Ki+1 . Choose one such hyperplane Li
in the component of X \ (Ki ∪ Ki+1 ) which does not contain any other Kj . Then since Li
does not meet the Ki or Ki+1 , it is a hyperplane of X proper. Since it does not separate,
there is a non-trivial cycle αi contained in this component satisfying αi .Li = 1. Then by
naturality of the Kronecker pairing
1 = αi .Li = φLi (αi ) = f ∗ (φLi )(f∗ (αi )) = φf (Li ) (αi ) = αi .f (Li ) = 0.
This contradiction implies that f takes every hyperplane to itself, hence must be the
identity by condition (3).

4.2. Passing to covers. Even if we cannot guarantee that every automorphism acts nontrivially on H1 (X), in some cases it may be possible to pass to a cover and lift our automorphism so that it acts non-trivially on the homology of the cover. In fact, this is always the
case. The result follows from the next proposition, which although not difficult to prove,
does not seem to appear anywhere in the literature. We record it here for posterity.
Proposition 4.4. Let G any finitely generated group which surjects onto F2 , and let φ ∈
Out(G) have finite order. If φ∗ is the induced map on the abelianization H1 (G), then there
exists a finite index normal subgroup N E G and an induced outer automorphism φb of N
such that φb∗ does not act trivially on H1 (N ).
Remark 4.5. Informally, if G is large, any finite order outer automorphism acts non-trivially
on the abelianization of some finite index subgroup.
Proof. Let π : G → F2 be a surjection. Since G is finitely generated, H1 (G) is a finitely
generated abelian group say with first Betti number b1 . Choose d >> b1 and find some
finite-index normal subgroup K 0 < F2 such that rk(H1 (K)) = d. Then K = π −1 (K 0 )
is normal and of finite index in G. Finally let f be a lift of φ to Aut(G) and define
N = K ∩ · · · f n−1 (K) where n is the order of φ. It follows that f (N ) = N , hence f induces
an automorphism fb : N → N . We claim that after postcomposing f with congjugation by
an element of G, the induced map fb not act trivially on H1 (N ).
This is just a straightforward application of the transfer homomorphism. If fb∗ acts nontrivially on H1 (N ), we are done. Otherwise, by the transfer, since rk(H1 (N )) = d > b1 ,

18

COREY BREGMAN

there exists g ∈ G such that conjugation by g acts non-trivially on H1 (N ). Denote by cg
the automorphism of N induced by conjugation by g. Then fb0 = cg ◦ fb acts non-trivially
on H1 (N ). Note that fb0 also has finite order. Setting φb = [fb0 ] ∈ Out(N ) finishes the
proof.

Corollary 4.6. Suppose G is finitely generated and virtually compact special. Then any
finite order outer automorphism of G has a lift which acts non-trivially on the abelianization
of some finite index subgroup.
Proof. If G is not virtually abelian, then G virtually surjects onto F2 and the result follows
by Proposition 4.4. If G is virtually abelian, then G contains Zn as a finite index normal
subgroup, for some n. In this case it is not hard to show that rk(H1 (G)) < n. Thus the
same proof as in Proposition 4.4 works here, too.

In fact, when G is δ-hyperbolic we can say a little more. Let X be a compact NPC cube
complex with Γ = π1 (X) δ-hyperbolic. By Theorem 1.1. of [1], X is virtually compact
special. Note that the center Z(Γ) is trivial. Let φ : Γ → Γ be a finite-order outer
automorphism of Γ. From the exact sequence
1 → Γ → Aut(Γ) → Out(Γ) → 1,
we can consider the extension given by pulling back the subgroup hφi:
1 → Γ → Eφ → hφi → 1.
Since Γ is cubulated hyperbolic, Eφ is virtually cubulated hyperbolic. Hence by Lemma
7.15 of [20], we obtain a proper cocompact action of Eφ on a CAT(0) cube complex Ye .
Since Γ is torsion-free, the action of Γ < Eφ on Ye is free. We therefore obtain a quotient
Y with π1 (Y ) ∼
= Γ, and a finite order automorphism f : Y → Y corresponding to φ. We
have just proven
Proposition 4.7. If Γ is cubulated and hyperbolic, every finite order element of Out(Γ)
can be realized as an automorphism of an NPC cube complex Y with π1 (Y ) = Γ.
Example 4.8. Let K be an amphichiral knot such as the figure 8. If M = S3 \K is the knot
complement then there is an orientation-preserving involution σ : M → M , induced by the
amphichirality. If T ⊂ M is a boundary parallel torus, then σ|T 2 is just the hyperelliptic
involution on T 2 . In particular, σ sends every slope p/q to −p/ − q. Let Mp/q be the result
of p/q-surgery on K. Since Mp/q = M−p/−q , the action of σ on M extends to an involution
σ
b : Mp/q → Mp/q . If K is hyperbolic (e.g. the figure 8 knot), then a theorem of Thurston
states that for all but finitely many slopes Mp/q will be hyperbolic. Taking p = 1, a MayerVietoris computation implies that M1/q will be an integral homology sphere, and will also
be hyperbolic for infinitely many q. Then σ
b is an automorphism of π1 (M1/q ) which is not
inner since it has finite order, and non-trivial since it inverts the meridian and longitude of
the knot. Moreover, as σ
b is orientation-preserving, σ
b∗ : H∗ (M1/q ) → H∗ (M1/q ) is actually
the identity.

This construction gives infinitely many ZHS3 ’s whose fundamental groups have nontrivial outer automorphism groups. By Agol’s theorem, all of these virtually compact
special, implying that Corollary 4.6 is best possible.
5. Applications to right-angled Artin groups
In the next two sections we present applications of the results of the previous section
to automorphisms of cubulated groups. The first concerns automorphisms of right-angled
Artin groups.
Let Γ = (V, E) be a finite simplicial graph, with vertex set V and edge set E, and let AΓ
be the associated right-angled Artin group. If V = {v1 , . . . , vn } then V ± = {v1± , . . . , vn± }
is a generating set for AΓ with the standard presentation, and the abelianization of AΓ is
n
∼ n
Aab
Γ = Z . The abelianization map ψ : AΓ → Z induces Ψ : Aut(AΓ ) → Gln (Z) and we
obtain short exact sequences
Ψ

1 → IA(AΓ ) → Aut(AΓ ) −
→ Gln (Z)
Ψ

→ Gln (Z).
1 → I(AΓ ) → Out(AΓ ) −
The kernel I(AΓ ) = ker Ψ (resp. IA(AΓ ) = ker Ψ) is called the Torelli subgroup of Out(AΓ )
(resp. Aut(AΓ )). IA(AΓ ) and I(AΓ ) are further related by the short exact sequence
1 → Inn(AΓ ) → IA(AΓ ) → I(AΓ ) → 1
where Inn(AΓ ) ∼
= AΓ /Z(AΓ ) is the group of inner automorphisms of AΓ .
The main goal of this section is to prove
Theorem 5.1. (Wade [19], Toinet [18] ) I(AΓ ) is torsion-free for all Γ.
Here we present a geometric proof of this theorem using NPC cube complexes and the
machinery developed in the previous section. Before discussing the strategy of the proof,
we list some immediate corollaries.
Corollary 5.2. IA(AΓ ) is torsion-free.
Corollary 5.3. (Charney–Vogtmann [6]) Out(AΓ ) and Aut(AΓ ) are both virtually torsionfree. In particular, each have finite virtual cohomological dimension.
Both of these corollaries are straightforward consequences of the exact sequences above,
Theorem 5.4 below, and Selberg’s lemma. We will prove the theorem in two steps. We
assume for contradiction that φ ∈ I(AΓ ) is torsion. Then
(1) Realize φ as an automorphism f : X → X of some NPC cube complex X with
π1 (X) = AΓ . This means in particular that the induced map f∗ = φ as an automorphism of π1 (X).
(2) Show that for any such X, every automorphism acts non-trivially on H1 (X).
To carry out Step (1), we will make use of a contractible simplicial complex KΓ on which
I(AΓ ) acts. For Step (2), we will verify the criterion of Proposition 4.3 for certain NPC
cube complexes.

5.1. Automorphisms of Raags. For each v ∈ V we define two subsets of V :
lk(v) = {w ∈ V |w is adjacent to v}
st(v) = {v} ∪ lk(v).
Following [5], the relation lk(v) ≤ st(w) for v, w ∈ V will be denoted v ≤ w. In this case
we say w dominates v. If v ≤ w and w ≤ v then we write v ∼ w, in which case v and w
are said to be equivalent.
Laurence [15] and Servatius [17] proved that the following four types of automorphisms
generate Aut(AΓ ):
(1) Inversions: If v ∈ V ± , the automorphism iv sends v 7→ v −1 and fixing all other
generators.
(2) Graph Automorphism: Any automorphism of Γ induces a permutation of V ± which
extends to an automorphism of AΓ .
(3) Transvections: If v ≤ w, the automorphism τw,v sends v 7→ vw and fixes all other
generators.
(4) Partial Conjugations: If C is a connected component of Γ \ st(v) for some v ∈ V ,
the automorphism σv,C maps w 7→ vwv −1 for every w ∈ C, and acts as the identity
elsewhere.
If, in (3), v and w are adjacent, τw,v is called an adjacent transvection. Otherwise, τw,v
is called a non-adjacent transvection. As in [8] and [5], we distinguish the subgroup of
long-range automorphisms Out` (AΓ ) ⊆ Out(AΓ ) (resp. Aut` (AΓ ) ⊆ Aut(AΓ )) generated
by automorphisms of type (1), (2), (4) and non-adjacent transvections.
5.2. The Out` -spine KΓ . Recall the definition of the standard Salvetti complex S = SΓ
associated to AΓ . S is the cube complex constructed as follows. Start with a single vertex
x0 . For every v ∈ Γ, attach both ends of a 1-cube ev to x0 . For every complete k-subgraph
of Γ, we add in a k-cube C whose image is a k-torus with 1-skeleton the edges labelled by
elements in the subgraph. S is an NPC cube complex whose fundamental group is AΓ . In
particular, S is a K(AΓ , 1).
In [5], Charney, Stambaugh and Vogtmann constructed a contractible simplicial complex
KΓ on which Out` (AΓ ) acts properly discontinuously cocompactly by simplicial automorphisms. Like outer space for free groups, one considers pairs (X, ρ), where X is an NPC
cube complex with fundamental group AΓ , and ρ is a homotopy equivalence ρ : X → S.
The pair (X, ρ) is called a marked blow-up of a Salvetti complex. Construction of such cube
complexes will be described below. An automorphism φ ∈ Out` (AΓ ) acts on (X, ρ) ∈ KΓ
by changing the marking: Represent φ as a homotopy equivalence h : S → S. Then
φ.(X, ρ) = (X, h ◦ ρ). We have
Theorem 5.4. ([5], Propositions 4.17, Theorem 5.24) KΓ is contractible and the action
of Out` (AΓ ) on KΓ is properly discontinuous.
See [5] for details on the construction of KΓ . For us, what will be important is that it is
contractible, finite dimensional, and admits a properly discontinuous action of Out` (AΓ ).

5.3. The Torelli Subgroup for a Raag. Day has shown in [8] that IA(AΓ ) is generated
by automorphisms of the following two forms:
(1) (Partial Conjugation) Let v ∈ V ± be a generator, and C 6= ∅ a component of
Γ \ st(v). Then σv,C : AΓ → AΓ denotes the automorphism
σv,C :w →
7 vwv −1 , w ∈ C ± ;
w→
7 w, else.
(2) (Commutator Transvection) Let v, w1 , w2 ∈ V ± such that w1 , w2 both dominate v,
i.e. lk(v) ⊂ lk(w1 ), lk(w2 ). Then there are non-adjacent transvections of v by w1
and w2 , and we can therefore transvect v by the commutator [w1 , w2 ].
τw1 ,w2 ,v : AΓ → AΓ denotes the automorphism
τw1 ,w2 ,v :w →
7 [w1 , w2 ]w, w = v;
w→
7 w, else.
We remark that in case (1), if Γ \ st(v) is connected, then σv,C is just conjugation by v.
From this generating set, it is clear that IA(AΓ ) ≤ Aut` (AΓ ), since partial conjugations lie
in Aut` (AΓ ) by definition, and in order for the transvection in case (2) to be non-trivial, we
must have that v, w1 and w2 are pairwise non-adjacent. Passing to the outer automorphism
group, we obtain I(AΓ ) ≤ Out` (AΓ ).
Since I(AΓ ) ≤ Out` (AΓ ), it follows that I(AΓ ) acts on KΓ by simplicial automorphisms.
Suppose φ ∈ I(AΓ ) has finite order. Without loss we may assume the order is prime. KΓ
is finite-dimensional and by Theorem 5.4 it is contractible, hence the action of φ on KΓ has
a fixed point. The fixed point (X, ρ) ∈ KΓ corresponds to a marked blow-up of a Salvetti
complex. By the definition of KΓ , this means that φ is realized as an automorphism
f : X → X which commutes with the marking ρ up to homotopy. Further, as φ ∈ I(AΓ ),
we know that the induced map f∗ : H1 (X) → H1 (X) is the identity map. This will be the
starting point for our investigation. We want to show that f itself must be the identity.
We record the preceding discussion in
Proposition 5.5. Let φ ∈ I(AΓ ) have prime order. Then φ is realized as an automorphism
f : X → X of some marked blow-up X of a Salvetti complex.
5.4. Blow-ups of Salvetti complexes. At this point, we have realized torsion elements
of I(AΓ ) as automorphisms of cube complexes which act trivially on first homology. In
order to show that I(AΓ ) is torsion-free, it suffices to show that any automorphism of
a blow-up X acts non-trivially on H1 (X). To do this, we will show that every blow-up
satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition 4.3.
Generalizing Whitehead partitions for free groups, Charney, Stambaugh, and Vogtmann
define automorphisms of AΓ which they call Γ-Whitehead partitions. The reason for using a
generating set consisting of Γ-Whitehead automorphisms instead of the standard generating
set is that each Γ-Whitehead automorphism can be achieved by an expansion and collapse
of a Salvetti complex for AΓ .

Definition 5.6. ([5], Definition 2.1) Let P ⊂ V ± have at least 2 elements, including some
m ∈ P with m−1 ∈
/ P . Then (P, m) is a Γ-Whitehead pair if
(1) no element of P is adjacent to m,
(2) if v ∈ P and v −1 ∈
/ P then v ≤ m,
(3) if v ± ∈ P , then w± ∈ P for every w in the same component of Γ \ st(m) as v.
A Γ-Whitehead pair (P, m) defines an automorphism φ = φ(P,m) defined by
 −1

The pair (P, m) also defines several important subsets of V ±
double(P ) = {v ∈ P |v ± ∈ P }
single(P ) = {v ∈ P |v −1 ∈
/ P}
max(P ) = {v ∈ single(P )|v ∼ m}
lk(P ) = lk(m)±
The automorphism φ is clearly a product of an inversion of m, a transvection of elements
of elements of single(P ) and a partial conjugation of elements of double(P ), hence φ ∈
Out` (AΓ ). Conversely, it is easy to see that Out` (AΓ ) is generated by all Γ-Whitehead
automorphisms together with inversions and graph automorphisms. Note that each φ(P,m)
has order 2.
Condition (1) in the definition implies that P ∩ lk(P ) = ∅. The other side of P , denoted
P ∗ , is the complement of P ∪ lk(P ) in V ± . (P ∗ , m−1 ) is also a Γ-Whitehead pair which
defines the same outer automorphism of AΓ . We therefore obtain a disjoint union
V ± = P ∪ lk(P ) ∪ P ∗ .
Definition 5.7. ([5], Definition 2.4) The triple P = {P, lk(P ), P ∗ } is called a Γ-Whitehead
partition of V ± . P and P ∗ are the sides of P.
Definition 5.8. ([5], Definition 3.3) Let P = {P, lk(P ), P ∗ } and Q = {Q, lk(Q), Q∗ } be
two Γ-Whitehead partitions.
(1) P, Q commute if max(P ), max(Q) are distinct and commute.
(2) P, Q are compatible if either they commute or at least one of P ∩ Q, P ∗ ∩ Q,
P ∩ Q∗ or P ∗ ∩ Q∗ is empty.
It is shown in [5] that if P, Q are compatible and do not commute, exactly one of the
intersections is empty. A collection Π = {P1 , . . . , Pk } is called compatible if the Pi are
pairwise compatible. A region of Π is choice of side Pi× ∈ {Pi , Pi∗ } for each i, such that
for any i, j, either Pi and Pj commute, or Pi× ∩ Pj× 6= ∅.

We are now in a position to build the blow-up SΠ associated to Π. First we will
construct a contractible complex EΠ containing all the vertices of SΠ . To each region
R = P1× ∩ · · · ∩ Pk× we associate a vertex xR = (a1 , . . . , ak ) of the k-cube [0, 1]k via

0 if Pi× = Pi
ai =
1 if Pi× = Pi∗
(0)

Now we attach edges to EΠ . If R and R0 are two regions which differ exactly by
switching sides along a single partition Pi , we attach an edge ePi from xR to xR0 . The edge
ePi is oriented from the region containing Pi to the region containing Pi∗ . The rest of EΠ
is formed by filling in cubes where their boundaries occur.
We complete the construction of SΠ by attaching cubes to EΠ , starting with the 1-cubes.
×
Set P i = Pi× ∪ lk(Pi ). For each region R, define a subset V ±
×

×

I(R) = P 1 ∩ · · · ∩ P k .
Compatibility implies each I(R) is non-empty, and Lemma 3.10 (1) of [5] states that ever
v ∈ V ± occurs in some I(R). If v ± ∈ I(R), attach both vertices of an edge ev at xR .
Suppose v ∈ I(R) and v −1 ∈
/ I(R), and v is a single in Pi×1 , . . . , Pi×r . By Lemma 3.10 (2) of
[5], there is a region Rv obtained from R by switching sides along the Pi×j , and v −1 ∈ I(Rv ).
In this case we therefore attach an edge ev from xR to xRv . Note that ev−1 = ev .
Every edge of (SΠ )(1) carries a label which is either some generator v ∈ V ± or some
partition Pi . Two edges el1 , el2 have commuting labels if one of the following holds
(1) l1 = v ∈ V ± , l2 = w ∈ V ± and v, w are distinct an commute in AΓ ,
(2) l1 = v ∈ V ± , l2 = Pi and v ∈ lk(Pi ),
(3) l1 = Pi , l2 = Pj and Pi , Pj are distinct and commute.
With commuting labels defined as above, any collection of k edges with commuting
labels at a vertex xR forms the corner of the 1-skeleton of a k-cube in (SΠ )(1) , with parallel
edges carrying the same label ([5], Corollary 3.12). To finish the construction of SΠ , we
fill in all such k-cubes where they occur. SΠ is called the blow-up of SΓ along Π. We have
Theorem 5.9. ([5], Theorem 3.14) SΠ is connected, locally CAT(0) and π1 (SΠ ) ∼
= AΓ .
Definition 5.10. After crossing an edge ev labelled by a generator v ∈ V , there is a path
(1)
in EΠ connecting the two endpoints of ev . This path crosses edges labelled by every
partition containing v as a singleton. We call such a path a characteristic loop γv .
5.5. Automorphisms of blow-ups.
Proposition 5.11. Every blow-up X satifies the hypotheses of Proposition 4.3.
Proof. Without loss of generality, X = SΠ is a blow-up of the standard Salvetti, hence
comes equipped with some labeling of the 1-skeleton by generators v1 , . . . , vn ∈ V or
partitions P1 , . . . , Pk ∈ Π. The hyperplanes of X are in one-to-one correspondence with
these labels, so we check them one by one. To this end, let l1 and l2 be labels with
corresponding hyperplanes Kl1 , Kl2 .

24

COREY BREGMAN

Kl1 ∩ Kl2 6= ∅: Observe that Kl1 , Kl2 intersect if and only if their corresponding labels commute. Consider a square bounded on by edges e1 and e2 dual to Kl1 and Kl2 ,
respectively. Each edge ei can be completed to a characteristic loop γi as follows. If
li = v is a generator, then take a characteristic loop γv . If li = P is a partition, choose
some m ∈ max(P ), and complete this to a characteristic loop γm . Next observe that since
lk(l1 ) ⊂ st(l) for every label l occurring on γ1 , l2 commutes with every such l, and similarly
for γ2 and l1 . It follows that γ1 ⊆ Kl2 and γ2 ⊆ Kl1 . Thus, γi .Klj = δij and this case is
satisfied.
Kl1 ∩Kl2 = ∅ and Kl1 ∪Kl2 separates: Since EΠ contains all of the vertices of SΓ , it is easy
to see that if the li both correspond to generators, then Kl1 ∪ Kl2 cannot separate. Thus
the only possibilities for pairs of separating hyperplanes are one generator, one partition
or two partitions.
First suppose l1 = v and l2 = P . We know that KP disconnects EΠ into two components, corresponding to vertices which contain P and those which contain P ∗ . If Kv ∪ KP
separate, then we must have v ∈ single(P ), and in fact {v} = single(P ) = max(P ). Then
(P, v) is one of the Γ-Whitehead partitions in Π. By assumption, this partition is nondegenerate; hence there must be w1± ∈ double(P ) and w2± ∈ double(P ∗ ). The hyperplanes
corresponding to w1 and w2 do not separate there respective components.
Now assume l1 = P and l2 = Q. Then P and Q are compatible and do not commute,
hence without loss of generality we have P ⊂ Q and Q∗ ⊂ P ∗ by Lemma 3.4 of [5]. Then
P ∗ ∩ Q 6= ∅. In EΠ , deleting KP and KQ leaves three components E1 , E2 and E3 whose
vertices correspond to regions containing P ∩ Q, P ∗ ∩ Q, and P ∗ ∩ Q∗ , respectively. Elements of single(P ) \ single(Q) connect E1 and E2 , elements of single(Q) \ single(P )
connect E2 and E3 , while elements of single(P ) ∩ single(Q) connect E1 and E3 . If
max(Q) 6= max(P ) then KP ∪ KQ does not separate. Then if max(P ) = max(Q), the only
way KP ∪ KQ separates is if actually single(P ) = single(Q). As P ∗ ∩ Q 6= ∅ we must have
that double(Q) 6= double(P ), or else P = Q, which is impossible. Then the component containing E2 has a non-separating hyperplane labeled by some w± ∈ double(Q) \ double(P ).
If single(P ) is not a single element, then the hyperplane corresponding to any element
of single(P ) does not disconnect the component containing E1 ∪ E3 . Otherwise, {m} =
max(P ) = single(P ) = single(Q) is a single generator. In this case, since (P, m) is
non-trivial, there exists v ± ∈ double(P ), and the hyperplane Kv does not separate the
component containing E1 ∪ E3 .
Finally, to see that condition (3) of Proposition 4.3 is satisfied, observe that for each
maximal collection of pairwise commuting hyperplanes, there is a unique cube in which
they all meet. If f : X → X is an automorphism which preserves every hyperplane, f
must fix each of these cubes pointwise. Since the union of these cubes covers X, f is the
identity. This completes the proof.

Corollary 5.12. Every automorphism of a blow-up a Salvetti acts nontrivially on H1 .
We are now in a position to finish off the proof of Theorem 5.1:
Proof: Suppose for contradiction there exists φ 6= 1 ∈ I(AΓ ) such that φn = 1. Passing
to a power, we may assume n is prime. By Proposition 5.5, there exists a blow-up of a

Salvetti X and an automorphism f : X → X such that f∗ = φ ∈ Out(AΓ ). Corollary
5.12 now implies that if f acts trivially on H1 (X), f is the identity. Hence, φ = 1, a
contradiction.
