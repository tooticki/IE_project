Abstract. The main results in this note concern the characterization of the length
of continua 1 (Theorems 2.5) and the parametrization of continua with finite length
(Theorem 4.4). Using these results we give two independent and relatively elementary
proofs of Gołąb’s semicontinuity theorem.
Keywords: continua with finite length, Hausdorff measure, Gołąb’s semicontinuity
theorem.

1. Introduction
Let F be the class of all continua K contained in Rd , endowed with the Hausdorff
distance. A classical result due to S. Gołąb (see [8], Section 3, or [6], Theorem 3.18)
states that the length, that is, the function K 7→ H 1 (K), is lower semicontinuous
on F . Variants of this semicontinuity result, together with well-known compactness
properties of F , play a key role in the proofs of several existence results in the
Calculus of Variations, from optimal networks [9] to image segmentation [2] and quasistatic evolution of fractures [3]. In particular, Gołąb’s theorem has been extended to
general metric spaces in [1], Theorem 4.4.17, and [9], Theorem 3.3.2
It should be noted that none of the proofs of Gołąb’s theorem mentioned above is
completely elementary. On the other hand, the counterpart of this result for paths,
namely that the length of a path γ : [0, 1] → X is lower semicontinuous with respect to
the pointwise convergence of paths, is elementary and almost trivial. This sharp contrast is due to the fact that the definitions of length of a path and of one-dimensional
Hausdorff measure of a set are utterly different, even though they aim to describe
(essentially) the same geometric quantity. More precisely, the length of a path, being
defined as a supremum of finite sums which are clearly continuous, is naturally lower
semicontinuous, while the definition of Hausdorff measure is based on Caratheodory’s
construction, and is designed to achieve σ-subadditivity, not semicontinuity.
In this note we point out a couple of relations/similarities between the onedimensional Hausdorff measure of continua and the length of paths, which we then
† Compared to the published version, we have added two pictures, corrected the proof of
Lemma 2.22 and a few small mistakes, and modified the definition of δ-partition in Subsection 2.7,
in order to make the statement of Proposition 2.8 stronger (consequently, we have also modified
Lemma 2.18).
1 As usual, a continuum is a connected compact metric space (or subset of a metric space), and
the length of a set is its one-dimensional Hausdorff measure H 1 .
2 The proof in [1] is actually incomplete; the missing steps were given in [9].

use to give two independent (and relatively elementary) proofs of Gołąb’s theorem.
We think, however, that these results are interesting in their own right.
Firstly, in Theorem 2.5 we show that for every continuum X there holds
X

1
H (X) = sup
diam(Ei ) ,
i

where the supremum is taken over all finite families {Ei } of disjoint connected subsets
of X. (Note the resemblance with the definition of length of a path.)
Secondly, in Theorem 4.4 we show that every continuum X with finite length
admits some sort of canonical parametrization; more precisely, there exists a path
γ : I → X with length equal 2 H 1 (X) which “goes through almost every point of X
twice, once moving in a direction, and once moving in the opposite direction”, the
precise statement requires some technical definitions and is postponed to Section 4.
This paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 4 contain the two results mentioned above (Theorems 2.5 and 4.4) and the corresponding proofs of Gołąb’s theorem. Section 3 contains a review of some basic facts about paths with finite length in
a metric space which are used in Section 4, and can be skipped by the expert reader.
This review is self-contained and limited in scope; a more detailed presentation of
the theory of paths with finite length in metric spaces can be found in [1], Chapter 4,
while continua with finite length have been studied in detail in [4] (see also [7]).
Since the results described in this paper are rather elementary (in particular Theorem 2.5), we strove to keep the exposition self-contained, and avoid in particular the
use of advanced results from Geometric Measure Theory. On the other hand, proofs
are sometimes just sketched, with all steps clearly indicated but many details left to
the reader.
2. A characterization of length
The main results in this section are the characterizations of the length of sets
with countably many connected components (and in particular of continua) given in
Theorem 2.5 and Proposition 2.8. Using the former result we give our first proof of
Gołąb’s theorem (Theorem 2.9).
2.1. Notation. Through this paper X is a metric space endowed with the distance
d. Given x ∈ X and E, E 0 subsets of X we set:
B(x, r) closed ball with center x and radius r > 0;
diam(E) diameter of E, i.e., sup{d(x, x0 ) : x, x0 ∈ E};
dist(x, E) distance between x and E, i.e., inf{d(x, x0 ) : x0 ∈ E};
dist(E, E 0 ) distance between E and E 0 , i.e., inf{d(x, x0 ) : x ∈ E, x0 ∈ E 0 };3
dH (E, E 0 ) Hausdorff distance between E and E 0 , i.e., the infimum of all r ≥ 0 s.t.
dist(x, E 0 ) ≤ r for every x ∈ E and dist(x0 , E) ≤ r for every x0 ∈ E 0 ;
Lip(f ) Lipschitz constant of a map f between metric spaces;
|E| = L 1 (E), Lebesgue measure of a Borel set E contained in R.
2.2. Hausdorff measure. For every set E contained in X, the one-dimensional
Hausdorff measure of E is defined by
H 1 (E) := sup Hδ1 (E) = lim Hδ1 (E) ,
δ>0

δ→0

3 Since the infimum of the empty set is +∞, dist(E, E 0 ) = +∞ if either E or E 0 are empty.

the infimum being taken over all countable families {Ei } of subsets of X which cover
E and satisfy diam(Ei ) ≤ δ.
2.3. Remark. Among the many properties of H 1 we recall the following ones.
(i) H 1 is a σ-subadditive set function (that is, an outer measure on X) and is
σ-additive on Borel sets. Moreover H 1 agrees with the (outer) Lebesgue measure
L 1 when X = R.
(ii) Given a Lipschitz map f : X → Y , for every set E contained in X there holds
H 1 (f (E)) ≤ Lip(f ) H 1 (E).
(iii) If Hδ1 (E) = 0 for some δ ∈ (0, +∞] then H 1 (E) = 0.
2.4. The set function Lδ . For every δ ∈ (0, +∞] and every set E in X we define
X

Lδ (E) := sup
diam(Ei ) ,
i

where the supremum is taken over all finite, disjoint families {Ei } of continua contained in E with diam(Ei ) ≤ δ.
2.5. Theorem. Let E be a subset of X which is locally compact and has countably
many connected components.4 Then, for every δ ∈ (0, +∞],
H 1 (E) = Lδ (E) .

(2.1)

2.6. Remark. (i) The assumption that E has countably many connected components
cannot be dropped. Indeed Lδ (E) = 0 for every totally disconnected set E, and there
are examples of such sets with H 1 (E) > 0, even compact and contained in R.
(ii) Theorem 2.5, together with Lemma 2.11, implies the following
P weaker statement: for any set E as above, H 1 (E) agrees with the supremum of i diam(Ei ) over
all finite disjoint families {Ei } of connected subsets of E. Concerning this identity,
it is not clear if the assumption that E is locally compact can be weakened or even
removed. The role of compactness in our proof is briefly discussed in Remark 2.16.
1
P Using Theorem 2.5 we can actually show that H (E) can be approximated by
i diam(Ei ) using any partition of E made of connected subsets Ei with sufficiently
small diameters. For a precise statement we need the following definition.

2.7. δ-Partitions. Let E be a subset of X and let δ ∈ (0, +∞]. We say that a
countable family {Ei } of subsets of E is a δ-partition of E if the sets Ei are Borel,
connected, H 1 -essentially disjoint (i.e., H 1 (Ei ∩ Ej ) = 0 for every i 6= j), cover all
of E except a subset E 0 with H 1 (E 0 ) ≤ 0, and satisfy diam(Ei ) ≤ δ.
If E is locally compact, has finite length and countably many connected components, then Theorem 2.5 implies that there exist δ-partitions for every δ > 0.
4 A connected component of E is any element of the class of nonempty connected subsets of E

which is maximal with respect to inclusion; the connected components are closed in E, disjoint, and
cover E (for more details see [5], Chapter 6).

2.8. Proposition. Let E be a subset of X. Then every δ-partition {Ei } of E satisfies
X
X
H 1 (E) ≥
H 1 (Ei ) ≥
diam(Ei ) .
(2.2)

If in addition E is locally compact and has countably many connected components,
then for every m < H 1 (E) there exists δ0 > 0 such that every δ-partition {Ei } of E
with δ ≤ δ0 satisfies
X
diam(Ei ) ≥ m .
(2.3)
i

Using Theorem 2.5 we can also prove the following version of Gołąb’s theorem.
2.9. Theorem. For every m = 1, 2, . . . , let Fm be the class of all nonempty compact
subsets of X with at most m connected components. Then the function K 7→ H 1 (K)
is lower-semicontinuous on Fm endowed with the Hausdorff distance.
2.10. Remark. The statement of Gołąb’s theorem is often restricted to the case
m = 1, and in the metric setting reads as follows (cf. [1], Theorem 4.4.17): let be
given a sequence of continua Kn , contained in a complete metric space X, which
converge in the Hausdorff distance to some closed set K; then K is a continuum, and
lim inf H 1 (Kn ) ≥ H 1 (K). The assumption that X is complete is needed here to
ensure that the limit K is compact and connected, but not to prove the semicontinuity
of length.
The rest of this section is devoted to the proofs of Theorems 2.5 and 2.9, and Proposition 2.8. We begin with the proof of Theorem 2.5; the key estimate is contained in
Lemma 2.17.
2.11. Lemma. Let E be a connected set in X. Then H 1 (E) ≥ diam(E).
Proof. It suffices to prove that H 1 (E) ≥ d(x0 , x1 ) for every x0 , x1 ∈ E. Let indeed
f : X → R be the function defined by f (x) := d(x, x0 ). Then
H 1 (E) ≥ |f (E)| = diam(f (E)) ≥ |f (x1 ) − f (x0 )| = d(x1 , x0 ) ,
where the first inequality follows from Remark 2.3(ii) (and Lip(f ) = 1), while the first
equality follows from the fact that f (E) is an interval (because E is connected). 
2.12. Lemma. For every set E in X and δ > 0 there holds H 1 (E) ≥ Lδ (E).
Proof. Consider any family {Ei } as in the definition of Lδ (E): Lemma 2.11 yields
X
X
H 1 (E) ≥
H 1 (Ei ) ≥

and we obtain H

≥ Lδ (E) by taking the supremum over all {Ei }.



2.13. Lemma. Let E be a subsetPof X and let {Ei } be the family of all connected
components of E. Then Lδ (E) = i Lδ (Ei ) for every δ > 0.5
The proof of this lemma is straightforward, and we omit it.
5 The sum at the right-hand side of this equality is defined as the supremum of all finite subsums,
and is well defined even if the family {Ei } is uncountable.

2.14. Lemma. Let U be a nonempty compact set in X, and let F be a connected component of U . If F ∩ ∂U = ∅ then F is also a connected component of X. Accordingly,
if X is connected and F 6= X then F ∩ ∂U 6= ∅.
Proof. Let F be the family of all sets A such that F ⊂ A ⊂ U and A is open
and closed in U . Then F is closed by finite intersection, and F agrees with the
intersection of all A ∈ F (see [5], Theorem 6.1.23).
If F ∩ ∂U = ∅ then the intersection of the compact sets A ∩ ∂U with A ∈ F is
empty, which implies that A ∩ ∂U is empty for at least one A ∈ F .6 This means that
F is the intersection of all A ∈ F such that A ∩ ∂U = ∅. Note that these sets A are
open and closed in X, and then F is connected and agrees with the intersection of
a family of open and closed sets. This implies that F is a connected component of
X.

2.15. Corollary. Let E be a connected set in X, let B = B(x, r) be a ball with
center x ∈ E such that E ∩ B is compact and E \ B 6= ∅, and let F be the connected
component of E ∩ B that contains x. Then H 1 (B ∩ E) ≥ H 1 (F ) ≥ r.
Proof. By applying Lemma 2.14 with E and E ∩ B in place of X and U , we obtain
that F intersects ∂B. Then diam(F ) ≥ r, and Lemma 2.11 yields H 1 (F ) ≥ r.

2.16. Remark. The compactness assumptions in Lemma 2.14 and Corollary 2.15 are
both necessary. Indeed it is possible to construct a bounded connected set E in R2
and a ball B with center x ∈ E such that E \ B 6= ∅, but the connected component
F of E ∩ B that contains x consists just of the point x; in particular F ∩ ∂B = ∅,
and H 1 (F ) = 0.
2.17. Lemma. Let E be a set in X which is connected and locally compact. Then
Hδ1 (E) ≤ Lδ (E) for every δ > 0.
Proof. We can clearly assume that Lδ (E) is finite. We fix for the time being ε > 0,
and choose a finite disjoint family {Ei } of continua contained in E with diam(Ei ) ≤ δ
such that
X
diam(Ei ) ≥ Lδ (E) − ε .
(2.4)
i


Next we set
:= E \ ∪i Ei . Since the union of all Ei is closed and E is locally
compact, for every x ∈ E 0 we can find a ball B(x, r) with radius r ≤ δ/10 such that
E ∩ B(x, r) is compact and contained in E 0 . Using Vitali’s covering lemma (cf. [1],
Theorem 2.2.3), we can extract from this family of balls a subfamily of disjoint balls
Bj = B(xj , rj ) such that the balls Bj0 := B(xj , 5rj ) cover E 0 .
Then the balls Bj0 together with the sets Ei cover the set E, and since their diameters do not exceed δ, the definition of Hδ1 (E) yields
X

X
Hδ1 (E) ≤
diam(Ei ) +
diam(Bj0 ) ≤ Lδ (E) + 10

On the other hand, by Corollary 2.15, for every j we can find a closed, connected
set Fj contained in Bj ∩ E with diameter at least rj . Since the balls Bj are disjoint
and contained in E 0 , we have that the sets Fj together with the sets Ei form a disjoint

admits a finite subfamily with empty intersection.

definition of Lδ (E) and (2.4),
X

Lδ (E) ≥

which implies ε ≥ j rj . Hence (2.5) yields Hδ1 (E) ≤ Lδ (E) + 10 ε, and the proof is
complete because ε is arbitrary.

P

Proof of Theorem 2.5. By Lemma 2.12, it suffices to prove that
Lδ (E) ≥ H 1 (E) .

(2.6)

We assume first that E is connected. In this case Lemma 2.17 and the definition of
Lδ in Subsection 2.4 yield
Lδ (E) ≥ Lδ0 (E) ≥ Hδ10 (E) for every 0 < δ 0 ≤ δ,
and we obtain (2.6) by taking the limit as δ 0 → 0.
If E is not connected, then (2.6) holds for every connected component of E, and
we obtain that it holds for E as well using Lemma 2.13, the subadditivity of H 1 ,
and the fact that E has countably many connected components.

The next lemma is used in the proof of Proposition 2.8.
2.18. Lemma. Let F be a continuum in X, let {Ei } be a countable family of connected subsets of X, and let E 0 be the union of all Ei . Then
X
H 1 (F \ E 0 ) +
diam(Ei ) ≥ diam(F ) .
i

Proof. Take x0 , x1 ∈ F such that d(x0 , x1 ) = diam(F ), and let f : X → R be the
Lipschitz function given by f (x) := d(x, x0 ). Then
X
X
H 1 (F \ E 0 ) +
diam(Ei ) ≥ |f (F \ E 0 )| +
diam(f (Ei ))

= |f (F \ E )| +

X

|f (Ei )| ≥ |f (F )| ≥ diam(F ) ,

i

where the first inequality follows from the fact that Lip(f ) = 1, for the equality we
use that each f (Ei ) is an interval, for the second inequality we use that the sets f (Ei )
together with f (F \ E 0 ) cover f (F ), and the last inequality follows from the fact that
f (F ) is an interval that contains f (x0 ) = 0 and f (x1 ) = d(x0 , x1 ) = diam(F ).

Proof of Proposition 2.8. To prove (2.2) we use the definition of δ-partition and
estimate H 1 (Ei ) ≥ diam(Ei ) (see Lemma 2.11).
To prove the second part of the statement, we first choose δ1 > 0 such that
H 1 (E) > m + δ1 , and use Theorem 2.5 to find finitely many disjoint continua Fj
contained in E such that
X
diam(Fj ) ≥ m + δ1 .
(2.7)
j

Then we take δ0 with 0 < δ0 ≤ δ1 such that dist(Fj , Fk ) > δ0 for every j 6= k.
Consider now any δ-partition {Ei } of E with δ ≤ δ0 . Let E 0 be the union of all i.
For every j, let Ij the the collection of all indices i such that Ei intersects Fj , and

let Ej0 be the union of all Ei with i ∈ Ij . By the choice of δ0 the collections Ij are

and putting together (2.7), (2.8) and the fact that δ ≤ δ0 ≤ δ1 we obtain (2.3).



We now pass to the proof of Theorem 2.9.
2.19. δ-chains and δ-connected sets. Given δ > 0, a δ-chain in X is any finite
sequence of points {xi : i = 0, . . . , n} contained in X such that d(xi−1 , xi ) ≤ δ for
every i > 0. We call x0 and xn endpoints of the δ-chain, and we say that the δ-chain
connects x0 and xn . The length of the δ-chain is
length({xi }) :=

n
X

d(xi−1 , xi ) .

i=1

Finally, we say that a set E in X is δ-connected if every couple of points x, x0 ∈ E is
connected by a δ-chain contained in E.
2.20. Lemma. If E is a connected set in X then it is δ-connected for every δ > 0.
Proof. Fix x ∈ E and let Ax be the set of all points x0 ∈ E which are connected to
x by a δ-chain contained in E. We must show that Ax = E.
One easily checks that:
• Ax is closed in E and contains x;
• if x0 ∈ Ax then B(x0 , δ) ∩ E is contained in Ax ; thus Ax is open in E.
Since Ax is nonempty, open and closed in E, and E is connected, we conclude that
Ax = E, as desired.

2.21. Lemma. Let K be a compact set in X with at most m connected components,
which contains a δ-connected subset K 0 . Then
H 1 (K) ≥ diam(K 0 ) − mδ .

(2.9)

Proof. We can assume that m is finite. We then take x0 , x1 ∈ K 0 such that
` := d(x0 , x1 ) ≥ diam(K 0 ) − δ ,

(2.10)

and let H := f (K) where f : X → R is defined by f (x) := d(x, x0 ). It is easy to
check that:


(a) Lip(f ) = 1, and therefore H 1 (K) ≥ |H| ≥ ` − (0, `) \ H ;
(b) the sets f (K 0 ) and H contain 0 = f (x0 ) and ` = f (x1 );
(c) H has at most m connected components because so does K;
(d) the set f (K 0 ) is δ-connected because K 0 is δ-connected and Lip(f ) = 1.

8

G. Alberti, M. Ottolini

Statements (b) and (c) imply that the open set (0, `) \ H has at most m − 1 connected components, while statements (b) and (d) imply that each of these connected
components has length at most δ; in particular


(0, `) \ H  ≤ (m − 1)δ .
(2.11)
Using the estimate in (a), (2.10), and (2.11) we finally obtain (2.9).



2.22. Lemma. Let K be a compact set in X with at most m connected components,
let K 0 be a δ-connected subset of K, and let U be a closed set in X which contains
K 0 and satisfies
dist(K 0 , ∂U ) ≥ r
(2.12)
for some r > 0. 7 Then

δ
H 1 (K ∩ U ) ≥ 1 −
diam(K 0 ) − mδ .

(2.13)

Proof. We can clearly assume that both H 1 (K ∩ U ) and m are finite.
Let {Ki } be the collection of all connected components of K ∩ U that intersect K 0 ,
and let N be their number. We claim that N is finite, and more precisely
1
(2.14)
N ≤ m + H 1 (K ∩ U ) .
r
To prove this estimate, note that the components Ki which do not intersect ∂U are
also connected components of K (apply Lemma 2.14 with K, U ∩ K and Ki in place
of X and U and F , respectively), and therefore their number is at most m.
There are now two cases: either there are no components Ki that intersect ∂U ,8
and then N ≤ m, which implies (2.14), or there are components Ki that intersect
∂U . Since these components intersect also K 0 they satisfy
H 1 (Ki ) ≥ diam(Ki ) ≥ r
(use Lemma 2.11 and assumption (2.12)), and since their number is at least N − m
we obtain
H 1 (K ∩ U ) ≥ (N − m)r ,
which implies (2.14).

Figure 1. In this example, K has three connected components, while
K ∩ U has six connected components, four of which intersect K 0 .
Let now K 00 be the union of all components Ki . Then K 00 contains K 0 and is
compact (because it is a finite union of closed subsets of K), and applying Lemma 2.21
with K 00 in place of K we obtain
H 1 (K ∩ U ) ≥ H 1 (K 00 ) ≥ diam(K 0 ) − N δ .
7 If ∂U is empty then dist(K 0 , ∂U ) = +∞ (cf. Footnote 3) and then (2.12) holds for every r > 0.
8 This includes the case when ∂U is empty.

Using estimate (2.14) we then get

which in turn implies (2.13).

Proof of Theorem 2.9. We must show that for every sequence of compact sets
Kn ∈ Fm that converge in the Hausdorff distance to some K ∈ Fm there holds
lim inf H 1 (Kn ) ≥ H 1 (K). Taking into account Theorem 2.5 it suffices to prove that
X
lim inf H 1 (Kn ) ≥

for every finite family {Ei } of disjoint continua contained in K.
Since the sets Ei are compact and disjoint, we can find r > 0 and a family of
disjoint closed sets Ui such that each Ui contains Ei and satisfies 9
dist(Ei , X \ Ui ) ≥ r .

(2.16)

Then (2.15) follows by showing that, for every i,
lim inf H 1 (Kn ∩ Ui ) ≥ diam(Ei ) .

(2.17)

n→+∞

Let us fix i and choose δ such that 0 < δ < r. Since Ei is connected, it is also
δ-connected (Lemma 2.20) and therefore it contains a δ-chain {x0 , . . . , xk } with
d(x0 , xk ) ≥ diam(Ei ) − δ .
Consider now any n such that dH (Kn , K) ≤ δ (that is, any n sufficiently large). By
the definition of Hausdorff distance, for every point xj in the δ-chain we can choose a
point yj ∈ Kn with d(xj , yj ) ≤ δ, and we set Kn0 := {y0 , . . . , yk }. One readily checks
that
(a) Kn0 is a 3δ-chain, and therefore is 3δ-connected;
(b) diam(Kn0 ) ≥ d(y0 , yk ) ≥ d(x0 , xk ) − 2δ ≥ diam(Ei ) − 3δ;
(c) dist(Kn0 , ∂Ui ) ≥ dist(Kn0 , X \ Ui ) ≥ dist(Ei , X \ Ui ) − δ ≥ r − δ.10
We can then apply Lemma 2.22 with Kn , Kn0 , Ui , 3δ and r − δ in place of K, K 0 , U ,
δ and r, respectively, and obtain

To obtain (2.17) we take the liminf as n → +∞ and then the limit as δ → 0.

Propositions 3.4 and 3.5. Both statements are well-known at least in the Euclidean
case.

3.1. Paths. A path in X is a continuous map γ : I → X where I = [a0 , a1 ] is a
closed interval. Then x0 := γ(a0 ) and x1 := γ(a1 ) are called endpoints of γ, and we
say that γ connects x0 to x1 . If x0 = x1 we say that γ is closed.
The multiplicity of γ at a point x ∈ X is the number (possibly equal to +∞)
m(γ, x) := #(γ −1 (x)) .
The length of γ is
length(γ) = length(γ, I) := sup

where the supremum is taken over all n = 1, 2, . . . and all increasing sequences
{t0 , . . . , tn } contained in I.11
The length of γ relative to a closed interval J contained in I, denoted by
length(γ, J), is the length of the restriction of γ to J. If γ has finite length it is
sometimes useful to consider the length measure associated to γ, namely the (unique)
positive measure µγ on I which satisfies
µγ ([t0 , t1 ]) = length(γ, [t0 , t1 ]) for every [t0 , t1 ] ⊂ I.
We say that γ is a geodesic if it has finite length and minimizes the length among
all paths with the same endpoints.
We say that γ has constant speed if there exists a finite constant c such that
length(γ, [t0 , t1 ]) = c(t1 − t0 ) for every [t0 , t1 ] ⊂ I.
An (orientation preserving) reparametrization of γ is any path γ 0 : I 0 → X of the
form
γ0 = γ ◦ τ
where τ : I 0 → I is an increasing homeomorphism.
3.2. Remark. Here are some elementary (and mostly well-known) facts.
(i) The length is lower semicontinuous with respect to the pointwise convergence
of paths. More precisely, given a sequence of paths γn : I → X which converge
pointwise to γ : I → X, it is easy to check that
length(γ) ≤ lim inf length(γn ) .
n→+∞

(ii) Every path γ : I → X with finite length `, which is not constant on any
subinterval of I, admits a Lipschitz reparametrization γ 0 : [0, 1] → X with constant
speed `, namely γ 0 := γ ◦ σ −1 where σ : I → [0, 1] is the homeomorphism given by
1
σ(t) := length(γ, [a0 , t]) for every t ∈ I = [a0 , a1 ].
`
(iii) If γ is constant on some subinterval of I then the function σ defined above
is continuous, surjective, but not injective. However, we can still consider the leftinverse τ defined by
τ (s) := min{t : σ(t) = s} for every s ∈ [0, 1],
and even though τ is not continuous, one can check that γ 0 := γ ◦ τ is a continuous
path with constant speed `, and m(γ 0 , x) = m(γ, x) for all points x ∈ X except
countably many.
11 The length of γ is sometimes called variation and denoted by Var(γ, I); paths with finite length
are called rectifiable.

(iv) If γ is Lipschitz then length(γ, J) ≤ Lip(γ) |J| for every interval J contained in
I, and more generally µγ (E) ≤ Lip(γ) |E| for every Borel set E contained in I. Thus
the length measure µγ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure
on I, and more precisely it can be written as µγ = ρ L 1 with a density ρ : I → R
such that 0 ≤ ρ ≤ Lip(γ) a.e.
(v) If γ has constant speed c then Lip(γ) = c, length(γ) = c |I| and µγ = c L 1 .
Conversely, it is easy to check that if Lip(γ) |I| ≤ length(γ) < +∞ then γ has
constant speed c = Lip(γ) = length(γ)/|I|.
3.3. Remark. The following result is worth mentioning, even though it will not be
used in the following: if γ is Lipschitz and ρ is taken as in Remark 3.2(iv), then for
a.e. t ∈ I there holds

The second equality in (3.1) is a straightforward consequence of Lebesgue’s differentiation theorem, while the first one is not immediate and will not be proved here.
The first limit in (3.1) is called metric derivative of γ (see [1], Definition 4.1.2 and
Theorem 4.1.6).
We can now state the main results of this section.
3.4. Proposition. Let X be a continuum with H 1 (X) < +∞, and let x 6= x0 be
points in X. Then x and x0 are connected by an injective geodesic γ : [0, 1] → X with
constant speed and length ` ≤ H 1 (X).
If X is a subset of Rn , this statement can be found for example in [6], Lemma 3.12.
A slightly more general version of this statement (in the metric setting) can be found
in [1], Theorem 4.4.7. For the sake of completeness we give a proof below, which
follows essentially the one in [6].
3.5. Proposition. Let γ : I → X be a path with finite length. Then the multiplicity
m(γ, ·) : X → [0, +∞] is a Borel function and
Z
length(γ) =
m(γ, x) dH 1 (x) .
(3.2)
In particular m(γ, x) is finite for H

X

x ∈ X.

3.6. Remark. (i) Formula (3.2) can be viewed as the one-dimensional area formula in
the metric setting, in particular if coupled with the existence of the metric derivative,
see Remark 3.3.
(ii) Formula (3.2) can easily re-written in local form: for every Borel function
f : X → [0, +∞] there holds

f (γ(t)) dµγ (t) =

This means that the push-forward of the length measure µγ according to the map
γ agrees with the measure H 1 on X multiplied by the density m(γ, ·); in short
γ# (µγ ) = m(γ, ·) H 1 .
The rest of this section is devoted to the proofs of Propositions 3.4 and 3.5. We
begin with some preliminary lemmas.

3.7. Lemma. Take X, x, x0 as in Proposition 3.4. Then, for every δ > 0, x and x0
are connected by a δ-chain {xi : i = 0, . . . , n} (see Subsection 2.19) such that
length({xi }) ≤ 4 H 1 (X) .

(3.4)

Proof. We can assume δ < d(x, x0 ), otherwise it suffices to take the δ-chain consisting
just of the points x, x0 and use Lemma 2.11 to obtain (3.4).
By Lemma 2.20, x and x0 are connected a δ-chain {xi }, and possibly removing
some points from the chain, we can further assume that
d(xi , xj ) > δ

if |j − i| ≥ 2.

(3.5)

Consider now the balls Bi := B(xi , δ/2) with i = 0, . . . , n, and note that H
i) ≥
δ/2 by Corollary 2.15, while (3.5) implies that Bi and Bj do not intersect if |j −i| ≥ 2,
which means that every point in X belongs to at most two balls in the family {Bi }.
Using these facts and the estimate δ ≥ d(xi−1 , xi ) we obtain

3.8. Lemma. For every path γ : I → X there holds H 1 (γ(I)) ≤ length(γ).
Proof. It suffices to show that Hδ1 (γ(I)) ≤ length(γ) for every δ > 0 (cf. Subsection 2.2). Using the continuity of γ, we partition I into finitely many closed intervals
Ii with disjoint interiors so that
diam(γ(Ii )) ≤ δ

for every i.

Using the definition of Hδ1 and the fact that diam(γ(Ii )) ≤ length(γ, Ii ), we obtain

Proof of Proposition 3.4. The idea is simple: for every δ > 0 we take the (almost)
shortest δ-chain {xδi } that connects x and x0 , and consider the set Γδ of all couples
(tδi , xδi ) ∈ [0, 1] × X with suitably chosen times tδi ∈ [0, 1]. Passing to a subsequence,
we can assume that the compact sets Γδ converge in the Hausdorff distance to some
limit set Γ as δ → 0; we then show that Γ is the graph of a path γ : [0, 1] → X with
the desired properties.
We set I := [0, 1] and L := H 1 (X). The proof is divided in several steps.

Continua with finite length

13

Step 1: construction of the δ-chain {xδi }. Fix δ > 0, and let Fδ be the class of
all δ-chains with initial point x and final point x0 , and let Lδ be the infimum of the
length over all δ-chains in Fδ . By Lemma 3.7 we know that Fδ is not empty and
Lδ ≤ 4L.
We then choose a δ-chain {xδi : i = 0, . . . , nδ } in Fδ whose length `δ satisfies
Lδ ≤ `δ ≤ Lδ + δ ≤ 4L + δ .

(3.6)

Step 2: construction of the set Γδ . Fix δ > 0 and let {xδi : i = 0, . . . , nδ } be the δchain chosen in Step 1. We can clearly assume that the points xδi are all different, and
find an increasing sequence of numbers tδi with i = 0, . . . , nδ such that the first one
is 0, the last one is 1, and the differences tδi − tδi−1 are proportional to the distances
d(xδi−1 , xδi ). This means that
d(xδi−1 , xδi )
= `δ
(3.7)
tδi − tδi−1

(3.8)

Finally, we set

	
Γδ := (tδi , xδi ) : i = 0, . . . , nδ .
Step 3: construction of the set Γ. The sets Γδ defined in Step 2 are contained in the
compact metric space [0, 1]×X, and by Blaschke’s selection theorem (see for example
[1], Theorem 4.4.15) we have that, possibly passing to a subsequence, they converge
in the Hausdorff distance as δ → 0 to some compact set Γ contained in [0, 1] × X.
Step 4: Γ is the graph of a Lipschitz path γ : I → X. Formula (3.7) implies that
each Γδ is the graph of a map γδ from a subset of I to X with Lipschitz constant `δ .
This immediately implies that Γ is the graph of a Lipschitz map γ from a subset of
I to X with Lip(γ) ≤ ` where (recall (3.6))
` := lim inf `δ = lim inf Lδ ≤ 4L .
δ→0

δ→0

(3.9)

Moreover the projection of Γδ on I is the set Iδ := {tδi }, and taking into account
estimate (3.8) and the fact that Iδ contains 0 and 1, we get that Iδ converges to I
in the Hausdorff distance as δ → 0. This implies that the projection of Γ on I is I
itself, which means that the domain of γ is I.
Step 5: γ connects x and x0 . Since xδ0 = x and xδnδ = x0 for every δ > 0, each
Γδ contains the points (0, x) and (1, x0 ), and therefore so does Γ, which means that
γ(0) = x and γ(1) = x0 .
Step 6: ` ≤ length(γ). For every δ > 0 we can extract from the image of γ a
δ-chain that connects x and x0 and has length at most length(γ). This implies that
`δ ≤ length(γ) (cf. Step 1), and using (3.9) we obtain the claim.
Step 7: γ has constant speed, and length(γ) = `. By Step 4 and Step 6 we have
that Lip(γ) ≤ ` ≤ length(γ). Then the claim follows from Remark 3.2(v).
Step 8: γ is a geodesic. Let γ 0 be any path connecting x and x0 . Arguing as in
Step 6 we obtain ` ≤ length(γ 0 ), which implies length(γ) ≤ length(γ 0 ) by Step 7.

14

G. Alberti, M. Ottolini

Step 9: γ is a injective. Assume by contradiction that there exists t0 ∈ I and s > 0
such that γ(t0 ) = γ(t0 + s). Then the path γ 0 : [0, 1 − s] → X defined by
(
γ(t)
if 0 ≤ t ≤ t0 ,
γ 0 (t) :=
γ(t + s) if t0 < t ≤ 1 − s.
is well-defined, connects x and x0 , and has length `(1 − s), which is strictly smaller
than the length of γ, contrary to the fact that γ is a geodesic.
Step 10: length(γ) ≤ H 1 (X). Apply Lemma 3.9.



We pass now to the proof of Proposition 3.5.
3.10. Piecewise regular paths. Let I be a closed interval. We say that a finite
family {Ii } is a partition of I if the Ii are closed intervals contained in I, have pairwise
disjoint interiors, and cover I, and we say that a path γ : I → X is piecewise regular
on the partition {Ii } if it is either constant or injective on each Ii .
3.11. Lemma. Let γ : I → X be a path with finite length, and let {Ii } be a partition
of I. Then there exists a path γ 0 : I → X such that:
(i) γ 0 is piecewise regular on the partition {Ii };
(ii) γ 0 agrees with γ at the endpoints of each Ii and γ 0 (Ii ) ⊂ γ(Ii );
(iii) length(γ 0 , Ii ) = H 1 (γ 0 (Ii )) ≤ H 1 (γ(Ii )) ≤ length(γ, Ii ) for every i.
Proof. We define γ 0 on each interval Ii = [ai , a0i ] as follows:
• if γ(ai ) = γ(a0i ) we let γ 0 be the constant path γ(ai );
• if γ(ai ) 6= γ(a0i ), we let γ 0 be any injective path from Ii to X 0 := γ(Ii ) which
connects γ(ai ) to γ(a0i ) (such path exists because X 0 has finite length, cf. Proposition 3.4).
The path γ 0 satisfies statements (i) and (ii) by construction, while (iii) follows from
Lemmas 3.8 and 3.9.

Proof of Proposition 3.5. The proof is divided in three cases.
Case 1: γ is injective. In this case the multiplicity m(γ, ·) is the characteristic
function of the compact set γ(I), and therefore is Borel, while identity (3.2) follows
from Lemma 3.9.
Case 2: γ is piecewise regular. We easily reduce to the previous case.
The general case. We choose a sequence of piecewise regular paths γn : I → X
that approximate γ in the following sense:
(a) γn converge to γ uniformly;
(b) length(γn ) ≤ length(γ) for every n;
(c) m(γn , x) ≤ m(γ, x) for every x ∈ X and every n;
(d) m(γn , x) → m(γ, x) as n → +∞ for every x ∈ X.
More precisely, we construct γn as follows: for every n we choose a partition {Iin } of
I so that
max diam(Iin ) → 0 as n → +∞.
(3.10)
i

and then take γn according to Lemma 3.11. Then statements (a), (b), (c) and (d)
can be readily derived from (3.10) and statements (ii) and (iii) in Lemma 3.11.

We can now prove that the multiplicity m(γ, ·) is Borel and (3.2) holds. The first
part of this claim follows by the fact that m(γ, ·) agrees with the pointwise limit of
the multiplicities m(γn , ·) (statement (d)), which are Borel measurable because the
paths γn fall into Case 2. To prove (3.2), note that statements (a) and (b) and the
semicontinuity of length imply that
(e) length(γn ) → length(γ) as n → +∞,
while statements (c) and (d) and Fatou’s lemma yield
R
R
(f) X m(γn , ·) dH 1 → X m(γ, ·) dH 1 as n → +∞.
We already know that (3.2) holds for each γn , and using statements (e) and (f) we
can pass to the limit (as n → +∞) and obtain that (3.2) holds for γ as well.

4. Parametrizations of continua with finite length
In this section we address the following question: can we parametrize a continuum
X by a single path γ : I → X, and if yes, what can we require about γ?
First of all, note that in general a continuum cannot be parametrized by a one-toone path, and not even by a path with multiplicity equal to 1 at almost every point
(take for example any network with a triple junction).12 On the other hand, it is easy
to see that every network can be parametrized by a closed path that goes through
every arc in the network twice, once in a direction and once in the opposite direction.
In Theorem 4.4 we show that something similar holds for every continuum X with
finite length, and more precisely there exists a closed path that goes through almost
every point of X twice, once in a direction and once in the opposite direction.
Before stating the result, we must give a precise formulation of the requirement
in italic. If X is a network made of regular arcs of class C 1 in Rn , we simply ask
that γ has multiplicity equal to 2 and degree equal to 0 at every point of X except
junctions. The problem in extending this condition to general continua is that the
usual definition of degree cannot be easily adapted to the metric setting. To get
around this issue, in Subsection 4.1 we introduce a suitable weaker notion of path
with degree zero.
Unless further specification is made, in the following X is a metric space.
4.1. Paths with degree zero. Given a Lipschitz path γ : I → X, a locally bounded
Borel function f : X → R, and a Lipschitz function g : X → R, we introduce the
notation
Z
Z
d
(4.1)
f dg := (f ◦ γ) (g ◦ γ) dt .
dt
γ
I
Note that g ◦ γ is Lipschitz, and therefore the derivative in the integral at the righthand side is well-defined at almost every t ∈ I and bounded in t, and the integral
itself is well-defined.
We say that γ has degree zero (at almost every point of its image) if
Z
f dg = 0 for every f, g : X → R Lipschitz.
(4.2)
γ

12 By network we mean here a connected union of finitely many arcs (that is, images of injective

Lipschitz paths) which intersect at most at the endpoints; a point which agrees with n endpoints,
n ≥ 3, is called an n-junction.

16

G. Alberti, M. Ottolini

4.2. Remark.
(i) A simple approximation argument shows that if γ has degree zero
R
then γ f dg = 0 for every Lipschitz function g : X → R and every bounded Borel
function f : X → R.
(ii) If X is a finite union of oriented regular arcs in Rn , or more generally an
oriented 1-rectifiable set, and γ : I → X is a Lipschitz path, then for H 1 -almost
every x ∈ X one can define the degree of γ at x, denoted by deg(γ, x). Moreover for
every f, g : X → R there holds
Z
Z
∂g
f dg :=
f (x)
(x) deg(γ, x) dH 1 (x) ,
(4.3)
∂τ
γ
X
where ∂g/∂τ is the tangential derivative of g. Using this formula it is easy to check
that (4.2) holds if and only if deg(γ, x) = 0 for H 1 -a.e. x ∈ X. This justifies the use
of the expression “path with degree zero” in Subsection 4.1.
(iii) Formula (4.2) can be reinterpreted in the framework of metric currents by
saying that the push-forward according to γ of the canonical 1-current associated to
the (oriented) interval I is trivial.
4.3. Proposition. Let γ : I → X be a Lipschitz path, and let f, g : X → R be
Lipschitz functions. Then the following statements hold.
(i) [Invariance under reparametrization] Let τ : I 0 → I be an increasing homeomorphism such that γ ◦ τ is Lipschitz. Then
Z

f dg =

In particular, γ has degree zero if and only if γ ◦ τ has degree zero.
(ii) [Stability] Given a sequence of paths γn : I → X which are uniformly Lipschitz
and converge uniformly to γ, then
Z

In particular, if each γn has degree zero, then γ has degree zero.
(iii) [Parity] If γ has degree zero then the multiplicity m(γ, x) is finite and even for
H 1 -a.e. x ∈ X.
We can now state the main result of this section.
4.4. Theorem. Let X be a continuum with finite length. Then there exists a path
γ : [0, 1] → X with the following properties:
(i) γ is closed, Lipschitz, surjective, and has degree zero;
(ii) m(γ, x) = 2 for H 1 -a.e. x ∈ X, and length(γ) = 2 H 1 (X);
(iii) γ has constant speed, equal to 2 H 1 (X).
4.5. Remark. (i) The existence of a Lipschitz surjective path γ : [0, 1] → X with
Lip(γ) ≤ 2 H 1 (X) was first proved in [10]. Here we simply point out that γ can be
taken of degree zero.
(ii) An immediate corollary of this result is that every continuum X with finite
length is a rectifiable set of dimension 1.
(iii) If X is contained in Rn , then one can apply Rademacher’s differentiability
theorem to the parametrization γ and prove with little effort that X admits a tangent
line in the classical sense at H 1 -a.e. point.

The rest of this section is devoted to the proofs of Proposition 4.3 and Theorem 4.4.
At the end of the section we give another proof of Gołąb’s theorem based on the latter.
4.6. Additional notation. Let be given a Lipschitz path γ : I → X and a Lipschitz
function g : X → R. We write h := g ◦ γ, and denote by N the set of all s ∈ R such
that one of the following properties fails:
(a) the set h−1 (s) is finite;
(b) the derivative ḣ exists and is not 0 at every t ∈ h−1 (s).
Thus for every s ∈ R \ N and every x ∈ g −1 (s), the following sum is well-defined and
finite:
X

sgn ḣ(t) ,
(4.5)
p(x) :=
t∈γ −1 (x)

where, as usual, sgn(x) := 1 if x > 0, sgn(x) := −1 if x < 0, and sgn(0) = 0.
4.7. Lemma. Take γ, g, h, N and p as in Subsection 4.6. Then |N | = 0 and for
every Lipschitz function f : X → R there holds

Z  X

(4.6)
f dg =

x∈g −1 (s)

Proof. To prove that |N | = 0 we write
N = N0 ∪ h(E0 ) ∪ h(E1 ) ,
where N0 is the set of all s ∈ R such that h−1 (s) is infinite, E0 is the set of all t ∈ I
where the derivative of h exists and is 0, E1 is the set of all t ∈ I where the derivative
of h does not exists.
We observe now that |N0 | = 0 and |h(E0 )| = 0 by the one-dimensional area formula
applied to the Lipschitz function h : I → R,13 while |E1 | = 0 by Rademacher’s
theorem and then |h(E1 )| = 0 because h is Lipschitz. We conclude that |N | = 0.
Let us prove (4.6). Using (4.1), the area formula, and that |N | = 0, we get

and we obtain (4.6) by suitably rewriting the sum within square brackets.



Proof of Proposition 4.3(i). Given g and γ, we take h, N and p as in Subsection 4.6, and let h0 N 0 and p0 be the analogous quantities where γ is replaced by γ ◦ τ .
Thanks to Lemma 4.7, identity (4.4) can be proved by showing that p(x) = p0 (x) for
every x such that g(x) ∈
/ \(N ∪ N 0 ).
Taking into account (4.5) and the fact that h0 = h ◦ τ , the identity p(x) = p0 (x)
reduces to the following elementary statement: given t ∈ I such that the derivative of

h at t exists and is nonzero, and the derivative of h0 = h ◦ τ at t0 := τ −1 (t) exists and
is nonzero, then these derivatives have the same sign (recall that τ is increasing). 

The next lemmas are used in the proof of Proposition 4.3(iii).
4.8. Lemma. Let γ : I → X be a path with finite length, and let µγ be the corresponding length measure (Subsection 3.1). Then for µγ -a.e. t ∈ I there holds

Let ε > 0 be fixed for the time being. For every t ∈ E we can find rt > 0 such that
the ball (i.e., centered interval) B(t, rt ) is contained in I and

diam γ(B(t, rt )) ≤ εrt .
Consider now the family F of all balls B(t, rt /5) with t ∈ E. Using Vitali’s covering
lemma (see for example [1], Theorem 2.2.3), we can extract from F a subfamily of
disjoint balls Bj = B(tj , rj /5) such that the balls Bj0 := B(tj , rj ) cover E. Thus the
sets γ(Bj0 ) cover γ(E) and can be used to estimate H∞1 (E) (see Subsection 2.2):

(for the last inequality we used that the balls Bj are disjoint and contained in I).
Since ε is arbitrary, we obtain that H∞1 (γ(E)) = 0 and therefore H 1 (γ(E)) = 0
(cf. Remark 2.3(iii)). Using formula (3.3) we finally get

4.9. Lemma. Let γ : I → X be a path with finite length, and let E be a Borel subset
of γ(I) with H 1 (E) > 0. Then there exists a Lipschitz function g : X → R such that
|g(E)| > 0.
Proof. We can assume that γ has constant speed 1 (Remark 3.2(iii)), which implies
that γ has Lipschitz constant 1 and the length measure µγ agrees with the Lebesgue
measure on I.
We set F := γ −1 (E) and F 0 := I \ F . Since E = γ(F ) is not H 1 -negligible, F
must have positive Lebesgue measure, and using Lemma 4.8 and Lebesgue’s density

theorem we can find a point t ∈ F where (4.7) holds and F has density 1, and
accordingly F 0 has density 0.
We define g : X → R by g(x) := d(x, γ(t)), and set h := g ◦ γ. By (4.7) there
exists δ > 0 such that diam(γ(B(t, r))) ≥ 2δr for every ball B(t, r) contained in I.
This implies that
sup h(t0 ) =
t0 ∈B(t,r)

sup d(γ(t0 ), γ(t)) ≥ δr .
t0 ∈B(t,r)

Thus the interval h(B(t, r)) contains [0, δr] and then


h(B(t, r)) ≥ δr .

(4.8)

On the other hand, the fact that h is Lipschitz and F 0 has density 0 at t implies


h(F 0 ∩ B(t, r)) = o(r) .
(4.9)
Finally, the inclusion
g(E) = h(F ) ⊃ h(B(t, r)) \ h(F 0 ∩ B(t, r)) ,
together with estimates (4.8) and (4.9), yields
|g(E)| ≥ δr − o(r) ,
and we conclude by observing that δr − o(r) > 0 for r small enough.



Proof of Proposition 4.3(iii). We already know that m(γ, x) is finite for H 1 a.e. x ∈ X (Proposition 3.5). Let then E be the set of all x ∈ X such that m(γ, x) is
finite and odd, and assume by contradiction that H 1 (E) > 0.
By Lemma 4.9 there exists a Lipschitz function g : X → R such that |g(E)| > 0.
Then we take N and p as in Subsection 4.6, and let f : X → R be given by
(
sgn(p(x)) if x ∈ E \ g −1 (N ),
f (x) :=
0
otherwise.
For this choice of g and f , the sum between square brackets in formula (4.6) is a
positive odd integer for every s ∈ g(E) \ N and is 0 otherwise, and therefore (4.6)
yields
Z
f dg ≥ |g(E) \ N | = |g(E)| > 0 .
γ

This contradicts the assumption that γ has degree zero (cf. Remark 4.2(i)).

The following construction is used in the proof of Theorem 4.4.
4.10. Joining paths. Let I := [0, 1], let γ : I → X be a closed path, and let
γ 0 : I → X be a path whose endpoint γ 0 (0) belongs to the image of γ. We join these
paths to form a closed path γ n γ 0 : I → X as follows (see figure 2): we choose t0
such that γ 0 (0) = γ(t0 ) and set 14

Figure 2. Example of joined paths: γ, γ 0 and γ n γ 0 are described in

its own image); x0 agrees with both endpoints of γ and γ n γ 0 , x1 and
x2 are the endpoints of γ 0 , and x1 = γ 0 (0) = γ(t0 ).

The next lemma collects some straightforward properties of γ nγ 0 that will be used
later. We omit the proof.
4.11. Lemma. Take γ, γ 0 and γ nγ 0 as in Subsection 4.10. The following statements
hold:
if γ and γ 0 are Lipschitz, then γ n γ 0 is Lipschitz;
length(γ n γ 0 ) = length(γ) + 2 length(γ 0 );
if γ and γ 0 have bounded multiplicities, so does γ n γ 0 ;
if the path γ has multiplicity 2 at all points in its image except finitely many,
γ 0 has multiplicity 1 at all points in its image except finitely many, and the set
γ(I) ∩ γ 0 (I) is finite, then γ n γ 0 has multiplicity 2 at all points in its image
except finitely many;
(v) for every f : X → R bounded and Borel, and every g : X → R Lipschitz there
holds

(vi) if γ has degree zero (cf. Subsection 4.1) then γ n γ 0 has degree zero.
Proof of Theorem 4.4. Let I := [0, 1]. We obtain the path γ : I → X with the
required properties as limit of the closed paths γn : I → X constructed by the
inductive procedure described in the next two steps.
Step 1: construction of γ1 . We choose x00 ∈ X and take x0 ∈ X which maximizes
the distance from x00 . By Proposition 3.4, there exists an injective Lipschitz path
γ00 : I → X that connects x00 to x0 . We then set
(
γ00 (2t)
if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2,
γ1 (t) :=
0
γ0 (2 − 2t) if 1/2 < t ≤ 1.
Note that that γ1 is closed, has degree 0, and its multiplicity is 2 at all points of γ1 (I)
except γ1 (1/2), where it is 1. Clearly length(γ1 ) = 2 length(γ00 ).
14 The notation γ n γ 0 is not quite appropriate, because this path does not depend only on γ and
γ 0 , but also on the choice of t0 .

Step 2: construction of γn+1 , given γn . We assume that γn (I) is a proper subset
of X.15 Then we take a point xn ∈ X which maximizes the distance from γn (I), and
an injective Lipschitz path γn0 : I → X that connects xn to some point x0n ∈ γn (I).
By “cutting off a piece of γn0 ” we can assume that this path intersects γn (I) only
at the endpoint x0n . We can also assume that x0n = γn0 (0). Then we set
γn+1 := γn n γn0 .
Step 3: properties of γn . Using Lemma 4.11, one easily proves that each γn is
closed and Lipschitz, has degree zero, and satisfies
`n := length(γn ) = 2

length(γm
).

Moreover the multiplicity of γn is bounded and equal to 2 for all points in γn (I)
except finitely many. This last property, together with formula (3.2), yields
`n := length(γn ) ≤ 2 H 1 (X) .

(4.11)

Step 4: reparametrization of γn . Since the multiplicity of γn is bounded, γn is not
constant on any subinterval of I, and therefore it admits a reparametrization with
constant speed equal to `n (Remark 3.2(ii)). In the rest of the proof we replace γn
by this reparametrization, which still satisfies all the properties stated in Step 3.
Step 5: construction of γ. The paths γn : I → X are closed and uniformly
Lipschitz, and more precisely Lip(γn ) = `n ≤ 2 H 1 (X). Therefore, possibly passing
to a subsequence, the paths γn converge uniformly to a path γ : I → X which is
closed and Lipschitz, and satisfies Lip(γ) ≤ 2 H 1 (X).
Step 6: γ is surjective. Equations (4.10) and (4.11) imply that the sum of the
lengths of all paths γn0 is finite, and then
length(γn0 ) → 0 as n → +∞.
Now, recalling the choice of xn and the fact that γn0 connects xn to γn (I) (cf. Step 2)
we obtain that
dn := sup dist(x, γn (I)) = dist(xn , γn (I)) ≤ length(γn0 ) ,
x∈X

and therefore dn tends to 0 as n → +∞, which means that the union of all γn (I) is
dense in X.
Now, γm (I) contains γn (I) for every m ≥ n, and then γ(I) contains γn (I) for every
n. Hence γ(I) contains a dense subset of X, and since it is closed, it must agree with
X.
Step 7: completion of the proof. Since the paths γn have degree zero, so does
γ (Proposition 4.3(ii)), and the proof of statement (i) is complete. This fact, the
surjectivity of γ, and Proposition 4.3(iii) imply that
m(γ, x) ≥ 2 for H 1 -a.e. x ∈ X.

(4.12)

On the other hand, estimate (4.11) and the semicontinuity of the length (Remark 3.2(i)) imply
length(γ) ≤ 2 H 1 (X) .
(4.13)
15 This inductive procedure stops if γ is surjective; when this happens, we simply reparametrize
n

γn so that it has constant speed, and set γ := γn . In this case it is quite easy to verify that γ has
the required properties (we omit the details).

Now, equations (4.12) and (4.13), together with (3.2), imply that equality must hold
both in (4.12) and in (4.13), and statement (ii) is proved.
To prove statement (iii), note that Lip(γ) ≤ 2 H 1 (X) = length(γ) (cf. Step 5),
and then γ must have constant speed (cf. Remark 3.2(v)).

We conclude this section by another proof of Gołąb’s theorem.
Second proof of Theorem 2.9 for m = 1. We must show that for every sequence
of continua Kn contained in X which converge in the Hausdorff distance to some
continuum K, there holds lim inf H 1 (Kn ) ≥ H 1 (K).
We can clearly assume that the lengths H 1 (Kn ) are uniformly bounded. For
every n, we apply Theorem 4.4 to the continuum Kn and find a path γn : I → X
with I := [0, 1] such that γn (I) = Kn , γn has constant speed and degree zero, and
length(γn ) = Lip(γn ) = 2 H 1 (Kn ).
Note that the paths γn are uniformly Lipschitz, and therefore, possibly passing to a
subsequence, they converge uniformly to some path γ : I → X, and clearly γ(I) = K.
Moreover Proposition 4.3(ii) implies that γ has degree zero, and Proposition 4.3(iii)
implies that m(γ, x) ≥ 2 for H 1 -a.e. x ∈ K. Then formula (3.2) implies that
length(γ) ≥ 2 H 1 (K).
We can now conclude, using the semicontinuity of length (cf. Remark 3.2(i)):
lim inf H 1 (Kn ) =
