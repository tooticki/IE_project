THE DERIVATION OF THE ENERGY-CRITICAL NLS FROM
QUANTUM MANY-BODY DYNAMICS

XUWEN CHEN AND JUSTIN HOLMER
Abstract. We derive the 3D energy critical quintic NLS from quantum many-body dynamics with 3-body interaction in the T3 (periodic) setting. Due to the known complexity
of the energy critical setting, previous progress was limited in comparison to the 2-body
interaction case yielding energy subcritical cubic NLS. Previously, the only result for the 3D
energy critical case was [44], which proved the uniqueness part of the argument in the case of
small solutions. In the main part of this paper, we develop methods to prove the convergence
of the BBGKY hierarchy to the infinite Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) hierarchy, and separately, the
uniqueness of large GP solutions. Since the trace estimate used in the previous proofs of
convergence is the false sharp trace estimate in our setting, we instead introduce a new
frequency interaction analysis and apply the finite dimensional quantum de Finetti theorem.
For the large solution uniqueness argument, we discover the new HUFL (hierarchical uniform frequency localization) property for the GP hierarchy and use it to prove a new type of
uniqueness theorem. The HUFL property reduces to a new statement even for NLS. With
the help of [26, 45] which proved the global well-posedness for the quintic NLS, this new
uniqueness theorem establishes global uniqueness.

1. Introduction
Since [26, 10, 45], it has been an open problem for a while to prove that the 3D energycritical nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS)
i∂t φ = −∆φ + |φ|4 φ in R × Λ,

(1.1)

where Λ = R3 or T3 , is the mean-field limit of the N-body Bosonic Schrödinger equation
with three-body interaction
i∂t ψ N = HN ψ N in R × ΛN

(1.2)

where ψ N ∈ L2s (ΛN ) and the N-body Hamiltonian is given by

then the problem asks to prove limN →∞ γ N (t) = |φ(t)i hφ(t)|⊗k if limN →∞ γ N (t) = |φ0 i hφ0 |
and φ solves (1.1) subject to initial datum φ0 . In this paper, we prove the Λ= T3 case, while
the R3 case is still open.

This problem arises from the study of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Since the Nobel
prize winning experiments [5, 28] of BEC in interacting many-particle systems using laser
cooling techniques, this new state of matter has attracted a lot of attention in physics and
mathematics. BEC is a peculiar gaseous state in which particles of integer spin (bosons)
occupy a macroscopic quantum state. In short, BEC means that every particle in the Nbody system takes the same quantum state (”does the same thing”). This new state of
matter can be used to explore fundamental questions in quantum mechanics, such as the
emergence of interference, decoherence, superfluidity and quantized vortices. Investigating
various condensates has become one of the most active areas of contemporary research.
A single particle in quantum mechanics is governed by a linear one-body Schrödinger
equation. If N bodies interact quantum mechanically, they are governed by the N-body
linear Schrödinger equation due to the superposition principle. Thus we arrive at the Nparticle dynamic (1.2) for the analysis of BEC. It is self-evident that (1.2) is impossible to
solve or simulate when N is large. In fact, the largest system one could simulate at the
moment only allows N ∼ 102 while N ∼ 103 for very dilute Bose-Einstein samples and N
is up to values of the order 1030 in Boson stars. Thus, it is necessary to find reductions
or approximations. It is long believed that NLS like (1.7) is the mean-field limit for these
N-body systems. Such a belief
can be formally seen, through the following heuristics.

When γ (k) (0) = |φ0 i hφ0 | , one solution to (1.10) is |φ(t)i hφ(t)|⊗k given by (1.7). That is,
if the solution to (1.10) is unique, then γ (k) (t) = |φ(t)i hφ(t)|⊗k which is the conclusion of
Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.
However, such a heuristics has to be studied via rigorous mathematical proofs, not only
because computers are of no use in such a large system, also because and especially because
there are experiments [27, 29] proving that such reasonings are not true, or in other words,
at least one of the four ”if”s in the above heuristics does not hold, when one considers the
focusing quantum many-body dynamics which is a current research hot spot.
It was Erdös, Schlein, and Yau who first proved this type of mean-field limit for the case
of defocusing pair interaction and Λ = R3 , in which, the mean-field equation would be a

hierarchy in R3 ) to which the cubic defocusing NLS generates a solution. Finally, they
1
proved that there is a unique solution to the cubic GP hierarchy checking the a-priori L∞
T Hx type bound. Their uniqueness proof uses a sophisticated Feynman graph analysis which are
closely related to renormalization methods in quantum field theory, and was regarded as the
most involved part of their analysis.2
In 2007, inspired by their work on the wave equation [50] and the combinatorial argument
in [31], Klainerman and Machedon gave a different uniqueness theorem, with a short analysis
1
of PDE style proof, for the cubic GP hierarchy in R3 , which, instead of a L∞
T Hx -type bound,
requires a Strichartz type bound. Though the desired limit generated by the cubic NLS
1
easily satisfies both of the L∞
T Hx -type bound and the Strichartz type bound, at that time,
it was unknown how to prove that the limits coming from the N-body dynamics actually
satisfy the Strichartz type bound.
In 2008, Kirkpatrick, Schlein, and Staffilani discovered that the Klainerman-Machedon
Strichartz type bound can be obtained via a simple trace theorem in R2 and T2 and hence
greatly simplified the argument and derived the 2D cubic NLS in [49]. In fact, Kirkpatrick,
Schlein, and Staffilani also introduced some fine tunings to the compactness and the convergence arguments in [49], like the Fourier analysis proof of the Poincaré / approximation of
identity type lemmas. The tuned scheme became standard in the later work, for example,
[16, 18, 35]. However, how to check the Klainerman-Machedon Strichartz type bound in the
3D cubic case remained fully open at that time.
Later in 2008, T. Chen and Pavlovic initiated the study of the repelling three-body interaction case / the quintic case in [10] and proved that the 1D and 2D defocusing quintic NLS
arise as the mean-field limits. They also showed in [10] that the 2D quintic case, which is
usually considered the same as the 3d cubic case because the corresponding NLS are both
1
H 2 -critical, does satisfy the Klainerman-Machedon Strichartz type bound though proving it
for the 3D cubic case was still open. They also considered the more general data to attack
the problem in [9, 11, 12]. Then in 2011, T. Chen and Pavlovic proved that the 3D cubic
Klainerman-Machedon Strichartz type bound does hold for the defocusing β < 1/4 case in
[17]. The result was quickly improved to β 6 2/7 by X.C. in [17]. In [19, 22], X.C. and J.H.
proved the bound up to the almost optimal case, β < 1, by lifting the X1,b space techniques
from NLS theory into the field. In 2013, T. Chen, Hainzl, Pavlovic, and Seiringer, gave a
1
simplified proof of the L∞
T Hx -type 3D cubic uniqueness theorem in [31], using the quantum
de Finette theorem from [55], in [8]. This inspired work for more refined uniqueness theorems
in the cubic case, see [63, 43, 24].
Convergence rate for the cubic defocusing cases have also been studied using Fock space
methods and even the metaplectic representation. See [6, 37, 38, 52, 53], and also [34, 30,
54, 61, 60, 39, 40, 15, 4, 2, 3, 55] for the β = 0 case (Hartree dynamics). The general wellposedness theory of the limiting GP hierarchy as a nonlinear PDE is also of interest. See
[14, 62, 64, 59].
We can see that the 3D quintic / energy-critical problem we are dealing with in this paper
is a main open problem in the defocusing setting. From the analysis of PDE point of view,
2When

revisiting [31, 33, 32] in [6], the authors actually wrote that proving the L∞
T Hx bound was tough.

6

it could even be the most interesting and at the same time the most difficult defocusing
problem since the energy-critical case has always been a very delicate case in the theory
of defocusing dispersive equations. See, for example, Colliander-Keel-Staffilani-Takaoka-Tao
[26] and Ionescu-Pausader [45] for the NLS case, and Grillakis [36] for the NLW case.
As already pointed out in [10], in many situations, interactions more general than pair
interactions are of importance. For instance, if the Bose gas interacts with a background
field of matter (such as phonons or photons), averaging over the latter will typically lead
to a linear combination of effective (renormalized, in the sense of quantum field theory) nparticle interactions, n = 2, 3, .... For systems exhibiting effective interactions of this general
structure, it remains a key problem to determine the mean-field dynamics. Thus there is a
strong physical reason to study the 3D quintic / energy-critical problem in the defocusing
setting. What’s more interesting is that, in fact, there is also a very strong reason in theoretic
physics to analyze the 3D defocusing quintic / energy-critical problem coming from the theory
of focusing quantum many-body systems.
While the focusing case is a natural continuation of the defocusing problems, the first full
focusing result [20], which derives the 1D focusing cubic NLS, did not come around until
2013. The mathematical reason is that when the interaction is nonpositive, the a-priori
1
L∞
T Hx -type bound, required in the compactness, convergence, and uniqueness arguments,
cannot be deduced by the standard process due to an accumulation of constants and the
technical difficulty that one estimates a trace instead of a pure power in NLS theory. By
introducing the 2-body operator and a new argument, X.C. and J.H. circumvented this
problem in the mass-subcritical case and worked out [20] and later a 3D to 1D reduction
[21]. But the L2 critical case (2D cubic), did not see any progress until [56], in which, Lewin,
Nam, and Rougerie showed in the static case that the ground state energy of the 2D Nbody focusing Hamiltonian right below the Gagliardo-Nirenberg threshold is still described
by a NLS ground state energy using a version the finite dimensional quantum de Finette
theorem from [25]. In [23], via a clever usage of the finite dimensional quantum de Finette
theorem in [56], X.C. and J.H. pushed the time-dependent case to such a threshold as well.
In [57], Lewin, Nam, and Rougerie proved in the static case that, if the potential approaches
the Gagliardo-Nirenberg threshold sufficiently slowly, the ground state energy of the 2D Nbody focusing Hamiltonian is given by a NLS energy which tends to infinity as N tends to
infinity. That is, at the moment, the mathematical study of the focusing quantum manybody problem stops right before any possible blow ups in time. In fact, the theoretical study
in physics stops right at this place as well, while, in the focusing experiments [27, 29], we
have already observed blow ups in time.
On [29, p.4-5], Cornell and Wiemann,3 wrote, ”At the moment all the theoretical calculation in physics use a mean-field approach, and describe the condensate dynamics using the
NLS equation. None of the predictions in these papers match our measurements except for
the general feature that atoms are lost from the condensate. Also, we see several phenomena
that are not discussed in these papers.” That is, the 3D cubic focusing NLS is not the right

7

model nor the correct mean-field limit. As Einstein said, ”A theory can be proved by experiment; but no path leads from experiment to the birth of a theory.” we need a new theory.
Interestingly, Cornell and Wiemann also suggested that ”the missing mechanism could be
a three-body recombination.” Hence, it is natural to assume that, to have more insight of
the focusing problem, one has to first understand the case with the simplest 3D three-body
interaction which is exactly the defocusing energy-critical case we are dealing with here.4
There are certainly difficulties so that this problem remained open for so long. For quite
a while, it was widely perceived that the difficulty lies solely on the uniqueness part because
the Klainerman-Machedon argument requires, by scaling, 32 -derivatives to work. After the
introduction of the quantum de Finette theorem, which can deal with traces like a superposition of powers, to the uniqueness theory, in [8], this problem was then conceived as solvable
via the standardized procedure from [31, 49, 8]. However, the most recent work [44] by
Hong, Taliferro, and Xie showed that such a belief is actually not true. They could only
prove a uniqueness theorem regarding small solutions to (1.10) and could not reproduce any
of the compactness nor the convergence results. This is exactly caused by the fact that, the
problem we are dealing with here is energy-critical.
We now give more details about the difficulties.5 For the compactness and the convergence
part, say one would like to estimate a term like



(k+1) 
(1.12)
Tr J (k) VN (xi − xj , xi − xk+1 )γ N 

where J (k) is a test function. In the standard argument, one would first regroup as the

are also trying to go to this direction. See, for example, [41].
is definitely interesting to analyze this energy-critical problem with the Fock space formalism which
is a newer method and should even yield a convergence rate result without the difficulties mentioned here.
However, to apply such a method, away from the many more error terms one has to chewed through, one
would have to assume much more than H 1 regularity for the initial datum of the H 1 -critical NLS (1.7) and
kind of defeat the purpose of the problem. (In fact, already at least H 4 in the cubic setting [6, 37, 38, 52].)
Moreover, one would need to prove ”uniform in N ” global well-posedness results for the auxiliary middle
4
equation i∂t φ = −∆φ + (VN ∗ |φ| )φ and compare it with (1.7). Considering this equation’s N → ∞ limit is
(1.7) and the tremendous effort in [26, 45] to prove the global well-posedness of (1.7), this does not sound like
any easier than what we are doing here. Finally, at the moment, all Fock space methods rely on space-time
decay of the solution to the corresponding NLS equation and have trouble dealing with situations, in which
bound states exist, like the T3 case we are dealing with here.

Alert readers can immediately tell that (1.13) is exactly the sharp endpoint Sobolev trace
theorem and is certainly not true. Due to the same reason, the usual approximation of
identity / the Poincaré type inequality used to prove the convergence of the key coupling
term, which reads

in the needed version here, also fails. Hence, neither compactness nor convergence follow
from the standard argument.
Notice that, estimating a trace, which is the case for the BBGKY / GP hierarchies, needs
an ε more derivative than estimating a power, which is the case of the NLS.
Despite how closely related the GP hierarchy and its corresponding NLS equation are,
1
proving the L∞
T Hx uniqueness for the GP hierarchy is more like proving the local existence
which iteratively uses the Strichartz estimates, instead of proving the unconditional uniqueness which usually involves absorbing the nonlinear term to the left, for NLS. Recall from
[67] the local existence theory for the NLS

That is, when we are dealing with the energy subcritical p < 5 case there is a small factor
5−p
T 10 in front so that we can get a contraction, and when we are dealing with the energycritical p = 5 case, we would have to use the size of the solution to build a contraction.

is like, taking |u| u − |v| v to be γ (k) (or Bj,k+1γ (k+1) ) and (u − v) as γ (k+1) , and
using the hierarchical structure to iterate (1.15). That is, one would end up with a zero and
5−p
thus uniqueness if one has a small factor in front. When p = 5, the factor T 10 is gone,6
therefore, to conclude uniqueness, one would then have to use the size of the solution. This
is why the standard argument could only reach a uniqueness regarding small solutions.
1.1. Outline of the Paper. We first state and prove, Theorem 2.1, which derives the apriori estimate (2.2) from (1.8) in §2. We obtain an improvement in β over the standard
method for the defocusing case by using the focusing scheme. It turns out that the focusing
scheme is fairly straight forward here since we are dealing with a defocusing case. Readers
1
familiar with this matter could skip §2, assume the L∞
T Hx a-priori bound, and start from §3.
Because §2 is the first and necessary step, in the sense that, compactness, convergence, and

be precise, the power of T for the GP hierarchy is not (5 − p)/10. We put that here just for illustration
purpose.

uniqueness all require (2.2) to hold, even in this defocusing setting, we did not put it in the
appendix.
In §3, we investigate terms like (1.12) in detail. By looking into their defining structure,
we are able to cleverly use the conserved energy and a subcritical Sobolev inequality to
prove their 

without the endpoint Sobolev. We found that, one could circumvent this ε loss with a

which is a bit closer to the usual argument and conveys the basic idea of why the frequency
decomposition helps. There are three main terms: high frequency approximation error, low
frequency approximation error, and low frequency main term. We notice that, when one
variable is at frequency higher than N 2β , without considering interaction, we can replace
(k+2)
the powers of N in VN by derivatives on γ N
and decrease the strength of the singularity
to obtain a decay. When all variables rest at a relatively low frequency, at the price of a
low frequency approximation error, a version of the finite dimensional quantum de Finette
theorem effectively turns the leftover problem from estimating a trace to dealing with a
power. We then prove Lemma 4.1, the approximation of identity for the low frequency main
term, without an ε loss and use some part of the usual argument to conclude the convergence.
This usage of the finite dimensional quantum de Finette theorem is where we require Λ = T3

argument, we then present the β < 19
in this paper. After the easier-to-understand β < 12
proof which uses only the frequency analysis language in §4.2. In §4.2, we use two frequency
parameters, one of them depends on N and the other one does not. We investigate the
low-high interaction inside (1.16), we set the N-dependent frequency splitting at N β this
time and further decompose the high region into four different interaction regions. Using
the fact that for frequencies above N β , there is a coupling between xk+1 and x′k+1 , and a
coupling between xk+2 and x′k+2 induced by VN , we can then squeeze a gain from the trace
lemma applied to the primed-factor. For the other terms, we use the advantage of the Nindependent frequency and obtain a decay. This frequency analysis in §4 is fully new and is
a novelty of this paper.
In §5, which is the main part of this paper, we establish Theorem 5.1, uniqueness of solutions to hierarchy (1.10) regardless of the size of the solution. We are able to prove Theorem
5.1 because we have discovered the fully new hierarchically uniform frequency localization

10

(HUFL) property, Definition 2, for solutions to the GP hierarchy and hence for solutions to
NLS as well. We break the proof of Theorem 5.1 into two main parts, Theorems 5.2 and 5.3.
1
We first prove, Theorem 5.2 in §5.1, that all admissible L∞
T Hx solutions to hierarchy (1.10)
satisfies HUFL uniformly for a small time independent of k. At a glance, the hierarchical
structure does nothing but produces numerous ”Deja vu” terms from the NLS energy. But if
one does treat them like in the NLS case in which there is no hierarchical structure, one will
end up with a k-dependent time and fails the whole proof. Thus we structure the proof of
Theorem 5.2 in a special way to avoid any k-dependent time emerging from the final estimate.
Via a delicate computation in which we need to estimate 42 terms, we first prove a growth
estimate, (5.11), for the high frequency part of the energy of the hiearchy (1.10) in §5.1.1.
With (5.11) and some refined Sobolev inequalities in Lemma 5.1 which allows a gain through
the intermediate kinetic energy, we argue by contradiction that the high kinetic energy must
stay small in §5.1.2 if we assume the continuity of the intermediate kinetic energy, which
implies a strong continuity result of the de Finette measure. Then in §5.1.3, we prove the
continuity of the intermediate kinetic energy. §5.1.1-§5.1.3 together proves Theorem 5.2.
After we have proved Theorem 5.2, we examine the couplings in the Duhamel-Born expansion of γ (1) carefully in §5.2. We find out that we can classify the couplings as unclogged
couplings and congested couplings as defined in Definition 3. In the unclogged couplings, we
explore uniform in time HUFL and manage to gain a small factor via uniform in time HUFL
even in this energy-critical case, by applying the refined multilinear estimates in Lemma 5.5.
In the congested couplings, due to its structure which consists of a nonlinear term solely
made of nonlinear terms, one cannot gain anything via HUFL. We then show that, at least
4/5 of the total couplings has to be unclogged couplings. This allows us to prove uniqueness
for a small time assuming HUFL initial datum, which is Theorem 5.3.
We then prove Lemma 5.5 in §5.3 with a meticulous frequency interaction argument.
The proof of Lemma 5.5 happens to be highly technical, and in fact, relies heavily on the
scale invariant T3 Strichartz estimates and bilinear Strichartz estimates recently proved in
Bougain-Demeter [7], Killip-Visan [48], and Zhang [68]. This is due to the fact that the T3
Strichartz estimates have loss and we are dealing with an ”endpoint” problem in which we
could not afford any loss.
With Theorems 5.2 and 5.3, we prove by contradiction that uniqueness must persist for all
time, which is Theorem 5.1 and establishes uniqueness for the energy-critical GP hierarchy
with critical regularity regardless of the size of the solution.7 §5 records this new discovery
and is the main novelty of this paper.
(k)
Through §2 to §5, we have concluded that, under the setting of Theorem 1.2, γ N (t) →
(k)
|φ(t)i hφ(t)|⊗k weak* as trace class operators. The standard argument then proves γ N (t) →
|φ(t)i hφ(t)|⊗k strongly as trace class operators, hence deduces Theorem 1.2. Again, by the

do not know if Theorem 5.1 should be classified as a conditional uniqueness theorem or an unconditional uniqueness theorem. See Remark 1 for detail.

here because it is not new.8
For completeness, we include an appendix on how HUFL works for NLS (1.7).

We prove Theorem 2.1 with the scheme in the focusing literature [20, 21, 23] though it is a
defocusing problem. While this proof is longer and more complicated than [10, Proposition
1
instead.
2.1], it yields β < 81 . If one follows [10, Proposition 2.1] directly, one obtains β < 12
As we go through the proof, we see that the reason of the improvement is that, the focusing
scheme, though much more complicated, groups terms finer.

(2.2) as usual. We omit the details here.
3. Compactness via Energy
We start by introducing an appropriate topology on the density matrices as was previously
done in [30, 31, 32, 33, 49, 10, 16,
operators and
 17, 18, 19]. 1Denote the spaces of compact

as Kk and Lk , respectively. Then (Kk ) = Lk . By the fact
(k)
that Kk is separable, we select a dense countable subset {Ji }i>1 ⊂ Kk in the unit ball of
(k)
Kk (so kJi kop 6 1 where k·kop is the operator norm). For γ (k) , γ̃ (k) ∈ L1k , we then define a
metric dk on L1k by

lim dk (γ N , γ (k) ) = 0.

N →∞

For fixed T > 0, let C
be the space of functions of t ∈ [0, T ] with values in L1k
which are continuous with respect to the metric dk . On C ([0, T ] , L1k ) , we define the metric
dˆk (γ (k) (·) , γ̃ (k) (·)) = sup dk (γ (k) (t) , γ̃ (k) (t)),
t∈[0,T ]

and denote by τ prod the topology on the space ⊕k>1 C ([0, T ] , L1k ) given by the product of
topologies generated by the metrics dˆk on C ([0, T ] , L1k ).

Though B is not part of the energy, B is in fact not as singular as A because VN (yj −
xk+1 , yj −xk+2 ) |ψ N |2 (t, xk+2 , xN −k ) effectively only set two variables inside |ψ N |2 to be equal.
But there is a technical point inside. For simpler notation, let us assume j = k. Denote a
Littlewood-Paley projector by P . Decompose ψ N in frequency that
(3.3)

ψ N = ψ N,1 + ψ N,2

where
ψ N,1 = PMk+1 >Mk+2 ψ N ,
and
ψ N,2 = PMk+2 >Mk+1 ψ N .
That is, inside ψ N,1 , the Mk+1 frequency dominates the Mk+2 frequency, while the Mk+2
frequency dominates the Mk+1 frequency inside ψ N,2 .

where ρα = α16 ρ( αx , αy ) and ρ is a probability measure and a Schwartz function on T3 × T3 ,

We estimate I, II, III, IV,and V II in detail. With our method, the estimate for V I follows

from the standard argument [49] since γ̃ N,M → γ (k) weak* as trace class operators, and hence
we skip it.

We estimate the best term I3 and the worst term I0 . The main idea is that when at least
one variable is at frequency higher than N 2β , we can exchange the powers of N β in VN with
(k+2)
derivatives on γ N
to decrease the strength of singularity and hence obtain a decay.
Without lose of generality, say xj−1 is at high in a typical term inside the worst group I0 ,

After the estimates of I and II, we are now dealing with a a superposition of tensor
product (|φi hφ|)⊗k+2 in III, IV , and V II. Hence we can follow the standard argument
because we can prove Lemma 4.1 for the approximation of identity without an ε loss. Since
Lemma 4.1 only applies to tensor products, its proof is elementary. However, we do need
this version of the H 1 → L6 Sobolev estimate to hold in sharp form, thus we prove it in
detail. The proof we provide is more like [31, Lemma 8.2] with a real space method, instead
of the Fourier method after [49, Lemma A.2], since we are proving a L6 estimate.11

Definition 2 (HUFL). We say that Γ(t) = γ (k) (t) k=1 ∈ ⊕k>1 L1k satisfies hierarchically

Then there is exactly one admissible solution to hierarchy (1.10) in [0, +∞) subject to this
initial datum satisfying the condition that there is a constant C0 such that
(5.1)

sup Tr S (1,k) γ (k) (t)S (1,k) 6 C02k for all k.

(5.2)

t∈[0,T ]

Remark 1. We are not sure if Theorem 5.1 should be called a GP conditional uniqueness
theorem or an GP unconditional uniqueness theorem. Theorem 5.1 requires more than (5.2),
the usual assumption of the GP unconditional uniqueness theorems (see [31, 8, 43, 44, 63,
24, 23], for examples). However, it does not require a Strichartz type bound like the GP
conditional uniqueness theorems (see [51, 49, 10, 16, 35, 20], for examples). If one applies
Theorem 5.1 to factorized datum γ (k) (0) = |φ0 i hφ0 |⊗k , then the HUFL condition is trivially
satisfied and Theorem 5.1 implies the unconditional uniqueness of (1.7) at critical regularity.
Moreover, the proof of Theorem 5.1, relies on the fact that hierarchy (1.10) is defocusing
while this is usually not the case for uniqueness theorems.
The proof of Theorem 5.1 is splitted into two main parts, Theorems 5.2 and 5.3. We prove
Theorem 5.2 in §5.1 and Theorem 5.3 in §5.2.
5.1. Local-in-time HUFL Estimates.


Theorem 5.2. Assume the initial datum γ (k) (0) k=1 to hierarchy (1.10) satisfies HUFL.
Let ε > 0 and M > 0 and suppose that

(5.3)
Tr S (1,k) P>M γ (k) (0)P>M S (1,k) 6 4ε

Γ = γ (k) k=1 ∈ ⊕k>1 C ([0, T ] , L1k ) to (1.10) in [0, T ], subject to this initial datum, satisfying
(5.2), must satisfy
(5.4)

(k)

(k)

sup Tr S (1,k) P>M γ (k) (t)P>M S (1,k) 6 ε2k for all k.

t∈[0,T ]

Remark 2. We note that the length of the time interval T in Theorem 5.2 depends on ε > 0
and M > 0 (which in turn depends on the specifics of the initial condition). We cannot, in
fact, claim the above result for arbitrarily long times, or even for short times independent of

3D QUINTIC NLS AS MEAN-FIELD LIMIT

37

ε or the initial condition. Nevertheless, Theorem 5.2 is a type of uniform-time, uniform-inhierarchy, frequency localization estimate, and is sufficient to prove Theorem 5.3 and hence
Theorem 5.1.

help understanding the definition of HLj and HH

NLS (1.1).
L
For NLS, we can decompose ENLS into a low frequency component ENLS
and a high
H

frequency component ENLS , as follows: In the expansion of |φL + φH | , all of the terms that
have 0, 1, or 2 of φH or φ̄H are placed into EL , and all of the terms that have 3, 4, 5, or 6
of φH or φ̄H go into EH . The expansion is
|φH + φL |6 = (φH + φL )3 (φ̄H + φ̄L )3
and thus the coefficients can be determined by counting the number of bar and non bar H
terms.
• zero H terms: |φL |6
• one H terms: This breaks into two cases
3
– If the H term is non bar, then there are three possibilities, so 3φ̄L φ2L φH =
3|φL |2 φ̄L φH .
2
– If the H term is bar, then there are three possibilities, so 3φ3L φ̄L φ̄H = 3|φL |2 φL φ̄H
• two H terms: This breaks into three cases
– 2 H are non bar, zero H are bar. There are 3 ways to choose the non bar L term,
2
3
so 3φ2H φL φ̄L = 3φ2H φ̄L |φL |2
– 2 H are bar, zero H are non bar. There are 3 ways to choose the bar L term, so
2
2
3φ̄H φ̄L φ3L = 3φ̄H φ2L |φL |2
– 1 H is bar, 1 H is non bar. There are 3 ways to choose the non bar H term,
2
and 3 ways to choose the bar H term, so 9 total possibilities, so 9φH φ̄H φ2L φ̄L =
9|φH |2 |φL |4 .

allowing for the M 2 penalty using Bernstein.
One certainly hopes that the NLS case in Appendix A will go through for GP hiearchy
j
(5.6) as well if we define HLj , HH
for (5.6) similarly. However, if one uses the NLS argument
for GP, even if one assumes Theorem 4.3 which at a glance, makes the NLS problem and the
GP problem look similar, one will end up with a k−depending t in the end and hence fails
completely. (Yes, we have tried.) This is certainly because special solutions (1.1) cannot
imply the general case (5.6). On the one hand, derivatives do not work very well with even

helps the argument, does not exist. Therefore, we have to come up with a much more
accurate and delicate argument to prove Theorem 5.2.

After seeing the definition of ENLS
(5.7), it is obvious that, in this proof of Theorem 5.2,
we have to write out a large sum of high/low projections of many variables explicitly in the
interaction part. To shorten the formulas, for a fixed M, we shorten the notation by

interaction lie at high frequency. The possiblities are

Because of that L∞
dµt (φ) , the continuity of KM ≤•≤R (t) could be interpreted a strong continuity
result of the de Finetti measure.
Finally, in the third part, §5.1.3, we prove, as Lemma 5.2, that KM ≤•≤R (t) the intermediate
kinetic energy, is indeed a continuous function in time t. §5.1.1-5.1.3 proves Theorem 5.2.

that, when k > 1, (5.11) is more accurate than (5.8) even if one assumes a pure tensor product
solution to (5.6).

At the expense of a factor of 25 , we may assume the sizes of the frequencies are ordered so
that M1 > M2 > M3 > M4 > M5 > M. Now we have that M1 ∼ M2 (since otherwise,
if M2 ≤ 81 M1 , then we cannot have |ξ 1 + ... + ξ 5 | 6 M which is forced by the restriction
|ξ 6 | 6 M). Hence, at the expense of a factor of 3, we can take M1 = M2 . Hence the sum

Since we have now proved Lemma 5.2, the argument in §5.1.2 is now completed and we
have established Theorem 5.2.
5.2. Uniqueness through HUFL.
Theorem 5.3. For initial data satisfying HUFL, there exists T > 0 such that there is exactly
one admissible solution to (1.10) in [0, T ] satisfying (5.2).
Once we have proved Theorem 5.3, Theorem 5.1 then follows. In fact, we can write the
initial datum as
Z
(k)
γ (0) = (|φi hφ|)⊗k dµ0 (φ)

	∞
by Theorem 4.3. If γ (k) (0) k=1 satisfies HUFL at t = 0, then by the same Chebyshev
argument as in [8, Lemma 4.5], dµ0 is supported in the set

{φ ∈ B L2 (T3 ) : kP>M h∇i φkL2 6 ε}.
Let St be the solution operator of the energy critical NLS (1.1), then by [26, 45] in which
St φ is proven to exists for all t < +∞, there is a global solution to (1.10) given by
Z
(k)
γ (t) = (|St φi hSt φ|)⊗k dµ0 (φ).

Assume the maximal time of uniqueness is T ∗ < +∞, we infer by uniqueness at T ∗ that,
Z
(k)
∗
γ (T ) = (|ST ∗ φi hST ∗ φ|)⊗k dµ0 (φ).

Then, at T ∗ , since dµ0 is supported in {kP>M h∇i φkL2 6 ε} and we have Theorem A.1
for NLS (1.1), we know γ (k) (T ∗ ) satisfies HUFL at T ∗ and is good enough to bootstrap
with Theorem 5.3 for uniqueness again. Hence, this contradicts that the maximal time of
uniqueness is T ∗ < +∞. Thus T ∗ = +∞ and we have proved Theorem 5.1.

58

XUWEN CHEN AND JUSTIN HOLMER

We now start the proof of Theorem 5.3. Because hierarchy (1.10) is linear, we will prove
(k)
(k)
(k)
(k)
that γ (k) (t) = 0 if γ (k) (t) = γ 1 (t) − γ 2 (t), where γ 1 (t) and γ 2 (t) are two admissible
solutions which satisfy (5.2) and HUFT and subject to the same initial datum. Without lose
of generality, we prove γ (1) (t) = 0.
We use (4.1), the integral form of (1.10). From now on, we will also omit the −ib0 in front
of the coupling term in (4.1) so that we do not need to track its exact power. With this
notation change, (4.1) reads
Z t
(k)

(k)
(5.26)
γ (t) = U (t)γ (0) +

it∆

We will denote U(t) = e without explicitly writing out the spatial variable. Usually, the
space variable is clear from the context.
Let us define
J (2k+1) (t2k+1 )(f (2k+1) )(t1 )
= U (1) (t1 − t3 )B (3) U (3) (t3 − t5 )B (5) ...U (2k−1) (t2k−1 − t2k+1 )B (2k+1) f (2k+1) (t2k+1 )
with t2k+1 = (t3 , t5 , ..., t2k−1 , t2k+1 ). We can then shorten
Z t1 Z t3 Z t2k−1

γ (t1 ) =
...
J (2k+1) (γ (2k+1) )(t2k+1 )dt2k+1 .

Before delving into the analysis, we notice that there are (2k+1)!!2k summands inside γ (1) (t1 ).
We reduce the total number of summands by the following theorem which was proved by T.
Chen and Pavlovic [10] and combines the terms via the Klainerman-Machedon board game
argument [51].
Lemma 5.3 ([10]). One can rewrite
Z t1 Z t3 Z t2k−1
J (2k+1) (t2k+1 )(f (2k+1) )dt2k+1

= U (1) (t1 − t3 )Bµ(2);2,3 ...U (2k−1) (t2k−1 − t2k+1 )Bµ(2k);2k,2k+1 f (2k+1) (t2k+1 )
and D ⊂ [0, t1 ]k , µ is a map from {2, 3, ..., 2k} to {1, 2, 3, ..., 2k − 1} such that µ(2) = 1 and
µ(j) < j for all j.
That is,

Thence, Rby inserting a factor of 23k−1 into the final estimate, it suffice to estimate a typical
summand D J (2k+1) (t2k+1 ; µ)(γ (2k+1) )dt2k+1 . By paying an extra factor of 2k , we can split

and Bµ(2l);2l,2l+1
and focus on
all Bµ(2l);2l,2l+1 inside J (2k+1) (t2k+1 ; µ)(γ (2k+1) ) into Bµ(2l);2l,2l+1

where ”±” simply means it could be a ”+” or a ”−”.
The good thing about splitting Bµ(2l);2l,2l+1 , instead of estimating J (2k+1) (t2k+1 ; µ)(γ (2k+1) )(t1 )
(2k+1)
directly, is that J±
(t2k+1 ; µ)(γ (2k+1) )(t1 ) is indeed only one term instead of just another
sum and hence make its analysis more transparent. We will prove the following proposition
(2k+1)
about estimating J±
.
Proposition 5.1. For initial data satisfying HUFL, there exists C > 0 such that ∀ε > 0,
∃M(ε), we have,

Proof. Postpone to §5.2.1. We remark that, for a specific ± combination, the power 45 k could
certainly be higher, but cannot be lower.

Before going into the proof of Proposition 5.1, we remark that the HUFL assumption in
Theorem 5.3 can be weakened. We actually proved the following theorem.

	
Theorem 5.4. Given a kinetic energy size C0 of the solution γ (k) to (1.10),there is a

5.2.1. Proof of Proposition 5.1. Let us assume from now on that the two solutions γ 1 (t)
(k)
and γ 2 (t) are weakly admissible to avoid redundancy in the proof. By Theorem 4.3, there
exists dµ1,t and dµ2,t supported on B(L2 ) such that

µi,t {φ ∈ L : kSφkL2x > C0 } = 0 for i = 1, 2.

Certainly, dµt also, by definition, carries properties (5.31) and (5.32).
We are now ready to prove Proposition 5.1. The proof to Proposition 5.1 is more like an
algorithm, let us first illustrate the idea by giving an example.

(2l+1)
by Qφ
if at least one of the factors inside this quintic term is a Ut2l+1 ,tj φ and Q(2l+1) if
none of the factors inside this quintic term is a Ut2l+1 ,tj φ where j is an index larger or equal
(2k+1)
to 2l + 3. Moreover, if one of the factors19 inside this l-th quintic term contains QR
, we
(2l+1)
(2l+1)
put an extra R subscript at the notation, that is Qφ,R or QR
. We remark that, every
(2l+1)

one of the five factors inside Qφ
or Q(2l+1) carries the propagator U which smooths out
each factor. For the 2nd coupling in the example we are working on here, there is a factor

Ut5 ,t7 φ inside and no QR inside, so we put down Qφ .

which is Proposition 5.1 in the case of k = 3. Hence we have ended Example 1.
From Example 1, one can immediately tell that the number of Qφ couplings in the total
of k couplings is exactly the decay power one puts in the end. Let us first make sure such
a decay power is at least proportional to k. We make the following definition to help the
presentation.
Definition 3. For l < k, we say the l-th coupling is an unclogged coupling, if the corresponding quintic term Q(2l+1) contains at least one Ut2l+1 ,tj φ factor where j is an index larger or
equal to 2l + 3. If the l-th coupling is not unclogged, we will call it a congested coupling.

64

XUWEN CHEN AND JUSTIN HOLMER

Lemma 5.4. For large k, there are at least 54 k unclogged couplings in the total of k couplings
when one plugs (5.30) into (5.28).
Proof. Assume there are j congested couplings, then there are (k −1−j) unclogged couplings.
Before the (k −1)-th coupling, there are 4k −3 copies of Uφ available. After the 1st coupling,
all of these 4k − 3 copies of Uφ, except one, must be inside some quintic term. Since the j
congested couplings do not consume any Uφ, to consume all 4k − 4 copies of Uφ, we have
to have
(5.34)

4k − 4 6 5(k − 1 − j)

because a unclogged coupling can, at most, consume 5 copies of Uφ. Inequality (5.34)
unclogged couplings.
certainly cannot hold for large k if j > k5 . Hence, there are at least 4k

Corollary 5.1 (Strichartz estimates on T3 with noncentered frequency localization). Let M
be a dyadic value and let Q be a (possibly) noncentered M-cube in Fourier space
Q = {ξ 0 + η : |η| ≤ M} .
Let PQ be the corresponding Littlewood-Paley projection, then by the Galilean invariance, we
have

for p > 10
. The net effect of this observation is that we pay a factor of only M 2 − p , when

applying (5.39).
Proof. The proof is completely standard but we include it for completeness. We will need
the following Galilean invariance property: for ξ 0 ∈ 2πZd , we have
(5.41)

e−ix·ξ0 (eit∆ f )(x, t) = eit|ξ0 |

2 /2

[eit∆ (e−i•·ξ0 f )](x − 2ξ 0 t, t).

In Fourier space, let
Q = {ξ 0 + η : |η| 6 M} ,
be a noncentered M-cube, and let Q̃ be the corresponding centered M-cube
Q̃ = {ξ : |ξ| 6 M} .
it∆ f (ξ +η) =
Let PQ and PQ̃ be the corresponding Littlewood-Paley projections. Then since e[

(5.42)

kPQ eit∆ f kLpt,x = kPQ̃ (e−i•·ξ0 eit∆ f )kLpt,x

Since [f (• + v)] c (ξ) = e−iξ·v fˆ(ξ), we have PQ̃ [f (• + v)](x) = (PQ̃ f )(x + v). In other words,
PQ̃ commutes with translations. Thus by (5.41),
(5.43)

PQ̃ [e−i•·ξ0 (eit∆ f )](x, t) = eit|ξ0 |

2 /2

[PQ̃ eit∆ (e−i•·ξ0 f )](x − 2ξ 0 t, t)

Plugging (5.43) into (5.42),
kPQ eit∆ f kLpt,x = kPQ̃ eit∆ (e−i•·ξ0 f )kLpt,x

We have that the sum of all six frequencies is zero, so the top two frequencies are comparable in size. Thus by symmetry we might as well assume without loss that there are two
(overlapping) cases
Case 1. M1 ∼ M2 ≥ M3 ≥ M4 ≥ M5 and M1 ∼ M2 ≥ M
Case 2. M1 ∼ M ≥ M2 ≥ M3 ≥ M4 ≥ M5
Note that Case 1 breaks into two cases
Case 1A. M1 ∼ M2 ≥ M3 ≥ M4 ≥ M5 and M3 ≥ M
Case 1B. M1 ∼ M2 ≥ M ≥ M3 ≥ M4 ≥ M5
Let Ij denote the integral restricted to the corresponding case. We can also assume that
the Hx−1 norm goes on the f1 term, as opposed to fj for 2 ≤ j ≤ 5, since this is the hardest
case due to our ordering M1 ≥ M2 ≥ M3 ≥ M4 ≥ M5 . Now we begin the proofs of each
case.
Case 1A of the high frequency estimate (5.46). Let us consider fixed M1 , M2 , M3 , M4 , M5 ,
and M subject to the condition

M1 ∼ M2 ≥ M3 ≥ M4 ≥ M5 and M ≤ M3

Divide the M1 -dyadic space and the M2 -dyadic space into subcubes of size M3 . Due to the
frequency constraint ξ 2 = −(ξ 1 + ξ 3 + ξ 4 + ξ 5 + ξ), for each choice Q of an M3 -cube within
the ξ 1 space, the variable ξ 2 is constrained to at most 53 of M3 -cubes dividing the M2 dyadic
space. For expository convenience, we will refer to these 53 cubes as a single cube Qc that
corresponds to Q.

Since in our proof, we assume M1 ≥ M2 ≥ M3 ≥ M4 ≥ M5 , we cannot assume that P<M0
sits on f2 , but have to allow for f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 , or f5 . The most difficult case is when P<M0
lands on f5 (the least gain case) and the Hx−1 norm goes on the f1 term, so we will assume
so in the proofs of the cases.

Case 1. M1 ∼ M2 ≥ M3 ≥ M4 ≥ M5 and M1 ∼ M2 ≥ M
Case 2. M1 ∼ M ≥ M2 ≥ M3 ≥ M4 ≥ M5
In Case 1, in the proof of (5.35) we had
kPM1 f1 kH −1 ,

kPM2 f2 kH 1 ,

kPM gkH 1

or equivalently
kPM2 f2 kL2 ,

kPM1 f1 kL2 ,

MkPM gkL2

and, for (5.36), we would now like to have
kPM1 f1 kH 1 ,

kPM2 f2 kH 1 ,

kPM gkH −1

or equivalently
M1 kPM1 f1 kL2 ,

M2 kPM2 f2 kL2 ,

M −1 kPM gkL2

Thus (5.36)’s Case 1 follows immediately from the previous analysis because summands
inside σ(M1 ) got multiplied by M 2 /M1 M2 . 1.
In Case 2, the proof is identical. In (5.35), we had kPM1 f1 kH −1 and kPM gkH 1 , and now we
want kPM1 f1 kH 1 and kPM gkH −1 for (5.36). Since M1 ∼ M, we can trade derivatives between
these two factors. We omit further details.
Appendix A. Uniform in Time Frequency Localization for NLS
0
Definition 4. Suppose that u ∈ C[0,1]
Ḣx1 . We say that u satisfies uniform in time frequency
localization (UTFLNLS) if for each ε > 0 there exists N(ε) such that

(A.1)

kP>M ∇ukL∞
L2 ≤ ε
[0,1] x

Theorem A.1. Any solution to the 3D quintic NLS
(A.2)

i∂t u + ∆u ± |u|4 u = 0

on 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 belonging to Ct0 Ḣx1 ∩ Ċt1 Ḣx−1 satisfies UTFLNLS .
Notice that, Theorem A.1 holds no matter (A.2) is focusing or defocusing and one has
uniform in time frequency localization for arbitrarily large time while Theorem 5.2 is a small
time defocusing result. This is certainly because there is no hierarchical structure, which
gets in the way in the analysis of (1.10), for the NLS.
Proof of NLS UTFL. For convenience, we fix the sign in (A.2) and assume that u solves the
3D quintic focusing NLS
i∂t u + ∆u + |u|4u = 0
The same argument applies to the defocusing case. Let
(A.3)

C1 = max(k∇u(t)kL∞
L2 , 1)
[0,1] x

We first prove the following lemma which stems from an energy decomposition into low and
high frequency components, and a control in time of the low frequency part.

Lemma A.1. Let 0 < ε ≪ C1−3 and suppose that for some t0 ∈ [0, 1] and some N,
kP>M ∇u(t0 )kL2x 6 21 ε
Then there exists δ > 0 (which can be taken ∼ C1−10 M −2 ε2 ) such that
kP>M ∇u(t)kL2x 6 ε
for all t ∈ (t0 − δ, t0 + δ).
Proof. The energy
1
1
E(u) = k∇uk2L2 − kuk6L6

6
is conserved in time. Let uH = P>M u and uL = P6M u. For convenience we will ignore the
complex conjugates for intermediate terms since they will just be estimated in a way that
does not matter whether there are complex conjugates or not and expand the sixth power
as
|u|6 = |uL + uH |6 = |uL |6 + 6u5L uH + 15u4L u2H + 20u3L u3H + 15u2L u4H + 6uL u5H + |uH |6
Let

E(u) = E(u(t)) = EH (u(t)) + EL (u(t))

We do not expect the same for the components EH (u(t)) and EL (u(t)) although E(u) is
independent of t. We will prove the following bound for EL (u(t)) giving short time control:
(A.7)

|EL (u(t)) − EL (u(t0 ))| . C110 N 2 |t − t0 |

Since E(u) is conserved, (A.6) implies
EH (u(t)) − EH (u(t0 )) = EL (u(t0 )) − EL (u(t))
and hence (A.7) implies the same bound for EH (u(t)):
(A.8)

|EH (u(t)) − EH (u(t0 ))| . C110 N 2 |t − t0 |

Since k∇uH (t0 )kL2 is a small quantity, this will imply control on k∇uH (t)kL2 by continuity of
∇uH (t) in t (mapping into L2x ). More precisely, we argue as follows. Let tH > t0 be the first
forward time at which k∇uH (tH )kL2x = ε. We will obtain a contradiction unless tH > t0 + δ,
where δ ∼ C1−10 N −2 ε2 .
Indeed, for any t0 ≤ t ≤ tH , we have from (A.5) and Hölder that

This is a contradiction with the assumption that k∇uH (tH )kL2x = ε and k∇uH (t0 )kL2x 6 12 ε,
which together imply that

 3


k∇uH (tH )k2L2x − k∇uH (t0 )k2L2x  > ε2 .

Thus it follows that the assumption |tH − t0 | ≪ C1−10 N −2 ǫ2 is false, and we have |tH − t0 | &
C1−10 N −2 ǫ2 . A similar argument applies in the backward time direction t < t0 , yielding the
result.
It remains to prove the claimed bound (A.7) on EL (u(t)). For this, it clearly suffices to
prove
(A.10)

|∂t EL (u(t))| . C110 N 2

We will compute each term of ∂t EL (u(t)) and estimate each term using Bernstein and Sobolev.
First, we have

We complete the proof of Theorem A.1 with the following compactness argument. Fix
0 < ε ≪ 1. For each t0 ∈ [0, 1], there exists M(t0 ) such that
1
kP>M (t0 ) ∇u(t0 )kL2x ≤ ε
2
By Lemma A.1, there exists δ > 0 (depending on N(t0 ), C1 , and ε) such that if we set

The collection of intervals {It }t∈[0,1] covers [0, 1]. Pass to a finite subcover It1 , . . . , Itk , and
then let

Then clearly

since this holds on each of the subintervals Itj , 1 ≤ j ≤ k.
