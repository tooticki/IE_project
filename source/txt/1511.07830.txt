ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS
DAVID CARCHEDI

Abstract. A new approach to étale homotopy theory is presented which applies to a much
broader class of objects than previously existing approaches, namely it applies not only to
all schemes (without any local Noetherian hypothesis), but also to arbitrary higher stacks
on the étale site of such schemes, and in particular to all algebraic stacks. This approach
also produces a more refined invariant, namely a pro-object in the infinity category of
spaces, rather than in the homotopy category. We prove a profinite comparison theorem
at this level of generality, which states that if X is an arbitrary higher stack on the étale
site of affine schemes of finite type over C, then the étale homotopy type of X agrees with
the homotopy type of the underlying stack Xtop on the topological site, after profinite
completion. In particular, if X is an Artin stack locally of finite type over C, our definition
of the étale homotopy type of X agrees up to profinite completion with the homotopy type
of the underlying topological stack Xtop of X in the sense of Noohi [30]. In order to prove our
comparison theorem, we provide a modern reformulation of the theory of local systems and
their cohomology using the language of ∞-categories which we believe to be of independent
interest.

1. Introduction
Given a complex variety V, one can associate topological invariants to this variety by
computing invariants of its underlying topological space Van , equipped with the complex
analytic topology. However, for a variety over an arbitrary base ring, there is no good
notion of underlying topological space which plays the same role. (It is well known that the
Zariski topology is too coarse.) Étale cohomology gives a way of partly circumventing this
problem, since it associates cohomology groups to a scheme, and it is well known that if V is
a complex variety, then its étale cohomology with coefficients in any finite abelian group A
agrees with the singular cohomology of its underlying space Van with the same coefficients.
The étale homotopy type of a scheme takes things one giant step further. Although it does
not associate a genuine topological space to a scheme, it associates a (pro-)homotopy type,
and this allows one to associate to a scheme much more refined topological invariants, e.g.
higher homotopy groups.
The original notion of étale homotopy type goes back to seminal work of Artin and Mazur
[2] in 1969. They give a way of associating to any locally Noetherian scheme a pro-object
in the homotopy category of simplicial sets. From the étale homotopy type of a scheme, one
can recover its étale cohomology, and also its étale fundamental group, and higher homotopy
groups. Étale homotopy types have made many important impacts in mathematics, perhaps
most famously in the proof of the Adams conjecture [37, 41, 12]. More recently, étale
homotopy theory has been an important tool in studying the rational points of algebraic

varieties [15, 34, 40], and also has an interesting connection with motivic homotopy theory
[18, 39].
Artin and Mazur also introduced the notion of profinite completion, which was motivated
by the notion of profinite completion of groups, and they proved the following celebrated
comparison theorem:
Theorem 1.1. [2, Theorem 12.9] Let X be a pointed connected scheme of finite type over
C. Then there is a canonical map
[Xan ] → [Xét ]
from the homotopy type of Xan to the étale homotopy type of X which induces an isomorphism
on profinite completions.
The above theorem is a vast generalization of the comparison theorem for étale cohomology.
Although étale homotopy theory, as developed by Artin and Mazur, has been quite a
successful endeavor, there are limitations to their framework. The most serious limitation is
that, although their notion of étale homotopy type naturally extends to Deligne-Mumford
stacks, it does not easily extend to more general objects, such as Artin stacks. A more
subtle limitation is related to the notion of homotopy coherence: the étale homotopy type
of a scheme in the sense of Artin and Mazur produces a pro-object— a diagram of a certain
shape — in the homotopy category of spaces (or simplicial sets); it is well known that a
diagram in the homotopy category need not lift to a diagram of actual spaces— this is the
issue of homotopy coherence. A third limitation is that the schemes in question are required
to be locally Noetherian. This excludes many natural examples. One such example, is that
Vakil and Wickelgren show in [46] that for a quasicompact and quasiseparated scheme X,
e which itself surprisingly is always a scheme, however it
there exists a universal cover X,
may fail to be locally Noetherian even when X is, so one cannot apply the machinery of
Artin and Mazur to it. The first two limitations were partly remedied by subsequent work
of Friedlander [13], as he refined the construction of Artin and Mazur to define the étale
homotopy type of a locally Noetherian scheme as a pro-object in the actual category of
simplicial sets, rather than its homotopy category. He also extended the construction to
simplicial schemes, and proved a comparison theorem similar to the above, but for pointed
connected simplicial schemes of finite type over C. Unfortunately, the profinite comparison
result that Friedlander proves uses the same notion of profinite completion as Artin-Mazur,
which happens at the level of pro-objects in the homotopy category of spaces, and also
Friedlander’s approach still has a locally Noetherian hypothesis.
In this paper, we present a new approach to étale homotopy theory which offers a refinement of the original construction which produces a pro-object in the ∞-category of spaces
rather than its homotopy category and applies to a much broader class of objects, namely
to arbitrary higher stacks on the étale site of affine schemes over an arbitrary base, with no
Noetherian hypothesis. Furthermore, our approach to profinite completion follows Lurie and
produces a pro-object in the ∞-category of π-finite spaces (Definition 2.4). We also prove
a generalization of Artin and Mazur’s comparison theorem which holds for any higher stack
on the étale site of affine schemes of finite type over C. In particular, the comparison result
holds for any algebraic stack locally of finite type over C, or more generally, any n-geometric
stack locally of finite type over C, in the sense of [45].

As our machinery applies to much more general objects than previous frameworks, it is
ripe for future applications. One application which has already been explored is related
to the profinite homotopy type of log schemes, and is explained in Section 7 of [6]. The
results of [6] imply that if X is a (fine saturated) log scheme locally of finite type over C,
then the homotopy type of its Kato-Nakayama space [21] agrees after profinite completion
with the homotopy type of the underlying topological stack of its infinite root stack— which
is a pro-algebraic stack [42]. Our comparison theorem, Theorem 4.13, implies that both
of these profinite homotopy types also agree with the profinite étale homotopy type of the
infinite root stack. As the later makes sense for log schemes over a more general base, this
gives a suitable replacement for the Kato-Nakayama space in positive characteristics. The
previously existing comparison theorems were not robust enough to apply in this situation.
The machinery and formulation of our approach is quite different than the work of ArtinMazur and Friedlander, however for locally Noetherian schemes, our definition of étale homotopy type turns out to be essentially the same after unwinding the definitions. The principal
difference between the definition of the étale homotopy type of such a scheme as computed
according to our machinery and its definition computed according to the machinery of ArtinMazur is two-fold, namely our approach uses Čech covers and theirs uses hypercovers, and
our definition yields a pro-object in the ∞-category of spaces, and theirs yields a pro-object
in the homotopy category of spaces (see Remark 2.35). By a recent result of Hoyois [16], for
locally Noetherian schemes, the former is the only real difference between the definition using
our approach and the definition using the approach of Friedlander (see Proposition 2.36).
The difference between using Čech covers as opposed to using hypercovers is moreover erased
by passing to profinite homotopy types.
Our approach necessitates the use of the powerful framework of ∞-categories. The use of
this language makes our definition of étale homotopy type much more simple and transparent
than previous definitions. This is partly due to the fact that the language of ∞-categories
allows for a simple definition of pro-spaces and profinite spaces. At the same time, this
approach to pro-spaces is equivalent to the approach of Edwards-Hastings and Isaksen [10, 17]
using model categories [3], and moreover, the ∞-categorical approach to profinite spaces is
equivalent to Quick’s model-categorical approach as in [35, 36]. However, the ∞-categorical
approach to pro-spaces and profinite spaces is much easier to work with, e.g. (c.f. [24]): If
S is the ∞-category of spaces, succinctly, the ∞-category Pro (S) of pro-spaces is the full
subcategory of Fun (S, S)op - the opposite of the ∞-category of functors from spaces to spaces
- on those functors which preserve finite limits (and are accessible).
Let X be an arbitrary higher stack on the étale site of affine schemes over k. Let G be
an arbitrary space in S (i.e. an ∞-groupoid). Denote by ∆ét (G) the stackification of the
constant presheaf with value G. Then, as a pro-space, the étale homotopy type Πét
∞ (X) of X
as a functor from spaces to spaces sends the space G to the space of maps

from higher stacks on the étale site to pro-spaces, sending a stack X to its étale homotopy
type.
Strictly speaking, the above description of the étale homotopy type of an arbitrary stack is
not by definition; this description is the content of Theorem 2.40. Our definition is of more
geometric origin, as our approach has its roots in the philosophy of Grothendieck which
led to the inception of the concept of a topos; topoi were invented in order to associate to
a scheme an underlying “space” whose cohomology is (by definition) the étale cohomology
of the scheme in question, and this was an important first step towards producing a Weil
cohomology theory and proving the Weil conjectures. We take seriously the idea that the
correct geometric “space” underlying a scheme X is its small étale topos Sh (Xét ) , and
therefore all the topological invariants of a scheme X should actually be invariants of the
topos Sh (Xét ) . To make this precise, one needs a way of associating to a topos a prohomotopy type. This can be accomplished by using the theory of ∞-topoi. Indeed, given an
∞-topos, there is a simple construction, originally due to Toën and Vezzosi, which associates
to an ∞-topos E a pro-space Shape (E) called its shape, which is to be the thought of as the
pro-homotopy type of the ∞-topos in question, and as any topos can be in a natural way
regarded as an ∞-topos, this gives a way of associating to any scheme a pro-homotopy type.
The above discussion works well for schemes. It also works well for Deligne-Mumford
stacks, as they can be modeled geometrically as ringed topoi. However, to extend the
definition of étale homotopy type to an arbitrary higher stack, one needs a new idea. We
accomplish this by formally extending the functor associating to a scheme its small étale
∞-topos Sh∞ (Xét ) (the ∞-topos associated to its small étale topos) to a colimit preserving
functor
Sh∞ (Aff k , ét) → Top∞
from the ∞-category of higher stacks on the étale site of affine schemes over k to the ∞category of ∞-topoi. The étale homotopy type of a higher stack is then defined to be the
shape of its associated ∞-topos via the above functor. Although this definition is not very
tractable for stacks which are not Deligne-Mumford, this is rectified by Theorem 2.40, and
moreover, in light of our comparison theorem, Theorem 4.13, it is still a reasonable definition
for Artin stacks, which may a priori be non-obvious due to the use of the étale topology rather
than say the smooth topology.
There is substantial overlap of our results with those of Chough, whose manuscript [7]
is still in preparation. Although our overall approaches are quite different, we believe both
approaches will prove valuable to the mathematical community.
1.1. The comparison theorem. We will now explain in detail the content of our comparison theorem:
In [6], we extend two important classical constructions for schemes and topological spaces
to higher stacks, namely the analytification functor and the functor sending a topological
space to its homotopy type.

from schemes locally of finite type over C to topological spaces. It sends a scheme X to
its space of C-points equipped with the complex analytic topology. Motivated by the desire
to associate to an algebraic stack over C a natural topological object from which one can
extract topological invariants, Noohi extends this construction in [30] to a functor
T
→ TopSt
( · )top : AlgStLF
C

from Artin stacks locally of finite type over C to topological stacks. In [6], we extend this
further to a colimit preserving functor

( · )top : Sh∞ Aff LFT
,
ét
→ HypSh∞ (TopC )
C

from ∞-sheaves on the étale site of affine schemes of finite type over C, to hypersheaves on
a suitable category TopC of topological spaces.
The homotopy type of a stack: In [31], Noohi defines a functor
ho : TopSt → Ho (Top)

from the 2-category of topological stacks to the homotopy category of topological spaces,
sending a topological stack X to its weak homotopy type. Explicitly, if G is a topological
groupoid presentation for X, ho (X) has the weak homotopy type of the classifying space of
G. In [32] Noohi and Coyne refine this to a functor to the ∞-category of spaces S.
In [6], we extend this further to a colimit preserving functor
Π∞ : HypSh∞ (TopC ) → S

from the ∞-category of hypersheaves on TopC to the ∞-category of spaces.
The final important construction we need in order to explain our comparison result is
Profinite completion: In [24], Lurie constructs the profinite completion functor
(c
· ) : S → Prof (S)

from the ∞-category of spaces to the ∞-category of profinite spaces. In fact, this is the
restriction of a profinite completion functor
Pro (S) → Prof (S)
from pro-spaces to profinite spaces, and composing this functor with our étale homotopy
type functor

between the profinite étale homotopy type of X and the profinite completion of the homotopy

1.2. Overview of our approach. It turns out that all of the functors in the statement
of Theorem 1.2 are colimit preserving, so, by the Yoneda lemma, the comparison result
for higher stacks in fact follows formally from the comparison result for affine schemes.
Therefore, in order to prove Theorem 1.2, one must prove an analogue of Artin and Mazur’s
classical comparison theorem for (affine) schemes of finite type over C (without the additional
assumptions of being pointed or connected) and for our new ∞-categorical definition of étale
homotopy type.
Our strategy is close in spirit to the original strategy of Artin and Mazur, but uses more
modern machinery. The key ideas are the following:
1) For X a separated scheme of finite type over C, the shape of the ∞-topos Sh∞ (Xan ) of
∞-sheaves on its underlying space Xan , Shape (Sh∞ (Xan )) is canonically equivalent
to the underlying homotopy type Π∞ (Xan ) of Xan .
2) Analytification induces a geometric morphism of topoi
ε : Sh (Xan ) → Sh (Xét )
from the topos of sheaves on Xan and the small étale topos of X, which canonically
extends to a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi
ε : Sh∞ (Xan ) → Sh∞ (Xét ) .

3) A π-finite space is a space V with only finitely many connected components and only
finitely many homotopy groups all of which are finite. The geometric morphism ε
induces a profinite homotopy equivalence if and only if for every π-finite space V, the
induced map between global sections of the constant stack with value V
Γét ∆ét (V ) → Γan ∆an (V )

is a homotopy equivalence.
4) By GAGA, ε induces an isomorphism on profinite fundamental groups, and by results
in [1], it induces an isomorphism in cohomology with coefficients in any local system
of finite abelian groups.
In order to deduce that ε is a profinite homotopy equivalence from 3) and 4), one needs
to understand the interpretation of cohomology classes of a space with coefficients in a local
system in terms of classifying spaces, and one needs to know this interpretation is valid in any
∞-topos. We therefore dedicate Section 3 of this paper to carefully working this out. This
allows us to prove the maps in 3) are homotopy equivalences by induction using Postnikov
towers.
1.3. Conventions and notation. By an ∞-category, we mean an (∞, 1)-category. We
will model these using quasicategories. We follow very closely the notational conventions
and terminology from [26], and refer the reader to the index and notational index op. cit.
However, we do make a few small deviations from the notational conventions just mentioned:
1. We shall interchangeably use the notation Gpd∞ and S for the ∞-category of ∞groupoids, or the ∞-category of spaces, since these are in fact the same ∞-category.
(We find it useful to use one terminology over another in certain instances to emphasize how we are viewing the objects in question.)
2. For C an ∞-category, we denote by HomC (C, D) the space of morphisms from C to
D rather than using the notation MapC (C, D) .
3. For C an ∞-category, we denote by Psh∞ (C ) the ∞-category of ∞-presheaves, i.e.
the functor category
Fun (C op , S) = Fun (C op , Gpd∞ ) .

comparison theorem for the case of schemes, and to Achim Krause who was nice enough to

2. Étale Homotopy Theory
In this section we will present a refinement of the construction of Artin and Mazur for the
étale homotopy type of a scheme. Our construction is defined for an arbitrary higher stack
on the étale site, and agrees with the definition of Lurie for Deligne-Mumford stacks.
2.1. Pro-spaces and profinite spaces. In this subsection, we give a brief recollection of
the concepts of pro-objects, pro-spaces, and profinite spaces. For more detail, we refer the
reader to [6, Section 2].
Definition 2.1. Let C be any ∞-category. Then there is an ∞-category Pro (C ) together
with a fully faithful functor
j : C ֒→ Pro (C ) .
The ∞-category Pro (C ) is called the ∞-category of pro-objects of C , and it satisfies the
following universal property:
Pro (C ) admits small cofiltered limits, and if D is any ∞-category admitting small cofiltered limits, then composition with j induces an equivalence of ∞-categories
(1)

Funco−filt. (Pro (E ) , D) → Fun (E , D) ,

where Funco−filt. (Pro (E ) , D) is the full subcategory of Fun (Pro (E ) , D) spanned by those
functors which preserve small cofiltered limits.
In many cases, the ∞-category Pro (C ) can be described explicitly. When C is small, then
we can identify Pro (C ) with the full subcategory of Fun (C , S)op spanned by those functors
which are cofiltered limits of co-representable functors (those of the form HomC (C, · ) , for
C an object of C ). In this case, the functor j is simply the Yoneda embedding (of C op ).
In fact, this description persists for C a large (but locally small) ∞-category, provided we
replace S with the ∞-category of large spaces, b
S, and we demand that the cofiltered limits
we are considering are small. However, if C is accessible and admits finite limits, then there
is a more concrete description of Pro (C ) , namely it is the full subcategory of Fun (C , S)op
on those functors which are left exact and accessible [24, Proposition 3.1.6].
Remark 2.2. In all the cases above, the functor
j : C → Pro (C )
can be identified with a restriction of the opposite functor of the Yoneda embedding
y : C op ֒→ Psh∞ (C op ) = Fun (C , S) ,
and since y is fully faithful and preserves limits, j is fully faithful and preserve colimits.
Definition 2.3. The ∞-category Pro (S) is the ∞-category of pro-spaces.
Definition 2.4. A space X in S is π-finite if all its homotopy groups are finite, it has only
finitely many non-trivial homotopy groups, and finitely many connected components.

Definition 2.5. Let Sπ denote the full subcategory of the ∞-category S on the π-finite
spaces. Sπ is essentially small and idempotent complete (and hence accessible). The ∞category of profinite spaces is defined to be the ∞-category
Prof (S) := Pro (Sπ ) .

Denote by i the canonical inclusion i : Sπ ֒→ S. It induces a fully faithful embedding
Pro (i) : Prof (S) ֒→ Pro (S)
of profinite spaces into pro-spaces [24, Remark 3.1.7]. It is the functor corresponding under
(1) with the composite
j

i

Sπ ֒→ S ֒→ Pro (S) .
Moreover, i is accessible and preserves finite limits, hence the above functor has a left adjoint
i∗ : Pro (S) → Prof (S)
induced by composition with i, by loc. cit.
Definition 2.6. We denote by (c
· ) the composite
j

and call it the profinite completion functor. Concretely, if X is a space in S, then X
corresponds to the composite

Sπ ֒→ S −−−−−−−−−−−−−→ S.

This functor has a right adjoint given by the composite

where T sends a functor

Proposition 2.8]. Concretely, T sends a pro-space of the form lim j (Xi ) to the actual limit

see [6, Proposition 2.10].
2.2. Profinite shape theory. We first begin by recalling how to associate to a space X in
S, an ∞-topos. To do this, it is conceptually simpler to view such an object X as an ∞groupoid, as then we have a natural candidate for such an ∞-topos, namely the ∞-topos of
∞-presheaves on X, Psh∞ (X) . Thinking more topos-theoretically, viewing X as an object
of the ∞-topos S of spaces, another natural candidate for such an ∞-topos is the slice ∞topos S/X, and these two natural choices agree by [26, Corollary 5.3.5.4]. By [26, Remark

10

DAVID CARCHEDI

6.3.5.10, Theorem 6.3.5.13, and Proposition 6.3.4.1], it follows that there is a fully faithful
colimit preserving functor
S/ ( · ) : S → Top∞
X 7→ S/X
from the ∞-category of spaces to the ∞-category of ∞-topoi.
Remark 2.7. The above functor is not to be confused with the functor
Sh∞ ( · ) : Top → Top∞
T 7→ Sh∞ (T )
sending a topological space T to its ∞-topos of ∞-sheaves. The above functor however is
also fully faithful, once one restricts it to the full subcategory of sober topological spaces.
If T is a (sober) topological space and Π∞ T is its associated ∞-groupoid, then Sh∞ (T )
remembers the space T up to homeomorphism, whereas S/ (Π∞ T ) only captures the weak
homotopy type of T . For nice spaces, one can recover S/ (Π∞ T ) however as the shape of
Sh∞ (T ) (or its hypercompletion), see Proposition 2.9 and Proposition 2.12.
The functor
S/ ( · ) : S → Top∞ ,

by the equivalence (1), induces a well-defined functor

Pro (S) → Top∞
which sends a representable pro-space j (X) to S/X, and sends a pro-space of the form lim Xi
←−
i∈I

to the cofiltered limit of ∞-topoi lim S/Xi . Denote this functor by Spro/ ( · ) . By [26, Remark
←−
i∈I

7.1.6.15], this functor has a left adjoint Shape. We now will describe this construction, which
originates from [44]:
Recall that a morphism in Top∞
f : E → F,

called a geometric morphism, consists of an adjunction f ∗ ⊣ f∗ , such that the left adjoint
f ∗ preserves finite limits. Let E be an ∞-topos. Consider the essentially unique geometric
morphism e : E → S to the terminal ∞-topos of spaces. Then the composite
e∗

e

∗
S −→ S −→
S

is a left-exact functor, i.e. a pro-space. We typically denote the inverse image functor e∗ as
∆ and the direct image functor e∗ as Γ. The functor Γ is the global sections functor, i.e. it
sends an object E to the space HomE (1, E) . We denote by Shape (E) the pro-space Γ ◦ ∆.
Definition 2.8. Let E be an ∞-topos. Then the pro-space Shape (E) is called the shape of
the ∞-topos E.
We have the following useful proposition

ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS

Proposition 2.9. ([25, Remark A.1.4]) Let T be a paracompact Hausdorff space homotopy
equivalent to a CW -complex. Then
Shape (Sh∞ (T )) ≃ j (Π∞ T ) .
Definition 2.10. An ∞-topos E is locally ∞-connected if the inverse image functor
∆:S→E
has a left adjoint ΠE∞ .
Remark 2.11. If E is a locally ∞-connected ∞-topos, then the pro-space Shape (E) is
corepresented by the space
ΠE∞ (1) .
This follows from the fact that if G is any space

in S, by adjunction we have the following
HomE (1, ∆ (G))
Γ∆ (G)
Shape (E) (G) .

We also have the following proposition:
Proposition 2.12. Let T be a locally contractible topological space. Then the shape
Shape (HypSh∞ (T ))
of its ∞-topos of hypersheaves is equivalent to j (Π∞ T ) . Moreover, HypSh∞ (T ) is locally
∞-connected.
Proof. Denote by Π∞ : Top → S the canonical functor sending a space to its weak homotopy
type (as an ∞-groupoid). Denote by Op (T ) the poset of open subsets of T. Denote by l the
composite
Π∞

−−→ S,
Op (T ) → Top −−−−−

where the functor Op (T ) → Top sends each open subset U of T to itself. Denote by
L = Lany l : Psh∞ (Op (T )) → S
the left Kan extension of l along the Yoneda embedding, i.e. the unique colimit preserving
functor which agrees with l on representables. It follows from the Yoneda lemma that this
functor has a right adjoint R which sends an ∞-groupoid G to the ∞-presheaf
R (G) : U 7→ Hom (l (U) , G) .
We claim that R (G) is a hypersheaf. To see this, it suffices to observe that if V • is a
hypercover of U, then, regarding it in the natural way as a simplicial topological space, the
colimit of the composite

Denote by Opc (T ) the subposet of Op (T ) on those open subsets which are contractible.

where the latter topos is the topos of sheaves with respect to covers by contractible open
subsets. It now follows from [19, Theorem 5] and [26, Proposition 6.5.2.14] that there is a
canonical equivalence
HypSh∞ (Op (T )) ≃ HypSh∞ (Opc (T )) .

The left adjoint ∆ to global sections in HypSh∞ (Opc (T )) is defined so that ∆ (G) can be
computed as the hypersheafification of constant presheaf with value G. Note however that
for U in Opc (T ) , R (G) is a hypersheaf, and
R (G) (U) ≃ Hom (l (U) , G)
≃ Hom (∗, G)
≃ G,

since U is contractible, and hence the constant presheaf is already a hypersheaf on Opc (T ) .
Hence we can identify R with ∆. It follows that HypSh∞ (T ) is locally ∞-connected with
ΠT∞ = L ⊣ ∆.


By Remark 2.11, it follows that the shape of HypSh∞ (T ) is corepresented by j ΠT∞ (1) .
But 1 is the representable presheaf corresponding to the open subset T, and hence ΠT∞ (1) is
canonically equivalent to
l (T ) = Π∞ (T ) .

ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS

Definition 2.14. Let E → F be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi. Such a morphism is a
profinite homotopy equivalence if the induced map
Shape Prof (E) → Shape Prof (F)

is an equivalence of profinite spaces.

Remark 2.15. Unraveling the definitions, we see that a geometric morphism ϕ : E → F
is a profinite homotopy equivalence, if and only if for every π-finite space V, the canonical
morphism
f∗ f ∗ (V ) → e∗ e∗ (V )
is an equivalence of spaces, where e : E → S and f : F → S are the (essentially unique)
maps to the terminal ∞-topos, and the above map is induced by the unit of the adjunction
ϕ∗ ⊣ ϕ∗ , using the equivalence e ≃ f ◦ ϕ.

b → E be the canonical map from its
Proposition 2.16. Let E be an ∞-topos and let a : E
hypercompletion. Then a is a profinite homotopy equivalence.

Proof. Using Remark 2.15, it suffices to show for any π-finite space V that the canonical
map
e∗ e∗ (V ) → e∗ (a∗ a∗ (e∗ (V )))
is an equivalence, where the map above is induced from the map
e∗ (V ) → a∗ a∗ e∗ (V ) .

However, the latter map is the canonical map from e∗ (V ) to its hypersheafification. Since V
is π-finite, it is n-truncated for some n, and hence so is e∗ (V ) by [26, Proposition 5.5.6.16],
since e∗ is left exact. However, every n-truncated sheaf automatically satisfies hyperdescent,
so this map is an equivalence.

2.3. The small étale ∞-topos. For this subsection and the next, we will work over an
arbitrary commutative ring k.
Definition 2.17. A subcategory Aff Uk of the category of affine schemes over k, Aff k , is étale
closed if for any object X in Aff Uk , if Y → X is an étale morphism from an affine scheme,
then Y is in Aff Uk . We denote the corresponding subcategory of commutative k-algebras by
AlgUk .
Example 2.18. Since étale maps are of finite presentation, the subcategory Aff LFT
of affine
k
k-schemes of finite type is étale closed.
Remark 2.19. Since étale maps between affine schemes are of finite presentation, any essentially small subcategory of Aff k is contained in an essentially small étale closed subcategory.
In the rest of this section, we will work over a fixed essentially small étale closed subcategory Aff Uk of Aff k , unless otherwise specified. The notion of étale closedeness was specifically
chosen so that the étale pretopology on Aff k naturally restricts.
Recall that for a scheme X, its small étale site is the following Grothendieck site: As a
category, Xét consists of étale morphisms
U → X,

14

DAVID CARCHEDI

with U another scheme, and the morphisms are commutative triangles over X. The Grothendieck
pretopology on this category is given by étale covering families. The small étale topos
Sh (Xét ) is the topos of sheaves over this site.
Definition 2.20. Let X be a scheme. Its small étale ∞-topos is the ∞-topos Sh∞ (Xét ) .
Remark 2.21. Since étale maps are stable under pullback, the category Xét has finite
limits. It follows then from [26, Lemma 6.4.5.6] that Sh∞ (Xét ) is the 1-localic ∞-topos
corresponding to Sh (Xét ) under the equivalence of ∞-categories between the (2, 1)-category
of topoi and the ∞-category of 1-localic ∞-topoi.
This definition naturally carries over for Deligne-Mumford stacks and their higher analogues. It will be technically convenient to work straightaway with higher Deligne-Mumford
stacks. We start by briefly recalling some material from [23] and [5].
Let A be a commutative k-algebra, where k is our base ring. Denote by Aét the category
whose objects consists of étale morphisms U → Spec (A) , with U another affine scheme.
There is a canonical inclusion of sites
Aét ֒→ Spec (A)ét ,
which satisfies the conditions of the Comparison Lemma of [1] III, hence one has
Sh (Aét ) ≃ Sh (Spec (A)ét ) .

As both sites have finite limits, it follows from [26, Proposition 6.4.5.4] that
Sh∞ (Aét ) ≃ Sh∞ (Spec (A)ét ) .

Notice that there is a canonical sheaf of rings OA on the site Aét , which assigns an étale map
Spec (B) → Spec (A)

the ring B. The stalks of this sheaf OA along geometric points are not only local k-algebras,
but in fact strictly Henselian. This is important in order to get the correct notion of morphism
between ringed topoi. Just as a map of ringed spaces need not be a map of locally ringed
spaces, since one must demand that the induced map along stalks is a map of local rings,
i.e. preserves the maximal ideals, a map of strictly Henselian ringed topoi needs to respect
the Henselian ring structure along stalks, i.e. be a Henselian map. Using this idea one can
define an ∞-category of strictly Henselian ringed ∞-topoi. Let us denote this ∞-category
by TopHens.

((Eα , OEα ) → (E, OE ))α
such that for each α,

(Eα , OEα ) ≃ Spec ét (Aα ) ,

for Aα ∈
We will call a Deligne-Mumford strictly Henselian ringed ∞-topos a DeligneMumford scheme, as these are precisely G-schemes in the sense of [23, Definition 2.3.9],
where G is the étale geometry in the sense of Section 2.6 of op. cit. (and the étale cover is
by affines in Aff Uk ). We denote the ∞-category of Deligne-Mumford schemes by DMSchUk .
Restriction along Spec ét defines for each strictly Henselian ringed ∞-topos (E, OE ) a functor of points

[23, Theorem 2.4.1, Lemma 2.4.13], [5, Theorem 5.2.2, Remark 5.2.3].

Definition 2.22. A Deligne-Mumford ∞-stack is an ∞-stack X on the étale site of Aff Uk ,
equivalent to the functor of points of a Deligne-Mumford scheme. We denote the ∞-category
of such stacks by DM (k)U∞ .
Remark 2.23. By [23, Theorem 2.6.18], DM (k)U∞ contains the classical (2, 1)-category of
Deligne-Mumford stacks that can be modeled on affines in Aff Uk as a full subcategory, but
also contains more general objects as there are no separation conditions imposed. E.g., B (Z)
we will be considered a Deligne-Mumford stack in this setting. This will cause no problems
and will in fact simplify the proofs considerably.
Definition 2.24. Let X be a Deligne-Mumford (∞-)stack. Its small étale ∞-topos is the
∞-topos of ∞-sheaves over Xét , Sh∞ (Xét ) , where Xét is the (∞-)category of (not necessarily
representable) étale maps U → X with U a scheme, equipped with the Grothendieck topology
generated by étale covering families. If X ≃ ỹ ((E, OE )), by an étale morphism, we mean a
morphism U → X which under the Yoneda lemma corresponds to a morphism
(Sh∞ (Uét ) , OU ) → (E, OE )
of Deligne-Mumford schemes which is étale in the sense of [23, Definition 2.3.1].
Lemma 2.25. Let X be a Deligne-Mumford ∞-stack. By definition, X is the functor of
points of a Deligne-Mumford scheme (E, OE ). In this case, one has a canonical equivalence
Sh∞ (Xét ) ≃ E.

16

DAVID CARCHEDI

Proof. Let DM (k)U∞ denote the ∞-category of Deligne-Mumford ∞-stacks built out of affine
schemes in Aff Uk , and define similarly SchUk to be the analogously defined category of schemes.
By [5, Remarks 5.19 and 5.23], we see that SchUk is a locally small strong étale blossom in the
sense of [5, Definition 5.1.7], or more precisely, SchUk is canonically equivalent to the strong
étale blossom whose objects are the Deligne-Mumford schemes which are classical schemes
built out of affines in Aff Uk . By [5, Theorems 5.3.6 and 5.3.7] combined with Proposition
5.3.2 of op. cit., it follows in fact that


U,ét
E ≃ Sh∞ Schk , /ỹ ét (X) ,
where ỹ ét (X) is the stack assigning a scheme X the ∞-groupoid of étale maps
X → X.

By [5, Remark 2.2.4 and Proposition 2.2.1], we conclude that E ≃ Sh∞ (Xét ) .



Lemma 2.26. There is a colimit preserving functor


Sh∞ (( · )ét ) : Sh∞ Aff Uk , ét → Top∞

which sends an affine scheme Spec (A) to Sh∞ (Aét ) .

Proof. We start by constructing such a functor out of ∞-presheaves, which can be accomplished simply by taking the left Kan extension of the functor

along the Yoneda embedding
where

is the canonical functor which forgets the structure sheaf. Denote this left Kan extension by
L. By [26, Proposition 5.5.4.20 and Theorem 5.1.5.6], it suffices to show that L sends each
covering sieve
SU ֒→ y (Spec (A))
for U = (Ui → Spec (A))i an étale covering family, to an equivalence. Note however that
this covering sieve is the colimit of the Čech nerve

NU : ∆op → Psh∞ Aff Uk
of U. Since L preserves colimits, it thus suffices to show that the canonical map
colim L ◦ NU → L (y (Spec (A))) ≃ Sh∞ (Aét )
−−−→

is an equivalence.
The functor NU has a canonical lift to an augmented simplicial diagram

defining the canonical cocone for NU with vertex y (Spec (A)) (which corresponds to the
inclusion of the subobject SU ֒→ y (Spec (A))). At the level of simplicial sets, the formation

Now L induces a colimit preserving functor

By [23, Example 2.3.8] together with the fact that along representables L agrees with ∞e◦N

agrees up to equivalence with L◦ NU . Note that by [26, Remark 6.3.5.10], there is a canonical
equivalence of ∞-categories Topét / Sh∞ (Aét ) ≃ Sh∞ (Aét ) under which F corresponds to the
Čech nerve of the same étale cover, except regarded as a simplicial diagram
N U : ∆op → Sh∞ (Aét ) .

The colimit of this diagram is the terminal object. Notice that Topét / Sh∞ (Aét ) → Topét

Definition 2.27. Let F be an ∞-sheaf on Aff Uk , ét . Then the small étale ∞-topos of
F is
Sh∞ (Fét ) := Sh∞ (( · )ét ) (F ) .
We will proceed to justify this definition by showing it agrees with Definition 2.24 when
F is a Deligne-Mumford (∞-)stack. First, we will show that the definition does not depend
on the ambient étale closed subcategory:
Remark 2.28. Suppose that Aff Vk is an essentially small étale closed category of affine
schemes which contains Aff Uk . Denote by i the inclusion
i : Aff Uk ֒→ Aff Vk .
Then i induces a restriction functor



i∗ Sh∞ Aff Vk , ét → Sh∞ Aff Uk , ét

which has a fully faithful left adjoint



i! : Sh∞ Aff Uk , ét ֒→ Sh∞ Aff Vk , ét .

18

DAVID CARCHEDI

Concretely, i! is the unique colimit preserving functor sending each affine scheme Spec (A)
to itself. Denote by

S : Sh∞ Aff Uk , ét → Top∞
the colimit preserving functor from Lemma 2.26, and similarly denote by

R : Sh∞ Aff Vk , ét → Top∞
the corresponding functor for the étale closed category Aff Vk . Then we have a canonical
equivalence
S (F ) ≃ R (i! (F )) .
To see this, note the composition
 i!
 R
Sh∞ Aff Uk , ét −→
Sh∞ Aff Vk , ét −→ Top∞

is colimit preserving and agrees with S along representables. It follows that the above
composition
R ◦ i! ≃ S.
We will now justify the notation for the functor Sh∞ (( · )ét ) by showing it agrees with
Definition 2.24:

Proposition 2.29. Let S = Sh∞ (( · )ét ) be the functor from Lemma 2.26, and let X be a
Deligne-Mumford ∞-stack. Then S (X) is equivalent to the small étale ∞-topos of X, in the
sense of Definition 2.24.
Proof. Denote by DM (k)U,ét
the subcategory of Deligne-Mumford ∞-stacks built out of
∞
affines in U, where the morphisms are (not necessarily representable) étale maps. By [5,
Proposition 5.2.11 and Remark 5.3.11], it follows that the composition

which is the functor of points of a Deligne-Mumford scheme (E, OE ) to the ∞-topos E. So

of ∞-categories

Sh∞ Aff U,ét ≃ DM (k)U,ét

which sends the sheaf of étale points of an affine scheme Spec (A) to Spec (A) itself. The
result now follows from [26, Proposition 5.5.4.20 and Theorem 5.1.5.6], together with Lemma
2.25 of this article.

Remark 2.30. The results of this section readily generalize to the settings of derived and
spectral algebraic geometry. The proofs are exactly the same, once one replaces the étale
geometry ([23, Definition 2.6.12]) with the derived étale geometry ([23, Definition 4.3.13])
or the spectral étale geometry ([27, Definition 8.11]) respectively. We presented the results
in the setting of non-derived schemes merely to avoid overburdening the reader with new
concepts.
2.4. Étale homotopy type. We now present the definition of the étale homotopy type of
a general ∞-sheaf on the étale site of Aff Uk , for some small étale closed subcategory of affine
k-schemes, in the sense of Definition 2.17.
Definition 2.31. The étale fundamental ∞-groupoid functor is the composite
Sh∞ (( · )ét )
Shape

Sh∞ Aff Uk , ét −−−−−−−−−−−−−→ Top∞ −−−−−

U
and is denoted by Πét
∞ . For F an ∞-sheaf on Aff k , ét , its étale homotopy type is
Shape (Sh∞ (Fét )) , the shape of its small étale ∞-topos.

We also introduce a slight variant:
Definition 2.32. The hyper-étale fundamental ∞-groupoid functor is the composite
Sh∞ (( · )ét )
Hyp

where Hyp is the hypercompletion
functor. We denote this composite by Π∞
. For F an ∞
U
sheaf on Aff k , ét , its hyper-étale homotopy type is Shape (HypSh∞ (Fét )) , the shape
of the hypercompletion of its small étale ∞-topos.

Remark 2.33. The process of hypercompleting an ∞-topos is indeed functorial. Let
d ∞ (Top ) denote the ∞-category of large presheaves of ∞-groupoids on the ∞-category
Psh
∞
of ∞-topoi, and consider the inclusion
q : TopHC
∞ ֒→ Top∞

of the full subcategory of hypercomplete ∞-topoi. Then, by [26, Proposition 6.5.2.13], for
any ∞-topos E, if y (E) is its associated representable (large) presheaf, the presheaf q ∗ y (E)
b
on TopHC
∞ is representable by the hypercompletion E. It follows that there is a canonical

b ֒→ E,
ǫE : E

and hence Hyp is right adjoint to the canonical inclusion
TopHC ֒→ Top∞ ,
with counit
ǫ : q ◦ Hyp ⇒ idTop∞ .
Remark 2.34. The idea of using the small étale site of a scheme to define its étale homotopy
type is not new, and goes back to Artin and Mazur in [2]. The étale homotopy type of Artin
and Mazur was further refined by Friedlander in [13] and generalized to simplicial schemes.
Finally, in [24, Section 3.6], Lurie defines the étale homotopy type of a spectral DeligneMumford stack X as the shape of its underlying ∞-topos.
Remark 2.35. The hyper-étale homotopy type of a scheme X is closely related to its étale
homotopy type as defined in [2, Definition 9.6 on p. 114]. Lets illustrate this. For simplicity,
lets assume that X is locally Noetherian, so that its small étale site is locally connected by
[14, I 6.1.9]. Let Z be a space in S. Then, as a left exact functor
ΠH-ét (X) : S → S,
∞

we have
H-ét
Π∞
(X) (Z) = ΓHypSh∞ (Xét ) ∆HypSh∞ (Xét ) (Z) ,

that is, it assigns Z the space of sections of the hypersheafification on the constant presheaf
with value Z. Hypersheafification of a presheaf F can be constructed in one-step (p. 672 of
[26]) as follows:

∞-category of spaces, whereas the Artin-Mazur étale homotopy type is a pro-object in the

We also note a recent result of Hoyois. First we will introduce some notation. Let

In particular, this has an effect of “erasing the difference” between the étale homotopy type
and the hyper-étale homotopy type of a stack.
2.5. A concrete description of the étale homotopy type. Thus far, we have succeeded
in generalizing the previously existing definitions of étale homotopy type to a definition that
makes sense for arbitrary higher stacks on the étale site. However, when the stack in question
is not Deligne-Mumford, this construction is a bit opaque, since it involves taking the shape
of a colimit of ∞-topoi indexed by the right fibration associated to the stack in question.
In this subsection, we will show that nonetheless, the pro-space associated to such a higher
stack has a natural concrete description.
Consider the essentially unique geometric morphism

to the terminal ∞-topos. This is represented by an adjoint pair ∆ét ⊣ Γét , and ∆ét is left
exact. Moreover, ∆ét assigns a space Z the sheafification of the constant presheaf with value
Z, and Γét assigns an ∞-sheaf F the value

is the functor evaluating a presheaf G on Sh∞ Aff Uk , ét at the object F. Since limits in a
functor ∞-category are computed object-wise, and since ∆ét is left exact, the above composition is also left-exact, hence a pro-space. Lets denote this pro-space by l (F ) . The pro-space
l (F ) is given by the simple formula

(2)
l (F ) (Z) = HomSh∞ (Aff U ,ét) F, ∆ét (Z) .

This can be formulated more abstractly as follows. Let E be an arbitrary ∞-topos and let
∆E ⊣ ΓE

denote the essentially unique geometric morphism e : E → S. Let E be an object in E and
let
πE : E/E → E

∆E/E ≃ πE∗ ◦ ∆E .

the inverse image functor of the unique geometric morphism

from the underlying ∞-topos of Spec ét (k) to the terminal ∞-topos of spaces. Let Z be
an arbitrary space. Then Spec ét (k) /δ (Z) is a Deligne-Mumford scheme, whose functor of
points is the stack ∆ét (Z) .
Proof. It follows from [23, Proposition 2.3.10] that Spec ét (k) /δ (Z) is a Deligne-Mumford
scheme. It therefore suffices to show that its functor of points is ∆ét (Z). Consider the

By [23, Proposition 2.3.5] and [5, Proposition 5.2.11], the composition preserves small colimits. Moreover, it sends the one point space ∗ to Spec (k) , which is terminal. The functor ∆ét
also has this property, and since the above composite and ∆ét are both colimit preserving
functors out of S = Psh∞ (∗) , they must agree, but this is exactly what we wanted to show,
since the composite sends a space Z to the functor of points of Spec ét (k) /δ (Z) .

where f is the map whose functor of points is the unique map to Spec (k) . Since Spec ét (k)
is the terminal Deligne-Mumford scheme, it follows that
HomDMSchUk (Spec ét (A) , Spec ét (k) /δ (Z))
is equivalent to the space of sections of the étale map
Spec ét (A) /f ∗ δ (Z) → Spec ét (A) ,

and since any section of an étale map is étale, this is in turn the space of maps in the slice

3. Cohomology with coefficients in a local system
In this section we give a careful introduction to the concept of cohomology with coefficients
in a local system of abelian groups using the modern language of ∞-categories. We work this
out first for the case of spaces, and then for an arbitrary ∞-topos, and link these definitions
with the classical definition of cohomology with twisted coefficients in a topos. The material
in this section will play a pivotal role in proving the main theorem of this paper.
3.1. Topological case. In this subsection, we will explain how to define the cohomology of
a space X with coefficients in a local system of abelian groups by using classifying spaces.
The basic idea is not new and goes back to [38, 4], and we benefited greatly from discussion
with Achim Krause. In what follows, we formulate cohomology of local systems on spaces
in the natural setting of the ∞-category S of spaces.
3.1.1. Preliminaries on ∞-groupoids. Let X be a space in S. Regarding X as an ∞-groupoid
(and hence as an ∞-category), by the proof of [26, Corollary 5.3.5.4], there is a canonical
equivalence of ∞-categories
S/X ≃ Psh∞ (X) .
Let us unravel this equivalence a little. First note that since X is an ∞-groupoid, X is
naturally equivalent to its opposite ∞-category X op , so we have a canonical equivalence
Psh∞ (X) ≃ Fun (X, S) . It will be convenient to phrase things in terms of Fun (X, S) instead:
Given an object f : Y → X of S/X, it defines a functor F : X → S = Gpd∞ , by assigning
to each object x of the ∞-groupoid X, the ∞-groupoid of lifts

In particular, if f : X → Y arises from a continuous map f˜ of topological spaces, F (x) is
the homotopy fiber of f˜ over x. Conversely, given an arbitrary functor F : X → Gpd∞ , it
corresponds to a left fibration
Z
πF :

which since X is a Kan complex (when regarded as a quasicategory) is also a Kan fibration,
and hence πF is a map of Kan complexes, corresponding to an object of S/X. It follows
5.3.5.4] that as an ∞-category, using the identification
from the proof of [26, Corollary
R
Fun (X, S) ≃ Psh∞ (X) , X F is the full subcategory of the slice category Psh∞ (X) /F
on those morphisms whose domain is a representable presheaf, and this ∞-category is an
∞-groupoid.
Proposition 3.1. If F : X → S is a functor, its associated left fibration
Z
πF :
F →X
X

can canonically be identified with the canonical map

Proof. Consider the composite

colim F → X.
−−−→
∼

Psh∞ (X) −→ S/X → S,
where the functor S/X → S is the forgetful functor, which is colimit preserving. Let x be
an object of the ∞-groupoid X. Then the representable presheaf y (x) gets mapped as
y (x) 7→ x : ∗ → X 7→ ∗
under the above composite. It follows from [26, Theorem 5.1.5.6] that the composite must
in fact be equivalent to the left Kan extension of the terminal functor X → S (sending
everything to the contractible space) along the Yoneda embedding
y : X ֒→ Psh∞ (X) .
It follows that the composite is the functor assigning a presheaf F its colimit. The result
now follows from [26, Proposition 1.2.13.8].

3.1.2. Universal fibrations. Let Cat∞ be the ∞-category of small ∞-categories. Recall that
for C an ∞-category, given a functor
F : C → Cat∞
there is an associated coCartesian fibration
Z
F → C.
C

This is an ∞-categorical analogue of the classical Grothendieck construction from category
theory, which associates a functor
F : D → Cat,

with D a small category, to its associated cofibered category
Z
F → D.
D

ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS

This construction is part of an equivalence of ∞-categories between the functor category
Fun (C , Cat∞ ) and the ∞-category of coCartesian fibrations over C (more precisely the
∞-category associated to the covariant model structure on marked simplicial sets over C ).
Definition 3.2. Let id : Cat∞ → Cat∞ be the identity functor. The universal coCartesian fibration is its associated coCartesian fibration
Z
id → Cat∞ .
Z :=
Cat∞

The universal property of the above coCartesian fibration, which justifies its name, is that

Consider now the canonical inclusion
S = Gpd∞ ֒→ Cat∞

of the ∞-category of spaces (i.e. ∞-groupoids) into the ∞-category of small ∞-categories.
Denote this inclusion by I. Then the associated coCartesian fibration
Z
I→S
S

is in fact a left fibration, since I factors through the identity functor
id : S → S,
and can in fact be identified with the left fibration associated to the identity functor of S.
Also, we can identify it as the fibered product
S ×Cat∞ Z → S.
Definition 3.3. The left fibration ZS := S ×Cat∞ Z → S is the universal left fibration.
It follows immediately by pasting pullback diagrams that if F : C → S is any functor,
then its associated left fibration fits in a pullback square

We will now identify the universal left fibration as a very familiar functor:
Proposition 3.5. The universal left fibration can be canonically identified with the functor
S∗ → S

from pointed spaces to spaces which forgets the base point.
Proof. The opposite functor

op
ZS
→ Sop
is a right fibration corresponding to the functor
id

(Sop )op = S −→ S.

It suffices to show that the right fibration
Z

Sop

id → Sop

can be canonically identified with the opposite of the functor
S∗ → S.

Let b
S denote the ∞-category of large spaces, i.e. the ∞-category of spaces in the Grothendieck
universe V of large sets, and denote by J the composite
id
(Sop )op = S −→ S ֒→ b
S.

After changing universes, S may be considered as a small ∞-category and J as a presheaf on
Sop . By the proof of [26, Corollary 5.3.5.4], the underlying ∞-category of the right fibration
associated to J can be identified with the full subcategory of the slice category of large
presheaves
d ∞ (Sop ) /J
Psh
on those objects of the form
x
b : y (X) → J,
where y (X) is a representable presheaf on Sop , where the fibration sends such an object to
X. By the Yoneda lemma, since
HomPsh
d ∞ (Sop ) (y (X) , J) ≃ J (X) = X,
these objects can be identified with pointed spaces, where a point
x:∗→X

ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS

29

x
b : y (X) → J.

By the description of mapping spaces in a slice ∞-category [26, Proposition 5.5.5.12], if
(X, x) and (Y, y) are pointed spaces, there is a pullback diagram

3.1.3. Classifying spaces and cohomology with coefficients local systems. Fix A an abelian
group and let n > 0 be an integer. Denote by SK(A,n) the full subcategory of spaces on the
single space K (A, n) , and denote by BAut (K (A, n)) its maximal sub-Kan-complex, i.e.
the ∞-groupoid obtained by throwing out all the arrows which are not equivalences. Define
the space Aut (K (A, n)) to be the mapping space HomBAut(K(A,n)) (K (A, n) , K (A, n)) .
Concretely, Aut (K (A, n)) is the space of self homotopy equivalences of K (A, n) . Denote
by Θn the canonical inclusion
BAut (K (A, n)) → SK(A,n) ֒→ S.
Denote by θn : UnA → BAut (K (A, n)) the left fibration classified by the functor Θn , which
is simply a map of spaces.
Denote by Aut∗ (K (A, n)) the space of homotopy equivalences of K (A, n) that preserve
the base-point. It is the subcategory of the ∞-groupoid
End∗ (K (A, n)) = HomS∗ (K (A, n) , K (A, n))
of pointed endomorphisms of K (A, n) on those which are equivalences. By [25, Theorem

DAVID CARCHEDI

from the ∞-category of pointed n-connective spaces to the ∞-category of grouplike En -spaces
is an equivalence. Since K (A, n) is n-connective, it follows that
End∗ (K (A, n)) = HomS≥n
(K (A, n) , K (A, n))
∗
≃ HomMongp (Ωn K (A, n) , Ωn K (A, n))

Since A is a discrete group, we have finally that
It follows that

End∗ (K (A, n)) ≃ HomGrp (A, A) .

Aut∗ (K (A, n)) ≃ Aut (A) .
Note also that we have a pullback diagram in S:
Aut (A) ≃ Aut∗ (K (A, n))

K (A, n) .

Unwinding the definitions, since the inverse functor to Ωn is B n , we have that the map above
Aut (A) → Aut (K (A, n))

∼

sends an automorphism ϕ : A −→ A to the automorphism
∼

K (ϕ, n) : K (A, n) −→ K (A, n) .

Also, via the long exact sequence in homotopy groups from the fibration sequence associated
to the above diagram, we conclude that
π0 (Aut (K (A, n))) ∼
= Aut (A)
and the only other non-trivial homotopy group is
πn (Aut (K (A, n))) ∼
= A.
In other words, we have an equivalence of spaces
Aut (K (A, n)) ≃ Aut (A) × K (A, n) .

In fact, we even have a semi-direct product decomposition

Aut (K (A, n)) ≃ Aut (A) ⋉ K (A, n) .

Recall that θn : UnA → BAut (K (A, n)) is the left fibration classified by the canonical
functor
Θn : BAut (K (A, n)) → S.
A
Let us compute what Un is explicitly. As an ∞-category, this is the full subcategory of the
slice category Psh∞ (BAut (K (A, n))) /Θn on those maps G → Θn with G a representable
presheaf. But, BAut (K (A, n)) only has one object, call it ⋆. Denote by y (⋆) its associated
presheaf, which sends ⋆ to Aut (K (A, n)). By the Yoneda lemma, we have
Hom (y (⋆) , Θn ) ≃ K (A, n) .

ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS

31

It follows that the ∞-category UnA also has a single object, call it V . We can write
V : y (⋆) → Θn .
The space of maps HomUnA (V, V ) is the space of maps in the slice category
Psh∞ (BAut (K (A, n))) /Θn .
By [26, Proposition 5.5.5.12], we can identify HomUnA (V, V ) with the fiber of the map
Hom (y (⋆) , y (⋆)) → Hom (y (⋆) , Θn )
induced by composition with V. By the Yoneda lemma, this is equivalent to the fiber of the
map
Aut (K (A, n)) → K (A, n) .
Unwinding the definitions, we see that the above map

Aut (K (A, n)) ≃ Aut (A) × K (A, n) → K (A, n)
is just the first projection. It follows that
1) HomUnA (V, V ) ≃ Aut (A) ,
2) The canonical map HomUnA (V, V ) → Aut (K (A, n)) induced by the left fibration
θn : UnA → BAut (K (A, n))
sends an automorphism
∼

to the automorphism

ϕ : A −→ A
∼

K (ϕ, n) : K (A, n) −→ K (A, n) .

From 1) we conclude that UnA = K (Aut (A) , 1) . Notice that K (Aut (A) , 1) is a 1-type,
hence a groupoid. Viewing it as a groupoid, it is the groupoid with one object ⋆ such that
Hom (⋆, ⋆) = Aut (A) .
As such, there is a canonical functor into the category of abelian groups
χA : K (Aut (A) , 1) → Ab,

sending ⋆ to A and each automorphism of A to itself. Composition with the nth EilenbergMacLane functor then yields a functor into spaces

it follows from Lemma 3.4 that we can identify the map

with the left fibration

Z

So, as an ∞-category, we may identify the total space of the above fibration with the full
subcategory of the slice category Psh∞ (K (Aut (A) , 1)) /K (χA , n + 1) on those morphisms
of the form G → K (χA , n + 1) , with G a representable presheaf. Since the groupoid
K (Aut (A) , 1)R has only one object ⋆, and since K (A, n + 1) only has one object, it follows that
K (χA , n + 1) likewise has one object W : y (⋆) → K (χA , n + 1) which
K(Aut(A),1)

corresponds under the Yoneda lemma to the unique object of K (A, n + 1) . Now, by [26,

BAut (K (A, n)) → K (Aut (A) , 1) = Π1 (BAut (K (A, n))) .

Finally, when n = 0, most of the above proof goes through, except of course that we do
not have an identification of Aut (A) × A with Aut (A) , but rather the group structure on
Aut (A) × A is that of the semi-direct product.

3.2. The ∞-topos case. Before turning our attention on how to define cohomology with
coefficients in a local system of abelian groups on an ∞-topos, we make a quick digression
into the topic of local connectedness of ∞-topoi. We will need the theory later to prove the
comparison theorem we desire, and it is also relevant in distinguishing between two possibly
different notions of a local system.
3.2.1. Locally connected ∞-topoi.
Definition
` 3.12. An object E in a topos E is connected if whenever there is an isomorphism
E∼
= U V in E, then exactly one of U and V is not an initial object.
Remark 3.13. An object E in a topos E is connected if and only if the functor
HomE (E, · ) : E → Set

preserves coproducts. (See Proposition 3.26.)

Definition 3.14. A topos E is locally connected if and only if every object E in E can
be written as a coproduct of connected objects. (The initial object is an empty coproduct).
Lemma 3.15. [20, Lemma C.3.3.6] A topos E is locally connected if and only if the
inverse image functor
∆ : Set → E
has a left adjoint Π0 .
Remark 3.16. Let U be a connected object of a locally connected topos E, and let S be a
set. Then we have:
Hom (Π0 (U) , S) ∼
= Hom (U, ∆ (S))
!
a
∼
= Hom U, 1
s∈S

a
∼
Hom (U, 1)
=
s∈S

∼
=

a
s∈S

∗

∼
= S,

where the second to`last isomorphism follows from Remark 3.13, and thus Π0 (U) ∼
= ∗. It
follows that if E = Ui is a decomposition of E into connected objects, then
i∈I

Π0 (E) ∼
= I,

hence the “set of connected components of E” is well defined up to isomorphism, and isomorphic to Π0 (E) .
Definition 3.17. A locally connected topos E is connected if and only if the terminal
object 1 is connected. Equivalently, if and only if
Π0 (E) := Π0 (1) ∼
= ∗.

ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS

39

The following proposition is standard:
Proposition 3.18. Let C be a locally connected Grothendieck site as in [2, Section 9], then
the topos of sheaves of sets Sh (C ) is locally connected.
Example 3.19. Let X be a locally connected topological space (in the strong sense that
the each point x has a neighborhood basis of connected open subsets). Then the open cover
Grothendieck topology on the poset of open subsets Op (X) is a locally connected site, and
hence Sh (X) is locally connected. Any sheaf of sets F on X is the sections of a local
homeomorphism L (F ) → X, and such an F is connected if and only if the space L (F ) is.
Example 3.20. Let X be a locally Noetherian scheme. Then its small étale site Xét is
locally connected (see [14, I 6.1.9]). It follows that the small étale topos Sh (Xét ) is locally
connected. Concretely, a representable sheaf Y → X in Sh (Xét ) , i.e. an étale map from a
scheme Y, is connected if and only Y is a connected scheme. More generally, as any étale
sheaf over a scheme is representable by an étale map P → X from an algebraic space (with
no separation conditions), a sheaf F in Sh (Xét ) corresponding to such a map is connected
if and only if the algebraic space P is.
Definition 3.21. An ∞-topos E is locally connected if its underlying topos Disc (E) of
discrete objects is a locally connected topos, where Disc (E) is the full subcategory of E
spanned by the 0-truncated objects.
Remark 3.22. It might be tempting to think an ∞-topos is locally connected if and only
if the inverse image functor
∆ : Gpd∞ → E
has a left adjoint Π∞ . However, this is a strictly stronger condition; an ∞-topos satisfying
this property is said to be locally ∞-connected. For example, a locally connected space
X may not have Sh∞ (X) locally ∞-connected, but this will hold if X is locally contractible.
Definition 3.23. An
` object E in an ∞-topos E is connected if whenever there is an
equivalence E ≃ U V in E, then exactly one of U and V is not an initial object.

Lemma 3.24. An object E in an ∞-topos E is connected if and only if its 0-truncation
π0 (E) is connected in Disc (E) .
`
Proof. Suppose that π0 (E) is connected, and we have E ≃ U V. Then since π0 is a left
adjoint, we have
a
π0 (E) ∼
π0 (V ) .
= π0 (U)
So, without loss of generality, π0 (U) is an initial object, and hence so is U. Hence E is
connected.
Conversely, suppose that E is connected and that
a
V.
π0 (E) ∼
=U
Then since colimits are universal,

E ≃ E ×π0 (E) U

a

E ×π0 (E) V,

40

DAVID CARCHEDI

and hence, without loss of generality, E ×π0 (E) U is an initial object. However, since
E → π0 (E)

is an epimorphism, it follows that so is ∅ = E ×π0 (E) U → U, therefore U is initial.



Lemma 3.25. Let E be a locally connected ∞-topos. Then any object E can be written as a
coproduct of connected objects.
Proof. Let E be an object of a locally connected ∞-topos. Then by definition, π0 (E) is an
object of a locally connected topos, hence we can write
a
π0 (E) =
Ui
i∈I

where each Ui is connected. But then, since colimits are universal, it follows that
a
E≃
E ×π0 (E) Ui .
i∈I

Now, since,


π0 E ×π0 (E) Ui ∼
= Ui ,
each E ×π0 (E) Ui is connected by Lemma 3.24.



Proposition 3.26. Let E be an object of a locally connected ∞-topos E. Then E is connected
if and only if the functor
HomE (E, · ) : E → Gpd∞
preserves coproducts.
`
Proof. Let E be connected and let X = Xi be an object of E. Let
i∈I

f :E→X

be a map in E. Then since colimits are universal, we have
a
E≃
E ×X Xi .
i∈I

Fix j ∈ I and write

E ≃ E ×X Xj +

a
i6=j

E ×X Xi .

Since E is connected, only one the above factors can be non-initial. Moreover, we cannot
have that E ≃ E ×X Xj is initial for all j ∈ I, for this would imply that E was initial.
Now suppose by way of contradiction that there is j 6= k in I such that E ≃ E ×X Xj and
E ≃ E ×X Xk are both non-initial. Then since E is connected,
a
E ×X Xi
i6=j

is initial, but

a

E ×X Xi = E ×X Xk +
E ×X Xi ,
i6=j

i6=j,i6=k

and E ×X Xk is non-initial, which then leads to a contradiction. So E ×X Xi is non-initial
for exactly one i, and hence for this i,
E ×X Xi ≃ E.

It follows that f factors through the inclusion Xi → X. Hence HomE (E, · ) preserves coproducts.
`
Conversely, suppose that HomE (E, · ) preserves coproducts and that E ≃ U V. Then

3.2.2. Cohomology with coefficients in local systems in an ∞-topos. In this subsection we
define local systems on an arbitrary ∞-topos with coefficients in an abelian group and
their associated cohomology groups. This is closely connected with the definition of twisted
cohomology in an ∞-topos; see e.g. [29, Section 4].
Definition 3.27. Let E be an ∞-topos. Let A be an abelian group. Consider the groupoid
K (Aut (A) , 1) , and its associated stack in E, ∆ (K (Aut (A) , 1)) . A local system with
coefficients in A on E is a map
τ : 1 → ∆ (K (Aut (A) , 1))
in E, where 1 is the terminal object.
Given a local system as above, there is an associated sheaf of abelian groups Fτ classified
by τ. (By a sheaf of abelian groups, we mean an abelian group object in Disc (E) .) The
main idea is that it is constructed by pulling back a canonical sheaf of abelian groups on
K (Aut (A) , 1) . We now explain in detail.
An abelian sheaf on the space K (Aut (A) , 1) is by definition a sheaf of abelian groups on
the ∞-topos Psh∞ (K (Aut (A) , 1)) ≃ S/ (Aut (A) , 1) . Since K (Aut (A) , 1) is a groupoid,
this is the same as specifying a functor
K (Aut (A) , 1) → Ab,
to the category of abelian groups. We have already discussed such a functor χA , namely the
canonical functor sending ⋆ to A and each automorphism of A to itself. Lets denote this
abelian sheaf by FA .
We will now show that τ corresponds canonically to a geometric morphism
τ : E → S/ (Aut (A) , 1) ,

and then we will define Fτ as the pullback sheaf τ ∗ FA .
Indeed, by [26, Remark 6.3.5.10], for any ∞-topos E, there is an equivalence of ∞categories
E → Topét
∞ /E

42

DAVID CARCHEDI

between E and the ∞-category of étale geometric morphisms over E, which sends an object
E ∈ E to the canonical étale morphism E/E → E. Hence τ corresponds to a section of the
étale geometric morphism
E/∆ (K (Aut (A) , 1)) → E
corresponding to the object ∆ (K (Aut (A) , 1)) of E. By [26, Proposition 6.3.5.8], there is a
pullback diagram in the ∞-category of ∞-topoi

so the aforementioned section can be identified with a lift

and since S is the terminal ∞-topos, we conclude that the data of the local system τ and
the geometric morphism
τ : E → S/K (Aut (A) , 1)
are equivalent, or more precisely:

Proposition 3.28. The construction just explained produces an equivalence of ∞-groupoids
HomE (1, K (Aut (A) , 1)) ≃ HomTop∞ (E, S/K (Aut (A) , 1))
between local systems with coefficients in A on E and geometric morphisms from E into
S/K (Aut (A) , 1) .
The following corollary follows immediately from [26, Remark 7.1.6.15]:
Corollary 3.29. There is an equivalence of ∞-groupoids
HomE (1, K (Aut (A) , 1)) ≃ HomPro(S) (Shape (E) , K (Aut (A) , 1)) .
Example 3.30. If X is a scheme, then a local system on its small étale ∞-topos Sh∞ (Xét )
is the same a morphism
τ : Πét
∞ (X) → K (Aut (A) , 1)
from its étale fundamental ∞-groupoid to K (Aut (A) , 1) .

Definition 3.31. Let τ : 1 → K (Aut (A) , 1) be a local system with coefficients in A on E.
Then the abelian sheaf Fτ := τ ∗ FA is the abelian sheaf classified by the local system τ .
Remark 3.32. By the proof of Proposition 3.9, the object in S/K (Aut (A) , 1) corresponding to the underlying sheaf of sets of FA can be identified with the functor of groupoids
θ0 : Aut (A) ⋉ A → K (Aut (A) , 1) .

ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS

Moreover, by construction, there is a factorization of τ of the form
E/τ

E −−−−−
−−→ E/∆ (K (Aut (A) , 1)) → S/K (Aut (A) , 1) .

Definition 3.33. Let A be an abelian group and E an ∞-topos. A locally constant sheaf
with values in A on E is an abelian sheaf F on E such that there are objects (Ui )i∈I in E
such that the canonical map
a
Ui → 1
i∈I

is an epimorphism, and such that the pullback of F to each slice topos E/Ui is isomorphic
to the constant abelian sheaf with value A.

Remark 3.34. Let C be a small category equipped with a Grothendieck topology. Then
any object E in Sh∞ (C ) admits an epimorphism from a coproduct of representables, hence
a locally constant abelian sheaf in Sh∞ (C ) can be identified with a classical locally constant
abelian sheaf on C .
Proposition 3.35. Let τ : 1 → K (Aut (A) , 1) be a local system in an ∞-topos E. Then
the abelian sheaf Fτ classified by τ is a locally constant sheaf with values in A.
Proof. Notice that ∆ (K (Aut (A) , 1)) is the classifying stack for Aut (A)-torsors. In particular, the universal Aut (A)-torsor
∆(⋆)

1 = ∆ (∗) −−−−−
−−→ ∆ (K (Aut (A) , 1))
is an epimorphism. Consider the following pullback diagram

It follows that Q ≃ Pτ × ∆ (A) → Pτ , i.e. the pullback of Fτ to E/Pτ is equivalent to the
constant sheaf ∆Pτ (A) . Hence the same is true for the abelian sheaf, i.e. the pullback of Fτ
to E/Pτ is constant with value A, and hence Fτ is locally constant.

Remark 3.36. For a general ∞-topos E, it is not true that every locally constant sheaf with
values in A is classified by a local system
τ : 1 → K (Aut (A) , 1) ,

however it is true if E is locally connected. The reason is as follows. Let A be any abelian
sheaf. We say for an object E of E, that an abelian sheaf F on E/E is locally isomorphic to
A (or a twisted form of A) if there is an epimorphism
a
Ei → E,
i

such that the restriction of F to each Ei is isomorphic to the restriction of A to each Ei . It is a
classical fact that the groupoid of abelian sheaves on E locally isomorphic to A is equivalent
to the groupoid of morphism Hom (E, B (Aut (A))) , where Aut (A) is the automorphism
sheaf of A, c.f. [28, Chapter III, Section 4]. Now consider the constant sheaf ∆ (A) for A
an abelian group. To show that locally constant sheaves with values in A are classified by
morphisms into
∆ (K (Aut (A) , 1)) = ∆ (BAut (A)) ,
it suffices to show that
∆ (BAut (A)) ≃ BAut (∆ (A)) .
Notice that
BAut (A) ≃ colim Aut (A)n ,
−−−→
op
n∈∆

and since ∆ preserves colimits and finite limits we have
∆ (BAut (A)) ≃ colim ∆ (Aut (A))n ≃ B (∆ (Aut (A))) .

So it suffices to show that

∆ (Aut (A)) ∼
= Aut (∆ (A)) ,
when E is locally connected. This follows readily from the following observation: Let S be
any set, and denote by ∆Disc the inverse image functor of the essentially unique geometric
morphism of 1-topoi
Disc (E) → Set.
Then since ∆Disc has a left adjoint Π0 , it preserves limits and we have

Definition 3.37. Let E be an ∞-topos, A an abelian group, and
τ : 1 → ∆ (K (Aut (A) , 1))

a local system on E. The nth cohomology group of E with values in τ is
π0 HomE (1, K (Fτ , n)) ,
where K (Fτ , n) is the nth Eilenberg-MacLane object of the abelian sheaf Fτ classified by τ.
Remark 3.38. Let C be a small category equipped with a Grothendieck topology. Let τ
be a local system on Sh∞ (C ) with values in an abelian group A. By Remark 3.34, we can
identify the abelian sheaf classified by τ with a classical locally constant sheaf of abelian
groups Fτ on C . Furthermore, by [26, Remark 7.2.2.17], we can identify the nth cohomology
group of Sh∞ (C ) with values in τ as just defined with the nth cohomology group of Fτ as
computed using classical sheaf cohomology.
Theorem 3.39. Let E be an ∞-topos, A and abelian group and

Proof. The statement about the 0th cohomology group follows immediately from Remark
3.32.
Now suppose that n > 0. Recall that FA is the abelian sheaf on S/K (Aut (A) , 1) corresponding to the functor
χA : K (Aut (A) , 1) → Ab,
and Fτ is by definition τ ∗ FA , where τ : E → S/K (Aut (A) , 1) is the geometric morphism induced by τ. Denote by K (FA , n) the nth Eilenberg-MacLane object of FA in S/K (Aut (A) , 1) .
By [26, Remark 6.5.1.4], it follows that
Under the equivalence

τ ∗ K (FA , n) ≃ K (Fτ , n) .

S/K (Aut (A) , 1) ≃ Fun (K (Aut (A) , 1) , S) ,

K (FA , n) corresponds to the composite

K( · ,n)

K (Aut (A) , 1) → Ab −−−−−
−−→ S,

which means that K (FA , n) in S/K (Aut (A) , 1) is the left fibration classified by the above
composite functor. Recall this functor also factors as the composite

where Θn : BAut (K (A, n)) → S is the natural functor which in fact classifies the universal

θn : K (Aut (A) , 1) → BAut (K (A, n)) .
Denote by
S/θn : S/K (Aut (A) , 1) → S/BAut (K (A, n))
the geometric morphism induced by θn , then regarding θn as an object of S/BAut (K (A, n)) ,
we have a canonical identification
(S/θn )∗ (θn ) ≃ K (FA , n) .

And hence K (Fτ , n) can be identified with the pullback of θn along the geometric morphism

The following corollary is proved in the same was as Corollary 3.11:

there is a natural bijection between the set of global sections

4. A profinite comparison theorem
In this section, we extend the results of [2] to show that the profinite étale homotopy type
of any higher stack on the site of affine schemes of finite type over C agrees with the profinite
homotopy type of its underlying topological stack.
We start by recalling some notions and results from Section 3 of [6].
Let Top be the category of topological spaces and let TopsC denote the full subcategory
on all those spaces which are contractible and locally contractible spaces which are homeomorphic to a subspace of Rn for some n. Denote by TopC the following subcategory of
topological spaces:
Definition 4.1. A topological space T is in TopC if T has an open cover (Uα ֒→ T )α such
that each Uα is an object of TopsC .

48

DAVID CARCHEDI

The reason for decorating the notation with “C” is that TopC is a good recipient for the
analytification functor from complex schemes. Recall from [43] that there is an analytification
functor
T
( · )an : SchLF
→ Top,
C
from schemes locally of finite type over C to topological spaces, and this functor preserves
finite limits. When X is a scheme, Xan = X (C) is its space of C-points equipped with the
complex analytic topology. Xan is locally (over any affine) a triangulated space by [22], so in
particular Xan is locally contractible, and since Xan is locally cut-out of Cn by polynomials,
so it follows that Xan is in TopC .
In [30, Section 20], Noohi extends the analytification functor to a left exact functor
T
( · )top : AlgStLF
→ TopSt
C

from Artin stacks locally of finite type over C to topological stacks. For X an Artin stack,
Xtop is called its underlying topological stack. In [6, Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.11], we
extend this further to a left exact colimit preserving functor

 on

ét
, we
TopC (with respect to the open cover topology). For X any ∞-stack on Aff LFT
C
refer to Xtop as its underlying stack on TopC .
Remark 4.2. Even though TopC is not a small category, HypSh∞ (TopC ) is an ∞-topos,
since there is a canonical equivalence of ∞-categories
See [6, Section 3.1].

HypSh∞ (TopC ) ≃ HypSh∞ (TopsC ) .

In Section 3.2 of [6], we also prove the following theorem:
Theorem 4.3. [6, Proposition 3.12 and Corollary 3.13] There is a colimit preserving functor
Π∞ : HypSh∞ (TopC ) → S

which sends space X in TopC , to its underlying weak homotopy type.
The functor Π∞ is called the fundamental ∞-groupoid functor. (This is an extension
of the results of [31].)
We now state our main result:

For any ∞-sheaf F on Aff LFT

ét

b ét (F ) ≃ Π

between the profinite étale homotopy type of F and the profinite completion of the homotopy
type of the underlying stack Ftop on TopC (see Theorem 4.13).
We will need a few preliminaries:

ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS

49

Notice that there is a canonical functor
TopC → Top∞ .

This factors as the canonical inclusion

TopC ֒→ Top
followed by the canonical functor
Sh : Top → Top
T 7→ Sh (T ) ,

from topological spaces to topoi (which is fully faithful when restricted to sober spaces),
followed by the canonical inclusion
Top ֒→ Top∞
identifying topoi with 1-localic ∞-topoi. Since the poset of open subsets of a topological
space has finite limits, it follows from [26, Proposition 6.4.5.4] that the total composite sends
a topological space T to the ∞-topos Sh∞ (T ) of ∞-sheaves over T. Denote by
Hyp : Top∞ → Top∞

the hypercompletion functor (see Remark 2.33).
Recall that by Remark 4.2, there is a canonical equivalence of ∞-categories
HypSh∞ (TopC ) ≃ HypSh∞ (TopsC ) .

The following lemma’s proof is completely analogous to that of Lemma 2.26. We leave
the details to the reader:
Lemma 4.4. There exists a colimit preserving functor
HypSh∞ ( · ) : HypSh∞ (TopC ) → Top∞

which sends a representable sheaf y (T ) for T a topological space to the ∞-topos of hypersheaves on T.
Lemma 4.5. The following diagram commutes up to equivalence:

Since all the functors in the above diagram preserve colimits, it suffices by [26, Proposition
5.5.4.20, Theorem 5.1.5.6] to prove that there is a natural equivalence of functors

is the Yoneda embedding. Let T be an object of Tops C. In particular, T is locally contractible. By the proof of Proposition 2.12, we have a canonical identification
Shape (HypSh∞ (T )) ≃ j (Π∞ (T )) ,

and by construction, there is a canonical equivalence

Shape (HypSh∞ (T )) ≃ Shape ◦ HypSh∞ ( · ) (y (T )) .

To prove the above proposition, since all the functors involved are colimit preserving, by
[26, Proposition 5.5.4.20, Theorem 5.1.5.6] it suffices to prove the result after restricting the
functors to affine schemes of finite type over C. The affine assumption will not play a role,
so we will establish the result for any scheme X of finite type over C.
Following [1, exposé XI.4]:
Denote by Topét /Xan the category of local homeomorphisms over Xan . Let
α : Xét → Topét /Xan

be the restriction of the analytification functor; it sends an étale map of schemes f : Y → X
to the local homeomorphism fan : Yan → Xan . Note also that via the étalé space construction,
there is a canonical equivalence of categories Topét /Xan ≃ Sh (Xan ) . Since Sh (Xan ) has
enough points, and since α is left exact, it follows that α is flat, and hence by [20, B3.2.7],
α induces a geometric morphism
∗

ϕ : Sh (Xan ) → Psh (Xét ) .

Explicitly, ϕ is the left Kan extension Lany (α) of α along the Yoneda embedding, and for
F a sheaf on Xan corresponding to a local homeomorphism LF → Xan , ϕ∗ (F ) evaluated on
an étale morphism Y → X is HomXan (Yan , LF ) . The functor α sends étale covering families
in Xét to families of jointly surjective local homeomorphisms. These are exactly the effective
epimorphisms in Topét /Xan . Hence, identifying α with a functor Xét → Sh (Xan ) , we see that
α pulls back sheaves on Sh (Xan ) equipped with the canonical topology to sheaves, since the
canonical topology Sh (Xan ) is precisely generated by jointly epimorphic families. It follows
that ϕ∗ (F ) is always a sheaf, and hence ϕ∗ restricts to a left exact colimit preserving functor
ε∗X : Sh (Xét ) → Sh (Xan ) ,

ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS

51

hence constitutes a geometric morphism
εX : Sh (Xan ) → Sh (Xét ) .
Since both Xét and the poset of open subsets of Xan have finite limits, this canonically
extends to a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi
εX : Sh∞ (Xan ) → Sh∞ (Xét )
by [26, Proposition 6.4.5.4].
We define ξX as the composition

Since all the functors involved preserve colimits, and since analytification preserves finite

ε (f ) : ε∗X ◦ f ∗ ⇒ fan

That is to say, ε (f ) represents a 2-morphism in the (2, 1)-category Top of topoi, making the

and to prove that it is an equivalence after applying Shape Prof , it suffices to show that each
geometric morphism ξX is a profinite homotopy equivalence, when X is a scheme of finite
type over C. Note that by Proposition 2.16,
ǫX : HypSh∞ (Xan ) → Sh∞ (Xan )

is a profinite homotopy equivalence for all X, so it suffices to prove that each geometric
morphism
εX : Sh∞ (Xan ) → Sh∞ (Xét )
is a profinite homotopy equivalence as well.
Let us fix a scheme X of finite type over C and denote εX from now on by ε.
The main ingredient in showing that ε is a profinite homotopy equivalence is the following
classical result from [1]:
Theorem 4.7. [1, exposé XI.4 Theorem 4.3, Theorem 4.4, and exposé XVI.4, Theorem 4.1]
Let X be a scheme of finite type over C. Then
1) The analytification functor α : Xét → Topét /Xan induces an equivalence of categories
between finite étale maps over X and finite covering spaces of Xan .

2) ε induces an isomorphism in cohomology with coefficients in any local system of finite
abelian groups.
Recall that from Remark 2.15 that ε is a profinite homotopy equivalence if and only if for
every π-finite space V, the induced map
Γét ∆ét (V ) → Γan ∆an (V )
is an equivalence, where

are the unique geometric morphisms to the terminal ∞-topos S. Our method of proof will be
to first establish this for connected π-finite spaces by using induction on Postnikov towers.
First we will need a few lemmas:
Lemma 4.8. Let X be a connected scheme of finite type over C, and consider the geometric
morphism
ε : Sh (Xan ) → Sh (Xét ) .
Suppose that f : Y → X is a finite étale map. Then
ε∗ (fan ) ∼

Proof. Let g : Z → X be any étale map from a scheme, i.e. an object of Xét . Then we have
that
ε∗ (fan ) (g) = HomTopét /Xan (gan , fan ) .
Consider the pullback diagram

Since analytification preserves finite limits, we have

HomTopét /Xan (gan , fan ) ∼
= HomTopét /Zan (idZan , g ∗ (f )an ) ,

and g ∗ (f )an is a finite covering projection so, by Theorem 4.7, 1),
HomTopét /Zan (idZan , g ∗ (f )an ) ∼
= HomZét (idZ , g ∗ (f )) .
Finally, we can identify HomZét (idZ , g ∗ (f )) with HomXét (g, f ) , by using the pullback diagram for Z ×X Y. The result now follows.

Lemma 4.9. Let G be a finite group, and X a scheme of finite type over C. Then the
analytification functor
Xét → Topét /Xan

induces an equivalence of categories between the category of G-torsors on X and the category
of principal G-bundles over Xan .
Proof. Consider the geometric morphism
ε : Sh (Xan ) → Sh (Xét ) .

Suppose that P is a G-torsor on X, with underlying map P → X, which is a finite étale
map. The analytification functor sends this to Pan → Xan which is a finite covering map, and
since the analytification functor preserves finite limits, Pan inherits a fiber-wise G-action in
such a way that it makes it a principal G-bundle. It follows from Theorem 4.7, 1), that this
construction produces a fully faithful functor from G-torsors on X to principal G-bundles
over Xan . It suffices to show this is essentially surjective. Suppose that P′ is is a principal
G-bundle with underlying finite covering space π ′ : P ′ → Xan . By Theorem 4.7, 1), we may
assume this finite covering space is of the form πan for π : Q → X a finite étale map, and by
Lemma 4.8, we may further assume that π = ε∗ (π ′ ) . Denote by ∆an (G) the constant sheaf
of groups, and regard P′ as a ∆an (G)-torsor, i.e. as a sheaf EP in Sh (Xan ) equipped with a
∆an (G)-action such that the canonical map
∆an (G) × EP → EP × EP
is an isomorphism, where G denotes the underlying set of G. Note that ∆ét (G) is representable by the finite étale map
pr2 : G × X → X,

and the analytification of this map is

pr2 : G × Xan → Xan ,
which is the étalé space of ∆an (G) . It follows from Lemma 4.8 and the fact that ε∗ preserves
limits that
ε∗ (∆ (G)) ∼
= ∆ét (G) .
Moreover, ε∗ carries ∆an (G)-torsors in Sh (Xan ) to ∆ét (G)-torsors in Sh (Xét ) . The result
now follows.

Lemma 4.10. Let f : E → F be a geometric morphism of ∞-topoi and let A be an abelian
sheaf in F. Suppose that for all n ≥ 0, f induces an isomorphism in sheaf cohomology groups
∼

H n (F, A) −→ H n (E, f ∗ A) .
Then for all n, then induced map
ΓF (K (A, n)) → ΓE (K (f ∗ A, n))
is an equivalence of ∞-groupoids.

ON THE ÉTALE HOMOTOPY TYPE OF HIGHER STACKS

55

Proof. First of all, it follows immediately from [26, Remark 6.5.1.4] that
f ∗ K (A, n) = K (f ∗ A, n) ,
which explains the induced map above; it is induced by the functor f ∗ (since f ∗ preserves the
terminal object). Notice that for any abelian sheaf B on an ∞-topos X, for n > 0, K (B, n)
has the structure of a grouplike E∞ -object in X, and consequently,
ΓX (K (B, n)) = HomX (1, K (B, n))
is a grouplike E∞ -space. Let e : 1 → K (B, n) be the group unit. We can identify e with a
map from the one-point space
e

Let

∗ −→ HomX (1, K (B, n)) .
g

∗ −→ HomX (1, K (B, n))
be any other base point of the space HomX (1, K (B, n)) . Denote by [g] the image of g in
π0 (HomX (1, K (B, n))) . Note that π0 (HomX (1, K (B, n))) is a group, since the E∞ -space
HomX (1, K (B, n)) is grouplike. Now, for any n > 0, multiplication with [g] induces an
isomorphism
∼

πn (HomX (1, K (B, n)) , e) −→ πn (HomX (1, K (B, n)) , g) .

From this discussion, it suffice to prove in our situation, that

ΓF (K (A, n)) → ΓE (K (f ∗ A, n))

induces an isomorphism on π0 and on all higher homotopy groups at the canonical base point
e. So it suffices to show that for all k > 0 the induced map
π0 Ωke (ΓF (K (A, n))) → π0 Ωke (ΓE (K (f ∗ A, n)))

is an isomorphism.
Notice that the canonical base point e is in the image of the global sections functor ΓF ,
i.e.
e = ΓF (e) : ΓF (1) → ΓF (K (A, n)) ,
and since ΓF preserves finite limits, it then follows that

Ωke (ΓF (K (A, n))) ≃ ΓF Ωke ((K (A, n))) .
When k ≤ n, Ωke ((K (A, n))) ≃ K (A, n − k) and for k > n, it’s the terminal object.
Consequently, we have that
πk (ΓF (K (A, n)) , e) ∼
= π0 Ωk (ΓF (K (A, n))) ∼
= H n−k (F, A)
e

for k ≤ n, and otherwise is zero, and similarly for πk (ΓE (K (f ∗ A, n)) , e) . The result now
follows.

Proposition 4.11. Let X be a connected scheme of finite type over C. Then
ε : Sh∞ (Xan ) → Sh∞ (Xét )

is a profinite homotopy equivalence.

DAVID CARCHEDI

Proof. It suffices to prove that for every π-finite space, the induced map
Γét ∆ét (V ) → Γan ∆an (V )

is an equivalence of ∞-groupoids. Denote by C the full subcategory of S spanned by all spaces
V for which the above map is an equivalence. Note that since the functors Γét , ∆ét , Γan , ∆an
all preserve finite limits, if follows that C is closed under finite limits in S. Note by Theorem
4.7, 2), together with Lemma 4.10 it follows in particular that C contains all EilenbergMacLane spaces of the form K (A, n) , with A a finite abelian group. Also, it follows from
Lemma 4.9 that C contains all K (G, 1) for all finite groups G.
Fix a finite abelian group A and let n > 0 be an integer. We claim that BAut (K (A, n))
is also in C . Let us establish this claim. We have already seen that the canonical map
Γét ∆ét (K (Aut (A) , 1)) → Γan ∆an (K (Aut (A) , 1))

is an equivalence of ∞-groupoids. Consider the canonical map

ψ : BAut (K (A, n)) → K (Aut (A) , 1)

induced by identifying K (Aut (A) , 1) as the 1-truncation of BAut (K (A, n)) . It suffices to
prove that for every base point
τ : ∗ → Γét ∆ét (K (Aut (A) , 1)) ,

the induced maps between the (homotopy) fiber of
Γét ∆ét (ψ)
over τ and the (homotopy) fiber of

Γan ∆an (ψ)
over ε∗ τ is an equivalence of ∞-groupoids. Let Fn , denote the fiber of
Γét ∆ét (ψ)

Since ∆ét preserves finite limits, it follows from Lemma 3.10 that the following is a pullback

In light of this, by the pullback square at the end of the proof of Theorem 3.39, we have a
canonical identification
1 ×∆ét (K(Aut(A),1)) ∆ét (BAut (K (A, n))) ≃ K (Fτ , n + 1) ,

where Fτ is the abelian sheaf classified by the local system τ. In summary, we have that the
fiber of Γét ∆ét (ψ) over τ can canonically be identified with Γét (K (Fτ , n + 1)) . Hence the
induced map between fibers can be identified with the induced map
Γét (K (Fτ , n + 1)) → Γan (K (Fε∗ τ , n + 1)) .

By Theorem 4.7, 2), for all n, the induced map
∼

H n (Sh∞ (Xét ) , Fτ ) −→ H n (Sh∞ (Xan ) , Fε∗ τ )

is an isomorphism. The claim now follows from Lemma 4.10.
Since X is connected, it follows that so is Xan , and hence the terminal objects of both
Sh∞ (Xan ) and Sh∞ (Xét ) are connected, by Lemma 3.24. It follows then from Proposition
3.26 that both Γét and Γan preserve coproducts, and hence C is closed under coproducts in
S. This reduces our job to checking that
Γét ∆ét (V ) → Γan ∆an (V )

is an equivalence for all connected π-finite spaces.
Lets prove by induction on n that C contains all connected n-truncated π-finite spaces.
We have already established that this holds for n = 1. Suppose by hypothesis that n ≥ 2
and C contains all (n − 1)-truncated connected π-finite spaces. We wish to show that C
contains all n-truncated connected π-finite spaces. Let Z be such a space. Denote by Zn−1
the (n − 1)st -truncation of Z. Then Z → Zn−1 has fiber K (πn (Z) , n) . Let A be the abelian
group πn (Z) . Then by Proposition 3.7, we have a pullback square

The result now follows from Proposition 4.11.

This establishes the proof of Proposition 4.6. We now prove our main theorem:

ShapeProf ◦ HypSh∞ ( · ) ◦ ( · )top = i∗ ◦ Shape ◦ HypSh∞ ( · ) ◦ ( · )top .

By Lemma 4.5 we have an equivalence

Shape ◦ HypSh∞ ( · ) ≃ j ◦ Π∞ .

Furthermore, by definition the profinite completion functor

Corollary 4.14. Let X be an Artin stack locally of finite type over C, then there is an
equivalence of profinite spaces
b ét (X) ≃ Π
b ∞ (Xtop ) ,
Π

between the profinite étale homotopy type of X and the profinite completion of the homotopy
type of the underlying topological stack Xtop .
Example 4.15. Consider the moduli stack Mg,n of proper smooth curves of genus g with
n marked points, and let Γg,n be the mapping class group of a surface of genus g with n
marked points. Fix an embedding
Q ֒→ C.
Then it was shown in [33] that the homotopy type of the analytification of
Mg,n ⊗ Q

is that of BΓg,n . It follows that there is an equivalence of profinite spaces

b ét
\
Π
∞ Mg,n ⊗ Q ≃ BΓg,n .

An analogous result was shown in [33] using the machinery of étale homotopy type of Friedlander, and the notion of profinite completion of Artin-Mazur. Similarly, it follows from [9]
that

b ét Mg,n ⊗ Q ≃ BCL

Π

where Mg,n is the Deligne-Mumford compactification, and CLg,n is the Charney-Lee category.
Example 4.16. Consider the moduli stack of elliptic curves Mell , and fix an embedding
Q ֒→ C.
Then it is shown in [11] than the homotopy type of the analytification is that of BSL (2, Z) ,
from which it follows that

\
b ét Mell ⊗ Q ≃ BSL

As above, an analogous result was shown in the same paper, but using the machinery of
étale homotopy type of Friedlander, and the notion of profinite completion of Artin-Mazur.

Example
4.18. Let X be a fine saturated log scheme locally of finite type over C, and let

X be its infinite-root stack in the sense of [42]. (This is a pro-object in algebraic stacks).
It was shown in [6] that the homotopy type of the underlying (pro-)topological stack, after
profinite completion agrees with the Kato-Nakayama space Xlog of X in the sense of [21]. It
thus follows that

As the Kato-Nakayama space is only defined for log schemes over C, this suggests that the
