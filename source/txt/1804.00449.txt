Abstract. Consider n players having preferences over the connected pieces of a cake,
identified with the interval [0, 1]. A classical theorem due to Stromquist ensures under mild
conditions that it is possible to divide the cake into n connected pieces and assign these
pieces to the players in an envy-free manner, i.e, no player strictly prefers a piece that has
not been assigned to her. One of these conditions, considered as crucial, is that no player is
happy with an empty piece. We prove that, even if this condition is not satisfied, it is still
possible to get such a division when n is a prime number or is equal to 4. When n is at most
3, this has been previously proved by Erel Segal-Halevi, who conjectured that the result
holds for any n. The main step in our proof is a new combinatorial lemma in topology, close
to a conjecture by Segal-Halevi and which is reminiscent of the celebrated Sperner lemma:
Instead of restricting the labels that can appear on each face of the simplex, the lemma
considers labelings that enjoy a certain symmetry on the boundary.

1. Introduction
An instance of the envy-free cake-cutting problem consists in the following. We are given
n players, numbered from 1 to n, and a cake to be divided among them. Since the cake will
be cut with parallel knives, the cake is identified with the segment [0,1] so that knife cuts
are just points of this segment. A division of the cake is a partition of [0, 1] into finitely
many intervals of positive length, which we call nonempty pieces in this context. For each
player i, there is a preference function pi which, given a division D of the cake, returns a
subset of D ∪ {∅}. A nonempty piece I being in pi (D) means that player i is happy to get
I; the empty set ∅ being in pi (D) means that player i is happy to get an empty piece, i.e.,
to get nothing (e.g., each nonempty piece is partially burnt, a situation the player prefers to
avoid).
An envy-free division of the cake is a division D such that there exists a map π : [n] →
D ∪ {∅} (matching players and pieces) that satisfies the following three conditions:
(i) π(i) ∈ pi (D) for all i ∈ [n].
(ii) D ⊆ π([n]).
(iii) π(i) = π(i0 ) =⇒ (i = i0 or π(i) = ∅).
Condition (i) means that each player gets a piece she is happy with, condition (ii) means
that each piece is assigned to a player, and condition (iii) means that the same nonempty
piece cannot be assigned to two distinct players. We present now two assumptions on the
preference functions. When n is a prime number or is equal to 4, they will be enough to
ensure the existence of an envy-free division.
Consider a converging sequence (Dk ) of divisions with a fixed number of nonempty pieces.
The preference function pi satisfies the closed preferences assumption if the following holds:

when there is a converging sequence of pieces (P k ) (empty or not) with P k ∈ pi (Dk ) for all
k, then P ∞ ∈ pi (D∞ ), where D∞ and P ∞ are respectively limits of (Dk ) and (P k ). Here,
we have to explain which metrics are used for the convergence, but to ease the readability,
we postpone this discussion to the end of the introduction. We already emphasize that the
chosen metric makes that whether or not the endpoints belong to the intervals does not
matter.
The second assumption, which we call the full division assumption, ensures that when
|D| = n, then ∅ ∈
/ pi (D) for every player i. In other words, under this assumption, when
the cake has been divided into n intervals of positive length, then no player is happy with
an empty piece.
The following theorem is our main result. Without the condition on n, it has been conjectured by Erel Segal-Halevi [8], who proved it for at most n = 3 players.
Theorem 1. Consider an instance of the cake-cutting problem with the number n of players
being either a prime number or 4. If the preference function of every player satisfies the
closed preferences and the full division assumptions, then there exists an envy-free division.
It departs from the celebrated result by Walter Stromquist [9], which ensures the same
conclusion with the additional assumption that ∅ ∈
/ pi (D) for every player i in any case, even
when |D| < n, i.e., a player always strictly prefers a nonempty piece to an empty piece. This
additional condition is usually called the “hungry players” assumption and it has always been
considered as crucial for the conclusion to hold. In the literature, the divisions into at most
n pieces are represented by points in the standard (n − 1)-dimensional simplex ∆n−1 (these
points being the cut positions). The approach by Francis Su [10] consists in constructing a
triangulation of ∆n−1 and in labeling it. The “hungry players” assumption implies that the
labeling is a “Sperner labeling” and that Sperner lemma can be applied. It was thus very
surprising to discover that this condition is unnecessary when n = 3 at most, and that it
might even be unnecessary for larger n.
Without the full division assumption, an envy-free division (in the sense of conditions (i), (ii),
and (iii) above) is not necessarily achievable. Imagine for instance the situation where, no
matter which division D is chosen, we have pi (D) = {∅} for all i: every player strictly
prefers to get nothing instead of a piece of positive length (e.g., the cake has been poisoned).
Nevertheless, a division satisfying conditions (i) and (iii) always exists in this case, as shown
by an easy adaptation of Su’s proof, which we leave to the reader.
We do not know whether our theorem is still valid if n is neither 4, nor a prime number.
Our main step toward the proof of Theorem 1 is given by Sperner-type results, where the
usual boundary condition of the Sperner lemma is replaced by a symmetry condition. This
symmetry comes from the fact that, in the representation of divisions by points in ∆n−1 ,
divisions into at most n − 1 pieces admit several representatives. These Sperner-type results,
close to a conjecture by Segal-Halevi, are Theorem 2 and Proposition 1, stated and proved
in Section 2.
We finish this introduction by emphasizing that regarding existence of approximate envyfree divisions, our proof is constructive in a purely logical sense but does not directly provide
a path-following method. Usually, this kind of method is a by-product of the Sperner-like
approach (see Su [10, Section 5] or Frick et al. [3, Section 5] for the secretive version by
Asada et al. [2]).

Convergence of intervals and divisions. The metric we consider on the measurable
subsets of [0, 1] is the symmetric difference metric δ, which is defined for two measurable
subsets A, B of [0, 1] by δ(A, B) = µ(A4B), where µ is the Lebesgue measure. Note that
with the symmetric difference metric, ∅ is limit of a sequence of intervals whose length goes
to 0. The distance considered between two divisions D and D0 is then simply the Hausdorff
distance induced by δ between D ∪ {∅} and D0 ∪ {∅}.
As already mentioned, divisions are usually identified with points in the standard simplex
∆n−1 and not with partitions into intervals. It is mainly to ease the definition of convergence
and to avoid to deal with several representative of the limit that we chose to work with
partitions into intervals. Nevertheless, our theorem does imply Stromquist’s theorem when
n is a prime number or 4, and Segal-Halevi’s result for n = 2. Indeed, if the closed preferences
assumption is satisfied for the definition with points in the simplex, it is also satisfied for
our definition.
Remark. Another option for defining the divisions and the topology would have been to
consider

	
Dn−1 = (z1 , . . . , zn−1 ) ∈ Rn−1 : 0 6 z1 6 · · · 6 zn−1 6 1 / ∼,
where ∼ is the equivalence relation defined on Rn−1 by
0
0
(z1 , . . . , zn−1 ) ∼ (z10 , . . . , zn−1
) if and only if {z1 , . . . , zn−1 } = {z10 , . . . , zn−1
}.

Two points in Rn−1 are equivalent if the sets consisting of their coordinates are equal. The
space D2 is the classical dunce hat space. The spaces Dn−1 have been more systematically
studied by Andersen, Marjanović, and Schori [1], and generalized by Kozlov [5]. There is
an one-to-one correspondence between the points in Dn−1 and the divisions of the cake in
at most n pieces: the coordinates of a point in Dn−1 are the endpoints of the intervals
(except 0 and 1). The Hausdorff metric on Rn−1 is compatible with the equivalence relation
∼ and induces then a metric on Dn−1 . Convergences of divisions could have been considered
according to this metric: it does not change the topology. But we have not made this choice
because we have thought that it makes the description of the problem less intuitive and more
cumbersome.
2. “Sperner lemmas” with symmetries
The purpose of this section is to state and prove combinatorial fixed point results (Theorem 2 and Proposition 1) in the spirit of the Sperner lemma. One of these results, which
will play a crucial role in our proof of Theorem 1, is close to Conjecture 4.15 in the paper
by Segal-Halevi, who realized that it would be the main step to a proof of his conjecture
on cake-division. It deals with triangulations of ∆n−1 – the standard (n − 1)-dimensional
simplex – that satisfy some symmetry.
2.1. Statements. For each j ∈ [n], we introduce two maps. The first map is the permutation ρj on [n] defined by

if i = 1
 j
j
i − 1 if 2 6 i 6 j
ρ (i) =

i
if i > j + 1.
The second map, denoted rj , is the linear self-map of Rn defined by rj (ei ) = eρj (i) for
i = 1, . . . , n, where the ei are the unit vectors of the standard basis of Rn . Note that rj is a
3

bijection that induces a permutation of the facets of ∆n−1 , and that when j = 1, both maps
are the identity map.
Pn
n−1
We identify ∆n−1 with {(x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Rn+ :
defined by
i=1 xi = 1}. The facet of ∆
n−1
b
xj = 0 is the j-facet. Note that the vertices of ∆
are the ei ’s. For a point x ∈ ∆n−1 , we
define Jx to be the set of all j such that x belongs to the b
j-facet.
Triangulations and labelings considered in the paper will in general enjoy certain symmetries. We say that a triangulation T of ∆n−1 is nice if rj (σ) ∈ T for every j ∈ [n] and
every simplex σ ∈ T included in the b
1-facet. (Such triangulations are called “friendly” in
Segal-Halevi’s paper.) Similarly, consider a labeling
Λ of the vertices v of T with subsets of

j
j
[n]. We say such a labeling is nice if Λ r (v) = ρ Λ(v) for every j ∈ [n] and every vertex
v of T included in the b
1-facet.
Theorem 2. Let T be a nice triangulation of ∆n−1 and let Λ be a nice labeling of its vertices
with nonempty proper subsets of [n]. If n is a prime number, then there is an (n − 1)dimensional simplex τ ∈ T such that it is possible to pick a distinct label in each Λ(u) when
u runs over the vertices of τ .
We do not know whether Theorem 2 is true for any nonprime n. Up to additional conditions on the labeling, we are however able to prove that a special case holds when n = 4.
The supporting face supp(x) of a point x in ∆n−1 is the inclusion-minimal face of ∆n−1
containing this point. Two faces are comparable for inclusion if one of them is included in
the other (they can be equal).
Proposition 1. Let T be a nice triangulation of ∆3 such that the supporting faces of any
two adjacent vertices are comparable for inclusion. Suppose that Λ is a nice labeling of its
vertices with nonempty subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4} such that for every vertex v, the subset Λ(v) is
either Jv or a singleton not belonging to Jv . Then there is an 3-dimensional simplex τ ∈ T
such that it is possible to pick a distinct label in each Λ(u) when u runs over the vertices of
τ.
Replacing 4 by a prime number n in the statement of Proposition 1 leads to a valid result,
since such a result is a direct consequence of Theorem 2: this latter theorem requires much
weaker constraints on the triangulation and the labeling. For the proof of Theorem 1, such
a result would actually be enough, but we think that Theorem 2 has its own merit.
2.2. Preliminaries. For the proofs, we assume basic knowledge in algebraic topology; see
the book by Munkres [7], and especially Chapter 1 for the notions used hereafter (abstract
simplicial complexes, chains, chain maps, etc.). To that traditional tools, we add the following ones. Let R be the abstract simplicial complex whose vertices are the points of Rn
and whose maximal simplices are all possible n-subsets of Rn . (Note that R is an abstract
simplicial complex, two (n − 1)-dimensional simplices may have intersecting convex hulls,
and the vertices of a simplex can be aligned.) For an oriented (n − 1)-dimensional simplex
[v 1 , . . . , v n ] of R, we define det] ([v 1 , . . . , v n ]) to be det(v 1 , . . . , v n ). We extend then the
definition of det] by linearity for all elements in Cn−1 (R, Z).
The following generalization of the Sperner lemma will play a key role in the proof of Theorem 2 and Proposition 1. Contrary to the latter results, there is no particular assumption
on the triangulation T and on n.

Lemma 1. Let T be a coherently oriented triangulation of ∆n−1 . Consider a labeling λ of

λ(v) lies in the affine hull of supp(v). Then

where [v1 , . . . , vn ] runs over the positively oriented (n − 1)-dimensional simplices of T.
Proof. We proceed by induction on n. If n = 1, the result is immediate: λ(e1 ) = e1 .
Suppose n > 2 and let t be the element of Cn−1 (T, Z) that is the formal sum of all positively
oriented (n−1)-dimensional simplices of T. Our goal is to prove that (det] ◦λ] )(t) = 1, where
we interpret λ as a simplicial map from T to R.
Let proj : Rn → Rn−1 be the projection on the first n − 1 coordinates, defined by
 0
ei if i 6= n
proj(ei ) =
0 otherwise,
where the e0i are the unit vectors of the standard basis of Rn−1 . We interpret proj as a
simplicial map from R to R0 too, where R0 is the abstract simplicial complex whose vertices
are the points of Rn−1 and whose maximal simplices are the (n − 1)-subsets of Rn−1 .
Claim. The following equality holds: (det] ◦λ] ) = (−1)n−1 (det] ◦ proj] ◦∂ ◦ λ] ).
Proof. We prove the equality for an oriented simplex [v1 , . . . , vn ], which is enough to get the
conclusion. Define ai = (a1,i , . . . , an,i ) to be λ(vi ) and a0i to be proj(ai ). By definition of
proj, we have a0i = (a1,i , . . . , an−1,i ). If two of the ai ’s are equal, the left-hand and right-hand
terms of the equality to prove are both equal to zero when applied to the considered oriented
simplex. We can thus assume that all ai ’s are distinct.
Compute the left-hand term on the considered oriented simplex:
(det] ◦λ] )([v1 , . . . , vn ]) = det (a1 , . . . , an )

Similarly, compute the right-hand term on the considered oriented simplex:

(det] ◦ proj] ◦λ] )(tj ) = 0 when j 6= n. Therefore, (det] ◦λ] )(t) = (−1)n−1 (det] ◦ proj] ◦λ] )(tn ).
Let T0 be the triangulation of the n

|(det] ◦λ] )(t)| = 1.

A lemma by Yakar Kannai [4, Lemma 3] has the same condition and almost the same
conclusion as Lemma 1. Regarding the conclusion, the lemma of Kannai ensures the existence
of a subdivision of T for which the formula of Lemma 1 holds, while we know henceforth
that it holds for T itself.
Florian Frick (personal communication) noted that the approach by Andrew McLennan
and Rabee Tourky [6] for proving the Sperner lemma can also be used here to provide an
alternative proof of Lemma 1.
For a nonempty subset S of [n], we define the points bS = (bS1 , . . . , bSn ) of ∆n−1 by

 1 if i ∈ S
S
|S|
bi =


otherwise.
The point bS is the barycenter of the face whose vertex set is {ei : i ∈ S}. These points are
subject to two easy lemmas, which will be useful in the sequel.
Lemma 2. Suppose that S1 , . . . , Sn are nonempty subsets of [n] such that det(bS1 , . . . , bSn ) 6=
0. Then it is possible to pick in each Sj a distinct element of [n].
i
Proof. Since the determinant is nonzero, there is a permutation π of [n] such that bSπ(i)
is
nonzero for all i ∈ [n]. We have therefore π(i) ∈ Si for all i and all π(i)’s are distinct.

Lemma 4. We have det(rj ) = (−1)j−1 for all j.
Proof. The determinant is the sign of the permutation ρj . Denote by τ j the transposition
that interchanges j and j + 1. We have ρj+1 = τ j ◦ ρj . The conclusion follows from the fact
that the sign of ρ1 is 1 (it is the identity).

2.3. Proofs.
Proof of Theorem 2. We put a shrunk copy of T inside ∆n−1 . The non triangulated part of
∆n−1 admits a natural decomposition into n cells, each being the convex hull Cj of a b
j-facet
and its shrunk copy. We complete T in a triangulation T0 of ∆n−1 such that rj (σ) ∈ T0
for every j ∈ [n] and every simplex σ ∈ T0 included in C1 . In particular, T0 is nice. The
triangulation of Cj induced by T0 is denoted Cj .
(Such a triangulation T0 is easily achieved by keeping on ∂∆n−1 the triangulation induced
by T before it was shrunk, and then proceeding to a subdivision of the prisms induced by
the pairs σ 0 , σ, where σ 0 is an (n − 2)-dimensional simplex of ∂∆n−1 and σ is its shrunk copy.
This latter subdivision can be performed without adding new vertices in those simplices
σ, σ 0 .)
Now, we label the vertices v of T by λ(v) = bΛ(v) . For the other vertices u in V (T0 ) \ V (T),
we proceed as follows: we consider the radial projection u0 from the barycenter of ∆n−1 on
∂∆n−1 . We label then u by λ(u) = b{i(u)} = ei(u) , where i(u) is the minimal index of a
nonzero coordinate of the projection u0 . (The construction of T0 and of λ is illustrated for
n = 3 on Figure 1.)
The map λ satisfies obviously the condition of Lemma 1. We have thus
(1)

|(det] ◦λ] )(t0 )| = 1,

where t0 is the formal sum of all positively oriented (n − 1)-dimensional simplices of T0 . (As
in the proof of Lemma 1, the map λ is seen as a simplicial map T0 → R.)
7

On the other hand, we have by linearity
(2)

(det] ◦λ] )(t0 ) = (det] ◦λ] )(t) +

n
X

(det] ◦λ] )(cj ),

j=1

where t is the formal sum of all positively oriented (n − 1)-dimensional simplices of T and
cj the formal sum of all positively oriented (n − 1)-dimensional simplices of Cj . As for other
linear maps already met in this paper, we also interpret rj as a simplicial self-map of R.
Moreover, rj satisfies the following property.
Claim. The relation (λ ◦ rj )(v) = (rj ◦ λ)(v) is satisfied for all j and all v ∈ V (C1 ).
Proof. To ease the reading, we denote by Ω the barycenter of ∆n−1 (which is denoted b[n]
elsewhere in the paper).
For α > 0, the application aα that maps a point x of ∆n−1 to a point x0 such that
0
x = Ω + α(x − Ω) commutes with rj . This is because rj (Ω) = Ω. When we shrink T, we
are applying such a map and Lemma 3 implies then that (λ ◦ rj )(v) = (rj ◦ λ)(v) for all
v ∈ V (C1 ) ∩ V (T).
Consider now a vertex v ∈ V (C1 ) that is on the boundary of T0 and an integer j ∈ [n].
The ith and i0 th coordinates of v are nonzero if and only if the ρj (i) and ρj (i0 ) coordinates of
rj (v) are nonzero. In such a case, we have moreover that i < i0 if and only if ρj (i) < ρj (i0 ).
It implies that (λ ◦ rj )(v) = (rj ◦ λ)(v) for all v ∈ V (C1 ) that are on the boundary of T0 .
Finally, since aα and rj commutes, this holds for any other vertex in V (C1 ) as well.

definition of rj and to Lemma 4, the second equality comes from the claim above, and the
third one is again a consequence of Lemma 4.
Since Λ(v) is always a proper subset of [n], the rational number (det ◦λ)(σ) can always
be written as a fraction of integers, with a denominator being a product of integers smaller
than n. With Equalities (1) and (2), the fact that n is a prime implies that (det] ◦λ] )(t) is
nonzero. There is therefore at least one (n − 1)-dimensional simplex τ = [v1 , . . . , vn ] of T
such that det(λ(v1 ), . . . , λ(vn )) 6= 0. Lemma 2 shows then we can pick distinct labels in the
Λ(vi )’s when i runs over the integer 1, . . . , n.

Proof of Proposition 1. The proof is exactly the same as the one of Theorem 2, except the
last paragraph. Under the condition of Proposition 1, the rational number (det ◦λ)(σ) can
always be written as a fraction of integers, with a denominator equal to 3! = 6. With
8

Equalities (1) and (2), the fact that 4 does not divide 6 implies that (det] ◦λ] )(t) is nonzero.
The conclusion is then identical.

Remark. The proof above for Proposition 1 can be extended for values of n different from 4,
but to conclude that (det] ◦λ] )(t) is nonzero we need that n does not divide (n − 1)!, which
happens precisely when n is a prime number or is equal to 4. Therefore, it does not seem
that we can reach other values for n with the current approach.
3. Proof of the main theorem
With Theorem 2 and Proposition 1, the proof of Theorem 1 is more or less routine. We
start with a lemma that shows that triangulations satisfying the symmetry condition of
Theorem 2 and Proposition 1 exist and can have arbitrary small mesh size. This lemma
shows moreover that we can label the vertices of the triangulation with the players in a way
compatible with the symmetry. A labeling with the players is called “owner-labeling” by
Su [10], and “ownership-assignment” by Segal-Halevi [8].
Lemma 5. There exists a nice triangulation T of ∆n−1 of arbitrary small mesh size and a
labeling o : V (T) → [n] satisfying o(rj (v)) = o(v) for every vertex v of T in the b
1-facet and
such that adjacent vertices in T get distinct labels via o.
Moreover, such a triangulation can be built so that the supporting faces of any two adjacent
vertices are comparable for inclusion.
Proof. We repeat the barycentric subdivision operation starting with ∆n−1 as many times
as needed to get a triangulation T with a sufficiently small mesh size. This triangulation is
clearly nice.
The triangulation T is thus of the form sdN (∆n−1 ) for some positive integer N . Each
vertex v of T corresponds to a simplex of sdN −1 (∆n−1 ). Defining o(v) to be the dimension
of this simplex plus one shows that this labeling o is as required.

Proof of Theorem 1. Consider a nice triangulation T with a labeling o as in Lemma 5. For
a point x in ∆n−1 , we denote by D(x) the division of the cake obtained when the cake is
P
cut at positions X1 , . . . , Xn , where X` = `i=1 xi . (Remember that because of our metrics,
whether the endpoints belong or not to the pieces does not matter.)
We are going to define a labeling Λ of the vertices of T to which we are going to apply
Theorem 2 when n is a prime number and Proposition 1 when n = 4. This labeling will be
defined with the help of a set-valued map Li : ∆n−1 → 2[n] \ {∅} we introduce now.
Consider a point x in ∆n−1 . For each nonempty piece I in pi (D(x)), we put in Li (x) the
smallest index j such that Xj is the right endpoint of I. If ∅ ∈ pi (D(x)), then we add to
Li (x) the set Jx . Because of the full division assumption, Li (x) 6= ∅.
We define then

Jx
if Li (x) = Jx
Λi (x) =
{min (Li (x) \ Jx )} otherwise.
Note that if Li (x) 6= Jx , then Li (x) \ Jx 6= ∅, which ensures that Λi (x) is always either Jx
or a singleton made of an element not in Jx .
Claim. Given x in the b
1-facet of ∆n−1 , the equality Λi (rj (x)) = ρj (Λi (x)) holds for all i
and j.

Proof. Let y = rj (x) and Y` = `i=1 yi . Note that D(x) = D(y).
Suppose first that there is at least one nonempty piece in pi (D(x)). If ` is the smallest
index such that X` is the right endpoint of a nonempty piece, then ρj (`) is the smallest index
`0 such that Y`0 is the right endpoint of that same nonempty piece. This shows that in this
case Λi (y) = ρj (Λi (x)).
Suppose now that pi (D(x)) = {∅}. We have Λi (x) = Jx and Λi (y) = Jy . Since Jy =
ρj (Jx ) by definition of ρj , we have again Λi (y) = ρj (Λi (x)).

For a vertex v ∈ V (T) of coordinate x, we define Λ(v) to be Λo(v) (x). If v is in the b
1-facet,
we have

Λ(rj (v)) = Λo(rj (v)) (rj (x)) = Λo(v) (rj (x)) = ρj Λo(v) (x) = ρj (Λ(v)) ,
where x is the coordinate vector of v. The first equality is by definition, the second is by
Lemma 5, the third is the preceding claim, and the last is again by definition. Thus, Λ is
a nice labeling. Moreover, it satisfies the additional condition of Proposition 1. Theorem 2
and Proposition 1 can be applied and their conclusion holds: there is an (n − 1)-dimensional
τ of T such that it is possible to pick a distinct label in each Λ(u) when u runs over the
vertices of τ .
Lemma 5 allows to choose T of arbitrarily small mesh size. Compactness and the following
claim imply that there is a point x∗ = (x∗1 , . . . , x∗n ) of ∆n−1 such that it is possible to select
a distinct element from each Li (x∗ ) when i goes from 1 to n.
Claim. Let (xk ) be a sequence of points in ∆n−1 converging to a point x∞ . If j ∈ Λi (xk )
for all k, then j ∈ Li (x∞ ).
Proof. We assume without loss of generality that all Jxk are equal (for finite k) and denote
by J this subset. We have Jx∞ ⊇ J. Consider a j that is in all Λi (xk ).

Suppose now that j ∈ Jx∞ \ J. The intervals (Xj−1

interval (Xj−1

The closed preferences assumption implies then that ∅ ∈ pi (D(x∞ )). In such a case, by
definition of Li , we have j ∈ Li (x∞ ).
Suppose finally that j ∈ J. By definition of Λi , it means that ∅ ∈ pi (D(xk )) for all k.
Since δ(∅, ∅) = 0, we get that ∅ ∈ pi (D(x∞ ) and thus j ∈ Li (x∞ ).

We finish the proof by showing that D(x∗ ) is an envy-free division. Denote by ji pairwise
distinct elements selected in the Li (x∗ ) when i goes from 1 to n. If (Xj∗i −1 , Xj∗i ) ∈ pi (D(x∗ )),
define π(i) = (Xj∗i −1 , Xj∗i ). Otherwise, define π(i) = ∅. By definition of Li , we have π(i) ∈
pi (D(x∗ )) (item (i) is satisfied). Since {ji : i ∈ [n]} = [n], each nonempty piece is equal to
10

some π(i) (item (ii) is satisfied). Finally, if π(i) = π(i0 ), we have π(i) = ∅ because otherwise
ji would be equal to ji0 (item (iii) is satisfied).
