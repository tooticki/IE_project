LEIBNIZ ALGEBRAS AS NON-ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS
JÖRG FELDVOSS
Abstract. In this paper we define the basic concepts for left or right Leibniz
algebras and prove some of the main results. Our proofs are often variations
of the known proofs and several results seem to be new.

Introduction
This paper is mainly a survey on (left or right) Leibniz algebras from the point
of view of the theory of non-associative (i.e., not necessarily associative) algebras,
but there are also several new results. Leibniz algebras were first introduced by
Bloh in the mid sixties of the last century (see [11, 12, 13]) and then forgotten
for nearly thirty years. In the early 1990’s they were rediscovered by Loday who
together with his students and collaborators developed much of the theory of Leibniz
algebras, Leibniz bimodules, and Leibniz cohomology (see, for example, [33, 34,
20]). A left (resp. right) Leibniz algebra is a vector space with a multiplication
for which every left (resp. right) multiplication operator is a derivation (i.e., a
linear operator satisfying the usual Leibniz product rule). As such Leibniz algebras
are non-anticommutative versions of Lie algebras. In particular, Leibniz algebras
are examples of non-associative algebras (see [42]). In contrast to other papers
on this topic, we study Leibniz algebras exclusively from this point of view. We
have tried to make the paper sufficiently self-contained so that it could serve as
a first introduction to Leibniz algebras, their modules (or representations), and
their cohomology. Leibniz algebras play an important role in different areas of
mathematics and physics (see [33]). In the last three decades numerous papers
on Leibniz algebras appeared and many results were duplicated. In this paper
we develop the basics of the theory of Leibniz algebras in a systematic way by
considering them as a special class of non-associative algebras. In the following we
will describe the contents of the paper in more detail.
The first section is devoted to some background material on non-associative
algebras which will be useful for the rest of the paper. In particular, we introduce
the concept of a radical of an arbitrary algebra and prove three of its properties
that can be used as axioms for such a concept. We refer the reader to [42] for more
details and most of the proofs.

In the second section we give the definition of left resp. right Leibniz algebras
and prove some basic results. We use several low-dimensional Leibniz algebras to
illustrate the concepts to be introduced and the results to be proved. Among other
topics, we define the (left/right) center and the Leibniz kernel of a Leibniz algebra.
The latter measures how far a Leibniz algebra deviates from being a Lie algebra.
Moreover, we associate several Lie algebras to a Leibniz algebra and discuss how
these are related to each other. We include an example showing that left or right
Leibniz algebras are not necessarily power-associative. This falsifies a claim by
Barnes in [6]. On the other hand, we prove that algebras satisfying the left and
the right Leibniz identity are flexible, power-associative, and nil. The terms of the
derived series of an arbitrary algebra are usually only subalgebras. At the end of
the second section we show that for left or right Leibniz algebras each term of their
derived series is an ideal.
Section 3 contains definitions of left Leibniz modules and Leibniz bimodules
of a left Leibniz algebra. In particular, following Eilenberg [26] we motivate the
defining identities of a Leibniz bimodule by considering abelian extensions of a left
Leibniz algebra. We prove some basic properties of Leibniz bimodules following
mainly Loday [33, 34] who introduced and investigated Leibniz bimodules for a
right Leibniz algebra. In addition, we also briefly discuss trace forms of left Leibniz
modules (see also [2] and [21]). Similarly to the Leibniz kernel of a Leibniz algebra,
we introduce the anti-symmetric kernel of a Leibniz bimodule. Using this concept,
we give a very short “Schur’s lemma type” proof of the fact that irreducible Leibniz
bimodules are either symmetric or anti-symmetric (see also the proof of Theorem 3.1
in [27]). Note that this proof neither needs to assume that the Leibniz algebra is
finite dimensional nor that the Leibniz bimodule is finite dimensional as in [7,
Theorem 1.4]). In the fourth section we define the cohomology of a left Leibniz
algebra in analogy to the cohomology of a right Leibniz algebra in [33, 34], and
describe the Leibniz cohomology spaces in degree 0 and 1. We also show explicitly
how Leibniz 2-cocycles give rise to abelian extensions of left Leibniz algebras.
The remaining three sections of the paper are devoted to several results for nilpotent, solvable, and semisimple Leibniz algebras, respectively. We give variants of
the known proofs of Engel’s and Lie’s theorem for Leibniz algebras as well as derive
some of their applications. Furthermore, we prove Cartan’s solvability criterion for
Leibniz algebras. We characterize the nilpotency and solvability of a Leibniz algebra
in terms of the nilpotency and solvability of their associated Lie algebras, respectively. These results seem to be new. In the last section we derive some structural
properties of (semi)simple Leibniz algebras and explain that the first Whitehead
lemma does not hold for non-Lie Leibniz algebras. In a previous version of this
paper we derived the second Whitehead lemma for Leibniz algebras from Levi’s
theorem for Leibniz algebras along the lines of the proof of [42, Proposition 3.22].
Unfortunately, our proof was not correct. We are very grateful to Bakhrom Omirov
for bringing this to our attention.
In this paper all algebras are defined over a field. For a subset X of a vector
space V over a field F we let hXiF be the subspace of V that is spanned by X. We
use the Lie bracket [−, −] for the commutator of linear operators or matrices. The
identity function on a set S will be denoted by idS , the set of non-negative integers
will be denoted by N0 , and the set of positive integers will be denoted by N.

1. Non-associative algebras
In this section we briefly recall some of the definitions and results on nonassociative algebras that we will need in the remainder of the paper. For more
details and most of the proofs we refer the reader to [42].
An algebra A is a vector space over a field with a bilinear mapping A × A → A,
(x, y) 7→ xy, the multiplication of A. The usual definitions of the concepts of
subalgebra, left or right ideal , ideal (= left and right ideal), homomorphism, isomorphism, etc., are the same as for associative algebras since they do not use the
associativity of the multiplication. Moreover, the fundamental homomorphism theorem, the isomorphism theorems, and the correspondence theorems for subalgebras
and for one-sided or two-sided ideals, respectively, continue to hold with the same
proofs as in the associative case.
Let S and T be two non-empty subsets of an algebra A over a field F. Then
ST := hst | s ∈ S, t ∈ TiF
is the F-subspace of A spanned by the products st. In particular, S2 := SS (see
[42, p. 9]).
The derived series of subalgebras
A(0) ⊇ A(1) ⊇ A(2) ⊇ · · ·
of A is defined recursively by A(0) := A and A(n+1) := (A(n) )2 for every non-negative
integer n.
Note that A(m+n) = (A(m) )(n) for all non-negative integers m and n. Moreover,
if φ : A → B is a homomorphism of algebras, then φ(A(n) ) = φ(A)(n) for every
non-negative integer n.
An algebra A is called solvable if A(r) = 0 for some non-negative integer r. An
algebra A is called abelian if AA = 0.
The next result is an immediate consequence of the compatibility of homomorphisms of algebras with the derived series.
Proposition 1.1. Subalgebras and homomorphic images of solvable algebras are
solvable.
The following results are well-known (see [42, Proposition 2.2 and 2.3]).
Proposition 1.2. Extensions of solvable algebras by solvable algebras are solvable.
Proposition 1.3. The sum of two solvable ideals of an algebra is solvable.
Let A be a finite-dimensional algebra, and let R be a solvable ideal of maximal
dimension. If I is any solvable ideal of A, then it follows from Proposition 1.3 that
R + I is a solvable ideal of A. Since R ⊆ R + I, for dimension reasons we have that
R = R + I, and thus I ⊆ R. This shows that R is the largest solvable ideal of A.
The ideal R is called the radical of the algebra A and will be denoted by Rad(A).
Proposition 1.4. Every finite-dimensional algebra A contains a largest solvable
ideal Rad(A) satisfying the following properties:
(a) Rad(Rad(A)) = Rad(A).
(b) Rad(A/Rad(A)) = 0.
(c) If φ : A → B is a homomorphism of algebras, then φ(Rad(A)) ⊆ Rad(φ(A)).

Proof. (a) follows from the solvability of Rad(A), and (c) is an immediate consequence of Proposition 1.1.
(b): According to the correspondence theorem for ideals, there exists an ideal I
of A such that Rad(A) ⊆ I and Rad(A/Rad(A)) = I/Rad(A). This implies that
I/Rad(A) is solvable, and therefore Proposition 1.2 yields that I is solvable. Hence
I ⊆ Rad(A), and so Rad(A/Rad(A)) = 0.

Let a ∈ A be an arbitrary element. Then the left multiplication operator La :
A → A, x 7→ ax is linear and
L(A) := {La | a ∈ A}
is a subspace of the associative algebra End(A) of linear operators on A. Similarly,
the right multiplication operator Ra : A → A, x 7→ xa is linear and
R(A) := {Ra | a ∈ A}
is a subspace of End(A). Let Mult(A) denote the subalgebra of End(A) that is
generated by L(A) ∪ R(A), the associative multiplication algebra of A (see [42,
Section 2 in Chapter II]). Let gl(A) := End(A)− denote the general linear Lie
algebra on the underlying vector space of A with the commutator [X, Y ] := X ◦
Y − Y ◦ X as Lie bracket. Moreover, let Lie(A) denote the subalgebra of gl(A) that
is generated by L(A) ∪ R(A), the Lie multiplication algebra of A (see [42, Section 3
in Chapter II]). Finally, let
Der(A) := {D ∈ End(A) | ∀ x, y ∈ A : D(xy) = D(x)y + xD(y)}
denote the derivation algebra of A. Note that Der(A) is a subalgebra of gl(A), and
therefore Der(A) is another Lie algebra associated to A.
An algebra A is called nilpotent if there exists a positive integer n such that any
product of n elements in A, no matter how associated, is zero. This generalizes the
concept of nilpotency for associative algebras. Note that every nilpotent algebra
is solvable (see [42, p. 18]). For any subset S of an algebra A let S∗ denote the
subalgebra of Mult(A) generated by {Ls : A → A | s ∈ S} ∪ {Rs : A → A |
s ∈ S}. Then an ideal I of A is nilpotent if, and only if, I∗ is nilpotent (see
[42, Theorem 2.4]). In particular, A is nilpotent if, and only if, Mult(A) = A∗ is
nilpotent.
An algebra A is called flexible if Lx ◦ Rx = Rx ◦ Lx holds for every element x ∈ A,
or equivalently, if the identity x(yx) = (xy)x is satisfied for all elements x, y ∈ A
(see [42, p. 28]). An algebra A is called power-associative if any subalgebra of A
generated by one element is associative (see [42, p. 30]). In this case one can define
powers of an element x ∈ A recursively by x1 := x and xn+1 := xxn for every
positive integer n. These powers then satisfy the usual power laws xm+n = xm xn
and (xm )n = xmn (see [42, p. 30]). Alternative algebras, Jordan algebras, and Lie
algebras are flexible and power-associative (see [42, pp. 28, 30, and 92]).
An element x of a power-associative algebra is called nilpotent if xn = 0 for
some positive integer n. A subset of a power-associative algebra consisting only of
nilpotent elements is called nil (see [42, p. 30]). Note that every solvable powerassociative algebra is nil (see [42, p. 31]).
The opposite algebra Aop of an algebra A with multiplication (x, y) 7→ xy has
the same underlying vector space structure and the opposite multiplication (x, y) 7→
x · y := yx. Since the derived series of Aop coincides with the derived series of A,

the opposite algebra of a solvable algebra is solvable. Moreover, it is clear from the
definition of nilpotency, that the opposite algebra of a nilpotent algebra is nilpotent.
2. Leibniz algebras – Definition and Examples
A left Leibniz algebra is an algebra L such that every left multiplication operator
Lx : L → L, y 7→ xy is a derivation. This is equivalent to the identity
(2.1)

x(yz) = (xy)z + y(xz)

for all x, y, z ∈ L, the left Leibniz identity, which in turn is equivalent to the identity
(2.2)

(xy)z = x(yz) − y(xz)

for all x, y, z ∈ L.
Similarly, one defines a right Leibniz algebra to be an algebra L such that every
right multiplication operator Ry : L → L, x 7→ xy is a derivation. This is equivalent
to the identity
(2.3)

(xy)z = (xz)y + x(yz)

for all x, y, z ∈ L, the right Leibniz identity, which in turn is equivalent to the
identity
(2.4)

x(yz) = (xy)z − (xz)y

for all x, y, z ∈ L.
Following Mason and Yamskulna [36] we call an algebra a symmetric Leibniz
algebra if it is at the same time a left and a right Leibniz algebra. Note that every
Lie algebra is a symmetric Leibniz algebra.
It is clear that the opposite algebra of a left Leibniz algebra is a right Leibniz
algebra and that the opposite algebra of a right Leibniz algebra is a left Leibniz
algebra. Consequently, the opposite algebra of a symmetric Leibniz algebra is again
a symmetric Leibniz algebra. Therefore, in most situations it is enough to consider
only left or right Leibniz algebras.
The following results are direct consequences of the left and right Leibniz identity,
respectively.
Lemma 2.1. If L is a left Leibniz algebra, then Lx2 = 0 for every element x ∈ L.
Lemma 2.2. If L is a right Leibniz algebra, then Rx2 = 0 for every element x ∈ L.
Proof. We only prove Lemma 2.1 as this yields Lemma 2.2 by considering the
opposite algebra. Let x, y ∈ L be arbitrary elements. Then we obtain from identity
(2.2) that
Lx2 (y) = x2 y = x(xy) − x(xy) = 0 ,
which shows that Lx2 = 0.

Every abelian (left or right) Leibniz algebra is a Lie algebra, but there are many
Leibniz algebras that are not Lie algebras (see, for example, [20, 4, 5, 25, 1, 2, 3,
37, 18, 28, 32, 16, 15, 17, 21, 22, 23]). We will use the following three examples to
illustrate the concepts introduced in this section.

6

JÖRG FELDVOSS

Examples.
(1) Let Aℓ := Fe ⊕ Ff be a two-dimensional vector space with multiplication
ee = f e = f f = 0, and ef = f . Then Aℓ is a left Leibniz algebra, but not
(1)
(2)
a right Leibniz algebra. We have that Aℓ = Ff and Aℓ = 0. Hence Aℓ
is solvable.
(2) Let N := Fe ⊕ Ff be a two-dimensional vector space with multiplication
ee = ef = f e = 0, and f f = e. Then N is a symmetric Leibniz algebra.
We will see in Section 5 that N is nilpotent.
(3) Let Sℓ := sl2 (C)×L(1), where sl2 (C) is the Lie algebra of traceless complex
2 × 2 matrices and L(1) is the two-dimensional left sl2 (C)-module (see [30,
Lemma 7.2]). Then Sℓ with multiplication (X, a)(Y, b) := ([X, Y ], X · b)
for any X, Y ∈ sl2 (C) and any a, b ∈ L(1) is a left Leibniz algebra (see
Section 3 and Lemma 4.7)1. Moreover, it can be shown that Sℓ is simple
(see Section 7 for the definition of the simplicity of Leibniz algebras).
Remark. One can prove that up to isomorphism Aℓ , Aop
ℓ , and N are the only
two-dimensional non-Lie left or right Leibniz algebras (see [21, pp. 11/12]).
Let L be a left or right Leibniz algebra. Then
Cℓ (L) := {c ∈ L | Lc = 0} = {c ∈ L | ∀ x ∈ L : cx = 0}
is called the left center of L,
Cr (L) := {c ∈ L | Rc = 0} = {c ∈ L | ∀ x ∈ L : xc = 0}
is called the right center of L, and
C(L) := Cℓ (L) ∩ Cr (L)
2

is called the center of L.

Remark. For a Lie algebra the left center, the right center, and the center are all
the same.
It is an immediate consequence of the definitions that the left center is a right
ideal and the right center is a left ideal. More precisely, we have the following
results.
Proposition 2.3. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra. Then LCℓ (L) ⊆ Cℓ (L) and
Cℓ (L)L = 0. In particular, Cℓ (L) is an abelian ideal of L.
Proposition 2.4. Let L be a right Leibniz algebra. Then Cr (L)L ⊆ Cr (L) and
LCr (L) = 0. In particular, Cr (L) is an abelian ideal of L.
Proof. We only prove Proposition 2.3 as this yields Proposition 2.4 by considering
the opposite algebra. Let c ∈ Cℓ (L) and x, y ∈ L be arbitrary elements. Then we
obtain from identity (2.2) that
Lxc (y) = (xc)y = x(cy) − c(xy) = xLc (y) − Lc (xy) = 0 ,
1This is known as the hemi-semidirect product of sl (C) and L(1) (see [38, Definition 1.5]).
2
2Note that, as for Lie algebras, the given definition of the center of a left or right Leibniz

algebra is not the one used for other non-associative algebras (see [42, p. 14]). The reason for this
is that, in general, Leibniz algebras, contrary to alternative algebras or Jordan algebras, are far
away from being associative (see Proposition 2.15 and Proposition 2.16).

which shows that Lxc = 0, i.e., xc ∈ Cℓ (L). This proves the first statement,
and the second statement is an immediate consequence of the definition of the left
center.

Examples.
(1) For the two-dimensional solvable left Leibniz algebra Aℓ from Example 1
we have that Cℓ (Aℓ ) = Ff and Cr (Aℓ ) = Fe. Hence C(Aℓ ) = 0.
(2) For the two-dimensional nilpotent symmetric Leibniz algebra N from Example 2 we have that C(N) = Cℓ (N) = Cr (N) = Fe.
(3) For the five-dimensional simple left Leibniz algebra Sℓ from Example 3 we
have that Cℓ (Sℓ ) = L(1) and Cr (Sℓ ) = 0. Hence C(Sℓ ) = 0.
Let L be a left or right Leibniz algebra over a field F. Then
Leib(L) := hx2 | x ∈ LiF
is called the Leibniz kernel of L. The Leibniz kernel measures how far a left or
right Leibniz algebra deviates from being a Lie algebra. In particular, a left or
right Leibniz algebra is a Lie algebra if, and only if, its Leibniz kernel vanishes.
The following results are well-known (see [20, Proposition 1 (a)], [19, Proposition 1.1.4], and [7, Lemma 1.3 and its proof]).
Proposition 2.5. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra. Then LLeib(L) ⊆ Leib(L) and
Leib(L) ⊆ Cℓ (L).
Proposition 2.6. Let L be a right Leibniz algebra. Then Leib(L)L ⊆ Leib(L) and
Leib(L) ⊆ Cr (L).
Corollary 2.7. If L is a symmetric Leibniz algebra, then Leib(L) ⊆ C(L).
Proof. We only prove Proposition 2.6 as this yields Proposition 2.5 by considering
the opposite algebra. As Cr (L) is a subspace of L, the second statement is an
immediate consequence of Lemma 2.2.
Since Leib(L) is a subspace of L, it is enough for the proof of the first statement
to show that x2 y ∈ Leib(L) for any elements x, y ∈ L. By using again Lemma 2.2,
we obtain that
(x2 + y)2 = (x2 + y)(x2 + y) = x2 x2 + x2 y + yx2 + y 2 = x2 y + y 2 ,
and therefore x2 y = (x2 + y)2 − y 2 ∈ Leib(L).



Examples.
(1) For the two-dimensional solvable left Leibniz algebra Aℓ from Example 1
we have that Leib(Aℓ ) = Ff = Cℓ (Aℓ ). Moreover, Leib(Aℓ ) ∩ Cr (Aℓ ) = 0.
(2) For the two-dimensional nilpotent symmetric Leibniz algebra N from Example 2 we have that Leib(N) = Fe = Cℓ (N) = Cr (N) = C(N).
(3) For the five-dimensional simple left Leibniz algebra Sℓ from Example 3 we
have that Leib(Sℓ ) = L(1) = Cℓ (Sℓ ). Moreover, Leib(Sℓ ) ∩ Cr (Sℓ ) = 0.
Remark. Let L be the two-dimensional solvable left Leibniz algebra from Example 1 or the five-dimensional simple left Leibniz algebra from Example 3. We have
that LLeib(L) = Leib(L). This shows that for a left Leibniz algebra L, LLeib(L)
can be non-zero and LLeib(L) is not necessarily properly contained in Leib(L). Of
course, a similar statement holds for right Leibniz algebras. But for a symmetric
Leibniz algebra L we have that LLeib(L) = 0 = Leib(L)L as Leib(L) ⊆ C(L).

The following result is a consequence of Proposition 2.5 or Proposition 2.6 (see
[21, p. 11] and [27, p. 479]).
Proposition 2.8. Let L be a left or right Leibniz algebra. Then Leib(L) is an
abelian ideal of L. Moreover, if L 6= 0, then Leib(L) 6= L.
Proof. It follows from Proposition 2.5 or Proposition 2.6 that in either case Leib(L)
is an ideal of L such that Leib(L)Leib(L) = 0.
Suppose now that Leib(L) = L. Then we have that LL = 0. In particular, every
square of L is zero. Consequently, we obtain that L = Leib(L) = 0.

Remark: It is an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.8 that every onedimensional left or right Leibniz algebra is a Lie algebra. Moreover, with a little
more work one can use Proposition 2.8 to classify the two-dimensional left or right
Leibniz algebras (see [21, pp. 11/12]).
Let L be a left or right Leibniz algebra. Then by definition of the Leibniz kernel,
LLie := L/Leib(L) is a Lie algebra. We call LLie the canonical Lie algebra associated
to L. In fact, the Leibniz kernel is the smallest ideal with this property (see [27,
Theorem 2.5]).
Proposition 2.9. Let L be a left or right Leibniz algebra. Then Leib(L) is the
smallest ideal I of L such that L/I is a Lie algebra.
Proof. Suppose that I is an ideal of L such that L/I is a Lie algebra. Then it
follows from the anti-commutativity of L/I that x2 ∈ I for every element x ∈ L.
Since I is a subspace of L, we conclude that Leib(L) ⊆ I.

Proposition 2.10. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra. Then the set L(L) of left
multiplication operators of L is an ideal of the derivation algebra Der(L) of L, and
L/Cℓ (L) is a Lie algebra that is isomorphic to L(L).
Proof. By definition of a left Leibniz algebra, L(L) ⊆ Der(L). Since the multiplication of L is bilinear, L(L) is a subspace of Der(L).
Let x, y ∈ L and D ∈ Der(L) be arbitrary elements. Then the computation
[D, Lx ](y) = (D ◦ Lx − Lx ◦ D)(y) = D(xy) − xD(y) = D(x)y = LD(x) (y)
shows that [D, Lx ] = LD(x) ∈ Der(L) for any element x ∈ L and any derivation
D ∈ Der(L). This completes the proof that L(L) is an ideal of Der(L).
Now consider the linear transformation L : L → Der(L) defined by x 7→ Lx . By
definition, Ker(L) = Cℓ (L) and Im(L) = L(L). Finally, it follows from the identity
[D, Ly ] = LD(y) that Lxy = LLx (y) = [Lx , Ly ] for any elements x, y ∈ L, and thus
L is a homomorphism of Leibniz algebras. Then the fundamental homomorphism
theorem shows that L induces a Leibniz algebra isomorphism from L/Cℓ (L) onto
L(L).

Remark. I am very grateful to Friedrich Wagemann for pointing out to me the
four-term exact sequence of left Leibniz algebras
L

0 → Cℓ (L) → L → Der(L) → Outℓ (L) → 0 ,
where Outℓ (L) := Der(L)/L(L) is the Lie algebra of outer derivations of the left
Leibniz algebra L, and in which only L is not necessarily a Lie algebra (see [24,
Proposition 1.8]).

By combining Proposition 2.5 and Proposition 2.10 with the fundamental homomorphism theorem we obtain the following result.
Corollary 2.11. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra. Then the set L(L) of left multiplication operators of L is a homomorphic image of LLie .
The first part of the next result is [27, Theorem 2.3].
Proposition 2.12. Let L be a right Leibniz algebra. Then the set R(L) of right
multiplication operators of L is an ideal of the derivation algebra Der(L) of L, and
L/Cr (L) is a Lie algebra that is isomorphic to R(L)op .
Proof. The proof of Proposition 2.12 is very similar to the proof of Proposition 2.10.
Nevertheless, we include the whole argument in this case as well, since it shows why
left multiplication operators are preferable when one writes functions on the left of
their arguments.
By definition of a right Leibniz algebra, R(L) ⊆ Der(L). Since the multiplication
of L is bilinear, R(L) is a subspace of Der(L).
Let x, y ∈ L and D ∈ Der(L) be arbitrary elements. Then the computation
[D, Rx ](y) = (D ◦ Rx − Rx ◦ D)(y) = D(yx) − D(y)x = yD(x) = RD(x) (y)
shows that [D, Rx ] = RD(x) ∈ Der(L) for any element x ∈ L and any derivation
D ∈ Der(L). This completes the proof that R(L) is an ideal of Der(L).
Now consider the linear transformation R : L → Der(L) defined by x 7→ Rx . By
definition, Ker(R) = Cr (L) and Im(R) = R(L). Finally, it follows from the identity
[D, Rx ] = RD(x) that Rxy = RRy (x) = [Ry , Rx ] for any elements x, y ∈ L that R is
an anti-homomorphism of Leibniz algebras. Then the fundamental homomorphism
theorem shows that R induces a Leibniz algebra isomorphism from L/Cr (L) onto
R(L)op .

Remark. Similarly to [24, Proposition 1.8], we obtain from the proof of Proposition 2.12 the four-term exact sequence of right Leibniz algebras
R

0 → Cr (L) → L → Der(L)op → Outr (L)op → 0 ,
where Outr (L) := Der(L)/R(L) is the Lie algebra of outer derivations of the right
Leibniz algebra L, and in which only L is not necessarily a Lie algebra.
By combining Proposition 2.6 and Proposition 2.12 with the fundamental homomorphism theorem we obtain the following result.
Corollary 2.13. Let L be a right Leibniz algebra. Then the set R(L) of right
multiplication operators of L is a homomorphic image of Lop
Lie .
The Lie multiplication algebra of a Leibniz algebra can be described as follows.
This generalizes the corresponding result for Lie algebras (see [42, p. 21]).
Theorem 2.14. The Lie multiplication algebra Lie(L) = L(L) + R(L) of a symmetric Leibniz algebra L is an ideal of the derivation algebra Der(L) of L.
Proof. Recall that the Lie multiplication algebra Lie(L) of the symmetric Leibniz
algebra L is the smallest subalgebra of the general linear Lie algebra gl(L) that
contains L(L) ∪ R(L). It follows from Proposition 2.10 and Proposition 2.12 that
L(L) and R(L) are ideals of Der(L). But as a sum of ideals L(L) + R(L) is an ideal
of Der(L), and thus a subalgebra of Der(L) which in turn is a subalgebra of gl(L).
This shows that Lie(L) = L(L) + R(L).

Example. Let N be the two-dimensional nilpotent symmetric Leibniz algebra from
Example 2. Then L(N) = Ff = R(N), and therefore Lie(N) = Ff . On the other
hand, Leib(N) = Fe, and thus NLie ∼
= Ff ∼
= Lie(N).
Question. What is the relationship between the canonical Lie algebra LLie associated to a symmetric Leibniz algebra L and the Lie multiplication algebra Lie(L)
of L?
The following results generalize [14, Exercise I.1.6] from Lie algebras to left
or right Leibniz algebras. As in the case of Lie algebras these are an immediate
consequence of the left or right Leibniz identity, respectively. Note the mixture of
left and right in both propositions which we will see again in Proposition 5.9 and
Proposition 5.10.
Proposition 2.15. A left Leibniz algebra L is associative if, and only if, L2 ⊆
Cr (L).
Proposition 2.16. A right Leibniz algebra L is associative if, and only if, L2 ⊆
Cℓ (L).
These results show that, in general, left or right Leibniz algebras are far from
being associative. In fact, it follows from Proposition 5.9 and Proposition 5.10
below that associative left or right Leibniz algebras are nilpotent.
Examples.
(1) For the two-dimensional solvable left Leibniz algebra Aℓ from Example 1
we have that A2ℓ = Ff and Cr (Aℓ ) = Fe. Hence Aℓ is not associative.
(2) For the two-dimensional nilpotent symmetric Leibniz algebra N from Example 2 we have that N2 = Fe = Cℓ (N) = Cr (N). Hence N is associative.
(3) For the five-dimensional simple left Leibniz algebra Sℓ from Example 3 we
have that S2ℓ = Sℓ and Cr (Sℓ ) = 0. Hence Sℓ is not associative.
In the sentence after the proof of [6, Corollary 1.3] Barnes claims that left Leibniz algebras are power-associative. But the following example shows that this is
not always the case. Let Aℓ denote the two-dimensional left Leibniz algebra from
Example 1. Then
(e + f )2 (e + f ) = 0 6= f = (e + f )(e + f )2 ,
which yields that Aℓ is not power-associative.
The following result shows that Barnes’ claim holds for symmetric Leibniz algebras. In fact, as Lie algebras, such algebras are flexible.
Proposition 2.17. Every symmetric Leibniz algebra is flexible and power-associative.
Moreover, x3 = 0 for every element x.
Proof. Let L be any symmetric Leibniz algebra. It follows from Lemma 2.2 that
yx2 = 0 for any elements x and y of a right Leibniz algebra. Hence the left Leibniz
identity for L yields x(yx) = (xy)x + yx2 = (xy)x for any elements x and y of L,
and thus L is flexible.
According to Lemma 2.1, we have that x2 y = 0 for any elements x and y of a
left Leibniz algebra. This implies that x2 x = 0 = xx2 for any element x ∈ L. In

particular, third powers are well-defined and are equal to zero. Consequently, we
obtain by induction that symmetric Leibniz algebras are power-associative.3

So in this respect symmetric Leibniz algebras are only slightly more general than
Lie algebras; instead of squares of arbitrary elements of a Lie algebra being zero,
cubes of arbitrary elements of a symmetric Leibniz algebra are zero.
In general, the terms of the derived series of an algebra are only subalgebras.
We finish this section by proving that any term in the derived series of a left or a
right Leibniz algebra is indeed an ideal.
Proposition 2.18. Let L be a left or right Leibniz algebra. Then L(n) is an ideal
of L for every non-negative integer n.
Proof. We only prove the result for left Leibniz algebras as this yields the result
for right Leibniz algebras by considering the opposite algebra. We first prove that
L(n) is a left ideal of L for every non-negative integer n. We proceed by induction
on n. The base step n = 0 is clear as LL(0) = LL ⊆ L = L(0) . For the induction
step let n > 0 be an integer and assume that the statement is true for n − 1. Then
we obtain from the left Leibniz identity and the induction hypothesis that
LL(n)

=

L[L(n−1) L(n−1) ] ⊆ [LL(n−1) ]L(n−1) + L(n−1) [LL(n−1) ]

⊆

L(n−1) L(n−1) = L(n) .

Next, we prove that L(n) is a right ideal of L for every non-negative integer n.
We again proceed by induction on n. The base step n = 0 is clear as L(0) L =
LL ⊆ L = L(0) . For the induction step let n > 0 be an integer and assume that the
statement is true for n − 1. Then we obtain from identity (2.2) and the induction
hypothesis that
L(n) L =
⊆

[L(n−1) L(n−1) ]L ⊆ L(n−1) [L(n−1) L]
L(n−1) L(n−1) = L(n) .

This completes the proof.

3. Leibniz modules

In this and in the next section we consider only left Leibniz algebras. We leave
it to the interested reader to formulate the corresponding definitions and results for
right Leibniz algebras (see [33, 34]).
Let L be a left Leibniz algebra over a field F. A left L-module is a vector space
M over F with an F-bilinear left L-action L × M → M , (x, m) 7→ x · m such that
(xy) · m = x · (y · m) − y · (x · m)
is satisfied for every m ∈ M and all x, y ∈ L.
The usual definitions of the notions of submodule, irreducibility, complete reducibility, composition series, homomorphism, isomorphism, etc., hold for left Leibniz modules.
Moreover, every left L-module M gives rise to a homomorphism λ : L → gl(M )
of left Leibniz algebras, defined by λx (m) := x · m, and vice versa. We call λ the
3The proof of Proposition 2.17 shows that this result holds more generally for left central
Leibniz algebras or right central Leibniz algebras. The latter notions were introduced by Mason
and Yamskulna in [36]: A left central Leibniz algebra is a left Leibniz algebra L such that Leib(L) ⊆
Cr (L) and a right central Leibniz algebra is a right Leibniz algebra L such that Leib(L) ⊆ Cℓ (L).

left representation of L associated to M . We call the kernel of λ the annihilator of
M and denote it by AnnL (M ).
Examples.
(1) Every left Leibniz algebra is a left module over itself via the Leibniz multiplication. This module is called the left adjoint module and will be denoted
by Lad,ℓ . The associated representation L : L → gl(L) is called the left
adjoint representation of L. Note that AnnL (Lad,ℓ ) = Cℓ (L).
(2) The ground field F of any left Leibniz algebra is a left L-module via x·α := 0
for every element x ∈ L and every scalar α ∈ F. This module is called the
trivial left module of L.
The next result generalizes the second part of Proposition 2.5 and reduces the
study of left Leibniz modules to Lie modules.
Lemma 3.1. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra and let M be a left L-module. Then
Leib(L) ⊆ AnnL (M ).
Proof. Since Leib(L) is a subspace of L, it is enough to show that x2 ∈ AnnL (M )
for any element x ∈ L. We have that λx2 = λx ◦ λx − λx ◦ λx = 0, and therefore it
follows that x2 ∈ Ker(λ) = AnnL (M ).

By virtue of Lemma 3.1, every left L-module is an LLie -module, and vice versa.
This is the reason that in [9, Définition 1.1.14] left Leibniz modules are called
Lie modules. Consequently, many properties of left L-modules follow from the
corresponding properties of LLie -modules. As one application of this point of view,
we discuss trace forms associated to finite-dimensional left Leibniz modules (see
also [2, 21]).
For any finite-dimensional left representation λ : L → gl(M ) we define its trace
form κλ : L × L → F by κλ (x, y) := tr(λx ◦ λy ). Every trace form of a left
representation of a left Leibniz algebra is an invariant symmetric bilinear form. As
usual, a bilinear form β : L × L → F is called invariant if β(xy, z) = β(x, yz) for
any elements x, y, z ∈ L. The subspace
Lλ := {x ∈ L | ∀ y ∈ L : κλ (x, y) = 0}
of L is called the radical of κλ .
Example. As for Lie algebras, the trace form κ := κL of the left adjoint representation L of a finite-dimensional left Leibniz algebra L is called the Killing form of
L. We will denote its radical by L⊥ .
The next result is a consequence of Lemma 3.1 and the invariance as well as the
symmetry of κλ .
Lemma 3.2. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra and let λ : L → gl(M ) be a finitedimensional left representation of L. Then Lλ is an ideal of L with Leib(L) ⊆ Lλ .
Proof. The inclusion Leib(L) ⊆ Lλ follows immediately from Lemma 3.1.
Let x, y ∈ L and z ∈ Lλ be arbitrary elements. Then we obtain from the
invariance of κλ that κλ (zx, y) = κλ (z, xy) = 0, i.e., zx ∈ Lλ . This shows that Lλ
is a right ideal of L.
Moreover, using the symmetry in conjunction with the invariance of κλ , we
conclude that κλ (xz, y) = κλ (y, xz) = κλ (yx, z) = κλ (z, yx) = 0, i.e., xz ∈ Lλ .
This proves that Lλ is a left ideal of L.

Lemma 3.2 implies that a trace form of a non-Lie left Leibniz algebra is never
non-degenerate. We call a trace form of a finite-dimensional left representation λ
of a left Leibniz algebra L minimally degenerate 4 if Lλ = Leib(L).
Example. Let Aℓ be the two-dimensional solvable left Leibniz algebra from Example 1 in Section 2. Recall that Leib(Aℓ ) = Ff 6= 0. Since κ(e, e) = 1 6= 0 yields
⊥
A⊥
ℓ 6= Aℓ , we conclude from Lemma 3.2 that Aℓ = Leib(Aℓ ). Hence the Killing
form of Aℓ is minimally degenerate.
The correct concept of a module for left Leibniz algebras is the notion of a Leibniz
bimodule. In order to motivate the appropriate definition of a bimodule for a left
Leibniz algebra, we follow the approach that Eilenberg proposed for any given class
of non-associative algebras (see [26] and [42, pp. 25/26]).
Let L be a left Leibniz algebra over a field F, and let M be a vector space over
the same ground field. Then the Cartesian product L × M with componentwise
addition and componentwise scalar multiplication is a vector space over F. Suppose
that L acts on M from the left via the F-bilinear map L × M → M , (x, m) 7→ x · m
and L acts on M from the right via the F-bilinear map M × L → M , (m, x) 7→ m·x.
Then we define a multiplication on L × M by
(x1 , m1 )(x2 , m2 ) := (x1 x2 , m1 · x2 + x1 · m2 )
for any elements x1 , x2 ∈ L and m1 , m2 ∈ M . To ensure that L × M satisfies the
left Leibniz identity, we compute
(x1 , m1 )[(x2 , m2 )(x3 , m3 )]

= (x1 , m1 )(x2 x3 , m2 · x3 + x2 · m3 )
= (x1 (x2 x3 ), m1 · (x2 x3 ) + x1 · (m2 · x3 + x2 · m3 ))
= (x1 (x2 x3 ), m1 · (x2 x3 ) + x1 · (m2 · x3 ) + x1 · (x2 · m3 )) ,

[(x1 , m1 )(x2 , m2 )](x3 , m3 )

= (x1 x2 , m1 · x2 + x1 · m2 )(x3 , m3 )
= ((x1 x2 )x3 , (m1 · x2 + x1 · m2 ) · x3 + (x1 x2 ) · m3 ))
= ((x1 x2 )x3 , (m1 · x2 ) · x3 + (x1 · m2 ) · x3 + (x1 x2 ) · m3 )) ,

(x2 , m2 )[(x1 , m1 )(x3 , m3 )]

= (x2 , m2 )(x1 x3 , m1 · x3 + x1 · m3 )
= (x2 (x1 x3 ), m2 · (x1 x3 ) + x2 · (m1 · x3 + x1 · m3 ))
= (x2 (x1 x3 ), m2 · (x1 x3 ) + x2 · (m1 · x3 ) + x2 · (x1 · m3 ))

for any elements x1 , x2 , x3 ∈ L and m1 , m2 , m3 ∈ M . The vector space L × M
satisfies the left Leibniz identity if, and only if, the left-hand side of the first identity
equals the sum of the left-hand sides of the second and third identities. Hence the
right-hand side of the first identity must equal the sum of the right-hand sides of
the second and third identities. For the first components of the right-hand sides
this is just the left Leibniz identity for L. From the desired equality for the second
components of the right-hand sides one can read off the following three identities
which are sufficient for L × M to satisfy the left Leibniz identity.
(3.1)

x · (y · m) = (xy) · m + y · (x · m)

4In [21, Definition 5.6] a minimally degenerate Killing form is called non-degenerate, but this

contradicts the usual definition of a non-degenerate bilinear form. Note that non-Lie Leibniz
algebras can admit non-degenerate invariant symmetric bilinear forms, which, of course, cannot
be trace forms. For example, this is the case for the two-dimensional nilpotent symmetric non-Lie
Leibniz algebra N from Example 2 in Section 2 (see [10, Example 2.2]).

(3.2)

x · (m · y) = (x · m) · y + m · (xy)

(3.3)

m · (xy) = (m · x) · y + x · (m · y)

for every m ∈ M and all x, y ∈ L.
This motivates the following definition. An L-bimodule is a vector space M with
a bilinear left and a bilinear right L-action that satisfies the following compatibility
conditions:
(LLM)
(xy) · m = x · (y · m) − y · (x · m)
(LML)
(x · m) · y = x · (m · y) − m · (xy)
(MLL)
(m · x) · y = m · (xy) − x · (m · y)
for every m ∈ M and all x, y ∈ L.
It is an immediate consequence of (LLM) that every Leibniz bimodule is a left
Leibniz module. Moreover, by combining (LML) and (MLL) we obtain the following
result.
Lemma 3.3. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra and let M be an L-bimodule. Then
(x · m) · y + (m · x) · y = 0 holds for every m ∈ M and all x, y ∈ L.
As for left Leibniz modules, the usual definitions of the notions of subbimodule,
irreducibility, complete reducibility, composition series, homomorphism, isomorphism, etc., hold for Leibniz bimodules.
Let L be a left Leibniz algebra over a field F, and let V be a vector space over F.
Then a pair (λ, ρ) of linear transformations λ : L → EndF (V ) and ρ : L → EndF (V )
is called a representation of L on V if the following conditions are satisfied:
(3.4)

λxy = λx ◦ λy − λy ◦ λx

(3.5)

ρxy = λx ◦ ρy − ρy ◦ λx

(3.6)

ρxy = ρy ◦ ρx + λx ◦ ρy

for every m ∈ M and all x, y ∈ L.
Then every L-bimodule M gives rise to a representation (λ, ρ) of L on M via
λx (m) := x · m and ρx (m) := m · x. Conversely, every representation (λ, ρ) of L on
M defines an L-bimodule structure on M via x · m := λx (m) and m · x := ρx (m).
In order to avoid confusion, the annihilator of an L-bimodule M will be denoted
bi
by Annbi
L (M ), and it is defined as AnnL (M ) := Ker(λ) ∩ Ker(ρ).
An L-bimodule M is called symmetric if m·x = −x·m for every x ∈ L and every
m ∈ M . An L-bimodule M is called anti-symmetric if m · x = 0 for every x ∈ L
and every m ∈ M . Moreover, an L-bimodule M is called trivial if x · m = 0 = m · x
for every x ∈ L and every m ∈ M . Note that an L-bimodule M is trivial if, and
only if, M is symmetric and anti-symmetric. Moreover, Annbi
L (M ) = AnnL (M ) if
M is symmetric or anti-symmetric and Annbi
L (M ) = L if, and only if, M is trivial.
Examples.
(1) Every left Leibniz algebra L is a bimodule over itself via the Leibniz multiplication, the so-called adjoint bimodule Lad of L. The associated representation is (L, R), where L denotes the left multiplication operator of L
and R denotes the right multiplication operator of L, is called the adjoint
representation of L. Note that Annbi
L (Lad ) = C(L). Moreover, unless the

LEIBNIZ ALGEBRAS AS NON-ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS

15

ground field has characteristic two, the adjoint bimodule Lad is symmetric
if, and only if, L is a Lie algebra.5
(2) The ground field F of any left Leibniz algebra L is a trivial L-bimodule via
x · α := 0 =: α · x for every element x ∈ L and every scalar α ∈ F.
Lemma 3.4. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra and let M be an anti-symmetric or a
symmetric L-bimodule. Then Leib(L) ⊆ Annbi
L (M ).
Proof. Since every L-bimodule is a left L-module, it follows from Lemma 3.1 that
Leib(L) ⊆ Ker(λ). If M is anti-symmetric, then ρ = 0, and the assertion is clear.
On the other hand, if M is symmetric, then λx = −ρx for every element x ∈ L.
Hence Ker(ρ) = Ker(λ), and therefore Leib(L) ⊆ Ker(ρ) follows from the already
established inclusion Leib(L) ⊆ Ker(λ).

Let L be a left Leibniz algebra over a field F and let M be an L-bimodule. We
call
M0 := hx · m + m · x | x ∈ L, m ∈ M iF
the anti-symmetric kernel of M (see [34, p. 145]).
Example (cf. also [27, p. 479]). Let L be a left Leibniz algebra. Then the identity
xy + yx = (x + y)2 − x2 − y 2
shows that (Lad )0 ⊆ Leib(L). Moreover, if the ground field of L has characteristic
6= 2, then the identity x2 = 12 (xx + xx) shows that (Lad )0 = Leib(L).
The next result generalizes Proposition 2.5 to arbitrary Leibniz bimodules (see
[34, p. 145] and also the proof of Theorem 3.1 in [27]).
Proposition 3.5. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra and let M be an L-bimodule.
Then M0 is an anti-symmetric L-subbimodule of M .
Proof. Let x, y ∈ L and m ∈ M be arbitrary elements. Then we obtain from (3.1)
and (3.2) that
x · (y · m + m · y) =
=

x · (y · m) + x · (m · y)
[(xy) · m + m · (xy)] + [y · (x · m) + (x · m) · y] ∈ M0 .

Since M0 is a subspace of M , we conclude that LM0 ⊆ M0 . Moreover, it is an
immediate consequence of Lemma 3.3 that M0 L = 0.

By definition of the anti-symmetric kernel, Msym := M/M0 is a symmetric Lbimodule. We call Msym the symmetrization of M . In fact, the anti-symmetric
kernel is the smallest subbimodule with this property. (This should be compared
with the analogous statement for the adjoint Leibniz bimodule in Proposition 2.9.)
Proposition 3.6. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra and let M be an L-bimodule.
Then M0 is the smallest L-subbimodule N of M such that M/N is a symmetric
L-bimodule.
Proof. Suppose that N is a L-subbimodule of M such that M/N is a symmetric
L-bimodule. Then it follows from the symmetry of M/N that x · (m + N ) =
−(m + N ) · x, and consequently, x · m + m · x ∈ N for every element x ∈ L and
every element m ∈ M . Since N is a subspace of M , we conclude that M0 ⊆ N . 
5In particular, the adjoint bimodule of a symmetric Leibniz algebra is not always symmetric
as the name might suggest.

The next result was first established for finite-dimensional irreducible Leibniz bimodules over finite-dimensional right or left Leibniz algebras (see [35, Theorem 3.1]
and [7, Theorem 1.4]). Then in [27, Theorem 3.1] this was generalized to arbitrary
irreducible Leibniz bimodules over any right Leibniz algebra. At the same time the
proof is simplified considerably.
Theorem 3.7. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra. Then every irreducible L-bimodule
is symmetric or anti-symmetric.
Proof. Let M be an irreducible L-bimodule. According to Proposition 3.5, we have
that M0 = 0 or M0 = M . In the former case M is symmetric and in the latter case
M is anti-symmetric.

The final result of this section discusses how a left Leibniz module can be made
into an anti-symmetric Leibniz bimodule or into a symmetric Leibniz bimodule.
Proposition 3.8. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra. Then the following statements
hold.
(a) Every left L-module with a trivial right action is an anti-symmetric Lbimodule.
(b) Every left L-module determines a unique symmetric L-bimodule.
Proof. (a): Since (LLM) holds for every left L-module, and each term in (LML) as
well as in (MLL) contains at least one trivial right action, the assertion follows.
(b): In order for M to be a symmetric L-bimodule, the right action of L on M
has to be defined by m · x := −x · m for every element m ∈ M and every element
x ∈ L. Since (LLM) is automatically satisfied, one only needs to verify (LML)
and (MLL). Let x, y ∈ L and m ∈ M be arbitrary elements. Then it follows from
(LLM) that
(x · m) · y

= −y · (x · m)
= (xy) · m − x · (y · m)
= x · (m · y) − m · (xy)

and
(m · x) · y

This completes the proof.

x · (y · m) − (xy) · m



Note that for the trivial left Leibniz module the Leibniz bimodule structures
obtained from parts (a) and (b) of Proposition 3.8 both give rise to the trivial
Leibniz bimodule.
Examples. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra and consider the left adjoint L-module
Lad,ℓ .
(1) According to Proposition 3.8 (a), Lad,ℓ with a trivial right action is an
anti-symmetric L-bimodule, which we call the anti-symmetric adjoint bimodule La of L. The associated representation is (L, 0), the so-called antisymmetric adjoint representation of L, where L denotes the left multiplication operator of L.

LEIBNIZ ALGEBRAS AS NON-ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS

17

(2) By virtue of Proposition 3.8 (b), Lad,ℓ has a unique symmetric L-bimodule
structure, which we call the symmetric adjoint bimodule Ls of L. The
associated representation is (L, −L), the so-called symmetric adjoint representation of L.
4. Leibniz cohomology
Let L be a left Leibniz algebra over a field F and let M be an L-bimodule. We set
C n (L, M ) := HomF (L⊗n , M ) for any non-negative integer n. For any non-negative
integer n we consider the linear transformation d n : C n (L, M ) → C n+1 (L, M )
defined by
n
X
(−1)i+1 xi · f (x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ x̂i ⊗ · · · ⊗ xn+1 )
(d n f )(x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xn+1 ) :=
i=1

+
+

(−1)n+1 f (x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xn ) · xn+1
X
(−1)i f (x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ x̂i ⊗ · · · ⊗ xi xj ⊗ · · · ⊗ xn+1 )
1≤i<j≤n+1

n

for any f ∈ C (L, M ) and all elements x1 , . . . , xn+1 ∈ L.
It is proved in [19, Lemma 1.3.1] that (C n (L, M ), d n )n∈N0 is a cochain complex,
i.e., d n+1 ◦ d n = 0 for every non-negative integer n. Of course, the original idea of
defining Leibniz cohomology as the cohomology of such a cochain complex for right
Leibniz algebras is due to Loday [34, (1.8)] (see also [12]). Hence one can define
the cohomology of L with coefficients in M by
HLn (L, M ) := H n (C • (L, M ), d • ) := Ker(d n )/Im(d n−1 )
for every non-negative integer n. (Note that d−1 := 0.)
We will describe now the cohomology spaces in degree 0 and 1 (see [19, Section 1.3.3] for left Leibniz algebras and [34, (1.8)] for right Leibniz algebras). For
this purpose we need to introduce more notation.
The subspace M L := {m ∈ M | ∀ x ∈ L : m · x = 0} of an L-bimodule M is
called the space of right L-invariants of M .
Proposition 4.1. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra and let M be an L-bimodule.
Then HL0 (L, M ) = M L .
Proof. We have that (d 0 m)(x) = −m · x for any m ∈ M and any x ∈ L. Hence
HL0 (L, M ) = Ker(d 0 ) = M L .

In particular, we obtain from Lemma 3.4 and the definition of M L the following
result.
Corollary 4.2. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra and let M be an L-bimodule. Then
the following statements hold.
(a) If M is symmetric, then HL0 (L, M ) ∼
= M LLie .
0
(b) If M is anti-symmetric, then HL (L, M ) = M .
The subspace
Der(L, M ) := {f ∈ HomF (L, M ) | ∀ x, y ∈ L : f (xy) = f (x) · y + x · f (y)}
of HomF (L, M ) is called the space of derivations from L to M . The subspace
Ider(L, M ) := {g ∈ HomF (L, M ) | ∃ m ∈ M : g(x) = m · x} of Der(L, M ) is called
the space of inner derivations from L to M .

Proposition 4.3. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra and let M be an L-bimodule.
Then HL1 (L, M ) = Der(L, M )/Ider(L, M ).
Proof. It follows from (d 0 m)(x) = −m · x that Ider(L, M ) = Im(d 0 ). Moreover, we have that (d 1 f )(x ⊗ y) = x · f (y) + f (x) · y − f (xy) for any m ∈ M ,
f ∈ HomF (L, M ), and x, y ∈ L. Hence Ker(d 1 ) = Der(L, M ), and therefore
HL1 (L, M ) = Ker(d 1 )/Im(d 0 ) = Der(L, M )/Ider(L, M ).

Corollary 4.4. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra over a field F and let M be an
L-bimodule. Then the following statements hold.
(a) If M is symmetric, then HL1 (L, M ) ∼
= HL1 (LLie , M ) = H 1 (LLie , M ).
1
(b) If M is anti-symmetric, then HL (L, M ) = HomL (L, M ), where the latter
denotes the vector space of homomorphisms of left L-modules.
Proof. (a): Let f ∈ Der(L, M ) and let x ∈ L be arbitrary. Since M is symmetric,
we have that f (x2 ) = f (x) · x + x · f (x) = −x · f (x) + x · f (x) = 0. Since f is linear,
it follows that f (Leib(L)) = 0. Hence f induces a derivation from LLie to M . This
yields the isomorphism HL1 (L, M ) ∼
= HL1 (LLie , M ).
n
Let d Lie denote the coboundary map for the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of
Lie algebras (see [14, Exercise I.3.12]). Then we have that
(d 1Lie f )(x ∧ y) = x · f (y) − y · f (x) − f (xy)
for any m ∈ M , any f ∈ HomF (LLie , M ), and any x, y ∈ LLie . Since M is symmetric, we obtain that Ker(d 1Lie ) = Der(LLie , M ). Similarly, d 0Lie (m)(x) = x · m for any
m ∈ M and any x ∈ LLie . Hence Im(d 0Lie ) = Ider(LLie , M ), and thus we have that
HL1 (LLie , M ) = H 1 (LLie , M ).
(b): Since M is anti-symmetric, we have that
Der(L, M ) = {f ∈ HomF (L, M ) | ∀ x, y ∈ L : f (xy) = x · f (y)}
as well as Ider(L, M ) = {0}, and therefore it follows from Proposition 4.3 that
HL1 (L, M ) = HomL (L, M ).

In particular, we obtain from Corollary 4.4 the following result.
Corollary 4.5. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra over a field F. Then HL1 (L, F) ∼

L/L2 ∼
= LLie /L2Lie .
The next result is reminiscent of Seligman’s non-vanishing theorem for modular
Lie algebras (see [43, p. 102]).
Corollary 4.6. Let L 6= 0 be a left Leibniz algebra. Then HL1 (L, La ) 6= 0.
Proof. It follows from Corollary 4.4 (b) that 0 6= idL ∈ HomL (L, La ) ∼
= HL1 (L, La ).

Finally, we briefly discuss abelian extensions of left Leibniz algebras. algebras

E → L → 0 with abelian kernel K gives rise to an L-bimodule structure on K (see
[19, Proposition 1.3.6]). It can be shown that the set of equivalence classes of all

extensions of L by a given L-bimodule M (considered as an abelian Lie algebra)
are in natural bijection to HL2 (L, M ) (see [19, Theorem 1.3.13] for left Leibniz
algebras and [34, Proposition 1.9] for right Leibniz algebras). We will only need
the following ingredient of establishing such a bijection.
Lemma 4.7. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra, let M be an L-bimodule, and let
f ∈ C 2 (L, M ) be a Leibniz 2-cocycle. Then E := L × M with Leibniz product
defined by
(x1 , m1 )(x2 , m2 ) := (x1 x2 , m1 · x2 + x1 · m2 + f (x1 ⊗ x2 ))
for any x1 , x2 ∈ L and any m1 , m2 ∈ M is a left Leibniz algebra.
Proof. Since the Cartesian product L × M with componentwise addition and componentwise scalar multiplication is a vector space, we only need to verify the left
Leibniz identity. We have that
(d 2 f )(x1 ⊗ x2 ⊗ x3 ) =

x1 · f (x2 ⊗ x3 ) − x2 · f (x1 ⊗ x3 ) − f (x1 ⊗ x2 ) · x3
−f (x1 x2 ⊗ x3 ) + f (x1 ⊗ x2 x3 ) − f (x2 ⊗ x1 x3 )

for any x1 , x2 , x3 ∈ L. Since f is a 2-cocycle, we have that
x1 ·f (x2 ⊗x3 )+f (x1 ⊗x2 x3 ) = x2 ·f (x1 ⊗x3 )+f (x1 ⊗x2 )·x3 +f (x1 x2 ⊗x3 )+f (x2 ⊗x1 x3 ) .
We compute
(x1 , m1 )[(x2 , m2 )(x3 , m3 )]

= (x1 , m1 )(x2 x3 , m2 · x3 + x2 · m3 + f (x2 ⊗ x3 ))
= (x1 (x2 x3 ), m1 · (x2 x3 ) + x1 · (m2 · x3 ) + x1 · (x2 · m3 )
+ x1 · f (x2 ⊗ x3 ) + f (x1 ⊗ x2 x3 )) ,

[(x1 , m1 )(x2 , m2 )](x3 , m3 ) =

(x1 x2 , m1 · x2 + x1 · m2 + f (x1 ⊗ x2 ))(x3 , m3 )

=

(x2 , m2 )[(x1 , m1 )(x3 , m3 )]

((x1 x2 )x3 , (m1 · x2 ) · x3 + (x1 · m2 ) · x3
+ f (x1 ⊗ x2 ) · x3 + (x1 x2 ) · m3 + f (x1 x2 ⊗ x3 )) ,

= (x2 , m2 )(x1 x3 , m1 · x3 + x1 · m3 + f (x1 ⊗ x3 ))
= (x2 (x1 x3 ), m2 · (x1 x3 ) + x2 · (m1 · x3 ) + x2 · (x1 · m3 )
+ x2 · f (x1 ⊗ x3 ) + f (x2 ⊗ x1 x3 ))

for any elements x1 , x2 , x3 ∈ L and m1 , m2 , m3 ∈ M .
It follows from the left Leibniz identity, (3.1), (3.2), (3.3), and the 2-cocycle
identity for f that the right–hand side of the first identity equals the sum of the
right-hand sides of the second and third identities. Hence the left-hand side of the
first identity also equals the sum of the left-hand sides of the second and third
identities, and thus L × M satisfies the left Leibniz identity.

5. Nilpotent Leibniz algebras
Let L be a left or right Leibniz algebra. Then the left descending central series

of L is defined recursively by 1L := L and n+1L := L nL for every positive integer
n. Similarly, the right descending central series
L1 ⊇ L2 ⊇ L3 ⊇ · · ·

20

JÖRG FELDVOSS

of L is defined recursively by L1 := L and Ln+1 := Ln L for every positive integer n.
Note that Proposition 5.2 is just [4, Lemma 1]. For the convenience of the reader
we include its proof.
Proposition 5.1. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra. Then (nL)n∈N is a descending
filtration of L, i.e., nL ⊇ n+1L and mL nL ⊆ m+nL for all positive integers m and
n. In particular, nL is an ideal of L for every positive integer n.
Proposition 5.2. Let L be a right Leibniz algebra. Then (Ln )n∈N is a descending
filtration of L, i.e., Ln ⊇ Ln+1 and Lm Ln ⊆ Lm+n for all positive integers m and
n. In particular, Ln is an ideal of L for every positive integer n.
Proof. We only prove Proposition 5.2 as this yields Proposition 5.1 by considering
the opposite algebra. Firstly, we show that the right descending central series is
indeed descending, i.e., Ln+1 ⊆ Ln for every positive integer n. We proceed by
induction on n. The base step n = 1 is clear. For the induction step let n > 1 be
an integer and assume that the statement is true for n − 1. Then
Ln+1 = Ln L ⊆ Ln−1 L = Ln .
Next, we prove Lm Ln ⊆ Lm+n by induction on n. The base step n = 1 is an
immediate consequence of the definition:
Ln L1 = Ln L = Ln+1 .
For the induction step let n > 1 be an integer and assume that the statement is true
for n − 1. It follows from identity (2.4) and by applying the induction hypothesis
twice that
Lm Ln

= Lm (Ln−1 L) ⊆ (Lm Ln−1 )L + (Lm L)Ln−1
⊆ Lm+n−1 L + Lm+1 Ln−1 ⊆ Lm+n .

This completes the proof.



Following [4, p. 2] and [39, p. 3829] we define the descending central series
L1 ⊇ L2 ⊇ L3 ⊇ · · ·
of a left or right Leibniz algebra L recursively by L1 := L and Ln :=

n−1
P

for every positive integer n. Note that Proposition 5.4 is just [4, Lemma 2]. For
the convenience of the reader we include its proof.
Proposition 5.3. Let L be a left Leibniz algebra. Then Ln = nL for every positive
integer n. In particular (Ln )n∈N is a descending filtration of L, i.e., Ln ⊇ Ln+1
and Lm Ln ⊆ Lm+n for all positive integers m and n.
Proposition 5.4. Let L be a right Leibniz algebra. Then Ln = Ln for every positive
integer n. In particular, (Ln )n∈N is a descending filtration of L, i.e., Ln ⊇ Ln+1
and Lm Ln ⊆ Lm+n for all positive integers m and n.
Proof. We only prove the first statement in Proposition 5.4 as this in conjunction
with Proposition 5.2 implies the remaining statements. We proceed by induction
on n. The base step n = 1 is an immediate consequence of the definitions. For the
induction step let n > 1 be an integer and assume that the statement is true for any

By combining Proposition 5.3 and Proposition 5.4 we obtain the following result
(cf. also [10, Proposition 2.13]).
Corollary 5.5. If L is a symmetric Leibniz algebra, then Ln = nL = Ln for every
positive integer n.
Recall from Section 1 that an algebra L is called nilpotent if there exists a positive
integer n such that any product of n elements in L, no matter how associated, is
zero (see [42, p. 18]). The following observation is clear.
Lemma 5.6. A left or right Leibniz algebra L is nilpotent if, and only if, there
exists a positive integer n such that Ln = 0.
Examples.
(1) The two-dimensional solvable left Leibniz algebra Aℓ from Example 1 in
Section 2 is not nilpotent as (Aℓ )n = nAℓ = Ff 6= 0 for every integer n ≥ 3.
But note that Anr = 0 for every integer n ≥ 3.
(2) The two-dimensional symmetric Leibniz algebra N from Example 2 in Section 2 is nilpotent as Nn = nN = Nn = 0 for every integer n ≥ 3.
(3) The five-dimensional simple left Leibniz algebra Sℓ from Example 3 in
Section 2 is not nilpotent as (Sℓ )n = nSℓ = Snℓ = Sℓ 6= 0 for every
positive integer n.
In the proof of Proposition 5.8 we will need the following result.
Lemma 5.7. If φ : L → K is a homomorphism of left or right Leibniz algebras,
then φ(Ln ) = φ(L)n for every positive integer n.
Proof. We proceed by induction on n. The base step n = 1 follows from
φ(L1 ) = φ(L) = φ(L)1 .
For the induction step let n > 1 be an integer and assume that the statement is
true for n − 1. Then we obtain from the induction hypothesis that
φ(Ln ) =

This completes the proof.
The next result is an immediate consequence of Lemma 5.7.

Proposition 5.8. Subalgebras and homomorphic images of nilpotent left or right
Leibniz algebras are nilpotent.
Proposition 5.9. If I is an ideal of a left Leibniz algebra L such that I ⊆ Cr (L)
and L/I is nilpotent, then L is nilpotent.
Proposition 5.10. If I is an ideal of a right Leibniz algebra L such that I ⊆ Cℓ (L)
and L/I is nilpotent, then L is nilpotent.
Proof. We only prove Proposition 5.10 as this yields Proposition 5.9 by considering
the opposite algebra.
Since L/I is nilpotent, there exists a positive integer r such that Lr = Lr ⊆ I.
But by hypothesis, we have that I ⊆ Cℓ (L), i.e., IL=0. Hence Lr+1 = Lr+1 =
Lr L ⊆ IL = 0, and therefore L is nilpotent.

Proposition 5.11. The sum of two nilpotent ideals of a left or right Leibniz algebra
is nilpotent.
Proof. Let L be a right Leibniz algebra. We begin by proving that In is a right
ideal of L for any right ideal I of L and for any positive integer n. We will proceed
by induction on n. The base step I1 L = IL ⊆ I = I1 follows from the fact that
I is a right ideal of L. For the induction step let n > 1 be an integer and assume
that the statement is true for n − 1. Then we obtain from the right Leibniz identity
and the induction hypothesis that
In L = (In−1 I)L ⊆ (In−1 L)I + In−1 (IL) ⊆ In−1 I = In .
Now let J and K be two nilpotent ideals of L. We will prove that
n

for every positive integer n. We will again proceed by induction on n. The base
step (J + K)1 = J + K = J1 + K1 is an immediate consequence of the definition of
the right descending central series. For the induction step let n ≥ 1 be an integer
and assume that the statement is true for n. Then we obtain from the induction
hypothesis and the fact that Jr and Kn−r are right ideals of L:

Finally, as J and K are nilpotent, there exist positive integers s and t such that
Js = 0 and Kt = 0. Hence we obtain that (J + K)s+t−1 = 0 which shows that J + K
is a nilpotent ideal of L.

Using Proposition 5.11 one can proceed similar to the solvable case to establish
the existence of a largest nilpotent ideal (see Section 1). We leave the details to
the interested reader (see also [29, Proposition 1]).
Now we prove the Lie analogue of a consequence of [42, Theorem 2.4] for symmetric Leibniz algebras.
Theorem 5.12. For every symmetric Leibniz algebra L the following statements
are equivalent:
(i) L is nilpotent.
(ii) LLie is nilpotent.
(iii) L/C(L) is nilpotent.
(iv) Lie(L) is nilpotent.
Proof. The implication (i)⇒(ii) is an immediate consequence of Proposition 5.8. It
follows from Corollary 2.7 that there is a natural epimorphism LLie → L/C(L) of
Lie algebras. Hence another application of Proposition 5.8 yields the implication
(ii)⇒(iii). Moreover, the implication (iii)⇒(i) follows from Proposition 5.9.
Suppose now that L/C(L) is nilpotent. Then we obtain from Proposition 2.10
that there is a natural epimorphism L/C(L) → L/Cℓ (L) ∼
= L(L), and therefore
L(L) is nilpotent. Similarly, we obtain from Proposition 2.12 that there is a natural epimorphism L/C(L) → L/Cr (L) ∼
= R(L)op , and thus R(L) is nilpotent. Hence
it follows from Proposition 5.11 and Theorem 2.14 that Lie(L) is nilpotent. This
establishes the implication (iii)⇒(iv). Finally, the implication (iv)⇒(i) can be
obtained from Proposition 5.8 in conjunction with Proposition 2.10 and Proposition 5.10.

Example. Let Aℓ denote the two-dimensional non-nilpotent solvable left Leibniz algebra Aℓ from Example 1 in Section 2. As has been observed above, we
have that Cℓ (Aℓ ) = Ff = Leib(Aℓ ) and Cr (Aℓ ) = Fe. Hence LLie = L/Leib(L),
L(L) ∼
= L/Cℓ (L), and R(L) ∼
= [L/Cr (L)]op are one-dimensional. So each of these
Lie algebras is abelian, and thus nilpotent, but Aℓ is not nilpotent. This shows
that the implication (ii)⇒(i) in Theorem 5.12 neither holds for left nor for right
Leibniz algebras. Moreover, neither of the implications (iii)⇒(i) and (iv)⇒(i) in
Theorem 5.12 holds for left (resp. right) Leibniz algebras if one replaces C(L) by
Cℓ (L) (resp. Cr (L)) and Lie(L) by L(L) (resp. R(L)).
The Leibniz analogue of Engel’s theorem for Lie algebras of linear transformations was first proved by Patsourakos [39, Theorem 7] and later by Barnes [7,
Theorem 1.2] who used the corresponding result for Lie algebras. Note that Patsourakos does not have to assume that the representation is finite-dimensional. For
the convenience of the reader we include a variation of Barnes’ proof.
Theorem 5.13. Let L be a finite-dimensional left Leibniz algebra and let (λ, ρ) be
a representation of L on a non-zero finite-dimensional vector space M such that λx
is nilpotent for every element x ∈ L. Then ρx is nilpotent for every element x ∈ L,
and there exists a non-zero vector m ∈ M such that λx (m) = 0 = ρx (m) for every
element x ∈ L.

24

JÖRG FELDVOSS

Proof. We first prove that for any element x ∈ L the nilpotency of λx implies the
nilpotency of ρx (see also [39, Lemma 6]). Namely, we have that ρnx = (−1)n−1 ρx ◦
λxn−1 for every element x ∈ L and every positive integer n. This can be shown by
induction on n. The base step n = 1 is trivial. For the induction step let n ≥ 1
and assume that the statement is true for n. Then it follows from the induction
hypothesis and Lemma 3.3 that
ρn+1
= ρx ◦ ρnx = (−1)n−1 ρx ◦ ρx ◦ λxn−1 = −(−1)n−1 ρx ◦ λx ◦ λxn−1 = (−1)n ρx ◦ λnx .
x
Since the L-bimodule M is finite-dimensional, it has an irreducible L-subbimodule N . We obtain from Theorem 3.7 that N is symmetric or anti-symmetric.
In the former case we have that ρx = −λx , and in the latter case we have that
ρx = 0 for every x ∈ L. It follows from the linearity of λ and (3.4) that λ(L) is a
Lie subalgebra of gl(M ). So the existence of a non-zero vector m ∈ N such that
λx (m) = 0 for every x ∈ L can be obtained from Engel’s theorem for Lie algebras
of linear transformations (see [30, Theorem 3.3]). Finally, this and the symmetry
or anti-symmetry of N yield ρx (m) = 0 for every x ∈ L.

We conclude this section by several applications of Theorem 5.13. The first result
is just a reformulation of Theorem 5.13 in terms of a composition series of a Leibniz
bimodule (see also [39, Corollary 9]).
Corollary 5.14. Let L be a finite-dimensional left Leibniz algebra over a field F
and let (λ, ρ) be a representation of L on a vector space M such that λx is nilpotent
for every element x ∈ L. Then the following statements hold:
(a) If M is irreducible, then M is the one-dimensional trivial L-bimodule.
(b) If M is finite-dimensional, then every composition series
0 = M0 $ M1 $ · · · $ Mn = M
of M satisfies dimF Mj = j, λx (Mj ) ⊆ Mj−1 , and ρx (Mj ) ⊆ Mj−1 for
every integer j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and every element x ∈ L.
Proof. (a) is an immediate consequence of the proof of Theorem 5.13 as we did not
use the finite dimension of M in the irreducible case.
(b): We apply part (a) to each composition factor Mj /Mj−1 (1 ≤ j ≤ n).

Next, we specialize Corollary 5.14 and Theorem 5.13 to the adjoint Leibniz
bimodule.
Corollary 5.15. Let L be a finite-dimensional nilpotent left Leibniz algebra over
a field F, and let I be a d-dimensional ideal of L. Then the following statements
hold:
(a) There exists an ascending chain
0 = L0 $ L1 $ · · · $ Ln = L
of ideals of L such that I = Ld , dimF Lj = j, LLj ⊆ Lj−1 , and Lj L ⊆ Lj−1
for every integer j ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
(b) If I 6= 0, then LI $ I and IL $ I
(c) If I 6= 0, then I ∩ C(L) 6= 0.
Proof. Since L is nilpotent, we have that Lx is nilpotent for every element x ∈ L.

LEIBNIZ ALGEBRAS AS NON-ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS

(a): Choose a composition series of the adjoint L-bimodule that contains I (see
[44, Proposition 1.1.1]) and apply Corollary 5.14 to the adjoint representation (L, R)
of L.
(b) is an immediate consequence of part (a).
(c): Note that I is an L-subbimodule of the adjoint L-bimodule. It follows from
Theorem 5.13 that there exists a non-zero element y ∈ I such that Lx (y) = 0 =
Rx (y), i.e., xy = 0 = yx for every element x ∈ L. Hence 0 6= y ∈ Cr (L) ∩ Cℓ (L) =
C(L).

Finally, we prove Engel’s theorem for left Leibniz algebras (see [4, Theorem 2]
and [39, Corollary 10]).
Corollary 5.16. Let L be a finite-dimensional left Leibniz algebra such that Lx is
nilpotent for every element x ∈ L. Then L is nilpotent.
Proof. In the notation of Corollary 5.15, we have that kL ⊆ Ln−k+1 for every
positive integer k, and therefore n+1L = 0. We proceed by induction on k to prove
the former statement. The base step k = 1 is just 1L = L = Ln . For the induction
step let k > 1 be an integer and assume that k−1L ⊆ Ln−k+2 is true. Then we
obtain from the induction hypothesis in conjunction with Corollary 5.15 (a) that
k
L = L k−1L ⊆ LLn−k+2 ⊆ Ln−k+1 .

6. Solvable Leibniz algebras
In the case of solvable Leibniz algebras we have one-sided analogues of Theorem 5.12. These show that the solvability of a left or right Leibniz algebra L is
equivalent to the solvability of several Lie algebras associated to L.
Proposition 6.1. For every left Leibniz algebra L the following statements are
equivalent:
(i) L is solvable.
(ii) LLie is solvable.
(iii) L/Cℓ (L) is solvable.
(iv) L(L) is solvable.
Proposition 6.2. For every right Leibniz algebra L the following statements are
equivalent:
(i) L is solvable.
(ii) LLie is solvable.
(iii) L/Cr (L) is solvable.
(iv) R(L) is solvable.
Proof. We only prove Proposition 6.2 as this yields Proposition 6.1 by considering
the opposite algebra.
The implication (i)⇒(ii) is an immediate consequence of Proposition 1.1. It follows from Proposition 2.6 that there is a natural epimorphism LLie = L/Leib(L) →
L/Cr (L) of Lie algebras. Hence another application of Proposition 1.1 yields the
implication (ii)⇒(iii). Moreover, the implication (iii)⇒(i) follows from Proposition 1.2. Finally, the remaining equivalence of (iii) and (iv) is an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.12.

L is solvable.
LLie is solvable.
L/C(L) is solvable.
L(L) is solvable.

Proof. The equivalence of (i) and (ii) follows from Proposition 6.1 or Proposition 6.2
and the implication (i)⇒(iii) is an immediate consequence of Proposition 1.1.
Suppose now that L/C(L) is solvable. Then we obtain from Proposition 2.10
that there is a natural epimorphism L/C(L) → L/Cℓ (L) ∼
= L(L), and therefore
L(L) is solvable. Similarly, we obtain from Proposition 2.12 that there is a natural
epimorphism L/C(L) → L/Cr (L) ∼
= R(L)op , and thus R(L) is solvable. This establishes the implications (iii)⇒(iv) and (iii)⇒(v). Each of the implications (iv)⇒(i)
and (v)⇒(i) follows from Proposition 6.1 and Proposition 6.2, respectively.
The implication (i)⇒(vi) is a consequence of Theorem 2.14 and Proposition 1.3
in conjunction with the already established implications. Finally, the implication
(vi)⇒(iv) can be obtained from Theorem 2.14 and Proposition 1.1.

The Leibniz analogue of Lie’s theorem for solvable Lie algebras of linear transformations was proved by Patsourakos [40, Theorem 2]. For the convenience of the
reader we include a proof that follows very closely the proof of Theorem 5.13 and
uses the corresponding result for Lie algebras.
Theorem 6.4. Let L be a finite-dimensional solvable left Leibniz algebra over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and let (λ, ρ) be a representation of
L on a non-zero finite-dimensional vector space M . Then M contains a common
eigenvector for the linear transformations in λ(L) ∪ ρ(L).
Proof. Since the L-bimodule M is finite-dimensional, it has an irreducible L-submodule N . We obtain from Theorem 3.7 that N is symmetric or anti-symmetric. In
the former case we have that ρx = −λx , and in the latter case we have that ρx = 0
for every x ∈ L. Similarly to the proof of Proposition 2.10, one can show that λ(L)
is a Lie subalgebra of gl(M ) such that λ(L) ∼
= L/AnnL (M ). The latter isomorphism
in conjunction with Proposition 1.1 yields that λ(L) is solvable. So the existence
of a common eigenvector m ∈ N for λ(L) can be obtained from Lie’s theorem for
solvable Lie algebras of linear transformations (see [30, Theorem 4.1]). Finally, this
and the symmetry or anti-symmetry of N show that m is also a common eigenvector
for ρ(L).

We conclude this section by several applications of Theorem 6.4. The first result
is just a reformulation of Theorem 6.4 in terms of a composition series of a Leibniz
bimodule (see also [40, Corollary 2] and [21, Theorem 3.2]).
Corollary 6.5. Let L be a finite-dimensional solvable left Leibniz algebra over an
algebraically closed field F of characteristic zero and let M be a non-zero finitedimensional L-bimodule. Then the following statements hold:
(a) If M is irreducible, then dimF M = 1.

(b) Every composition series
0 = M0 $ M1 $ · · · $ Mn = M
of M satisfies dimF Mj = j for any 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
Proof. (a) is an immediate consequence of the proof of Theorem 6.4.
(b): We apply part (a) to each composition factor Mj /Mj−1 (1 ≤ j ≤ n).



Remark. Corollary 6.5 (and thus also Theorem 6.4) is not true for ground fields
of prime characteristic as already can be seen for the non-abelian two-dimensional
Lie algebra (see [44, Example 5.9.1]). Moreover, the one-dimensional Lie algebra
spanned by any proper rotation of a two-dimensional real vector space shows that
Corollary 6.5 and Theorem 6.4 in general hold only over algebraically closed fields.
Next, we specialize Corollary 6.5 to the adjoint Leibniz bimodule (see also [21,
Corollary 3.3]).
Corollary 6.6. Let L be a finite-dimensional solvable left Leibniz algebra over an
algebraically closed field F of characteristic zero, and let I be a d-dimensional ideal
of L. Then there exists an ascending chain
0 = L0 $ L1 $ · · · $ Ln = L
of ideals of L such that I = Ld and dimF Lj = j for every 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
Proof. Choose a composition series of the adjoint L-bimodule that contains I (see
[44, Proposition 1.1.1]) and apply Corollary 6.5 to the adjoint L-bimodule.

We can also employ Engel’s theorem for left Leibniz algebras to prove the following result (see [4, Theorem 4], [40, Corollary 3], and [29, Corollary 6]).
Corollary 6.7. Let L be a finite-dimensional solvable left Leibniz algebra over an
algebraically closed field F of characteristic zero. Then Lx is nilpotent for every
element x ∈ L2 . In particular, L2 is nilpotent.
Proof. According to Corollary 6.6, there exists an ascending chain
0 = L0 $ L1 $ · · · $ Ln = L
of ideals of L such that dimF Lj = j for every 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Hence one can choose
successively a basis {x1 , . . . , xj } of Lj (1 ≤ j ≤ n) such that the corresponding
matrices of L(L) are upper triangular. By virtue of the proof of Proposition 2.10,
we have that L(L2 ) = [L(L), L(L)], and thus the matrices of L(L2 ) are strictly
upper triangular. Hence Lx is nilpotent for every element x ∈ L2 . In particular,
we obtain from Corollary 5.16 that L2 is nilpotent.

Finally, we give a proof of Cartan’s solvability criterion for left Leibniz algebras
(see also [2, Theorem 3.7] and [21, Theorem 3.5]).
Theorem 6.8. Let L be a finite-dimensional left Leibniz algebra over a field of
characteristic zero. Then L is solvable if, and only if, κ(x, y) = 0 for every element
x ∈ L and every element y ∈ L2 .
Proof. Suppose first that L is solvable and the ground field of L is algebraically
closed. It follows from Corollary 6.6 that L(L) can be simultaneously representated
by upper triangular matrices. Then the proof of Proposition 2.10 shows that the
corresponding matrix of Lyz = [Ly , Lz ] = Ly ◦ Lz − Lz ◦ Ly is a strictly upper

28

JÖRG FELDVOSS

triangular matrix for any y, z ∈ L. Hence κ(x, yz) = tr(Lx ◦ Lyz ) = 0 for any
x, y, z ∈ L.
Suppose now that κ(x, y) = 0 for every element x ∈ L and every element y ∈ L2
and the ground field of L again is algebraically closed. It follows from Proposition 2.10 that L(L) is a Lie subalgebra of gl(L). In particular, we obtain as before
that tr(Lx ◦ [Ly , Lz ]) = tr(Lx ◦ Lyz ) = κ(x, yz) = 0 for any x, y, z ∈ L. So the
other implication is a consequence of [30, Theorem 4.3] in conjunction with Proposition 6.1.
Finally, in case the ground field F of L is not algebraically closed, a base field
extension will show the assertion. Namely, let F be an algebraic closure of F, set
L := L ⊗F F, and let La⊗α (b ⊗ β) := ab ⊗ αβ for any a, b ∈ L and any α, β ∈ F
denote the left multiplication operator of L. Since L 2 = L2 ⊗F F, we obtain by
induction that L (n) = L(n) ⊗F F for every non-negative integer n. Consequently, L
is solvable if, and only if, L is solvable. Moreover, we obtain for the Killing form κ
of L that κ(x ⊗ 1, y ⊗ 1) = tr(Lx⊗1 ◦ Ly⊗1 ) = tr(Lx ◦ Ly ) = κ(x, y) for all x, y ∈ L
as La⊗α (b ⊗ β) = La (b) ⊗ αβ for any a, b ∈ L and any α, β ∈ F. This can be used
to show that κ(x, y) = 0 for every element x ∈ L and every element y ∈ L2 if, and
only if, κ(x, y) = 0 for every element x ∈ L and every element y ∈ L 2 .

7. Semisimple Leibniz algebras
A left or right Leibniz algebra L is called simple if 0, Leib(L), L are the only ideals
of L, and Leib(L) $ L2 (see [25, Definition 1] for the first part of this definition
or [37, Definition 2.2], [21, Definition 5.1], [27, Definition 2.6]). Note that there is
also another definition of simplicity for Leibniz algebras in the literature, namely,
requiring that 0 and L are the only ideals of L. Then it follows from Proposition 2.8
that every simple left or right Leibniz algebra has to be a Lie algebra.
Exactly as for Lie algebras, we call a left or right Leibniz algebra L perfect in
case L = L2 holds. Then the first result in this section is an immediate consequence
of these definitions.
Proposition 7.1. Every simple left or right Leibniz algebra is perfect.
The next result follows from the correspondence theorem for ideals. Note also
that the condition Leib(L) $ L2 implies that the Lie algebra LLie associated to a
simple left or right Leibniz algebra L is not abelian.
Proposition 7.2. If L is a simple left or right Leibniz algebra, then LLie is a simple
Lie algebra.
We will see in the example after Theorem 7.11 that the converse of Proposition 7.2
does not always hold.
In analogy with the above definition of simplicity, we call a left or right Leibniz
algebra L semisimple when Leib(L) contains every solvable ideal of L.
Proposition 7.3. Every simple left or right Leibniz algebra is semisimple.
Proof. Let I be any solvable ideal of the simple left or right Leibniz algebra L.
Then either I = 0, I = Leib(L), or I = L. In the first two cases we have that
I ⊆ Leib(L), and we are done. So suppose that I = L. From Proposition 7.1 we
obtain by induction that L = L(n) holds for every non-negative integer n. Since by
hypothesis I is solvable, there exists a non-negative integer r such that I(r) = 0.
Hence L = L(r) = I(r) = 0 which contradicts the requirement Leib(L) $ L2 .

In the finite-dimensional case we have the following result which often is taken
as the definition of semisimplicity for Leibniz algebras (see [21, Definition 5.2] or
[27, Definition 2.12]).
Proposition 7.4. A finite-dimensional left or right Leibniz algebra L is semisimple
if, and only if, Leib(L) = Rad(L).
Proof. It follows from Proposition 2.8 and Proposition 1.4 that Leib(L) ⊆ Rad(L).
This in conjunction with the semisimplicity of L proves the “only if”-part of the
assertion, and the converse follows from Proposition 1.4 which says that Rad(L) is
the largest solvable ideal of L.

Proposition 7.5. If L is a semisimple left Leibniz algebra, then Leib(L) = Cℓ (L).
Proposition 7.6. If L is a semisimple right Leibniz algebra, then Leib(L) = Cr (L).
Corollary 7.7. If L is a semisimple symmetric Leibniz algebra, then Leib(L) =
C(L).
Proof. We only prove Proposition 7.6 as this yields Proposition 7.5 by considering
the opposite algebra.
It follows from Proposition 2.6 that Leib(L) ⊆ Cr (L). According to Proposition 2.4, Cr (L) is an abelian ideal of L, and thus the semisimplicity of L yields that
Cr (L) ⊆ Leib(L).

Proposition 7.8. A left or right Leibniz algebra L is semisimple if, and only if,
LLie is semisimple.
Proof. Suppose that L is semisimple and let i be any solvable ideal of the Lie algebra
LLie = L/Leib(L). Let π : L → LLie denote the natural epimorphism of Leibniz
algebras. Then I := π −1 (i) is an ideal of L, and it follows from Proposition 1.2
applied to i = I + Leib(L)/Leib(L) ∼
= I/I ∩ Leib(L) that I is solvable. Hence
the semisimplicity of L yields that I ⊆ Leib(L), i.e., i = 0. Consequently, LLie is
semisimple.
In order to prove the converse, suppose that LLie = L/Leib(L) is semisimple
and let I be any solvable ideal of the left or right Leibniz algebra L. Then by
Proposition 1.1 we obtain that I + Leib(L)/Leib(L) is a solvable ideal of LLie .
Since the latter Lie algebra is semisimple, we have that I + Leib(L)/Leib(L) = 0,
and thus I ⊆ Leib(L). Hence L is semisimple.

Since finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras over a field of characteristic zero
are perfect, it follows from Proposition 7.8 in conjunction with Corollary 4.5 that
the same is true for Leibniz algebras (see [21, Corollary 5.5]).
Corollary 7.9. Every finite-dimensional semisimple left Leibniz algebra over a
field of characteristic zero is perfect.
Similar to the Killing form of a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra over
a field of characteristic zero being non-degenerate, the Killing form of a finitedimensional semisimple Leibniz algebra over a field of characteristic zero is minimally degenerate (see [21, Theorem 5.8]). As for Lie algebras, this can be obtained
from Cartan’s solvability criterion for Leibniz algebras (see Theorem 6.8).
Proposition 7.10. The Killing form of every finite-dimensional semisimple left
Leibniz algebra over a field of characteristic zero is minimally degenerate.

JÖRG FELDVOSS

Proof. Let L be a finite-dimensional semisimple left Leibniz algebra over a field of
characteristic 0, and let I := L⊥ denote the radical of the Killing form κ of L.
Recall that I is an ideal of L. The proof of [30, Lemma 5.1] shows that κI = κ|I×I ,
where κI denotes the Killing form of I. Then we have that κI (x, y) = κ(x, y) = 0
for every x ∈ I and every y ∈ I2 . Hence Theorem 6.8 shows that I is solvable.
Since L is semisimple, we obtain that L⊥ = I ⊆ Leib(L), and thus it follows from
Lemma 3.2 that L⊥ = Leib(L), i.e., κ is minimally degenerate.

Remark. The example after Lemma 3.2 shows that contrary to Lie algebras,
where the non-degeneracy of the Killing form implies semisimplicity, the converse
of Proposition 7.10 is not true.
Next, we give some insight into the structure of a finite-dimensional semisimple
Leibniz algebra in characteristic zero that can be obtained from the analogue of
Levi’s theorem for Leibniz algebras and is due to Pirashvili [41, Proposition 2.4]
and Barnes [8, Theorem 1]. The first part of Theorem 7.11 was already observed by
Fialowski and Mihálka [27, Corollary 2.14] and the third part is [28, Theorem 3.1].
Theorem 7.11. If L is a finite-dimensional semisimple left Leibniz algebra over
a field of characteristic zero, then there exists a semisimple Lie subalgebra s of L
such that L = s ⊕ Leib(L) and Leib(L) is an anti-symmetric completely reducible
s-bimodule.6 Moreover, if L is simple, then s is simple and Leib(L) is irreducible.
Proof. The existence of the semisimple Lie subalgebra s with L = s ⊕ Leib(L) is an
immediate consequence of Levi’s theorem for Leibniz algebras and Proposition 7.4.
It follows from Proposition 2.5 that Leib(L) is an ideal of L such that Leib(L)L = 0.
Hence Leib(L) is an anti-symmetric L-bimodule. In particular, Leib(L) is also an
anti-symmetric s-bimodule. Finally, Weyl’s theorem (see [30, Theorem 6.3]) yields
that Leib(L) is a completely reducible s-bimodule.
Suppose now that L is simple. Then we obtain from Proposition 7.2 that s ∼
=
L/Leib(L) = LLie is also simple. Let M be a non-zero proper L-subbimodule of
Leib(L). Then M is an ideal of L that is different from 0, Leib(L), and L which
contradicts the simplicity of L. Hence Leib(L) is an irreducible L-bimodule. By
virtue of Proposition 2.8, Leib(L) is also an irreducible s-bimodule.

A left or right Leibniz algebra L is called Lie-simple if LLie is simple. According
to Proposition 7.3 and Proposition 7.8, Lie-simple left or right Leibniz algebras are
semisimple, but they are not always simple.
Example (see also [21, Example 5.3]). Let s be any simple Lie algebra, and let
M and M ′ be two non-trivial irreducible left s-modules. Then consider the left
Leibniz algebra L := s × [M ⊕ M ′ ] with multiplication (x, a)(y, b) := (xy, x · b)
for any x, y ∈ s and any a, b ∈ M ⊕ M ′ (see also Example 3 in Section 2). The
identity (x, a)(x, a) = (0, x · a) for any x ∈ s and any a ∈ M ⊕ M ′ shows that
Leib(L) ⊆ M ⊕ M ′ . Since M and M ′ are non-trivial irreducible left s-modules, we
have that sM = M and sM ′ = M ′ . This in conjunction with the above identity
shows the other inclusion, and therefore Leib(L) = M ⊕ M ′ . Hence L/Leib(L) ∼
=s
is simple, and thus L is Lie-simple. But as M and M ′ are ideals of L that are
different from 0, Leib(L), and L, we have that L is not simple.
6More precisely, L is the hemi-semidirect product of s and the s-bimodule Leib(L).

Remark. The same argument as in the previous example in conjunction with
Proposition 7.8 proves that L = s × M with multiplication (x, a)(y, b) := (xy, x · b)
for any x, y ∈ s and any a, b ∈ M , where s is a semisimple Lie algebra and M is
a direct sum of non-trivial irreducible left s-modules, is a semisimple left Leibniz
algebra. Note also that there exist semisimple left Leibniz algebras that cannot
be decomposed as a direct product of (Lie-)simple left Leibniz algebras (see [28,
Examples 2 and 3]).
We obtain as an immediate consequence of Proposition 7.8 in conjunction with
Corollary 4.4 (a) and the first Whitehead lemma for Lie algebras (see [31, Theorem 13 in Chapter III]) the corresponding result for symmetric bimodules over
semisimple Leibniz algebras.
Theorem 7.12. If L is a finite-dimensional semisimple left Leibniz algebra over a
field of characteristic zero, then HL1 (L, M ) = 0 holds for every symmetric finitedimensional L-bimodule M .
Remark. Note that it follows from Corollary 4.6 that Theorem 7.12 does not hold
for asymmetric bimodules over semisimple non-Lie Leibniz algebras.
