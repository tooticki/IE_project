A BSTRACT. In this paper, we develop the deformation theory controlled by pre-Lie algebras; the main tool is
a new integration theory for pre-Lie algebras. The main field of application lies in homotopy algebra structures
over a Koszul operad; in this case, we provide a homotopical description of the associated Deligne groupoid.
This permits us to give a conceptual proof, with complete formulae, of the Homotopy Transfer Theorem by
means of gauge action. We provide a clear explanation of this latter ubiquitous result: there are two gauge
elements whose action on the original structure restrict its inputs and respectively its output to the homotopy
equivalent space. This implies that a homotopy algebra structure transfers uniformly to a trivial structure on its
underlying homology if and only if it is gauge trivial; this is the ultimate generalization of the ddc -lemma.

I NTRODUCTION
The philosophy of deformation theory, which goes back to P. Deligne, M. Gerstenhaber, W.M. Goldman,
A. Grothendieck, J.J. Millson, M. Schlessinger, J. Stasheff, and many others, says that any deformation
problem over a field of characteristic zero can be encoded by a differential graded Lie algebra. A precise
mathematical statement, together with a proof of it, has recently been given by J. Lurie [Lur11] with the
help of higher category theory.
In general, algebras of a given type do not have nice homotopy properties. Instead, one should embed
them into a bigger category of homotopy algebras, where the original relations are relaxed up to an infinite
sequence of homotopies. Encoding types of algebras with the notion of an operad, one can apply the Koszul
duality of operads to produce the required notion of homotopy algebras and a suitable notion of morphisms
between them, called ∞-morphisms.
Simultaneously the Koszul duality of operads also produces a differential graded Lie algebra which
encodes homotopy algebra structures, thereby answering the philosophy of deformation theory in this
case. This means that the solutions to the Maurer–Cartan equation are in one-to-one correspondence with
homotopy algebra structures and that the action of the gauge group, coming from the integration of the Lie

algebra into a Lie group, gives a suitable equivalence relation between these elements. These two pieces of
data form the Deligne groupoid, which is described by the first result of the present paper.
Theorem 3. The Deligne groupoid coming from the differential graded Lie algebra associated to a Koszul
operad P and a chain complex V admits, for objects, the set of P∞ -algebra structures on V and, for
morphisms, the ∞-isomorphisms whose first component is the identity.
The proof of this result relies on the following general method. We first notice that this differential
graded Lie algebra actually carries the refined algebraic structure of a pre-Lie algebra. An algebra of this
type is made up of a binary product whose associator is right-symmetric. So, the induced bracket defined
by the commutator of the binary product satisfies the Jacobi identity. This algebraic structure was first
discovered on the Hochschild cochain complex of associative algebras [Ger63] and on the space of vector
fields on a manifold with a flat connection, where it is called a Vinberg algebra after [Vin63].
In this paper, we develop the integration theory of pre-Lie algebras, that is we construct a group whose
tangent space at the unit is the original pre-Lie algebra. Some of the ingredients are not new, since the
notions of pre-Lie exponential and pre-Lie logarithm, as known as Magnus expansion, were already present
in the seminal work of Agrachev–Gamkrelidze [AG80] on the solutions of differential equations defined by
a flow. Recall that one can associate to any pre-Lie product an infinite collection of operations of any arity,
called the symmetric braces, see [OG08, LM05]. We prove that the product of this gauge group, obtained
by integration (exponentiation), is equal to the sum of the symmetric braces.
Theorem 2. Under the pre-Lie exponential map, the gauge group is isomorphic to the group made up of
group-like elements equipped with the associative product equal to the sum of all symmetric braces.
The general construction of the gauge group and its action on Maurer–Cartan elements in differential
graded Lie algebras are not very manageable since they rely on the intricate Baker–Campbell-Hausdorff
formula. In the same way as in the above mentioned theorem, we give a simpler formula for the gauge
group action for differential graded pre-Lie algebras. This pre-Lie algebra calculus makes the deformation
theory modeled by differential graded pre-Lie algebras easier to work with. Thanks to this more computable
calculus, we are able to prove the following results on the moduli spaces of homotopy algebras.
The Homotopy Transfer Theorem, see [LV12, Chapter 10], extending the Homological Perturbation
Lemma, explains how one can transfer homotopy algebra structures through deformation retracts in a
homotopy coherent way. Using the pre-Lie deformation theory, we shed new light on this theorem. With
the original algebraic structure and the homotopy datum of the deformation retract, we consider two gauge
group elements, both solutions to a certain fixed point equation. Then, the core of the Homotopy Transfer
Theorem lies in the following result:
the action of these two gauge group elements on the original structure produces two ∞-isomorphic
homotopy algebra structures, which are respectively restricted (inputs) and co-restricted (output) to the
homotopy equivalent space.
We provide all the formulae for the Homotopy Transfer Theorem, but, more interesting, this approach
gives a conceptual explanation for the discrepancy between them: the transferred structure and extension
of the inclusion, on the one side, and the extension of the projection and the extension of the homotopy, on
the other side.
Finally, this study allows us to solve the following problem: find a criterion on the level of a homotopy
algebra for the uniform vanishing of the transferred structure on its underlying homology.
Theorem 4. A homotopy algebra structure is homotopy trivial if and only if it is gauge trivial.
Notice that we already stated, proved, and used this result in [DSV15] but only for the simplest possible
example, that of mixed complexes. In that case, this was providing us with the ultimate generalization of
the ddc -Lemma of Rational Homotopy Theory due to Deligne–Griffiths–Morgan–Sullivan [DGMS75].
Layout. We begin by recalling in Section 1 how deformation theory works with differential graded Lie
algebras. We make it more precise when it is actually coming from a differential graded associative algebra
(Section 2); this includes the particular case of homotopy modules over a Koszul algebra (Section 3). Then,
we develop the deformation theory modeled by differential graded pre-Lie algebras in terms of pre-Lie
exponentials and symmetric braces (Section 4). It includes the case of homotopy algebras over a Koszul

of diagrams of operads. We treat the homotopy trivialization in Section 7 and the Homotopy Transfer

In this introductory section, we recall the deformation theory controlled by a dg Lie algebra: Maurer–
Cartan elements and their equivalence relation. We emphasize the role of the differential trick, which
consists in making the differential internal, and thus helps to provide neater formulae.
Let g = (g, d, [ , ]) be a dg Lie algebra, with homological convention, i.e. |d| = −1. We consider the
variety of Maurer–Cartan elements
	

MC(g) := ᾱ ∈ g−1 | dᾱ + 12 [ᾱ, ᾱ] = 0 .
Any element λ ∈ g0 induces the following vector field

dλ + [λ, −] = dλ + adλ ∈ Γ(T MC(g)) .
Two Maurer–Cartan elements ᾱ, β̄ are equivalent when there exists an element λ ∈ g0 whose flow relates
ᾱ to β̄ in finite time. Formulae are easily produced by the following trick. Let’s consider the “augmented”
dg Lie algebra
g ֌ g+ := (g ⊕ Kδ, d, [ , ]) ,
where |δ| = −1, d(δ) = 0, [δ, x] = d(x), and [δ, δ] = 0. (One could now forget the differential d, since it
has been made internal d = [δ, -] in this new dg Lie algebra.) The affine bijection
ᾱ 7→ α := δ + ᾱ ,
for |ᾱ| = −1, and x 7→ x otherwise, transforms the Maurer–Cartan equation into the square-zero equation
Sq(g+ ) := {α = δ + ᾱ ∈ g−1 ⊕ Kδ | [α, α] = 0} .
Notice that g0 = (g ⊕ Kδ)0 and that the vector fields now become
[λ, −] = adλ ∈ Γ(T Sq(g+ )) .
So the solutions to the differential equation
γ ′ (t) = adλ (γ(t))
are
γ(t) = etadλ (γ0 ) .
If γ0 = α, and under convergence assumptions, then we define
β = eadλ (α) .
Going back to the Lie algebra g, this gives
δ+ β̄ = eadλ (δ+ᾱ) = eadλ (δ)+eadλ (ᾱ) = δ+(eadλ −id)(δ)+eadλ (ᾱ) = δ+

eadλ − id
(dλ) + eadλ (ᾱ) .

THEORY WITH ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS

In this section, we simplify the above-mentioned treatment when the Lie bracket is coming from an associative product. This helps us to introduce the gauge group and to understand why the above equivalence
relation is actually coming form a group action.
Suppose that the dg Lie algebra g = (g, d, [ , ]) comes from a unital dg associative algebra a = (A, d, ⋆, 1)
under the anti-symmetrized bracket [x, y] := x ⋆ y − (−1)|x||y|y ⋆ x. Let us further assume the existence
of an underlying weight grading, different from the homological degree, satisfying
A∼

A(n) ,

1 ∈ A(0) ,

A(n) ⋆ A(m) ⊂ A(n+m) ,

and g ∼

so

A∼
= A(0) × g .

(The following deformation theory works under more general conditions, but the ones given here correspond precisely to the various examples treated in the present paper.)
Under this assumption, the exponential of elements λ with trivial weight 0 component is well defined

And so the images of the degree 0 elements under the exponential map form a group

eλ := 1 + λ +

made up of the group-like elements, that is the degree 0 elements whose weight 0 term is equal to 1.
The (infinitesimal) adjoint action then reads
adλ (-) = (λ ⋆ -) − (- ⋆ λ) .

Since it comes from two commuting operators in End(g), the (full) action is equal to the conjugation action
of the exponential group
eadλ (α) = elλ ◦ er−λ (α) = eλ ⋆ α ⋆ e−λ .
Notice that, pulling back the product in the exponential group with the logarithm map gives the following
group product on g0 :
1
x · y = ln (ex ⋆ ey ) = x + y + [x, y] + · · · = BCH(x, y) ,
2
produced by the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula.
In general, the dg Lie algebra does not come from a dg associative algebra and the exponential group
does not exist. Still, one can consider the group structure, defined by the BCH formula on g0 :
Γ := (g0 , x · y := BCH(x, y), 0) ,
under some nilpotence or convergence condition, like the one considered above. This group is called the
gauge group.
Proposition 1 ([GM88]). When the infinitesimal action of the Lie algebra g0 defined in Section 1 converges
at t = 1, it is given by the action of the gauge group Γ on the variety of Maurer–Cartan elements under the
formula:
λ.α := eadλ (α) .
Proof. The action of 0 is trivial
0.α = ead0 (α) = id(α) = α ,
and the action respects the group structure
λ.(µ.α) = eadλ (eadµ (α)) = (eadλ ◦ eadµ )(α) = eadBCH(λ,µ) (α) = (λ · µ).α .

In this case, one considers the Deligne groupoid associated to the dg Lie algebra g:
Deligne(g) := (MC(g), Γ) ,
whose objets are Maurer–Cartan elements of g and whose morphisms are given by the action of the gauge
group Γ.

HOMOTOPY MODULES OVER A

KOSZUL ALGEBRA

In this section, we apply the general deformation theory controlled by a dg associative algebra to the
example of homotopy modules over a Koszul algebra.
Let A be a (homogeneous) Koszul algebra with Koszul dual coalgebra A¡ , see [LV12, Chapter 3]. We
¡
denote its coaugmentation ideal by A . Let (V, d) be a chain complex. The set of (left) module structures
over the Koszul resolution A∞ := ΩA¡ on V is given by the Maurer–Cartan elements
∂(α) + α ⋆ α = 0
of the convolution dg associative algebra

.

One can embed it inside the dg associative algebra g+
A,V , defined in the same way as before for dg Lie
algebras, but this last one still misses a unit. Instead, we consider the more natural dg unital associative
algebra made up of all the maps from the Koszul dual coalgebra to the endomorphism algebra

¡
gA,V ֌ g+
A,V ֌ aA,V := Hom(A , End(V )), (∂V )∗ , ⋆, 1 ,
where the unit is given by

1 : I 7→ idV
and where the last embedding is given by δ 7→ (I 7→ ∂V ) . This associative algebra is graded by the weight
grading of the Koszul dual coalgebra:
Y

aA,V =
Hom A¡ (n) , End(V ) .
n∈N

Since the Koszul dual coalgebra is connected, i.e. A¡ (0) = I and A¡ (n) = 0 for n < 0, the convolution
unital associative algebra aA,V decomposes as follows
∞
Y


Hom A¡ , End(V ) ∼

So its elements are series f = f(0) + f(1) + f(2) + · · · , where f(n) : A¡ (n) → End(V ) . One can view the
gauge group Γ in term of group-like elements under the exponential map.
Proposition 2. The exponential map

The classical computations hold here, so one has ln(eλ ) = λ and eln(1+λ) = 1 + λ for any λ ∈ Hom(A ,
End(V )), which concludes the proof.

In this case, the exponential group G exists in the bigger algebra aA,V , and is isomorphic to the gauge
group Γ. By the weight grading property, its action on Maurer–Cartan elements is well defined and given
by the conjugation
eadλ (α) = eλ ⋆ α ⋆ e−λ .
Since the Maurer–Cartan elements correspond to homotopy A-module structures, the question is now
how to give a homotopical interpretation to the gauge group and its action. Let α and β be two homotopy A-module structures on V , i.e. two Maurer–Cartan elements. One defines a more general notion of
maps between two homotopy A-modules, called ∞-morphisms and denoted α
β, by degree 0 maps
f : A¡ → End(V ) satisfying the equation
f ⋆α=β⋆f .
These can be composed by the formula g ⋆ f and ∞-isomorphisms are the ∞-morphisms such that the first
component is invertible, i.e. f(0) (I) ∈ GL(V ). When this first component is the identity map, we call them
∞-isotopies and we denote their set by ∞−iso.
Theorem 1. For any Koszul algebra A and for any chain complex (V, d), the group of ∞-isotopies is
isomorphic to the gauge group
Γ = (g0 , BCH, 0) ∼
= (∞−iso, ⋆, idV )
and the Deligne groupoid is isomorphic to the groupoid whose objects are homotopy A-modules and whose
morphisms are ∞-isotopies
Deligne(gA,V ) = (MC(gA,V ), Γ) = (A∞ −Mod, ∞−iso) .
Proof. The first assertion follows directly from Proposition 2. Two Maurer–Cartan elements α and β are
gauge equivalent if and only if there is an ∞-isotopy between the two homotopy A-module structures on
¡
V . Indeed, there exists λ ∈ Hom(A , End(V ))0 such that β = eλ .α = eλ ⋆ α ⋆ e−λ if and only if
eλ ⋆ α = β ⋆ eλ .

E XAMPLE . The example of the Koszul algebra D = T (∆)/(∆2 ) of dual numbers was treated in [DSV15].
The gauge group action was used there to define new invariants on the de Rham cohomology of Poisson
manifolds.

THEORY WITH PRE -L IE ALGEBRAS

The notion of pre-Lie algebra sits between the notion of an associative algebra and the notion of a Lie
algebra: any associative algebra is an example of a pre-Lie algebra and any pre-Lie product induces a Lie
bracket. In this section, we first develop the integration theory of pre-Lie algebras, that is how to get a
group via exponentials from a pre-Lie algebra. Then, we apply it to make explicit the deformation theory
controlled by pre-Lie algebras, that is we describe the gauge equivalence via the action of this latter group.
Let us now study the more general situation where the dg Lie algebra g = (g, d, [ , ]) is actually
coming from a dg left unital pre-Lie algebra a = (A, d, ⋆, 1): under the usual anti-symmetrization:
[x, y] := x ⋆ y − (−1)|x||y|y ⋆ x. Recall, for instance from [LV12, Section 13.4], that a pre-Lie algebra is defined by a binary product whose associator is right symmetric:

(x ⋆ y) ⋆ z − x ⋆ (y ⋆ z) = (−1)|y||z| (x ⋆ z) ⋆ y − x ⋆ (z ⋆ y) .
Here the unit is only supposed to hold on the left-hand side: 1 ⋆ x = x.
We will again assume the existence of similar underlying weight grading satisfying
(1) A ∼

Under this assumption, one can realize the gauge group Γ as exponentials as follows. For pre-Lie algebras,
one chooses to iterate the product on the right-hand side:

(Notice that the space of vector fields of a manifolds with a flat and torsion free connection admits a pre-Lie
product such that the solutions to the flow differential equation are given by such series, see [Vin63, AG80]
for more details.)
We call group-like element any degree 0 element of a whose weight 0 component is equal to 1. We
denote the associated set by G.

Proof. Any element λ ∈ g0 viewed in a decomposes according to the weight grading as follows
λ = λ(1) + · · · + λ(n) + · · · ,
where λ(n) ∈ A(n) . So the exponential of λ is equal to
eλ

Recall that, in any pre-Lie algebra, one defines symmetric braces operations by the following formulae:
{a; }
{a; b1 }
{a; b1 , b2 }

:= a
:= a ⋆ b1
:= {{a; b1 }; b2 } − {a; {b1 ; b2 }} = (a ⋆ b1 ) ⋆ b2 − a ⋆ (b1 ⋆ b2 )

{a; b1 , . . . , bn }

n−1
X

{a; b1 , . . . , bi−1 , {bi ; bn }, bi+1 , . . . , bn−1 } .

One can see that these operations are (graded) symmetric with respect to the n right-hand side inputs. They
satisfy some relations, see [LV12, Section 13.11.4]. The category of pre-Lie algebras is isomorphic to the
category of symmetric braces algebras [OG08].
In any pre-Lie algebra like a, we define the circle product as the sum of the symmetric braces
X 1
a ⊚ (1 + b) :=
{a; b, . . . , b} ,
| {z }
n!
n≥0

n

for any a, b ∈ A such that b has trivial weight zero component. One can see that the circle product is linear
only on the left-hand side, i.e. with respect to a, and that 1 is a unit for it: a⊚ 1 = a and 1 ⊚ (1 + b) = 1 + b.

Proposition 3. Any pre-Lie algebra a, with the weight grading condition (1), satisfies:
erλ (a) = a ⊚ eλ ,
for any a, λ ∈ A, with λ having trivial weight zero component and where the operator rλ (a) := a ⋆ λ
presents the right product by λ.
Proof. It is enough to prove this result in the free pre-Lie algebra on two generators λ and a. Recall from
[CL01] that this free pre-Lie algebra is given by rooted trees with vertices labelled by λ and a, where the
pre-Lie product of two such trees is equal to the sum over all possible ways to graft the root of the second
tree at the top of a vertex of the first one. The unit is given by the trivial tree with no vertices.
For any rooted tree t ∈ RT, we denote by νt the number of its vertices and by nt by number of ways
to put its vertices on levels with one and only one vertex per level. (These numbers are also called the
Connes–Moscovici weights, see [Kre99, Bro00]). We will call this process “levelization”. In the example

Since the formula for the pre-Lie exponential eλ := 1 + λ + λ2! + λ3! + · · · is defined by iterating the
product ⋆ on the right-hand side, it amounts to successively graft the tree with one vertex labelled by λ on
the top of the root vertex labelled by λ. Therefore, the exponential of λ is equal to the following series of
rooted trees

eλ =

where the notation t(λ) stands for the rooted trees t with all vertices labelled by λ.
Since the element

Theorem 2. Under the pre-Lie exponential map, the gauge group is isomorphic to the group made up of
group-like elements equipped with the circle product:
Γ = (g0 , BCH, 0) ∼

Proof. It is known that
eBCH(µ,λ) = erλ (eµ ) ,

When one does not know the exponential form of a group-like element 1 − µ, with µ ∈ g, its inverse,
for the circle product, can be described as follows. We consider the free pre-Lie algebra preLie(a) on one
generator a, which is given by rooted trees (with vertices labelled by a). By the universal property, there
exists one morphism of pre-Lie algebras from preLie(a) to a. For any rooted tree t, we denote by t(µ) the
image of the tree t under this morphism.
A morphism between two trees is a map sending vertices to vertices and edges to edges which respects
the adjacency condition. We denote by Aut t the group of automorphisms of a tree t and by |Aut t| its
cardinal.
Proposition 4. In any preLie algebra a satisfying the weight grading assumption (1), the inverse, for the
circle product, of a group-like element 1 − µ, with µ ∈ g, is given by

in the free pre-Lie algebra preLie(a). The left-hand term is equal to a sum over the set of rooted trees.
The trivial tree appears only once. Let s ∈ rRT denote a non-trivial rooted tree, that is with at least one
vertex. There are two ways to get the term s(a). The first way comes with the element 1 of (1 − a); so the
1
coefficient is |Aut
s| . The other way comes with the element a of (1 − a). The non-trivial tree s is equal to
a root vertex grafted by trees t1 , . . . , tk . Therefore, the coefficient of the element s(a) arising in that way
is equal to

However, the automorphism group of the tree s is isomorphic to

respectively by t1 , . . . , tk . Therefore, the coefficient of the element s(a) arising in that way is equal to

s| , which concludes the proof.
So, in this case, the exponential group G exists in the bigger algebra a and realizes the gauge group
Γ coming from the Lie algebra g. Using this realization of the gauge group, the action on the variety of
Maurer–Cartan elements is given by the following formula.
Proposition 5. Under the abovementioned weight grading assumption, the infinitesimal Lie algebra g0
action defined in Section 1 integrates to t = 1 and is equal to the following action of the gauge group on
the variety of Maurer–Cartan elements :

λ.α = eadλ (α) = eλ ⋆ α ⊚ e−λ .

Proof. The weight grading assumption ensures the convergence of etadλ (α) at t = 1 to eadλ (α). The
function γ(t) := etadλ (α) is the unique solution to the differential equation

γ ′ (t) = adλ (γ(t)) = λ ⋆ γ(t) − γ(t) ⋆ λ

such that γ(0) = α. Let us show that the function ϕ(t) := etλ ⋆ α ⊚ e−tλ satisfies the same differential
equation, which will conclude the proof. First, the value of the function ϕ at t = 0 is
ϕ(0) = (1 ⋆ α) ⊚ 1 = α .

Since the pre-Lie product ⋆ amounts to grafting a vertex c above the rooted trees labeled by a and b, then
there are two possibilities: one can graft the vertex c above the root vertex a or above one of the n vertices
b. So we recover precisely the two above sums, which proves Formula (2).

Therefore the function ϕ(t) satisfies the same differential equation as the function γ(t), that is

Hence, ϕ(1) = γ(1), which is the formula of the proposition.

HOMOTOPY ALGEBRAS OVER A

KOSZUL OPERAD

We can now apply the general pre-Lie deformation theory of the previous section to the case of homotopy algebras over a Koszul operad. This allows us to describe the associated Deligne groupoid in
homotopical terms. This uses the crucial fact that the deformation theory of algebras over an operad is
controlled by a Lie algebra coming from a pre-Lie algebra.
Let P be a (homogeneous) Koszul operad with Koszul dual cooperad P ¡ . Let (V, d) be a chain complex.
Recall from [LV12, Chapter 10] that the set of algebra structures over the Koszul resolution P∞ = ΩP ¡ on
V is given by the Maurer–Cartan elements
∂(α) + α ⋆ α = 0
of the convolution dg pre-Lie algebra

we choose to embed it inside the dg left unital pre-Lie algebra made up of all the maps from the Koszul
dual cooperad to the endomorphism operad

N OTATION . We will still denote by f ⊚ g the operation in the convolution pre-Lie algebra aP,V defined
by the composite γ(f ◦ g)∆, for any f, g, even when their first component is not the identity. This generalization of the product ⊚ satisfies the same properties, like the associativity relation for instance.
Since the Maurer–Cartan elements of aP,V correspond to homotopy P-algebra structures, the question
is now how to give a homotopical interpretation of the gauge group and its action. Let α and β be two
homotopy P-algebra structures on V , i.e. two Maurer–Cartan elements. One defines a more general
notion of maps between two homotopy P-algebras, called ∞-morphisms and denoted α
β, by degree 0
elements f : P ¡ → EndV satisfying the equation
f ⋆α=β⊚f .
(Notice the discrepancy of this formula: the ⋆-product lies on the left-hand side and the ⊚-product lies
on the right-hand side.) They can be composed using the formula f ⊚ g and ∞-isomorphisms are the
∞-morphisms such that the first composite is invertible, i.e. f(0) (I) ∈ GL(V ). When this first component
is the identity map, we call them ∞-isotopies. We refer the reader to [LV12, Section 10.2] for more details.
Theorem 3. For any Koszul operad P and for any chain complex (V, d), the group of ∞-isotopies is
isomorphic to the gauge group under the preLie exponential map
Γ = (g0 , BCH, 0) ∼
= (∞-iso, ⊚, idV ) .
The Deligne groupoid is isomorphic to the groupoid whose objects are homotopy P-algebras and whose
morphisms are ∞-isotopies
Deligne(gP,V ) = (MC(gP,V ), Γ) ∼
= (P∞ -Alg, ∞-iso) .

Proof. The first assertion follows directly Theorem 2 and Lemma 2. The second assertion is given by
Proposition 5 as follows. Two Maurer–Cartan elements α and β are gauge equivalent if and only if there is
¡
an element λ ∈ Hom(P , End(V ))0 such that
β = eadλ (α) = (eλ ⋆ α) ⊚ e−λ .
By considering the circle product by eλ on the right, it is equivalent to
eλ ⋆ α = β ⊚ eλ ,
which means that eλ is an ∞-isotopy between α and β. One concludes with the bijective property of the

pre-Lie exponential map of Lemma 1.
R EMARKS .
⋄ This gauge equivalence first appeared in the paper [Kad88] of T. Kadeshvili for the Koszul operad
encoding associative algebras.
⋄ The results of Theorem 3 give a conceptual framework to state in full generality the theory of
Koszul hierarchy developed by M. Markl in [Mar15, Mar14] for the operads As and Lie. Let P
be a Koszul operad, let µ : P ! → EndA be an algebra structure over the Koszul dual operad, and
let ∆ be an degree 1 square-zero operator on A. We work here with the cohomological degree
convention and s denotes an element of degree 1. Any basis of the Koszul dual operad P ! gives
rise to a gauge group element defined by the composite
∗
µ⊗id
Φ : P¡ ∼
= EndsA .
= P ! ⊗ EndKs → P ! ⊗ EndKs −−−→ EndA ⊗ EndKs ∼

Therefore, the gauge action of Φ on the trivial P∞ -algebra structure αtr = (sA, ∆) produces a
P∞ -algebra structure (Φ−1 ⋆ αtr ) ⊚ Φ on the suspended chain complex sA. This construction
answers the question raised in Section 2.6 of [Mar15]. For the operad P = Lie of Lie algebras,
its Koszul dual is the operad P ! = Com of commutative algebras. Using the canonical basis
of this one-dimensional S-module in any arity, one recovers the Koszul hierarchy [Kos85] of a
commutative algebra, which forms an L∞ -algebra, cf. [Mar15, Example 2.8]. In the same way,
the nonsymmetric operad As of associative algebras is Koszul auto-dual As! = As and onedimensional in each arity. Using its canonical basis, one recovers the Börjeson hierarchy [Bö13]
of an associative algebra, which forms an A∞ -algebra, cf. [Mar15, Example 2.4]. Our results also
explain why these new structures are homotopy trivial, that is they produce trivial structures on the
cohomology level H • (sA, ∆), see Theorem 4.
Using this theorem, we can give yet another homotopy description of the Deligne groupoid. By definition, a homotopy P-algebra structure on a chain complex (V, d) is a morphism of dg operads
P∞ = ΩP ¡ → EndV .
Since, the source is cofibrant and the target is fibrant in the model category of dg operads [Hin97], then the
homotopy relation is an equivalence relation, denoted ∼h , which can be equivalently realized by any path
or cylinder object.
Corollary 2. The Deligne groupoid is isomorphic to the groupoid
Deligne(gP,V ) ∼
= (Homdg Op (ΩP ¡ , EndV ), ∼h ) ,
whose objects are morphisms of dg operads and whose morphisms are the homotopy equivalences.
Proof. This result follows in a straightforward way from Theorem 3 and the cylinder object given by B.
Fresse in [Fre09]. In loc. cit., the author proves that two such morphisms of dg operads are homotopy
equivalent with respect to his cylinder object if and only if the two homotopy P-algebras are related by an
∞-isotopy.

R EMARKS .
⋄ In [DR12], V. Dolgushev and C. Rogers almost proved this result: they consider a path object type
construction of dg operads but without proving the model category property. Then, they prove that
the associated “homotopy equivalence” is equivalent to the gauge equivalence (Theorem 5.6).

PRE-LIE DEFORMATION THEORY

⋄ Using other methods (coming from derived algebraic geometry), S. Yalin recently and independently proved a higher (simplicial) version of this result in [Yal14].
Homotopy P-algebra structures can be equivalently described by the following three bijective sets:
Homdg Op (ΩP ¡ , EndV ) ∼
= MC(gP,V ) ∼
= Codiff (P ¡ (V )) ,
which is called the Rosetta Stone in [LV12]. The various results of this section show that these bijections
of sets can be lifted to isomorphisms of groupoids:

6. H OMOTOPY

PROPERTIES OF ALGEBRAS OVER AN OPERAD

In this section, we use the diagrammatic method, due to Rezk [Rez96], to describe the homotopical
properties of algebras over an operad. The first part, which recalls the general notion of cofibrant replacement and a proof of the homotopy transfer theorem from [BM03, Fre10], is not new. The second part deals
with trivial homotopy transfer structure. This gives rise to a new general notion in any category theory,
dual to cofibrant replacement which we call homotopy trivialization. These two parts will be refined in the
next sections, using the preLie deformation calculus.
6.1. Categorical operadic interpretation. Let P be an operad and let f : V → H be a morphism of
chain complexes. We consider two P-algebra structures on V and on H respectively, α : P → EndV and
β : P → EndH . Recall that the map f is a morphism of P-algebras if and only if the following diagram
commutes in the category of S-modules

where EndV ×f EndH = {(g, h) ∈ EndV × EndH | f ◦ g(n) = h(n) ◦ f ⊗n }.
6.2. Homotopy transfer theorem. Suppose now that we are only given a P-algebra structure α on V and
∼
that f : V −
→ H is a quasi-isomorphism of chain complexes. One of the main application of this section
is given when H is equal to the homology H(V ) of V ; in this case, f is a cofibration, assumption that we
will keep in this section (only).
The homotopy transfer theorem (HTT) gives an answer to the following question: what kind of algebraic
structure, related to P, can be transferred from V to H?
Definition 1 (Cofibrant replacement). In any model category, a cofibrant replacement P∞ of an object P
is a factorisation of the initial map I → P into a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration:
I /

/ P∞

∼

//P .

So cofibrant replacements are unique up to homotopy. We consider here cofibrant replacements in the
model category of dg operads of [Hin97]. For instance, when the operad P is Koszul, the Koszul resolution
ΩP ¡ is cofibrant.
Cofibrant replacements give the kind of algebraic structure that one can homotopically transfer onto H.

Proposition 6 ([BM03]). For any acyclic cofibration f : H ֌ V and for any P-algebra structure α on
V , there exists a homotopy equivalent P∞ -algebra structure α̂ on V and a P∞ -algebra structure β on H,
such that the chain map f : H → V becomes a quasi-isomorphism of P∞ -algebras from (H, β) to (V, α̂).
Proof. We reproduce here quickly the main ingredient of the proof of [Fre10, Theorem 7.3 (2)] since we
will use it in the sequel. It is based on the following diagram of operads

that α

When the operad P is Koszul, one can use the cylinder object of [Fre09] to describe the homotopy equivalence of operads maps. This shows that the chain map f extends to an ∞-quasi-isomorphism:

Definition 2 (Homotopy transferred structure). For any quasi-isomorphism f : H −

transferred structure is any P∞ -algebra structure on H for which there exists an extension of the chain
map f into an ∞-quasi-isomorphism.
6.3. Homotopy trivialization. Suppose now that a homotopy transferred structure is trivial (strictly or in
general up to homotopy, see Definition 4), what does it mean about the initial P-algebra structure on V ?
Can one already read on that level some homotopy trivialization structure? To this extend, we now define
the general notion of homotopy trivialization, which is dual to the notion of cofibrant replacement.
Definition 3 (Homotopy trivialization). In any model category, a homotopy trivialization ho P of an object
P is a factorisation of the terminal map P → 0 into a cofibration followed by an acyclic fibration:
P /

//0 .

Homotopy trivializations are well defined up to homotopy and this notion commutes with the notion of
cofibrant replacement up to homotopy.
Lemma 3. In any model category, a cofibrant replacement of a homotopy trivialization is homotopy equivalent to a homotopy trivialization of a cofibrant replacement:
(ho P)∞ ≃ ho(P∞ ) .

We consider now homotopy trivializations in the model category of dg operads of [Hin97]. In this
case, homotopy trivializations ho P of P are retracts of a coproduct of P with a quasi-free operad T (Y )
generated by a free S-modules Y endowed with a triangulation, that is a filtration satisfying the following
conditions:
P ∨ T (Y0 ⊕ Y1 ⊕ · · · ) with d(Yn ) ⊂ P ∨ T (Y0 ⊕ Y1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Yn−1 ) .
We shall only be considering coproducts with quasi-free resolutions. In this case, the first “syzygies” Y0
are homotopy trivializations of the generators of P, the second ones Y1 are homotopies for these homotopies, etc. The differential dP + dχ is made up of the unique derivation dχ which extends a gluing map
χ : Y → P ∨ T (Y ). So it is often denoted by
ho P = P ∨χ T (Y ) := (P ∨ T (Y ), dP + dχ ) .
In the Koszul case, one can consider the following two homotopy trivializations of the operad P and
¡
of the operad P∞ respectively. In the first case, the underlying S-module is given by P ∨ T (P ). For the
¡
¡
direct one, the gluing map χ : P → P ∨ T (P ) is

direct one is produced by the gluing map χ : P → T (s−1 P ⊕ P ) equal to

Lemma 4. Let P be a Koszul operad. The above mentioned direct and the opposite operads are homotopy
trivializations of the operad P and P∞ respectively.
Proof. Each of these four constructions provides us with a dg operad: it is enough to prove that (dχ )2 ,
¡
respectively (dP∞ + dχ )2 , vanishes on P . The result is given by a straightforward computation and the
¡
coassociative properties of the (infinitesimal) decomposition coproduct of the Koszul dual cooperad P .
¡
¡
The embedding P ֌ P ∨χ T (P ), respectively P∞ ֌ P∞ ∨χ T (P ), is a cofibration by [Hin97,
¡
¡
Lemma 6.7.1]. The trivial map P ∨χ T (P ) ։ 0, respectively P∞ ∨χ T (P ) ։ 0 is a fibration since it is
surjective.
It remains to prove that it is a quasi-isomorphism. In the case of the direct candidate for the operad P,
¡
the underlying operad of P ∨χ T (P ) is made up of trees with vertices alternately labelled by elements
¡
¡
of P and T (P ). The differential only applies non-trivially to the upper vertices of T (P ), splitting the
¡
labeling element of P into two and composing the obtained top element with the above element in P. So
¡
as a chain complex, the component P ∨χ T (P ) without the trivial part I, is isomorphic to a direct sum
¡
of chain sub-complexes, which are made up of tensors of P with the augmentation part of the Koszul
complex P ¡ ◦κ P. Since the operad P is Koszul, the Koszul complex is acyclic, which proves that the
¡
homology of P ∨χ T (P ) is trivial. The same arguments hold mutatis mutandis for the three other cases,
where one has just to replace the Koszul complex P ¡ ◦κ P by, respectively, the acyclic Koszul complex
P ◦κ P ¡ , and the acyclic bar constructions P ¡ ◦ι ΩP ¡ and ΩP ¡ ◦ι P ¡ .

One can see that an algebra over the direct, respectively the opposite, homotopy trivialization amounts
to a P-algebra or a P∞ -algebra structure together with an ∞-isotopy to, respectively from, the trivial
structure; that is an algebra structure together with a gauge group element whose action produces the
trivial structure. Notice that here, we have an isomorphism (ho P)∞ ∼
= ho(P∞ ) and not only a quasiisomorphism.

play a key role in the description of Givental action on Cohomological Field Theories in [DSV15bis].

Proposition 7. For any acyclic cofibration f : H ֌ V and for any P-algebra structure on V , the

Proof.
(=⇒) If the map β is homotopy trivial, applying [Lur09, Proposition A.2.3.1] to the cofibration P∞ ֌

Finally, since the map P ֌ ho P is a cofibration, we can apply again [Lur09, Proposition A.2.3.1]
to prove the existence of a map ho P → EndV which factors the initial P-algebra structure α on
V.
(⇐=) In the other way round, if the initial P-algebra structure extends to a ho P-algebra structure, this
means that the structure map α factors through ho P, that is α : P ֌ ho P → EndV . By pulling

back with ho(P∞ ) → ho P, the space V acquires a ho(P∞ )-algebra structure. We can apply the
arguments of the proof of Proposition 6, to produce a map ho(P∞ ) → EndV ×f EndH whose
composite with EndV ×f EndH → EndV is homotopy equivalent to the previous one. By the
commutative diagrams of the proof of Lemma 3, this produces a required homotopy equivalent
P∞ -algebra structure α
e. Therefore, the induced transferred P∞ -algebra structure on H factors
through ho(P∞ ). Since the operad ho(P∞ ) is homotopy trivial, so is this P∞ -algebra structure.

In the case where H is the homology of the chain complex V with a choice of lifting of the homology
classes H ֌ V , this proposition shows, together with the above mentioned homotopy trivializations of
P∞ , that the transferred structure on H of Proposition 6 is homotopy trivial if and only if the original
structure on V is gauge trivial. We will generalize this result in the next section and prove that it actually
does not depend on either a choice of a lifting or a transferred structure.

TRIVIALIZATION

Using the pre-Lie deformation theory, we show the equivalence between gauge trivial and homotopy
trivial P∞ -algebra structures. In this section, we work with a Koszul operad P.
Lemma 5. Let α be a P∞ -algebra structure on a chain complex (V, d). The following assertions are
equivalent.
(1) There exist a deformation retract onto the homology H(V ) for which a homotopy transferred
structure is trivial.
(2) Every homotopy transferred structure onto the homology H(V ) is trivial.
(3) The P∞ -algebra structure α on V is homotopy trivial.
Proof.
(1) ⇒ (2) Assumption (1) provides us with a trivial transferred structure
(H(V ), 0, 0)
Let

be any other transferred structure. Since any ∞-quasi-isomorphism admits a homotopy inverse
[LV12, Theorem 10.4.4.], there exists an ∞-isomorphism
f : (H(V ), 0, 0)

∼
=

(H(V ), 0, β) .

Using the weight grading decomposition, the equation satisfied by the ∞-isotopy f becomes

Using the fact that f(0) (I) ∈ GL(H(V )), one can see that β = 0, by induction.

map α in the model category of operads by the cylinder construction of [Fre09].

In plain words, a P∞ -algebra structure is homotopy trivial if and only if it transfers uniformly, for any
choice of quasi-isomorphism and any choice of transferred structure, to a trivial structure on its underlying
homology.

Theorem 4. A P∞ -algebra structure is homotopy trivial if and only if it is gauge trivial.
Proof. Let us first prove that gauge trivial implies homotopy trivial. By Theorem 3, being gauge trivial
implies that there exists an ∞-isotopy
(V, d, 0)

=

(V, d, α) .

For any deformation retract onto the homology H(V ), the chain map
(H(V ), 0, 0)

∼

(V, d, 0) .

is an ∞-quasi-isomorphism for the trivial structures. The composite of these two ∞-morphims show that
the P∞ -algebra structure α is homotopy trivial.
Let us now prove that homotopy trivial implies gauge trivial. Suppose that there exists a deformation retract
onto the homology H(V ) with an associated transferred structure which is trivial. The deformation retract
data provides us with an isomorphism of chain complexes (V, d) ∼
= (H(V ) ⊕ K, dK ), where (K, dK ) is
acyclic. By [LV12, Theorem 10.4.3], this chain map extends into an ∞-isomorphism
(V, d, α)

∼
=

(H(V ) ⊕ K, dK , 0) .

The inverse chain map provides us with an ∞-quasi-isomorphism
(H(V ) ⊕ K, dK , 0)

∼

(V, d, 0) .

between trivial P∞ -algebra structures. Since the composite of these two ∞-morphisms is an ∞-isotopy,
then α is gauge trivial, which concludes the proof.

This theorem establishes a useful method to prove the uniform triviality for transferred homotopy structures on homology, without having to compute any transfer formula. This result says that, in order to prove
the homotopy triviality of a P∞ -algebra structure, it is enough to find a series f = 1 + f(1) + f(2) + · · · in
HomS (P ¡ , EndV ) satisfying
f ⋆ δ = (δ + α) ⊚ f ,
¡

or equivalently, a series λ = λ(1) + λ(2) + · · · in HomS (P , EndV ) satisfying

eλ ⋆ δ ⊚ e−λ = δ + α .

This method was used in the simplest kind of homotopy algebras, namely multicomplexes, in [DSV15],
to prove the homotopy triviality of the Koszul’s Batalin–Vilkovisky operator on the de Rham cohomology
of Poisson manifolds. This allowed us to define new higher invariants parametrized by the cohomology of
the moduli space of genus 0 curves with marked points.
8. H OMOTOPY

TRANSFER THEOREM

In this section, we interpret the Homotopy Transfer Theorem of Proposition 6 and [LV12, Chapter 10] in
terms of gauge action in the pre-Lie deformation theory. Moreover, we provide complete formulae together
with a conceptual explanation for their internal structure.
Since we are working over a field, the datum of an acyclic cofibration, that is an injective quasiisomorphism, is equivalent to the datum of a contraction [EML53]:
h

ip − idV = dV h + hdV ,

pi = idH ,

h2 = 0 ,

ph = 0 ,

hi = 0 .

This datum is equivalent to a deformation retract datum satisfying the side conditions (the three last conditions). Notice that such a datum is completely equivalent to the sole datum of a degree one linear operator
h on the chain complex (V, dV ) satisfying h2 = 0 and hdh = h, see [BL91]. For simplicity, we will denote
the projection onto the image of H inside V by π := ip. We consider the following symmetric homotopies

from π ⊗n to id⊗n .
Let P be a Koszul operad. We work inside the convolution algebra


a = aP,V = HomS (P ¡ , EndV ), (∂V )∗ , ⋆, ⊚, 1 .

Recall that Maurer–Cartan elements ᾱ ∈ MC(g) are considered under the “augmented” form α := δ + ᾱ
¡
in this convolution algebra a. The set of group-like elements is G = {1} × HomS (P , EndV ).
Let us introduce the following two degree 0 operators acting on a:
L : G

It is equal to

⋄ The Ψ-kernel is the unique group-like element Ψ ∈ G solution to the fixed point equation
Ψ = 1 + R(Ψ) .
It is explicitly equal to
Ψ = 1 + R(1) + R2 (1) + R3 (1) + · · · = 1 − h∗ ᾱ + h∗ (h∗ ᾱ ⋆ ᾱ) − h∗ (h∗ (h∗ ᾱ ⋆ ᾱ) ⋆ ᾱ) + · · · .
The Φ-kernel and the Ψ-kernel induce the following two operators acting on the Maurer–Cartan variety:
MC(g) → MC(g)

α
7→ α̂ := Φ−1 ⋆ α ⊚ Φ

MC(g) → MC(g)
α
7→ α̌ := (Ψ ⋆ α) ⊚ Ψ−1 .

Any endomorphism of V , like h or π for instance, can be viewed as an element of the convolution
algebra a defined by I 7→ h, and denoted with the same notation. Therefore, pushing forward by an
endomorphism is equal to h∗ ᾱ = h ⋆ ᾱ = h ⊚ ᾱ, which we simply denote by hᾱ. In the same way, we
will denote, by a slight abuse of notations, the pullbacks i∗ (x) and pushforwards p∗ (x) simply by xi and
px respectively.
Proposition 8. Any Maurer–Cartan element ᾱ ∈ MC(g) satisfies
α̂ = δ + π ⊚ ᾱ ⊚ Φ

and

α̌ = δ + ᾱ ⊚ Φ ⊚ π .

Proof. Using the Maurer–Cartan equation satisfied by ᾱ + δ and the homotopy relation, we get:
Φ−1 ⋆ (δ + ᾱ)

= (1 − hᾱ) ⋆ (δ + ᾱ) = δ + ᾱ − hᾱ ⋆ δ − hᾱ ⋆ ᾱ
= δ + ᾱ − h(ᾱ ⋆ δ + ᾱ ⋆ ᾱ) = δ + ᾱ + h(δ ⋆ ᾱ)
= δ + ᾱ + (hdV ) ⋆ ᾱ = δ + ᾱ + (−dV h + π − idV ) ⋆ ᾱ
= δ ⋆ (1 − hᾱ) + π ᾱ .

Composing on the right by ⊚ Φ, we obtain, by left linearity of the circle product:
α̂ = (δ ⋆ (1 − hᾱ) + π ᾱ) ⊚ Φ = δ + π (ᾱ ⊚ Φ) .

22

VLADIMIR DOTSENKO, SERGEY SHADRIN, AND BRUNO VALLETTE

The other relation is proved as follows. By the definition of α̌, we have to prove
(Ψ ⋆ α) ⊚ Ψ−1 = δ + ᾱ ⊚ Φ ⊚ π ,
which is equivalent to
δ ⊚ Ψ − Ψ ⋆ δ = Ψ ⋆ ᾱ − ᾱ ⊚ Φ ⊚ π ⊚ Ψ .
By analogy with the linear operator R, we consider the following two linear operators acting on a

where we mean that we put id (resp. π, h) on the places indexed by I (resp. P , H). This way we
can consider hp ⊗ hq as a sum over [p] = I ⊔ P ⊔ H and [q] = I ′ ⊔ P ′ ⊔ H ′ (here [q] refers to the
last q places, so [p] ⊔ [q] = [n]). If we assume that |I| = a, |P | = b, |I ′ | = c, |P ′ | = d, then the

coefficient of id⊗I π ⊗P h⊗H ⊗ id⊗I π ⊗P h⊗H is equal to

Let us compute the coefficient of the same expression in (hp ⊗ id⊗q )hn . Consider particular

These partitions give id⊗I π ⊗P h⊗H ⊗ id⊗I π ⊗P h⊗H if and only if we have

Let us assume that |P ′′′ ∩[p]| = b2 , b1 +b2 = b, and |P ′′ | = b1 +i, i+j = b2 . With this assumption,

The idea is now to use this relation to pull down all the π’s and to rewrite these level-tree composites by replacing all the level-wise homotopies hn by simple homotopies h labeling the internal
edges. This process produces the following combinatorial coefficient. To any levelization λ of a
rooted tree t ∈ RT, this coefficient, called the weight ω(λ), is equal to the product over the levels
between two vertices of one over the number of internal edges crossing this level, see Appendix A
for more details.
Therefore, we get

where t(ᾱ, h) stands for the element in the convolution pre-Lie algebra a, which is the image in a
of the element in the free pre-Lie algebra on two generators defined by the underlying tree t with
the root labelled by ᾱ and the other vertices labelled by hᾱ. Using Proposition 11 which asserts

Using the relation (π ⊗k ⊗ id⊗l ) hk+l = hk ⊗ π ⊗l , we only deal with the induced hn labeling
the edges above vertices different from the root. Since the abovementioned composites produce
operations from V ⊗n , we can always put on the right-hand side the sub-tree above the root which
contains the leaf corresponding to the last occurence of V in V ⊗n , and on the left-hand side, the
rest of the sub-trees. Let us prove, by induction on k = i + j ∈ N, the following statement:
(Pi,j ): for any underlying rooted trees t with k + 1 = i + j + 1 vertices, i on the left-hand side above
the root and j on the right-hand side above the root, the element Rk (x ⊚ π) ∈ a producing
composites equal to the sum over the levelizations of t, with i vertices on the left-hand side
above the root and j vertices on the right-hand side above the root, is equal to the element
of a producing composites equal to the sum of levelizations of the sub-forest with i vertices,
denoted Λi on the left-hand side above the root and composites corresponding to Ψk on the
right-hand side of the root.
For any k ≥ 0, the properties Pk,0 and P 0,k are obvious. So, for instance, P i,j holds for k = 0 and
k = 1. Suppose that P i,j holds for i + j 6 k and let us prove it for i + j = k + 1. Since P k+1,0 and
P 0,k+1 are proved, we can suppose i, j > 1. The element Rk (x ⊚ π), when applied to an element
of P ¡ produces a linear combination of composites of the above type where the highest appearance
of ᾱ is either on the right-hand side or on the left-hand side. Using the assumption hypotheses
P i,j−1 and P i−1,j respectively, the element Rk (x ⊚ π) produces composites of the form

In plain words, this proposition shows that the gauge twisted Maurer–Cartan element α̂ represents a new
P∞ -algebra structure on V whose operations have image in the sub-space i(H). Respectively, the gauge
twisted Maurer–Cartan element α̌ represents a new P∞ -algebra structure on V whose operations apply
trivially outside to the sub-space i(H). The next proposition makes this phenomenon even more precise.
Proposition 9. The following assertions are equivalent:
ᾱ = π ᾱ

⇐⇒

Φ=1

⇐⇒

α̂ = α .

⇐⇒

α̌ = α .

This implies
ˆ = α̂ .
α̂
Dually, the following assertions are equivalent:
ᾱ = ᾱπ

⇐⇒

Ψ=1

This implies
ˇ = α̌ .
α̌
We also have
ˇ = α̌
ˆ .
α̂
Proof. If ᾱ = π ᾱ, then Φ−1 = 1 − hᾱ = 1 − hπ ᾱ = 1, by the side conditions. So Φ = 1. If Φ = 1, then
α̂ = (Φ−1 ⋆ α) ⊚ Φ = α. Finally, if α̂ = α, then π ᾱ = π(π ⊚ ᾱ ⊚ Φ) = π ⊚ ᾱ ⊚ Φ = ᾱ by Proposition 8.
¯ = α̂,
¯ so α̂
ˆ = α̂.
Using Proposition 8 again, we have π α̂

PRE-LIE DEFORMATION THEORY

The dual assertions are proved in the same way. If ᾱ = ᾱπ, then R(1) = 0, by the side conditions. So
Ψ = 1. If Ψ = 1, then α̌ = (Ψ⋆α)⊚Ψ−1 = α. Finally, if α̌ = α, then ᾱπ = (ᾱ⊚Φ⊚π)π = ᾱ⊚Φ⊚π = ᾱ
¯ = α̌,
¯ so α̌
ˇ = α̌.
by Proposition 8. Using Proposition 8 again, we have α̌π
Notice that the definitions of L, R, Φ, and Ψ actually depend on the Maurer–Cartan element α. To be
precise, let us denote them using the index α, like Φα for instance. By Proposition 8, we have
ˇ = δ + α̂

This proposition shows that the choice of the gauge elements Φ and Ψ are quite natural since the P∞ algebra operations α on V already have image in the sub-space i(H) if and only if Φ is trivial. In this case,
there is no need to perturb the original structure α. Dually, the P∞ -algebra operations α on V are already
restricted to the sub-space i(H) if and only if Ψ is trivial. So, there is again no need to perturb the original
ˆ = α̂, α̌
ˇ = α̌.
ˇ = α̌, and α̂

structure α. These two restrictions by perturbation procedures are stable since α̂
The fact that the output (resp. the inputs) of α̂ (resp. α̌) are restricted to i(H) automatically ensures that
i (resp. p) becomes an ∞-quasi-isomorphism between the transferred structure p α̂ i and α̂ (resp. between
α̌ and the transferred structure p α̌ i).
Proposition 10.
⋄ The two elements
β := p α̂ i = p α̌ i
define the same Maurer-Cartan element in the convolution algebra aP,H of the space H.
⋄ The following diagram of P∞ -algebras with ∞-morphisms is commutative:

Proof.
⋄ Proposition 8 and the side conditions ensure that
p α̂ i = p(δ + π (ᾱ ⊚ Φ))i = δ + p(ᾱ ⊚ Φ)i = p(δ + (ᾱ ⊚ Φ) ⊚ π)i = p α̌ i .
⋄ By Theorem 3, the elements Φ and Ψ are ∞-isotopies. The map i defines an ∞-quasi-isomorphism
between p α̂ i and α̂ since
i ⋆ (p α̂ i) = α̂ ⊚ i
by the side conditions and Proposition 8. In the same way, the map p defines an ∞-quasiisomorphism between α̌ and p α̌ i since
(p α̌ i) ⊚ p = p ⋆ α̌
by the side conditions and Proposition 8.

⋄ These formulas for β, i∞ , and p∞ are the same as the ones given explicitly in [LV12, Chapter 10].
They also coincide with what can be extracted from the recursive formulas of [Ber14].
⋄ The next step would be to define a degree 1 element h∞ ∈ a, which extends the homotopy h.
Following the same ideas, one can consider h∞ := h Ψ, which is easily seen to satisfy the side
conditions h∞ ⊚ h∞ = 0, p∞ ⊚ h∞ = 0, and h∞ ⊚ i∞ = 0. But the homotopy relation between
h∞ , i∞ ⊚ p∞ , and idV is more subtle and surely deserves more study.
This approach conceptually explains the discrepancy between these four formulae: the first two ones
are of the same shape (trees) since they rely on the Φ-kernel and the other two ones are of the same
shape (leveled trees) since they relie on the the Ψ-kernel. Such a phenomenon was first noticed by Markl
[Mar06] on the level of A∞ -algebras. This discrepancy is present in the formulas of [LV12, Chapter 10]
and [Ber14]. See also [LM05, Section 4], where the role of the symmetric braces in the homotopy transfer
theorem is guessed.

The purpose of this appendix is to prove a new combinatorial formula for rooted trees. This property
plays a crucial role in the proof of the main theorem of this paper, see Section 8.
Definition 6 (Weight of a levelization). To any levelization λ of a rooted tree t ∈ RT, we associated its
weight ω(λ) defined by the product over the levels between two vertices of one over the number of internal
edges crossing this level.

Proof. Let us more generally prove this fact for a forest of trees. The notion of a levelization of a forest is
the same as the one for trees; the weight of a forest is defined similarly except that we multiply by the extra
term equal to one over the number of trees of the forest:

If a forest is reduced to a single tree, one recovers the above definition.
Let us prove this result by induction on the number of vertices of the forest. When the forest f has only
one vertex, it is made up of one tree made up of the sole root vertex. In this case, the left-hand side and
the right-hand side of the formula are both equal to 1. Suppose now the result true for forests with n − 1
vertices. Let us prove it for any forest f with n vertices.
Let f be a forest made up of ij trees of type tj , for j = 1, . . . , l and let k = i1 + · · · + il . Given a
levelization λ of the forest f , the lowest vertex belongs to a tree of type tj . If we cut such a levelization
just above this vertex, we get a levelization λj of an induced forest denoted fj . In this case, one has to cut
the tree tj just above its root, this gives rise to a forest made up of cj,m trees of type tm , for m 6= j, and
possibly trees of new types. We denote by nj the forest made up of these latter trees. We consider
Y im + cj,m 
ξj :=
.
cj,m
m6=j

Under these notations, the number of automorphisms of the tree tj is equal to
Y
|Aut tj | = |Aut nj |
(|Aut tm |cj,m cj,m !)
m6=j

and the number of automorphisms of the forest f is equal to
|Aut f | =

l
Y

j=1


|Aut tj |ij ij ! .

Therefore, the number of automorphisms of the forest fj is equal to

|Aut fj | = |Aut tj |ij −1 (ij − 1)!|Aut nj |

The levelization λ of the forest f gives rise to the levelization λj of the induced forest fj . In the other way
round, there are exactly ξj ways to produce the levelization λ of f from the levelization λj of fj : one has
first to choose cj,m trees of type tm from the im + cj,m such trees inside fj and then to attach them, for
any m 6= j, and all the trees of the forest nj onto a new root vertex, which is put on the new ground level
