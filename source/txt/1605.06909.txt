Abstract. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, and π : Γ → GL(H) be a representation
of Γ by invertible operators on a separable Hilbert space H. We show that the semidirect
product group G = H ⋊π Γ is SIN (G admits a two-sided invariant metric compatible with
its topology) and unitarily representable (G embeds into the unitary group U(ℓ2 (N))), if and
only if π is uniformly bounded, and that π is unitarizable if and only if G is of finite type:
that is, G embeds into the unitary group of a II1 -factor. Consequently, we show that a
unitarily representable Polish SIN group need not be of finite type, answering a question of
Sorin Popa. The key point in our argument is an equivariant version of the Maurey–Nikishin
factorization theorem for continuous maps from a Hilbert space to the space L0 (X, m) of all
measurable maps on a probability space.

1. Introduction
In this paper, we continue our study [AM12-2] of Popa’s class Ufin of ﬁnite type Polish
groups. Here, a Polish group G is said to be of finite type if it is isomorphic as a topological
group to a closed subgroup of the unitary group U (M ) of some ﬁnite von Neumann algebra
M with separable predual, where U (M ) is endowed with the strong operator topology. The
class Ufin was introduced in [Po07], in which Popa proved the celebrated Cocycle Superrigidity
Theorem. This theorem asserts that if Γ is a w-rigid group and α : Γ y (X, µ) is a probability
measure preserving (p.m.p) action of Γ on a standard probability space (X, µ) with certain
properties, then any 1-cocycle w : X × Γ → G for α with values in a Polish group G ∈ Ufin
is cohomologous to a group homomorphism Γ → G, see [Po07] for details. Despite the
importance of Popa’s Theorem and its wide range of applications, little has been known
about the properties of the class Ufin . There are two necessary conditions for a Polish group
to be in Ufin . Namely, if G ֒→ U (M ) for some ﬁnite von Neumann algebra (M, τ ) with
separable predual, then clearly G ֒→ U (ℓ2 (N)). G is said to be unitarily representable if the
abovementioned condition is satisﬁed. Moreover, the restriction of the 2-norm metric d on
U (M ) given by
1

d(u, v) := ku − vk2 , kxk2 := τ (x∗ x) 2 (u, v ∈ U (M ))
deﬁnes a two-sided invariant metric on G that is compatible with the topology. It is wellknown that a metrizable topological group admits a two-sided invariant metric compatible
with the topology if and only if the group is SIN (see Deﬁnition 2.3). In [Po07, §6.5], Popa
questioned whether the abovementioned two conditions are suﬃcient:
Question (Popa). Let G be a unitarily representable SIN Polish group. Is G necessarily of
ﬁnite type?

Motivated by the study [AM12-1] of the Lie structure of the class Ufin , two of us began to
research Popa’s Ufin -problem [AM12-2], and obtained some positive answers when additional
conditions were placed on G. Among other things, we showed that the question has a positive
answer if G is amenable. For example, the Hilbert-Schmidt group U (H)2 is a ﬁnite type Polish
group. However, the general case was left unaddressed.
Note that there is a similarity between the Ufin -problem and the problem of ﬁnding a
trace on a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra, which was established by Murray and von Neumann
in their classical papers on the subject. Yeadon [Ye71] found a relatively simpler proof of
Murray’s and von Neumann’s theorem as follows: Let M be a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra.
For simplicity, we assume that M has separable predual, and let ϕ be a faithful normal state
on M . We let the unitary group U (M ) act on the predual M∗ by conjugation:
(1)

αu (ψ) := uψu∗ = ψ(u∗ · u),

ψ ∈ M∗ , u ∈ U (M ).

Note that α is a linear isometric action on the Banach space M∗ . Using the ﬁniteness assumption, Yeadon showed that the orbit Oϕ := {αu (ϕ); u ∈ U (M )} is relatively weakly compact.
Thus, its weak convex closure co(Oϕ ) ⊂ M∗ is a weakly compact convex subset of M∗ on
which U (M ) acts by aﬃne isometries. By the Ryll-Nardzewski Theorem, this implies that
there exists an α-ﬁxed point, which is easily seen to be a normal faithful tracial state τ .
In the ﬁrst named author’s PhD thesis, we adopted the Yeadon argument up to a certain
point. This part of the thesis formed an unpublished joint work with the second named author.
The argument was as follows. Let G be a unitarily representable Polish SIN group. It is wellknown (see e.g. [Gao05]) that G is unitarily representable if and only if G admits a continuous
positive deﬁnite function ϕ that generates the topology. An analogous characterization for
Ufin is obtained in [AM12-2]. Let P(G) be the set of all normalized continuous positive
deﬁnite functions on G. Then G is of ﬁnite type if and only if there exists a character (i.e.,
a function ϕ ∈ P(G) which is conjugation-invariant) that generates a neighborhood basis of
the identity on G (see Theorem 2.4 for details). It is clear that P(G) is a convex subset of the
Banach space Cb (G) of all continuous bounded functions on G equipped with the sup norm.
Deﬁne an aﬃne isometric action β : G y Cb (G) by:
βg (ψ) := ψ(g −1 · g),

ψ ∈ Cb (G), g ∈ G.

If the orbit Oϕ = {βg (ϕ); g ∈ G} is relatively weakly compact, then by the Ryll-Nardzewski
Theorem, there exists a ﬁxed point ψ in the closed convex hull co(Oϕ ). Once we get a
ﬁxed point ψ ∈ co(Oϕ ), one can show, using Theorem 2.4 below, that G is of ﬁnite type.
Unfortunately, we do not know if Oϕ is relatively weakly compact. What we could show is
the following result.
Theorem 1.1 (Ando–Matsuzawa, unpublished). Let G be a unitarily representable Polish
SIN group, and assume that ϕ ∈ P(G) generates the topology of G. Then the following
statements hold:
(i) Oϕ is relatively compact in the compact open topology.
(ii) If Oϕ satisfies one of the following conditions, then G is of finite type.
(iia) The closure of Oϕ with respect to the topology of pointwise convergence is normseparable.
(iib) Oϕ is relatively weakly compact.
Two of the current authors considered the abovementioned result as an indication that the
Ufin -problem may have a positive answer in general. However, there was no obvious means of

verifying the relation between the compact open topology and the weak topology in Cb (G)
or verifying either (iia) or (iib).
In this paper, we show that indeed the orbit Oϕ ⊂ Cb (G) is not always relatively weakly
compact. That is, we construct a family of unitarily representable SIN Polish groups that do
not fall into the class Ufin . This answers Popa’s abovementioned question. The construction
is based on the existence of uniformly bounded non-unitarizable representations of countable
discrete groups.
Theorem 1.2 (Main Theorem). Let Γ be a countable discrete group, and let π : Γ → GL(H)
be a group homomorphism from Γ to the group of bounded invertible operators on H. Let
G = H ⋊π Γ be the semidirect product.
(a) G is a unitarily representable Polish group. Moreover, the following two conditions
are equivalent.
(i) G is a SIN group.
(ii) π is uniformly bounded. That is, kπk := sups∈Γ kπ(s)k < ∞ holds.
(b) Assume that π is uniformly bounded. Then the following three conditions are equivalent.
(i) G is of finite type.
(ii) There exists a character f : H → C that generates a neighborhood basis of 0 ∈ H,
such that f (π(s)ξ) = f (ξ) for all ξ ∈ H and s ∈ Γ.
(iii) π is unitarizable. That is, there exists V ∈ GL(H) such that V −1 π(s)V is unitary
for all s ∈ Γ.
A group Γ is said to be unitarizable if all of its uniformly bounded representations are
unitarizable. The problem of unitarizability has a long history. Sz.-Nagy [SzN47] showed that
the group Z of integers is unitarizable. Later, this was independently generalized to amenable
groups by Dixmier [Di50], Nakamura–Takeda [NT51] and Day [Da50]. This led Dixmier to
pose the question whether every unitarizable group is amenable, a question that remains open
today. The ﬁrst examples of non-unitarizable groups were found by Ehrenpreis and Mautner
[EM55], who showed that SL2 (R) is not unitarizable. For discrete groups, explicit families
of uniformly bounded non-unitarizable representations of free groups were later constructed
by Mantero–Zappa [MZ83-1, MZ83-2], Pitlyk–Szwarc [PS86], and Bozejko [Bo87]. We refer
the reader to [Pi01, Pi05, Oz06] for details. Because unitarizability passes to subgroups, it
follows that all discrete groups containing free subgroups are non-unitarizable. We also note
that examples of non-unitarizable groups not containing non-abelian free subgroups were
presented by Epstein–Monod [EM09], Osin [Os09] and Monod–Ozawa [MO10]. Therefore,
there exist many uniformly bounded representations that are not unitarizable. The present
article provides a new and unexpected connection between the study of unitarizability of
groups and the understanding of the class Ufin .
Finally, we explain the idea of the proof. Theorem 1.2 (a) is shown in Theorem 2.7. For (b),
(i)⇔(ii) is Theorem 2.8 and (iii)⇒(i) is Corollary 2.9. Finally, (i)⇒(iii) is shown in Theorem
3.1. The proofs of (a) and (b) (i)⇔(ii) and (iii)⇒(i) rely on our characterization [AM12-2]
of the class Ufin via positive deﬁnite functions. The most diﬃcult step is to prove that (b)
(i)⇒(iii). Note that our argument is diﬀerent from that of Vasilescu-Zsido [VZ74], who used
the Ryll-Nardzewski Theorem, and showed that if a uniformly bounded representation π
generates a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra, then π is unitarizable. From the assumption that
G = H ⋊π Γ is of ﬁnite type, there appears to be no obvious means to deduce the conditoin
that W ∗ (π(Γ)) is a ﬁnite von Neumann algebra (observe that when π is an irreducible unitary

representation, then H ⋊π Γ is of ﬁnite type, but π(Γ)′′ = B(H) is not a ﬁnite von Neumann
algebra if dim(H) = ∞). Assume that G = H ⋊π Γ is of ﬁnite type. Then there exists
f ∈ P(H) that generates the neighborhood basis of 0 and satisﬁes f (π(s)ξ) = f (ξ) (s ∈
Γ, ξ ∈ H). If dim(H) < ∞, then by Bochner’s Theorem, there exists a probability measure µ
on H (regarded as a real Hilbert space) such that
Z
eix·ξ dµ(x),
ξ ∈ H.
f (ξ) =
H

If dim(H) = ∞, Bochner’s Theorem does not hold (e.g. the positive deﬁnite function ξ 7→
2
e−kξk is not the Fourier transform of a probability measure on H). However, there exists a
cylinder set probability measure µ deﬁned on the algebraic dual Ha′ of H, such that
Z
eihχ,ξi dµ(χ),
ξ ∈ H.
(2)
f (ξ) =
Ha′

It can, in fact, be shown that µ is supported on a Hilbert-Schmidt extension of H. See [Ya85]
for details. Intuitively, one may hope that π is unitarizable by the following argument: deﬁne
Z
hχ, ξihχ, ηi dµ(χ),
ξ, η ∈ H,
hξ, ηi′π :=
Ha′

which is (if well-deﬁned) an R-bilinear form. Because f is π-invariant, its dual action π̃ of Γ on
Ha′ preserves µ, which then implies that h·, ·i′π is Γ-invariant: hπ(s)ξ, π(s)ηi′π = hξ, ηi′π (ξ, η ∈
H, s ∈ Γ). By complexiﬁcation, we obtain a π(Γ)-invariant inner product h·, ·iπ . We may
then hope that the inner product provides the same topology as the original inner product,
which would imply that π is unitarizable (see Lemma 3.2). There are two diﬃculties in this
approach: (a) we must guarantee that second moments exist:
Z
?
hχ, ξi2 dµ(χ) < ∞
Ha′

and (b) we must prove that the new inner product is equivalent to the original one. It does
not seem likely that these conditions hold in general. We remedy this by noncommutative
integration theory: assume that α : G → U (M ) is an embedding into the unitary group of a
II1 -factor M . Then by setting α(s) := α(0, s) and α(ξ) := α(ξ, 1) (ξ ∈ H, s ∈ Γ), we obtain
f be the space of all unbounded closed operators aﬃliated
α(s)α(ξ)α(s)∗ = α(π(s)ξ). Let M

that T (ξ) ∈ L (M, τ ) for every ξ ∈ H (we call it the L2 -condition), then

hξ, ηi′π := hT (ξ), T (η)iL2 (M,τ ) ,

is a well-deﬁned inner-product, which is Γ-invariant by α(s)T (ξ)α(s)∗ = T (π(s)ξ) (ξ ∈ H, s ∈
Γ). We can also show that the induced norm is equivalent to the original norm. By complexiﬁcation, we are done by Lemma 3.2. Again, the real question is whether the L2 -condition
holds in general, a question essentially equivalent to postulating the existence of the second
moments of µ. However, because the von Neumann algebra A = {α(ξ); ξ ∈ H}′′ generated
by the image of α is commutative, we may represent it as A = L∞ (X, m) for some probability
space (X, m) equipped with an m-preserving Γ-action β such that the W∗ -dynamical system
e Ad(α( · ))) is equivariantly ∗-isomorphic to (L0 (X, m), β). Here, L0 (X, m) is the space of

all measurable maps on a probability space (X, m) equipped with the topology of convergence
in measure Because H is a Hilbert space (hence of Rademacher type 2, see [AK06, §6]), it
is known (by the so-called Maurey–Nikishin factorization [Ni70, Ma72]) that any continuous
e factors through a Hilbert space. That is, there exists
linear operator T : H → L0 (X, m) = A
2
a bounded operator T̃ : H → L (X, m) and an m-a.e. positive function ψ ∈ L0 (X, m) such
that the following diagram commutes:

Here, Mψ is the multiplication operator by Rthe function ψ. More precisely, there exists an

Then T̃ ξ := M 21 · T ξ and ψ = ϕ− 2 gives the factorization. This result was ﬁrst essentially

proved by Nikishin [Ni70]. Nikishin’s proof was later simpliﬁed by Maurey [Ma72] using the
theory of Rademacher types. We refer the reader to [Pi86, AK06, GR85] for more details. In
§3, we show an equivariant version of the Maurey–Nikishin factorization, in which we use a
convexity argument to ensure (Theorem 3.5) that the operator T̃ can be made Γ-equivariant
if T is assumed to be Γ-equivariant. We can then deﬁne h·, ·i′π by the formula (3), with T
replaced by T̃ . Because T is a real linear homeomorphism onto its range, we can show that
T̃ is also a real linear homeomorphism onto its range too. The last step is to show that on
the image T̃ (H) of H under T̃ , the topology of the convergence in measure agrees with the
L2 -topology (Lemma 3.13). This is somewhat surprising: note that these two topologies do
not agree on the whole of L2 (X, m). The proof is done by using the fact [Be10, AM12-1]
f, the strong resolvent topology and the τ -measure topology of Nelson [Ne74] agree.
that on M
Once this is established, it is straightforward to show that h·, ·i′π generates the same topology
as that of the original inner product, and therefore that π is unitarizable.
Finally, we report that as a byproduct of the existence of an equivariant Maurey–Nikishin
factorization, we ﬁnd a new, useful description of positive deﬁnite functions on a Hilbert space
(compare (2) with (4)). See also the comments following Corollary 3.16.
Theorem 1.3 (Corollary 3.16). Let H be a separable real Hilbert space, and let f ∈ P(H).
Then there exist
(i) a compact metrizable space X and a Borel probability measure m on X,
(ii) a bounded linear operator T : H → L2 (X, m; R), and
(iii) a positive measurable function ϕ ∈ L0 (X, m),
such that

Moreover:

(iv) If f generates a neighborhood basis of 0, then T can be chosen to be a real-linear

(v) We may arrange T and ϕ such that if G is a uniformly bounded subgroup of the group
{u ∈ GL(H); f (uξ) = f (ξ) (ξ ∈ H)} of invertible operators on H fixing f pointwise,

6

then there exists a continuous homomorphism β from G to the group Aut(X, m) of all
m-preserving automorphisms of X with the weak topology, such that
[T (uξ)](x) = β(u)[T (ξ)](x),

ϕ(β(u)x) = ϕ(x),

u ∈ G, ξ ∈ H, m-a.e. x ∈ X.

2. The class Ufin and uniformly bounded representations
In this section we recall Popa’s class Ufin of ﬁnite type Polish groups and consider when a
speciﬁc semidirect group belongs to this class. The results of this section are extracted from
the ﬁrst named author’s PhD thesis, jointly proved with the second named author.
Definition 2.1. Let G, G′ be topological groups.
(i) We say that G is embeddable into G′ , if there exists a topological group isomorphism
π from G onto a closed subgroup of G′ . Such π is called an embedding.
(ii) We denote by P(G) the set of all normalized continuous positive deﬁnite functions
on G, and by P(G)inv the set of all f ∈ P(G) which is conjugation-invariant, i.e.,
f (g−1 xg) = f (x) holds for all x, g ∈ G. An element of P(G)inv is called a character
on G.
Definition 2.2 ([Po07]). A Polish group G is of finite type if G is embeddable into the unitary
group U (M ) of some ﬁnite von Neumann algebra M equipped with strong operator topology.
The class of ﬁnite type Polish groups is denoted by Ufin .
If G is a ﬁnite type Polish group, then by [Po07, Lemma 2.6], the above M may chosen to
be a type II1 -factor with separable predual.
Definition 2.3. Let G be a topological group.
(i) G is called unitarily representable if G is embeddable into U (ℓ2 (N)) equipped with
strong operator topology.
(ii) G is called SIN (small invariant neighborhood) if for any neighborhood V of G at the
identity e, there exists a neighborhood U ⊂ V of e which is conjugation invariant, i.e.,
g−1 U g = U, ∀g ∈ G. Such U is called an invariant neighborhood of G.
If G is metrizable, then G is SIN if and only if G admits a bi-invariant metric d which is
compatible with its topology.
For more details about unitary representability, see e.g., [Gal09, Gao05, Me02]. We will
use the following characterization of the ﬁnite type Polish groups (cf. [Gao05]).
Theorem 2.4 ([AM12-2]). For a Polish group G, the following conditions are equivalent.
(i) G is of finite type.
(ii) There exists a family F ⊂ P(G)inv which generates a neighborhood basis of the identity eG of G. That is, for each neighborhood V at the identity, there are functions
f1 , . . . , fn ∈ F and open sets O1 , . . . , On in C such that
n
\
fi−1 (Oi ) ⊂ V.
eG ∈
i=1

(iii) There exists f ∈ P(G)inv that generates a neighborhood basis of the identity of G.
(iv) There exists a family F ⊂ P(G)inv which separates the identity of G and closed subsets
A with A 6∋ eG . That is, for each closed subset A with A 6∋ eG , there exists f ∈ F
such that
sup |f (x)| < |f (eG )|.
x∈A

POLISH GROUPS OF FINITE TYPE

(v) There exists f ∈ P(G)inv which separates the identity of G and closed subsets A with
A 6∋ eG .
We start from the following characterization for the semidirect product of a SIN group
by a SIN group to be SIN. Denote by N (G) the set of all neighborhoods of identity of a
topological group G.
Theorem 2.5. Let N, K be SIN-groups. Let α : K → Aut(N ) be a continuous action of K
on N . Then the following two conditions are necessary and sufficient for N ⋊α K to be a
SIN-group.
(SIN. 1) For any U ∈ N (N ), there exist V ∈ N (N ) with V ⊂ U such that
αk (V ) = V,

k ∈ K.

(SIN. 2) The action α is bounded. That is, for any V ∈ N (N ), there exists W ∈
N (K) such that
n−1 αk (n) ∈ V,
n ∈ N, k ∈ W.
Proof. We denote by eN (resp. eK ) the unit of N (resp. K).
We ﬁrst prove suﬃciency of the two conditions. Fix an arbitrary U ∈ N (N ⋊α K). By
deﬁnition of the product topology, there exist V ′′ ∈ N (N ) and W ′ ∈ N (K) such that
(eN , eK ) ∈ V ′′ × W ′ ⊂ U holds. Since N is SIN, there exists an invariant neighborhood
V ′ ∈ N (N ) which satisﬁes V ′ · V ′ ⊂ V ′′ . By (SIN. 1), we may take V ∈ N (N ) such that
V ⊂ V ′ and
αk (V ) = V,
k ∈ K.
By (SIN. 2) and the SIN property of K, there exists an invariant neighborhood W ∈ N (K)
satisfying W ⊂ W ′ and
n−1 αk (n) ∈ V, n ∈ N, k ∈ W.
Indeed, by (SIN. 2) there is W0 ∈ N (K) such that n−1 αk (n) ∈ V holds for all n ∈ N and
k ∈ W0 . By the SIN property of K, there is an invariant neighborhood W ∈ N (K) contained
in W0 ∩ W ′ . It is then clear that this W satisﬁes the above requirement.
Let (n1 , k1 ) ∈ V × W and (n2 , k2 ) ∈ N ⋊α K. We see that

Hence, we have g−1 (V × W )g ⊂ U for all g ∈ N ⋊α (K). This shows
[
U ′ :=
g −1 (V × W )g ⊂ U
g∈N ⋊α K

is an invariant neighborhood of eN ⋊α H contained in U . Since U is arbitrary, this shows
N ⋊α K is a SIN-group.
We now prove necessity of the two conditions. Suppose N ⋊α K is a SIN-group. Given
U ∈ N (N ). Then U × K ∈ N (N ⋊α K). Thus by SIN-property of N ⋊α K we ﬁnd an

8

HIROSHI ANDO, YASUMICHI MATSUZAWA, ANDREAS THOM, AND ASGER TÖRNQUIST

invariant neighborhood A ∈ N (N ⋊α K) contained in U × K. Then we may ﬁnd U0 ∈ N (N )
and W ∈ N (K) such that U0 × W ⊂ A. Since A is invariant, we have
g(U0 × {eK })g−1 ⊂ A,

g ∈ N ⋊α K.

Inparticular, for all k ∈ K and n ∈ U0 , we have
(eN , k)(n, eK )(eN , k)−1 = (αk (n), eK ) ∈ A ⊂ U × K.
This shows αk (n) ∈ U for all k ∈ K and n ∈ U0 ⊂ U . Then
[
V :=
αk (U0 ) ⊂ U
k∈K

is a neighborhood of eN satisfying αk (V ) = V for all k ∈ K. Hence we conclude that (SIN.
1) holds.
In order to prove (SIN. 2), suppose V ∈ N (N ) is given. Again by the same argument as
above, we may ﬁnd an invariant neighborhood A ∈ N (N ⋊α K) contained in V × K and
V0 ∈ N (N ) and W ∈ N (K) with V0 × W ⊂ A ⊂ V × K. Since A is invariant, we have in
particular
g({eN } × W )g−1 ⊂ A ⊂ V × K,
g ∈ N ⋊α K.
Hence for n ∈ N and k ∈ W , we have
(n, eK )(eN , k)(n, eK )−1 = (nαk (n−1 ), k) ∈ A ⊂ V × K.
This shows nαk (n−1 ) ∈ V for all k ∈ W . This proves (SIN. 2).

Remark 2.6. A semidirect product G ⋊α Γ of a SIN group G by a discrete group Γ always
satisﬁes (SIN. 2) (take W = {eK }).
As an immediate corollary to Theorem 2.5, we obtain:
Theorem 2.7. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → GL(H) be an invertible representation of Γ. Then the semidirect product group
G := H ⋊π Γ is unitarily representable. Moreover, the following conditions are equivalent.
(1) G is SIN.
(2) π is uniformly bounded, i.e., kπk := sups∈Γ kπ(s)k < ∞.
2

Proof. The unitarily representable group H has a positive deﬁnite function f (ξ) := e−kξk , ξ ∈
H and identifying H with H × {e} ⊂ H ⋊π Γ, we may extend f to be a continuous positive
deﬁnite function on H ⋊π Γ by taking value 0 outside H × {e}. It is immediate to see that
this extended function still generates the neighborhood basis of the identity. Then by [Gao05,
Theorem 2.1], G is unitarily representable.
(1)⇒(2) Assume that G is a unitarily representable and SIN group. Let Bδ (0) be the open
δ-neighborhood of H at 0 (δ > 0). Then by (SIN. 1), there exists a neighborhood V ⊂ Bδ (0)
of H at 0 such that π(s)V = V, (s ∈ Γ). Since V is a neighborhood, there exists ε > 0
such that Bε (0) ⊂ V holds. Thus π(s)Bε (0) ⊂ Bδ (0) holds for all s ∈ Γ. This shows that
kπ(s)k ≤ δε for every s ∈ Γ. Therefore π is uniformly bounded.
(2)⇒(1) Assume that π is uniformly bounded. To prove that G is SIN, by Theorem 2.5 we have
only to check (SIN.1) (see Remark 2.6). Consider Bε (0) (ε > 0), and C := 1+sups∈Γ kπ(s)k <

kπ(s)ξk ≤ Ckξk < ε.

Theorem 2.8. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation of Γ. Then H ⋊π Γ is of finite type if
and only if there exists f ∈ P(H) such that
(F.1) f (π(s)ξ) = f (ξ),
∀s ∈ Γ, ξ ∈ H,
(F.2) f generates a neighborhood basis of 0 ∈ H.
Proof. We ﬁrst prove “if” part. For this, we assume that there exists a positive, continuous
positive deﬁnite function f on H which satisﬁes (F.1) and (F.2). Then one can extend f on
H ⋊π Γ by
(
f (ξ) (s = 1),
f˜(ξ, s) :=
0
(s 6= 1).
It is easy to see that f˜ is continuous, positive deﬁnite and generates a neighborhood basis of
the identity. Take arbitrary ξ, η ∈ H, s, t ∈ Γ. Since

(η, t)(ξ, s)(η, t)−1 = η + π(t)ξ − π(tst−1 )η, tst−1 ,

we have

= f˜(ξ, s).
Hence H ⋊π Γ is of ﬁnite type.
Conversely, let us assume that H ⋊π Γ is of ﬁnite type. Then there exists a positive,
continuous positive deﬁnite class function f˜ on H ⋊π Γ that generates a neighborhood basis
of the identity. We deﬁne a positive deﬁnite function f on H by
f (ξ) := f˜(ξ, 1),

ξ ∈ H.

It is easy to check that f is positive, continuous and satisﬁes (F.2). Since
(η, t)(ξ, 1)(η, t)−1 = (π(t)ξ, 1)
and f˜ is a class function, we obtain
f (ξ) = f˜(ξ, 1) = f˜ (η, t)(ξ, 1)(η, t)−1
= f˜ (π(t)ξ, 1) = f (π(t)ξ)
so that f satisﬁes (F.1).

Corollary 2.9. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and

Since amenable groups are unitarizable ([Da50, Di50, NT51]), we obtain:
Corollary 2.10. Let Γ be a countable discrete group, H be a separable Hilbert space and
π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation of Γ. Assume that Γ is amenable. Then
H ⋊π Γ is of finite type.
Remark 2.11. We remark that if Γ is amenable, then so is H ⋊π Γ, so that the conclusion of
Corollary 2.10 also follows from the fact [AM12-2, Theorem 2.2] that an amenable unitarily
representable SIN group is of ﬁnite type.
The purpose of the next section is to prove a converse to Corollary 2.9.
3. Equivariant Maurey–Nikishin Factorization
In this section, we prove the last and crucial step, Theorem 1.2 (b) (i)⇒(iii). Let π : Γ → H
be a uniformly bounded representation of a discrete countable group Γ on a separable Hilbert
space H, as before.
Theorem 3.1. If G = H ⋊π Γ is of finite type, then π is unitarizable.
Throughout this section, we assume that G = H ⋊π Γ is of ﬁnite type. Our aim is to ﬁnd
a Γ-invariant inner product and apply the following classical result due to Dixmier:
Lemma 3.2 (Dixmier). Let π : Γ → B(H) be a uniformly bounded representation. Then π is
unitarizable if and only if there exists an inner product h·, ·i′ on H that generates the same
Hilbert space topology and which is π-invariant, i.e., hπ(s)ξ, π(s)ηi′ = hξ, ηi′ (ξ, η ∈ H, s ∈ Γ)
holds.
By assumption, there exists an embedding (as a topological group) α : G → U (M ), where
M is some II1 -factor with separable predual and with the normal faithtul tracial state τ . We
let M act on L2 (M, τ ). As usual, we identify H ⊂ G ⊂ U (M ) and Γ ⊂ U (M ). That is, ξ ∈ H
is identiﬁed with α(ξ) = α(ξ, 0), and s ∈ Γ is identiﬁed with α(s) = α(0, s). Therefore under
this identiﬁcation, the uniformly bounded G-action π on H is implemented by unitaries in
M:
(5)

α(π(s)ξ) = α((0, s)(ξ, 1)(0, s−1 ) = α(s)α(ξ)α(s)∗ .

f be the space of all (possibly unbounded) closed and densely deﬁned operators T
Now, let M
f,
on L2 (M, τ ) which are aﬃliated with M . There is a completely metrizable topology on M
called the τ -measure topology [Ne74]. A neighborhood basis of 0 in the τ -measure topology
is given by the family {N (ε, δ); ε, δ > 0}, where
f; ∃p ∈ Proj(M ), τ (p⊥ ) < δ, kAp⊥ k < ε},
N (ε, δ) := {A ∈ M

where Proj(M ) is the lattice of all projections of M . In [AM12-1], we showed that the
τ -measure topology coincides with the strong resolvent topology (SRT) (the same result is

adjoint, then An → A in the τ -measure topology, if and only if k(An −i) −(A−i)−1 k2 →
n→∞
0, if and only if (by the Kato-Trotter Theorem) keitAn − eitA k2 → 0 for every t ∈ R (in this
case the convergence is compact uniform in t). As was shown by Murray-von Neumann, the
f, although not locally convex, is actually a topological ∗-algebra with respect to the
space M
τ -measure topology. The addition (resp. the multiplication) is deﬁned by (A, B) 7→ A + B
(resp. (A, B) 7→ AB), where the bar denotes the operator closure (it asserts that A + B, AB
are always closable and in fact A + B is self-adjoint whenever A, B are).
Now let ξ ∈ H. Then since α is continuous, R ∋ t 7→ α(tξ) ∈ U (M ) is a strongly continuous
one-parameter unitary group. Thus by Stone’s Theorem, there exists a unique self-adjoint
f such that
operator T (ξ) ∈ M
α(tξ) = eitT (ξ) ,

t ∈ R, ξ ∈ H.

fsa is a real-linear homeomorphism onto its range (with
Proposition 3.3. The map T : H → M
respect to the τ -measure topology or the SRT). Moreover, the following covariance property
holds.
T (π(s)ξ) = α(s)T (ξ)α(s)∗ ,

(6)

s ∈ Γ, ξ ∈ H.

Proof. Let s ∈ Γ and ξn , ξ, η ∈ H (n ∈ N). Since α is a topological isomorphism onto its
range,
n→∞

n→∞

ξn − ξ → 0 ⇔ α(tξn ) − α(tξ) = eitT (ξn ) − eitT (ξ) → 0 for all t ∈ R (SOT)
n→∞

⇔ T (ξn ) → T (ξ) (SRT).
Thus T is a homeomorphism from H onto its range. Also, for all s, t ∈ R, we have
α(tsξ) = eitsT (ξ) = α(t(sξ)) = eitT (sξ) .
Since t is arbitrary, the uniqueness part of Stone’s Theorem asserts that T (sξ) = sT (ξ).
Now since H is a commutative (additive) group, all {T (ξ); ξ ∈ H} are strongly commuting
self-adjoint operators. Thus by Kato-Trotter Theorem,
1

1

eitT (ξ)+T (η) = SOT − lim (eit n T (ξ) eit n T (η) )n = eitT (ξ) eitT (η)
n→∞

= α(tξ)α(tη) = α(t(ξ + η))
= eitT (ξ+η) .
Therefore we obtain T (ξ + η) = T (ξ) + T (η). Therefore T is a real-linear homeomorphism
onto its range. Finally, by the unitary covariance of the Borel functional calculus,
eitT (π(s)ξ) = α(tπ(s)ξ) = α(s)α(tξ)α(s)∗
= α(s)eitT (ξ) α(s)∗
∗

= eitα(s)T (ξ)α(s) .
Therefore T (π(s)ξ) = α(s)T (ξ)α(s)∗ .

Let A := {α(ξ); ξ ∈ H}′′ be the commutative von Neumann subalgebra of M generated
by the image of α. By RProposition 3.19, there exists a probability space (X, m) such that
(A, τ |A ) ∼
= (L∞ (X, m), X · dm). Then by (6), the formula

(7)

βs := Ad(α(s))|A ,

s ∈ Γ.

deﬁnes a trace-preserving action of Γ on A = L∞ (X, m). This action also deﬁnes a probability
measure preserving action on X. We denote this action by Γ × X ∋ (s, x) 7→ s · x ∈ X.
Therefore, βs (ϕ) = ϕ ◦ s−1 , ϕ ∈ L∞ (X, m). Below we keep this setting.
Definition 3.4. We denote by L0 (X, m) the space of all m-measurable C-valued functions
on X, and L0 (X, m)+ its positive cone. We also deﬁne the Γ-action on L0 (X, m) by βs =
Ad(α(s))|L0 (X,m) (s ∈ Γ) (we use the same symbol βs as the Γ-action on L∞ (X, m), but there
would be no danger of confusion).
Equipped with the convergence in measure, L0 (X, m) is a (non-locally convex) completely
metrizable topological vector space. Note that under the identiﬁcation A = L∞ (X, m), we
fsa (cf. [AM12-1]). What we will do is to construct a Γ-equivariant
obtain Ae = L0 (X, m) ⊂ M
fsa . We almost exactly
Maurey–Nikishin factorization of the map T : H → L0 (X, m) ⊂ M
follow Maurey’s argument as in [GR85, Chapter VI.3], but we also need to take care of the
Γ-action, which makes it necessary to reﬁne some of the arguments.
Theorem 3.5 (Equivariant Maurey-Nikishin Factorization). The map T : H → L0 (X, m)
factors Γ-equivariantly through a Hilbert space. More precisely, there exists a Γ-invariant
function ϕ ∈ L0 (X, m) which is m-a.e. positive and

t ∈ [0, 1].

Then clearly (cϕ) (t) = cϕ (t) (c > 0, t ≥ 0) holds.
The next lemmata are elementary.
Lemma 3.7. Let S : H → L0 (X, m) be a linear operator. Then the following conditions are
equivalent.
(i) S is continuous.
(ii) There exists a non-increasing map C : (0, ∞) → [0, 1] such that limλ→∞ C(λ) = 0 and
(9)

m({x ∈ X; |Sξ(x)| ≥ λkξk}) ≤ C(λ)

(λ > 0, ξ ∈ H).

(iii) For every t > 0, there exists K(t) > 0 such that
(10)

(Sξ)⋆ (t) ≤ K(t)kξk

(ξ ∈ H).

Proof. (i)⇒(ii) For each ε, δ > 0, the set U (ε, δ) := {f ∈ L0 (X, m); m({x ∈ X; |f (x)| ≥ ε}) ≤
δ} is an neighborhood of 0 in the measure topology. For each λ > 0, deﬁne
C(λ) := inf{δ > 0; Sξ ∈ U (λ, δ) for all ξ ∈ H with kξk ≤ 1}.
Note that C(λ) ≤ 1. It is then clear that C(·) is nonincreasing and (9) holds. We claim
that limλ→∞ C(λ) = 0. Assume by contradiction that there exists δ > 0 such that C(λ) ≥ δ
holds for all λ > 0. Then for each n ∈ N, there exists ξn ∈ H with kξn k ≤ 1, such that
Sξn ∈
/ U (n, δ − n1 ), i.e., m({x ∈ X; |Sξn (x)| ≥ n}) > δ − n1 holds. Then ηn := n1 ξn (n ∈ N)
n→∞
satisﬁes kηn k → 0, but m({x ∈ X; |Sηn (x)| ≥ 1) > δ − n1 , so Sηn 6→ 0 in measure, a
contradiction.
(ii)⇒(iii) Let t > 0. Since limλ→∞ C(λ) = 0, there exists K(t) > 0 such that C(λ) < t (λ ≥
K(t)) holds. Then for ξ ∈ H with kξk ≤ 1, m({x ∈ X; |Sξ(x)| > λ}) ≤ C(λ), so that
(Sξ)⋆ (t) ≤ K(t). For general ξ 6= 0, we have (Skξk−1 ξ)⋆ (t) ≤ kξk−1 K(t), whence (10) holds.
(iii)⇒(i) Since H and L0 (X, m) are metrizable, it suﬃces to show the sequential continuity
n→∞
of S. Let ξn ∈ H be such that kξn k → 0. Let ε, δ > 0. By assumption, we have
n→∞
(Sξn )⋆ (δ) ≤ K(δ)kξn k → 0. Therefore there exists N ∈ N such that (Sξn )⋆ (δ) < ε holds for
all n ≥ N . In particular, we have m({x ∈ X; |Sξn (x)| ≥ ε}) ≤ δ. Since ε, δ > 0 are arbitrary,
Sξn converges to 0 in measure.

Lemma 3.8. Let ϕ ∈ L0 (X, m). Then for every δ > 0, m({x ∈ X; |ϕ(x)| > ϕ⋆ (δ)}) ≤ δ
holds.
Proof. Let λ := ϕ⋆ (δ). Then for each n ∈ N, there exists λn ∈ (λ, λ + n1 ) such that µ({x ∈
X; |ϕ(x)| > λn }) ≤ δ. Thus
m({x ∈ X; |ϕ(x)| > λ}) ≤ lim m({x ∈ X; |ϕ(x)| > λ + n1 })
n→∞

≤ lim sup m({x ∈ X; |ϕ(x)| > λn })
n→∞

The crucial step in our proof is to establish the following proposition. This is the step
which allows to make the construction of the factorization canonical and hence equivariant
with respect to a group of symmetries.
Proposition 3.9. Let A be a convex subset of L0 (X, m)+ which is globally Γ-invariant. Then
for every ε > 0, there is a Γ-invariant measurable subset S(ε) ⊂ X with m(X \ S(ε)) ≤ ε and

This is a Γ-invariant version of [GR85, Proposition VI.3.1]. In order to show Proposition
3.9, we use the following variant of the Minimax Lemma:
Lemma 3.10 (Minimax Lemma). Let X, Y be topological vector spaces, and let A (resp. B)
be a convex subset of X (resp. Y ). Assume that B is compact. If the function Φ : A × B →

(ii) Φ(a, ·) is a convex function on B for each a ∈ A,

then the following identity holds:

Φ(ψ, ϕ) = sup Φt (ψ, ϕ).

This shows that Φ(ψ, ·) is weakly lower-semicontinuous on B. Let M := supψ∈A ψ ⋆ ( 2ε ), and

We are now ready to prove the existence of an equivariant Maurey–Nikishin factorization.

where kξkπ := sups∈Γ kπ(s)ξk (ξ ∈ H). Then since kπ(s)ξkπ = kξkπ (s ∈ Γ, ξ ∈ H), by (6),
the set A′ is globally Γ-invariant and convex. Since T is continuous and using Proposition
3.11, a very similar argument as in the proof of Lemma 3.7 (ii)⇒(iii) implies the following:

Proof. We ﬁrst show that in L2 (M ), the L2 -topology is stronger than the τ -measure topology.

This shows the claim. Note also that this proves that S −1 : S(H) ∋ S(ξ) → ξ ∈ H is
continuous:
n→∞

n→∞

kS(ξn )k2 → 0 ⇒ S(ξn ) → 0 SRT
n→∞

⇔ kξn k → 0.
Next, we show that S : H → L2 (M ) is L2 -continuous. Since H, L2 (M ) are Banach spaces,
it suﬃces to show that S is closed, by the Closed Graph Theorem. So assume that ξn ∈ H
n→∞
converges to 0, and S(ξn ) converges in L2 to some A ∈ L2 (M ). Then kS(ξn ) − Ak2 → 0,
n→∞
whence by the ﬁrst part, we also have S(ξn ) − A → 0 in SRT. Since SRT is a vector space
f (because M is ﬁnite), we obtain S(ξn ) n→∞
topology in M
→ A in SRT. However, S is continuous
n→∞
in SRT, whence S(ξn ) → 0 in SRT. Since SRT is Hausdorﬀ, A = 0. Therefore S is closed,
whence L2 -continuous.

Remark 3.14. In the above lemma, we did not claim that in L2 (M ), SRT and the L2 topology are the same. In fact the two topologies are diﬀerent (but they agree on the image
of S, i.e., S deﬁnes a strong embedding in the sense of [AK06, Deﬁnition 6.4.4]). To see
this in the commutative case, let (Ω, µ) be a diﬀuse probability space, and choose a sequence

Proof of Theorem 3.1. By Theorem 3.5, there exists an m-a.e. positive ϕ ∈ L0 (X, m) such
that (8) holds. We deﬁne an R-bilinear form h·, ·i′π : H × H → R by

ϕ(x)[T ξ](x)[T η](x) dm(x),

hξ, ηiπ :=

POLISH GROUPS OF FINITE TYPE

If hξ, ξi′π = 0, then ϕ|T ξ|2 = 0 a.e., and since ϕ > 0 a.e., T ξ = 0 a.e. But since T is injective,
we get ξ = 0. Thus this is an inner product. Let s ∈ Γ. Then for ξ, η ∈ H, the Γ-invariance
of ϕ and m show that

h·, ·i′π

Therefore
is Γ-invariant. We show that this inner product generates the same topology
on H as the original norm. Deﬁne S : H → L2 (X, m) ⊂ L2 (M ) by S(ξ) := ϕ1/2 T (ξ) =
Mϕ1/2 T (ξ). Note that the multiplication operator Mϕ1/2 is a (possibly unbounded) operator
aﬃliated with M . Therefore, the function
f ∋ X 7→ ϕ1/2 X ∈ M
f
Mϕ1/2 : M

is continuous with continuous inverse Mϕ−1/2 , so it is a homeomorphism. Therefore we obtain
f is also an R-linear homeomorphism onto its range. Moreover, we have
that S : H → M
the inclusion S(H) ⊂ L2 (X, m) ⊂ L2 (M ). Thus by Lemma 3.13, S : H → L2 (M ) is a
homeomorphism onto its range where L2 (M ) is equipped with the L2 -topology. Let (ξn )∞
n=1
be a sequence in H. Then
n→∞

n→∞

kξn k → 0 ⇔ kS(ξn )kL2 (M ) = kξk′π → 0.
This shows that k · k′π generates the same topology as k · k. Finally, we complexify the inner
product. Deﬁne a new sesqui-linear form h·, ·iπ : H × H → C by
1
hξ, ηiπ := {hξ, ηi′π + hiξ, iηi′π + ihξ, iηi′π − ihiξ, ηi′π },
4
′
Since h·, ·iπ is R-bilinear, so is h·, ·iπ . But if ξ, η ∈ H, then
(15)

ξ, η ∈ H.

1
hiξ, ηiπ = {hiξ, ηi′π + h−ξ, iηi′π + ihiξ, iηi′π + ihξ, ηi′π }
4
1
= {ihξ, ηi′π + ihiξ, iηi′π − hξ, iηi′π + hiξ, ηi′π }
4
= ihξ, ηiπ ,
1
hξ, iηi′ = {hξ, iηi′π − hiξ, ηi′π − ihξ, ηi′π − ihiξ, iηi′π }
4
1
= {−ihξ, ηi′π − ihiξ, iηi′π + hξ, iηi′π − hiξ, ηi′π }
4
= −ihξ, ηiπ .
Thus h·, ·iπ is sesqui-linear. Note that
1
1
kξk2π = (kξk′π )2 + (kiξk′π )2 ,
4
4
so that h·, ·iπ also generates the same Hilbert space topology. Since π(s) (s ∈ Γ) is C-linear
and preserves h·, ·i′π , it is also clear that π(s) preserves h·, ·iπ as well. By Lemma 3.2, this
shows that π is unitarizable.

Note that in our construction G = H ⋊π Γ, it is essential that Γ is discrete. It is therefore
of interest to consider the following question:
Question 3.15. Is there a connected, unitarily representable SIN Polish group which is not
of ﬁnite type?
Note also that in the proof of Theorem 3.1, we have shown the following result, which is
of independent interest:
Corollary 3.16. Let H be a separable real Hilbert space, and let f ∈ P(H). Then there exist
(i) a compact metrizable space X and a Borel probability measure m on X,
(ii) a bounded operator T : H → L2 (X, m; R), and
(iii) a positive measurable function ϕ ∈ L0 (X, m),
such that
Z
eiϕ(x)[T ξ](x) dm(x),
ξ ∈ H.
f (ξ) =
X

Moreover:
(iv) If f generates a neighborhood basis of 0, then T can be chosen to be a real-linear
homeomorphism onto its range.
(v) We may arrange T and ϕ such that if G is a uniformly bounded subgroup of the group
{u ∈ GL(H); f (uξ) = f (ξ) (ξ ∈ H)} of invertible operators on H fixing f pointwise,
then there exists a continuous homomorphism β from G to the group Aut(X, m) of all
m-preserving automorphisms of X with the weak topology, such that
[T (uξ)](x) = β(u)[T (ξ)](x),

ϕ(β(u)x) = ϕ(x),

u ∈ G, ξ ∈ H, m-a.e. x ∈ X.

One may regard Corollary 3.16 as an equivariant version of the classical result (cf. [AMM85,
Lemma 4.2]) that any f ∈ P(H) is of the form
Z
eit[U ξ](x) dm(x),
ξ ∈ H, t ∈ R
f (tξ) =
X

for a probability space (X, m) and a continuous linear map U : H → L0 (X, m).

Remark 3.17. A typical example of the above corollary is the positive deﬁnite function
2
f (ξ) = e−kξk /4 . To see this, let us ﬁx an orthogonal basis {ξi } for H. In this case, we can
choose X = (Ṙ)N the product of an inﬁnite number of copies of the one-point compactiﬁcation
of R, m = the inﬁnite dimensional Gaussian measure, T (ξi ) : X ∋ x 7→ xi ∈ Ṙ and ϕ = 1.
The triple (X, m, T ) is called a Gaussian random process indexed by H. For more detatils,
see [Si74].
Remark 3.18. It is clear from the proof that it applies whenever H is a Banach space of
Rademacher type 2 (see [AK06, §6] for deﬁnitions). Thus we have shown as a corollary that a
Banach space B is isomorphic (as a Banach space) to a Hilbert space if and only if a positive
deﬁnite function generates the topology of B and is of type 2. Moreover, the isomorphism can
be made equivariant with respect to a group of symmetries that preserve the positive deﬁnite
function. One may compare this result with Kwapień’s Theorem [Kw72] that B is isomorphic
to a Hilbert space if and only if B is of type 2 and cotype 2. Note that the Kwapień Theorem
does not produce an equivariant isomorphism but requires less in the sense that any Banach
space isomorphic to a subspace of L0 (X, m) is of cotype 2, but not all cotype 2 Banach spaces
can be isomorphic to a subspace of L0 (X, m) (see the remark after [BL00, Corollary 8.17] and
[Pi78]).

POLISH GROUPS OF FINITE TYPE

Appendix
The following two results are well-known, but we include the proofs for the reader’s convenience.
Proposition 3.19. Let A be a commutative von Neumann algebra with separable predual, and
let τ be a normal faithful tracial state on A. Let G be a Polish group, and let β : G → Aut(A)
be a continuous τ -preserving action. Then there exists a separable compact metrizable space
X, a Borel probability measure m on X, an m-preserving continuous action G × X ∋ (g, x) 7→
gx ∈ X and a ∗-isomorphism Φ : A → L∞ (X, m) such that
Z
(16)
Φ(a)(x) dm(x),
a ∈ A,
τ (a) =
X

(17)

Φ(βg (a))(x) = Φ(a)(g−1 x),

g ∈ G, µ−a.e. a ∈ A.

Moreover, the G-action is continuous as a map G → Aut(X, m), where the group Aut(X, m)
of all m-preserving automorphism of X is equipped with the weak topology.
Lemma 3.20. Let M, N be von Neumann algebras, and let ψ, ϕ be normal faithful states on
M, N , respectively. Let M0 (resp. N0 ) be a ∗-strongly dense subalgebra of M (resp. N ). If
α : M0 → N0 is a ∗-isomorphism such that ϕ(α(x)) = ψ(x) for every x ∈ M0 , then α can be
extended to a ∗-isomorphism from M onto N such that ϕ(α(x)) = ψ(x) (x ∈ M ).
Proof. By the GNS construction, we may assume that M acts on L2 (M, ψ) and N acts
on L2 (N, ϕ) so that ψ = h · ξψ , ξψ i, ϕ = h · ξϕ , ξϕ i for unit vectors ξψ ∈ L2 (M, ψ) and
ξϕ ∈ L2 (N, ϕ). Deﬁne U0 : M0 ξψ → N0 ξϕ by
U0 xξψ := α(x)ξϕ ,

x ∈ M0 .

Since ψ is faithful, U0 is well-deﬁned. Also, since M0 is ∗-strongly dense in M and ξψ is cyclic
for M , M0 ξψ is dense in L2 (M, ψ). Similarly, N0 ξϕ is dense in L2 (N, ϕ). By ϕ ◦ α = ψ on
M0 , we have
kU0 xξψ k2 = ϕ(α(x∗ x)) = ψ(x∗ x) = kxξψ k2 , x ∈ M0 .
Therefore, U0 extends to an isometry U from L2 (M, ψ) into L2 (N, ϕ) and the range of U
contains a dense subspace N0 ξϕ . Therefore U is onto. If x ∈ M0 , then for each y ∈ N0 ,
U xU ∗ yξϕ = U xα−1 (y)ξψ = α(x)yξϕ ,
so that by the density of N0 ξϕ , we have
U xU ∗ = α(x),

x ∈ M0 .

Let now x ∈ M . Then there exists a net (xi )i∈I in M0 converging ∗-strongly to x. Then
U xi U ∗ = α(xi ) (∈ N ) converges ∗-strongly to U xU ∗ . Therefore U xU ∗ ∈ N . Then it is clear
that M ∋ x 7→ U xU ∗ ∈ N deﬁnes a ∗-isomorphism with inverse N ∋ y 7→ U ∗ yU ∈ M .
The uniqueness of the extension is clear by the ∗-strong density of M0 and the fact that
isomorphisms between von Neumann algebras are normal. It is now clear that ϕ ◦ α = ψ on
M . This ﬁnishes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 3.19. Let A0 := {x ∈ A; limg→1 kαg (x) − xk = 0}, which is a normdense C∗ -subalgebra of A. Let {an }∞
n=1 be a ∗-strongly dense subset of A0 , and let C =
C ∗ ({βg (an ); g ∈ G, n ∈ N} ∪ {1}). Then since G is separable and g 7→ βg (an ) is normcontinuous for all n ∈ N, C is a norm-separable ∗-strongly dense C∗ -subalgebra of A, and let
X = Spec(C) (the Gelfand spectrum), which is a separable and compact metrizable space,

24

HIROSHI ANDO, YASUMICHI MATSUZAWA, ANDREAS THOM, AND ASGER TÖRNQUIST

and let Φ : C → C(X) be the Gelfand transform. Since τ ◦ Φ−1 ∈ C(X)∗+ , there exists a Borel
probability measure m on X such that
Z
Φ(c)(x) dm(x),
c ∈ C.
τ (c) =
X

L2 (X, m)

We let C(X) act on
by multiplication, so C(X) ⊂RL∞ (X, m) is a ∗-strongly dense
∞
∗-subalgebra of L (X, m). The map τm : L∞ (X, m) ∋ f 7→ X f dm ∈ C is a normal faithful
tracial state on L∞ (X, m). Moreover, τm (Φ(c)) = τ (c) for every c ∈ C. Therefore by Lemma
3.20, Φ can be extended to a ∗-isomorphism Φ : C ′′ = A → C(X)′′ = L∞ (X, m) such that
τm (Φ(a)) = τ (a) for every a ∈ A. This shows (16). Now let g ∈ G and x ∈ X. Let
mx ∈ C(X)∗ be the delta probability measure at x ∈ X. Let β ∗ be the dual action of G on
C(X)∗ given by
(18)

hβg∗ (ν), f i := hν, Φ ◦ βg−1 ◦ Φ−1 (f )i,

ν ∈ C(X)∗ , f ∈ C(X), g ∈ G.

Since β is an action, βg∗ maps pure states (on C ∼
= C(X)) to pure states, and pure states on
C(X) are precisely the delta probability measures, there exists a unique point g · x ∈ X such
that
βg∗ (mx ) = mg·x .
We show that G × X ∋ (g, x) 7→ g · x ∈ X is a continuous m-preserving action. It is routine to
check that this is indeed an action of G on X. We show that the action is continuous. Since
G is a Polish group and X is a Polish space, it suﬃces to show that the action is separately
continuous (see e.g., [Kec96, Theorem 9.14]). Suppose that (xn )∞
n=1 ⊂ X converges to x ∈ X
n→∞
and let g ∈ G. Then by the deﬁnition of the Gelfand spectrum, mxn → mx (weak*). Since
βg induces an action on C (C is β-invariant by construction), we have
n→∞

βg∗ (mxn ) = mg·xn → βg∗ (mx ) = mg·x ,
n→∞

which implies g·xn → g·x (again by the deﬁnition of the topology on the Gelfand spectrum).
Let now x ∈ X and (gn )∞
n=1 ⊂ G be a sequence converging to g ∈ G. Then for each f ∈ C(X),
n→∞

hβg∗n (mx ), f i = hmx , Φ ◦ βgn−1 ◦ Φ−1 (f )i → hmx , Φ ◦ βg−1 ◦ Φ−1 (f )i
= hβg∗ (mx ), f i,
n→∞

whence gn · x → g · x. Therefore the G-action on X is continuous. Next, we show that for
each g ∈ G, the map X ∋ x 7→ g · x ∈ X preserves m. It suﬃces to show that

By the Krein-Milman Theorem, D is weak*-dense in the state space of C(X). This shows
that

Therefore the G-action on X is m-preserving. Finally, we show (17). Since the map
βg′ : L∞ (X, m) ∋ f 7→ f (g −1 · ) ∈ L∞ (X, m)
deﬁnes a τm -preserving action and since C(X) is ∗-strongly dense in L∞ (X, m), it suﬃces to
show that (17) holds for every f = Φ(a) ∈ C(X) (a ∈ C), x ∈ X, and g ∈ G. But
f (g −1 x) = hµg−1 ·x , f i = hβg∗−1 (µx ), f i
= hµx , Φ ◦ βg ◦ Φ−1 (f )i
= Φ ◦ βg ◦ Φ−1 (f )(x).

Finally, assume that gn → g in G. Then for every measurable set A ⊂ X, we have
Z
|Φ ◦ βgn−1 ◦ Φ−1 (1A )(x) − Φ ◦ βg−1 ◦ Φ−1 (1A )(x)| dm(x)
m(gn A △ gA) =

n→∞

≤ kβgn−1 ◦ Φ−1 (1A ) − βg−1 ◦ Φ−1 (1A )k2 → 0,

because the u-topology on Aut(A) is the same as the topology of pointwise k · k2 -convergence.
Thus the G-action deﬁnes a continuous homomorphism G → Aut(X, m). This ﬁnishes the
proof.
