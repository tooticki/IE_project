Abstract. We develop an explicit Kuznetsov formula on GL(3) for congruence subgroups. Applications
include a Lindelöf on average type bound for the sixth moment of GL(3) L-functions in the level aspect, an
automorphic large sieve inequality, density results for exceptional eigenvalues and density results for Maaß
forms violating the Ramanujan conjecture at finite places.

1. Introduction
While the toolbox of analytic number theory for classical automorphic forms for congruence subgroups
of SL2 (Z) is well developed, much less is known in the case of higher rank groups. It is therefore very
desirable to extend the collection of available methods by genuine higher rank tools, such as explicit and
for the purpose of analytic number theory user-friendly spectral summation formulae. In this paper we
will introduce a version of the powerful Bruggeman-Kuznetsov formula for congruence subgroups of SL3 (Z)
and see it in action.
In the situation of the group SL2 (Z) this versatile formula was first developed independently by Bruggeman [Br] and Kuznetsov [Ku]. Starting with the groundbreaking work of Deshouillers and Iwaniec [DI1], it
has become a very attractive tool, among other things because it provides a method for studying averages
of Kloosterman sums by automorphic techniques, and has shown itself capable of going sometimes beyond
the powerful bounds known for individual Kloosterman sums by the Riemann Hypothesis over finite fields.
Classical applications include, among others, density results on exceptional eigenvalues, a proof of Selberg’s
3/16 theorem, the best known results on the proportion of critical zeros of the Riemann zeta function, and
equidistribution of integral points on spheres.
While such a formula exists in great generality, using the theory of general automorphic forms, a main
issue for the purpose of analytic number theory is to make the resulting expression analytically useful.
This requires a very good understanding of the integral transforms which relate the test functions on both
sides of the formulas at all places which turns out to be a problem both in real and p-adic analysis. In this
paper the focus is on the level aspect, and a good deal of work is devoted to the investigation of the fine
properties of GL(3) Kloosterman sums with prime power moduli, but some of the applications also require
more precise information on the archimedean test function than those developed in [Bl].
We proceed to describe the new applications that we group into three sections.
1.1. Moments of L-functions. While individual L-functions remain rather elusive objects, statistical
information in families F of L-functions is often more easily available. The archetypical result in this
direction is a statement on the order of magnitude (asymptotic formulae, upper bounds, or sometimes
lower bounds) of some moment of a family of L-functions

at the central point. Trace formulae are particularly suitable to evaluate such moments if the family is
given by “spectral properties”. Here we consider the GL(3) L-functions of large (prime) level N for the
congruence subgroup Γ0 (N ), the subgroup of matrices in SL3 (Z) with bottom row congruent to (0, 0, ∗)
modulo N acting on the generalized upper half plane H3 . This is a subgroup of index N 2+o(1) in SL3 (Z).
For an SO(3)-invariant subspace of a spherical cuspidal automorphic representation π ⊆ L2cusp (Γ0 (N )\H3 )
let µπ denote the spectral parameter (Langlands parameter at infinity) of π, normalized so that it is
purely imaginary if the Ramanujan conjecture holds. We fix once and for all a compact set Ω ⊆ a∗C , the
complexified dual of the Lie algebra of the maximal torus in PGL3 (R). If Ω is not too small, there are
roughly ≍Ω N 2+o(1) such representations π with µπ ∈ Ω.
It is a fairly straightforward exercise with Kuznetsov formula to prove the following best-possible (“Lindelöf-on-average”) bound for the fourth moment:
X
|L(1/2, π)|4 ≪ N 2+ε
π⊆L2 (Γ0 (N )\H3 )
µπ ∈Ω

for any ε > 0. Here and henceforth in this paper we will apply the usual ε-convention: the letter ε denotes
an arbitrarily small real number, not necessarily the same on each occurrence.
The main work of the paper is devoted to bound a sixth moment in a best-possible fashion. This gives
us the possibility to highlight the finer details of the Kloosterman side of the Kuznetsov formula and to
give a sample argument how to combine this formula with the rest of the machinery of analytic number
theory, such as multiple Poisson summation, estimation of multiple character sums and stationary phase
type arguments for the archimedean weight functions.
One of the technical problems is that the Kuznetsov formula – as any spectral summation formula –
requires a spectrally complete expression. Therefore we have to artificially add the continuous spectrum
which unfortunately produces a term of larger of magnitude (the maximal Eisenstein series contribute
N 5/2 , see Section 5.2). This problem was already faced in the GL(2) situation in [DFI] and [BHM]; in
[DFI], a delicate analysis identified a term on the arithmetic side of the Kuznetsov formula that cancelled
the continuous spectrum contribution, while in [BHM] this problem was solved by introducing extra zeros
in the Mellin transform of the weight function in the approximate functional equation. Both approaches
require extremely subtle and precise information on the archimedean test functions in the Kuznetsov
formula that is not easily available in higher rank situations. Here we deal with this problem by twisting
the automorphic forms in question with a fixed character in order to kill the unwanted poles incurred by
the continuous spectrum. Our first main theorem is as follows.
Theorem 1. Let N be a large prime and let p be a fixed prime. Let χ be a primitive character modulo p
of order > 2 and let Ω ⊆ a∗C . Then
X
|L(1/2, π × χ)|6 ≪p,Ω,ε N 2+ε
π⊆L2cusp (Γ0 (N )\H3 )
µπ ∈Ω

for every ε > 0.
1.2. Spectral mean values and a large sieve. Many applications call for an estimate of Fourier coefficients, averaged over the automorphic spectrum. For each π ⊆ L2cusp (Γ0 (N )\H3 ) we choose a newvector ̟
that we normalize such that its Fourier coefficients, defined in (2.7) and (2.8) below, satisfy A̟ (1, 1) = 1.
The following useful result is the level analogue of [Bl, Theorem 5]:
Theorem 2. Let n, m, N ∈ N, (mn, N ) = 1, Ω ⊆ a∗C . Then we have
X
|A̟ (n, m)|2 ≪Ω,ε (N mn)ε (N 2 + N 1/2 nm)
π⊆L2cusp (Γ0 (N )\H3 )
µπ ∈Ω

for every ε > 0.

The first term on the right hand side is (up to ε) the number of terms in the sum which dominates the
second term provided nm ≪ N 3/2 . In particular, in this region the result is best possible and can often be
used as a substitute for the Ramanujan conjecture.
A more refined estimate of this type is the following large sieve inequality for the unramified Hecke
eigenvalues λπ (n) = A̟ (n, 1), (n, N ) = 1.
Theorem 3. Let N ∈ N, Ω ⊆ a∗C , X > 1, and let α(n) be a sequence of complex numbers supported on
X 6 n 6 2X. Then

This is in the spirit of the celebrated large sieve inequalities of [DI1]. It should be compared with the
case n = 3 of [Ve] which requires X 6 N 1/4 to be optimal whereas our result covers the much larger
range X 6 N 3/4 (cf. also [DK] for a different large sieve inequality). This shows the advantage of using a
powerful tool like the Kuznetsov formula as opposed to the soft methods in [Ve] which on the other hand
generalize directly to GL(n).
1.3. Exceptional eigenvalues and the Ramanujan conjecture. The Ramanujan conjecture is one of
the central open problems in the theory of automorphic forms, known only for cohomological forms. In
analytic number theory it is often important to control the degree to which the Ramanujan conjecture is
violated, and to show that this cannot happen too frequently. The following theorems provide bounds for
the density of forms violating the Ramanujan conjecture at a given place, and we will show in particular
that in a quantitative sense almost all Maaß forms satisfy the Ramanujan conjecture at a given place. In
the eigenvalue aspect this has been investigated in [BBR]. We start with the archimedean place and show
the following density result for exceptional Maaß forms of large level:
Theorem 4. Let N be a prime and Ω ⊆ a∗C . Then
X
π⊆L2cusp (Γ0 (N )\H3 )
µπ ∈Ω

N 4kℜµπ k ≪Ω,ε N 2+ε

for every ε > 0.
Here and in the following, k.k denotes the maximum norm. The Jacquet-Shalika [JS] bounds imply
kℜµπ k 6 1/2 while the Kim-Sarnak method shows kℜµπ k 6 5/14. Our result recovers (essentially) the
Jacquet-Shalika bounds, but it shows much more: exceptional Maaß forms occur less and less frequent,
the more the Ramanujan conjecture at infinity is violated.
A similar result can be obtained for a fixed finite place. Let απ (p) denote the Satake parameter of a
representation π at p. The Ramanujan conjecture states that all three entries of απ (p) have absolute value
one.
Theorem 5. Let N ∈ N, fix a prime p ∤ N and let δ > 0. Let Ω ⊆ a∗C . Then there exists η > 0 (depending
on δ and p) such that

	
# π ⊆ L2cusp (Γ0 (N )\H3 ) : µπ ∈ Ω, kαπ (p)k > 1 + δ ≪Ω,δ,p (N 2 )1−η .
2. The Kuznetsov formula for congruence subgroups of SL3 (Z)

In this section we state and prove the Kuznetsov formula and correct a small error in the statement of
the formula in [Bl]. This requires a bit of notational preparation. Let N ∈ N be the level. We follow the

For a (not necessarily cuspidal) automorphic form ̟ of level N and spectral parameter µ we define the

To ease notation, we will denote by {̟} an orthonormal basis of automorphic
forms of level N , cuspidal or
R
Eisenstein series, containing all cuspidal newvectors, and we denote by (N ) d̟ a combined sum/integral
over the complete spectrum of level N . The relevant spectral decomposition is a special case of Langlands’
general theory, see e.g. [Ar] for a convenient summary in adelic language. By Hecke theory, we can and
will assume that all ̟ are eigenfunctions of the Hecke algebra coprime to N . Since
Γ0 (N )diag(m0 m1 m2 , m0 m1 , m0 )Γ0 (N ) = Γ0 (1)diag(m0 m1 m2 , m0 m1 , m0 )Γ0 (1)
for (m0 m1 m2 , N ) = 1, this is just the unramified Hecke algebra that satisfies the usual GL(3) Hecke
relations as in [Go, Theorem 6.4.11]. The proof of [Go, Theorem 6.4.11] also shows that if Ã̟ (1, 1) = 0,
then Ã̟ (m1 , m2 ) = 0 whenever (m1 m2 , N ) = 1. If Ã̟ (1, 1) 6= 0, which is the case in particular for
newvectors ̟, we write
(2.8)

A̟ (m1 , m2 ) = Ã̟ (m1 , m2 )/Ã̟ (1, 1),

in which case the normalized Fourier coefficients A̟ (m1 , m2 ) satisfy the multiplicativity relations of [Go,
Theorem 6.4.11]. If Ã̟ (1, 1) = 0, we simply write A̟ (m1 , m2 ) = Ã̟ (m1 , m2 ) and remark already at this
place that for such ̟ only vanishing Fourier coefficients will come up in our analysis (which, in a trivial
way, satisfy the Hecke relations), so that the normalization is irrelevant. For notational consistency we
write N (̟) = Ã̟ (1, 1)2 if Ã̟ (1, 1) 6= 0 and N (̟) = 1 otherwise.
Rankin-Selberg theory shows (see e.g. [Bl, Lemma 1]) that for a cuspidal newform ̟ ∈ π one has

Remarks: (1) In [Bl], the first two entries in the long Weyl element Kloosterman sum are mistakenly
interchanged, cf. [BFG, p. 64].
(2) The Fourier coefficients of Eisenstein series for Γ0 (N ) ⊆ SL3 (Z) for all indices are computed in detail
in [Ba].
(3) Note that there is a small asymmetry in the definition of Σ4 and Σ5 . If (n1 m1 , N ) = 1, then the
summation condition in Σ4 is equivalent to D1 = N 2 d1 d2 , D2 = N d2 , n2 d1 = m1 d2 , while the summation
condition in Σ5 is equivalent to D1 = N d1 , D2 = N 2 d1 d2 , n1 d2 = m2 d1 , so complete symmetry between
Σ4 and Σ5 is restored.
Proof. This is exactly as in [Bl, Proposition 4] by computing the inner product of two level N Poincaré
series by unfolding and by spectral decomposition and then comparing both expressions. We only have
to verify that the definition of our Kloosterman sums agrees with the Fourier expansion of the level N
Poincaré series. The exponential sums appearing in the latter are most easily, but abstractly, defined
in terms of the Bruhat decomposition, so the procedure is to enumerate the terms in the sum using the
Plücker coordinates, determine the summand as a function of the Plücker coordinates by writing out the
Bruhat decomposition of each term, and then verify that the summand only depends on the residue classes
of the Plücker coordinates.
Let U (R) be the group of upper-triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal and entries in the ring
R, W the Weyl group and V the diagonal orthogonal matrices of SL3 (Z). We also need the decomposition
of U (R) by w ∈ W , so set
Uw (R) = (w−1 U (R)w) ∩ U (R),

Define characters of U (R) by

Ūw (R) = (w−1 U (R)t w) ∩ U (R).

where we assume n1 , n2 ∈ Z. Then the Bruhat decomposition of some γ ∈ SL3 (Z) takes the form γ =
bcvwb′ with w ∈ W , v ∈ V , b, b′ ∈ U (R) and c = diag(1/c2 , c2 /c1 , c1 ) for some c1 , c2 ∈ N. The Bruhat
decomposition is only defined up to an element of Uw (R).
Now let w ∈ W , n1 , n2 , m1 , m2 ∈ Z and c = diag(1/c2 , c2 /c1 , c1 ) as before. If the compatibility condition
ψn1 ,n2 ((cw)u(cw)−1 )ψm1 ,m2 (u−1 ) = 1 for all u ∈ Uw (R)

holds, we define the Kloosterman sums

The sum is over representatives γ in the quotient space having the prescribed components c and w in their
Bruhat decomposition, which is well-defined by the compatibility condition. The quotient by V simply
allows us to restrict to positive moduli c1 and c2 by conjugating the v matrix, which contains the signs of
the moduli, to the right. If the compatibility relation fails, we simply define Sw (ψn1 ,n2 , ψm1 ,m2 ; c) = 0.
By a computation of Friedberg [Fr, pp. 173-174], only sums satisfying the compatibility condition occur
in the Fourier expansion of a Poincaré series. In particular, for n1 n2 m1 m2 6= 0, only the I, w4 , w5 , and w6
Weyl elements contribute, since otherwise the compatibility relation is never satisfied.
We now wish to show that the concrete expressions for the Kloosterman sums given in (2.2) and (2.3)
match the abstract definition (2.12).
We may parameterize representatives of U (Z)\Γ0 (N ) by the Plücker coordinates A1 , B1 , C1 and A2 , B2 , C2
satisfying
(A1 , B1 , C1 ) = (A2 , B2 , C2 ) = 1,
A1 C2 + B1 B2 + C1 A2 = 0,
N | A1 , N | B1 .

(2.13)

For a matrix γ =

∈ Γ0 (N ), these are computed by

B1 = b,

C1 = c,

A2 = bd − ae,

B2 = af − cd,

C2 = ce − bf.

Our computation now essentially follows [BFG], but we must keep track of the level condition N | A1 , N |
B1 . The auxiliary parameters Z2 = g, Y2 = h, X2 = i, Z1 = ge − dh, Y1 = di − gf , and X1 = f h − ei are
solutions to the equations
(2.14)

Z2 C2 + Y2 B2 + X2 A2 = 1,
Z1 C1 + Y1 B1 + X1 A1 = 1.

These equations do not completely determine the auxiliary parameters, but we will only require that the
auxiliary parameters are some solution, as the final expression for the Kloosterman sum will be independent
of the choice. The right-translation action of x ∈ U (Z) on the Plücker coordinates gives the new values
(A1 , B1 , C1 ) 7→ (A1 , B1 + x2 A1 , C1 + x1 B1 + x3 A1 ),
(A2 , B2 , C2 ) 7→ (A2 , B2 − x1 A2 , C2 − x2 B2 + (x1 x2 − x3 )A2 ).

Note that we put our decompositions in the form bcwb′ with b′ ∈ Ūw (Q), as opposed to [BFG], who put
their decompositions in the form bwcb′ with b ∈ Ūw−1 (Q). The decompositons are equivalent, but the
former is more standardized.
Restricting to a fundamental domain for the action of Ūw6 (Z) = U (Z), we may write the sum (2.12) for
w = w6 as

where the sum is taken over 0 ≤ B1 , C1 < A1 and 0 ≤ B2 < A2 subject to (2.13) and (2.14). Now [BFG,
Lemma 4.1] shows that the summand is independent of the choice of auxiliary parameters. Note that the
compatibility condition is trivially true for the long element as Uw6 (R) = {I}.

We conclude the long element analysis by mentioning that the proofs of [BFG, Lemmas 4.1, 4.2] show
that the sum is well-defined if we replace the summation conditions with their modular equivalents

(2.15)

B1 , C1 (mod A1 ),
B2 (mod A2 ),
N | A1 ,
A1 C2 + B1 B2 + C1 A2 ≡ 0 (mod A1 A2 ),
(A1 , B1 , C1 ) = 1,
(A2 , B2 , C2 ) = 1,
Z2 C2 + Y2 B2 = 1 (mod A2 ),
Z1 C1 + Y1 B1 = 1

N | B1
(mod A1 ),

and the sum is empty unless N | A2 . This matches the previous definition with
(2.16)

Sw6 (ψn1 ,n2 , ψm1 ,m2 ; (A1 , A2 )) = δN |A1 S (N ) (m2 , −m1 , n1 , −n2 ; A1 , A2 ).

As noted in the proof of [BFG, Theorem 5.1], replacing m1 , n2 , B2 , C2 , C1 , Y2 , Z2 , Z1 by their negatives
leaves the sum invariant, so we may drop the negatives on m1 and n2 .
Elements of the w5 cell necessarily have A1 = 0 and B1 , A2 6= 0, so that B1 | A2 . With the Plücker and
auxiliary coordinates as before, for γ having A1 = 0 we have

The compatibility condition becomes n1 A2 = m2 B12 . Now the conditions (2.13) and (2.14) simplify to
(B1 , C1 ) = 1,
(A2 /B1 , C2 ) = 1,
Z1 C1 ≡ 1 (mod B1 ),
Z2 C 2 ≡ 1

and the space Ūw5 (Z) ⊂ U (Z) is defined by x2 = 0, so we may write the Kloosterman sum as
Sw5 (ψn1 ,n2 , ψm1 ,m2 ; (B1 , A2 )) = δn1 A2 =m2 B12 S̃(m1 , n1 , n2 ; B1 , A2 ).
N |B1 |A2

Unlike the long element case, no extra work is needed to justify our use of the modular summation
conditions.
For the w4 cell, we have A2 = 0 and A1 , B2 6= 0, so that B2 | A1 , and the compatibility condition is
n2 A1 = m1 B22 . With the Plücker and auxiliary coordinates as before, we have

Now the conditions (2.13) and (2.14) simplify to

(B2 , C2 ) = 1,
B1 = −C2 B

Z1 C1 ≡ 1 (mod A1 /B2 ),
Z2 C2 ≡ 1 (mod B2 ),

N | A1 ,

N | B1 ,

but we may take this one step further: we have B2 BN1 = −C2 AN1 and the condition (B2 , C2 ) = 1 implies
1
B2 | AN1 . Conversely, the condition N B2 | A1 implies N | (−C1 A
B2 ) = B1 , so we may write the Kloosterman
sum as
Sw4 (ψn1 ,n2 , ψm1 ,m2 ; (A1 , B2 )) = δn2 A1 =m1 B22 S̃(−m2 , −n2 , −n1 ; B2 , A1 ).
N B2 |A1

Note that changing the sign of both n1 and n2 leaves S̃ invariant by C2 7→ −C2 .

3. Weight functions in the Kuznetsov formula
In order to use the Kuznetsov formula for a spectral average, we need a function F such that |hF, W̃µ i|2
appearing on the left hand side of (2.10) is bounded away from zero for µ ∈ Ω ⊆ a∗C . For our purposes the
following slightly weaker statement suffices.
Lemma 1. For a fixed compact Ω ⊆ a∗C there is a finite collection of smooth compactly supported functions
P
F1 , . . . , FJ such that j |hFj , W̃µ i|2 ≫ 1 for µ ∈ Ω.

Proof. This follows from a simple compactness argument: for each µ ∈ Ω choose an open set Sµ ⊆ R2>0
such that ℜW̃µ (y) 6= 0 for all y ∈ Sµ or ℑW̃µ (y) 6= 0 for all y ∈ Sµ . This is possible by continuity of
W̃µ (y) in y. By continuity in µ, we can choose open neighbourhoods Uµ about µ such that ℜW̃µ∗ (y) 6= 0
for all y ∈ Sµ and all µ∗ ∈ Uµ or ℑW̃µ (y) 6= 0 for all y ∈ Sµ and all µ∗ ∈ Uµ . By compactness we pick
a finite collection of such neighbourhoods Uµ1 , . . . , UµJ covering Ω, and define the corresponding Fj to be
real-valued functions with support on Sµj and non-vanishing on the interior S̊µj .

For the proof of Theorem 4 we will need a function that blows up on the exceptional spectrum. We
recall that by unitarity the exceptional spectrum is parametrized by
µ = (ρ + iγ, −ρ + iγ, −2iγ)

(3.1)

for γ ∈ R, ρ ∈ [−1/2, 1/2] (by the Jacquet-Shalika bounds) and its translates under the Weyl group. For
a fixed smooth compactly supported function F and two parameters X1 , X2 > 1 let
F (X1 ,X2 ) (y1 , y2 ) := F (X1 y1 , X2 y2 )

(3.2)
so that F = F (1,1) .

Lemma 2. Fix Ω ⊆ a∗C , and let X1 , X2 > 1, ε > 0. Assume that F is non-negative and supported in a
(depending on Ω) sufficiently small neighbourhood about (1, 1) and that X1 , X2 are sufficiently large. Then
for exceptional µ ∈ Ω of the form (3.1) with |ρ| > ε we have hF (X1 ,X2 ) , W̃µ i ≍ (X1 X2 )1+|ρ| .
Proof. We have by (2.6) that

where F is the double Mellin transform of F , an entire function in both variables. If without loss of
generality ρ > 0 (note that in particular µ1 , µ2 , µ3 are sufficiently distinct), we shift contours to the left
and obtain
hF (X1 ,X2 ) , W̃µ i = cµ F(−1 − ρ + iγ, −1 − ρ − iγ)(X11+ρ−iγ + O(X1 ))(X21+ρ+iγ + O(X2 ))

for some constant cµ 6= 0. If F is non-negative and supported in a sufficiently small neighbourhood about
(1, 1), then F(−1 − ρ + iγ, −1 − ρ − iγ) 6= 0 for all µ ∈ Ω. This proves the lemma.
Next we provide bounds for the functions J˜ǫ;F (A) and Jǫ;F (A1 , A2 ) defined in (2.4) and (2.5). Here
F will always be a fixed compactly supported function and all implied constants may depend on F . For
bounds in the case of certain highly oscillating functions F see [Bl, Proposition 5]. We define F (X1 ,X2 ) as
in (3.2). The following basic bound suffices in many cases.
Lemma 3. Let X1 , X2 > 1.

Remark: Except for one instance in the proof of Theorem 4 we will always apply this lemma with
X1 = X2 = 1, so for most of the paper the variables X1 , X2 can be ignored.
Proof. (a) This is straightforward from the definition and uses only trivial bounds, noting that the
support of F (X1 ,X2 ) restricts the variables to
y1 ≍ (X1 A)−1 ,

y2 ≍ X2−1 ,

1 + x21 + x22 ≍ A8/3 (X1 X2 )2 .

This forces A ≫ X1
+ X2
. The upper bound follows now from trivial estimates1.
(b) The support of F (X1 ,X2 ) restricts the variables to
y1 ≍ (X1 A1 )−1 ,

y2 ≍ (X2 A2 )−1 ,

which implies that both A1 A22 and A21 A2 must be at least of order (X1 X2 )−3/2 . We recall from [Bl, Lemma
4] that

ξ1 ≍Ξ1

for Ξ1 , Ξ2 ≫ 1. For the derivatives we differentiate under the integral sign and estimate trivially, see also
[Bl, (8.16)].
For one application we need a more refined estimate of a certain 6-fold Fourier transform involving Jǫ;F .

Lemma 4. Let W : (0, ∞)6 → C be a fixed smooth compactly supported function. Let A1 , A2 > 0
and define A := exp(max(| log A1 |, | log A2 |)). Let P > 1, and let α1 , α2 , β1 , β2 , γ1 , γ2 ∈ R be such that
min(|α1 |, |α2 |, |β1 |, |β2 |, |γ1 |, |γ2 |) 6 P . Then the six-fold Fourier transform

from the previous proof. We will frequently use (3.3) with X1 = X2 = 1. We also write x4 = x1 x2 − x3
and
η1 = x2 x4 + x1 , η2 = x1 x3 + x2 .

We start with the proof of (3.4). Suppose that |α1 | is the smallest of the variables (possibly |α1 | = 0).
Choose a sufficiently large constant c2 and a sufficiently large constant c1 > c2 . We split the x1 , x2 , x3 integration in four pieces
(i) |x1 |, A21 |η1 |/ξ1 6 c1 P,

(ii) |x1 | 6 c2 P, A21 |η1 |/ξ1 > c1 P,

(iii) |x1 | > c1 P, A21 |η1 |/ξ1 6 c2 P

and the remaining portion (iv), which is contained in |x1 |, A21 |η1 |/ξ1 > c2 P . The conditions (i) imply
4/3 2/3
|x1 | ≪ P , x2 x4 ≪ P A2 A1 (note that we may assume by Lemma 3 that this is ≫ P ). The area of this

As K(A1 , A2 ; x1 , x2 , x3 ) ≪ 1, the total contribution of this case to Jb is P 2 A2 A1 (AP )ε .

If c1 is sufficiently large compared to c2 (or if ǫ1 x1 and η have different signs), the phase has no stationary
point, and after sufficiently many integrations by parts, using for instance [BKY, Lemma 8.1] with
1
X = A1 , U = Q =
, Y = P, R = A1 Y,
A1
we bound after trivial estimation in all other variables this portion of Jb by ≪ Aε P −C . The same argument
works for the region (iii).
In order to analyze the region (iv), we consider the expression (3.6) in more detail, first without any
restrictions on the x-variables. We could run a careful stationary phase argument as in [BKY, Proposition
8.2], but we can also proceed in a completely elementary way. Applying the stationary phase method only
on a formal basis shows that the oscillation of the y1 -integral is given by

c2 P , as mentioned above. Since |α1 | 6 P , the phase has no stationary point if c2 is sufficiently large, and by
repeated partial integration in any of the variables t1 we obtain again the bound Aε P −C . This completes
the proof of (3.4) if |α1 | is minimal. If any of the other variables is minimal, we can run the same argument,
possibly with interchanged indices.
For the bound (3.5) we return to (3.8) for an arbitrary choice of x1 , x2 , x3 . The simple stationary phase

e(at + b t)W (t)dt ≪ |a|−1/2 , a 6= 0
for a fixed smooth function W with compact support in (0, ∞) applied twice, followed by trivial estimations,
yields readily the bound (3.5). This completes the proof.
4. Kloosterman sums
In this section we collect some results about the Kloosterman sums defined in (2.2) and (2.3). We start
with useful upper bounds.
Lemma 5. Let N, D1 , D2 ∈ N, m1 , m2 , n1 , n2 ∈ Z \ {0}. We have

for any ε > 0.

APPLICATIONS OF THE KUZNETSOV FORMULA ON GL(3) II: THE LEVEL ASPECT

Proof. The bound for S̃ is Larsen’s bound [BFG, Appendix]. The bound for S (N ) is Stevens’ bound [St,
Theorem 5.1] in its uniform version given in [Bu, p. 39]. Note that for the level N Kloosterman sum, only
those Sa,b (n, ψ, ψ ′ ) (in the notation of [St, Section 5]) contribute to the Kloosterman sum where a 6 s − k,
b 6 r with s, r > k whenever pk k N (cf. also [DF, Remark 2.5]). In particular, Stevens’ bound holds a
fortiori for level N Kloosterman sums.
As in [Bl, Lemma 3]2 we conclude from (4.1) that

Lemma 6. For N ∈ N the following holds.
(a) The sum S (N ) (m1 , m2 , n1 , n2 ; D1 , D2 ) depends only on mj , nj modulo Dj for j = 1, 2.
(b) If (t1 t2 , u1 u2 ) = 1 for j = 1, 2 and N | t1 u1 , t2 u2 , then
S (N ) (m1 , m2 , n1 , n2 ; t1 u1 , t2 u2 )
= S (gcd(N,t1 )) (ū21 u2 m1 , ū22 u1 m2 , n1 , n2 ; t1 , t2 )S (gcd(N,u1 )) (t̄21 t2 m1 , t̄22 t1 m2 , n1 , n2 ; u1 , u2 ).

Proof. This is proved as in [BFG, Section 4], cf. Properties 4.6, 4.7 and 4.10, respectively.
Part (a) is trivial.
For part (b) we observe that the assumptions (t1 , u1 ) = 1 and N | t1 u1 imply that

(4.3)
(N, t1 )u1 , (N, u1 )t1 = N.

We now follow verbatim the proof of [BFG, Property 4.7]. Given two sets of summation variables Bj , Cj
and Bj′ , Cj′ such that (Bj , Cj , tj ) = (Bj′ , Cj′ , uj ) = 1 for j = 1, 2, (N, t1 ) | B1 , (N, u1 ) | B1′ , t1 t2 | t1 C2 +
B1 B2 + C1 t2 and u1 u2 | u1 C2′ + B1′ B2′ + C1′ u2 we choose r, r ′ ∈ Z with rt1 t2 + r ′ u1 u2 = 1. We define new
variables
d1 = t1 u1 ,

b1 = r ′ u1 u2 B1 + rt1 t2 B1′ ,

c1 = (r ′ )2 u21 u2 C1 + r 2 t21 t2 C1′ ,

d2 = t2 u2 ,

b2 = r ′ u1 u2 B2 + rt1 t2 B2′ ,

c2 = (r ′ )2 u1 u22 C2 + r 2 t1 t22 C2′ ,

and observe that b1 runs through all numbers modulo d1 = t1 u1 that are divisible by (4.3), which is the
desired extra divisibility condition N | b1 for S (N ) (m1 , m2 , n1 , n2 ; t1 u1 , t2 u2 ). Now we continue verbatim
2Notice that in [Bl, Lemma 3] the indices should be exchanged and read as in (4.1) above as a consequence of Remark 1

Remark: For completeness we also state the following two properties of the level N Kloosterman sums
that can be proved as in Property 4.3 and Property 4.4+4.5 of [BFG]:
(d) For (D1 D2 , ab) = 1 we have S (N ) (am1 , bm2 , n1 , n2 ; D1 , D2 ) = S (N ) (m1 , m2 , an1 , bn2 ; D1 , D2 ).
(e) We have S (N ) (m1 , m2 , n1 , n2 ; D1 , D2 ) = S (N ) (n2 , n1 , m2 , m1 ; D2 , D1 ).
Note, however, that an analogue of Property 4.4 or Property 4.5 alone does not exist due to asymmetry of
the summation condition N | B1 . We do not need the statements (d) and (e) in this paper.
For later purposes we study a certain 6-fold Fourier transform of the long Weyl element Kloosterman
sum. Let d, D1 , D2 ∈ N, and let a ∈ (Z/D1 Z)∗ and b ∈ (Z/D2 Z)∗ . For integers x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 , z1 , z2 we

(4.10)

(Bj , Cj , q) = 1,

N | B1

for j = 1, 2.

We keep in mind that q ∤ ab. This sum is well-defined as shown in [BFG, Lemma 4.2], and does not depend
on the choice of the representatives B1 , B2 . In particular, we can and will always assume
1 6 Bj 6 q αj

for

j = 1, 2.

For future purposes we notice that (4.9) implies
(4.11)

vq (B1 ) 6 α2 ,

vq (B2 ) 6 α1

where vq denotes the q-adic valuation. Indeed, the first inequality is trivial if α1 6 α2 . If α1 > α2 , the first
condition in (4.9) implies q α2 C1 + B1 B2 ≡ 0 (mod q α1 ). If q ∤ B1 , there is nothing to prove, otherwise we
have q ∤ C1 , so vq (B1 ) 6 vq (B1 B2 ) = α2 . Similarly one shows the second inequality.
Lemma 7. Let q be a prime, and let α1 , α2 ∈ N0 . For x1 , y1 , z1 , x2 , y2 , z2 ∈ Z and d ∈ N define

γ := min vq (x1 ), vq (x2 ), vq (y1 ), vq (y2 ), vq (z1 ), vq (z2 ) , δ = vq (d).
Then we have

|Sba,b,d (x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 , z1 , z2 ; q α1 , q α2 )| 6 3q 2 min(α1 ,α2 )−(α1 +α2 )+2(γ+δ) .

Here we apply the usual convention min(∞, n) = n for n ∈ N0 . The bound is meaningless for x1 = x2 =
y1 = y2 = z1 = z2 = 0. This case will be considered in Lemma 9. We defer the lengthy proof of Lemma 7
to the end of this section. A similar result holds for the twisted transform.
Lemma 8. Let χ be a primitive character modulo a prime p, and let α1 , α2 ∈ N0 . For x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 , z1 , z2 ∈
Z define

ρ := min vp (x1 ), vp (x2 ), vp (y1 ), vp (y2 ), vp (z1 ), vp (z2 ) .
Assume that (d, p) = 1. Then we have

an extra factor of p6/2 = p3 ). Then we apply Lemma 7 with γ 6 ρ + 1 and δ = 0.

Proof. We start with the observation that a Gauß sum


X

vanishes unless vp (K) = λ − 1.
The last condition in (4.9) implies that p | B1 , hence p ∤ C1 , and we can choose Y1 = 0, Z1 = C̄1 in
(4.10). Hence the n1 , n2 -sum becomes

Since (l1 l2 , p) = 1 by the presence of the character and (b, p) = 1 by assumption, this is only non-zero if
α1 = α2 = α > 3, say, which we assume from now on. Moreover, vp (B2 ) = α − 1. Next, the sum over m1
equals

which implies vp (B1 ) = α − 1. We write B1 = pα−1 β1 , B2 = pα−1 β2 with p ∤ β1 , β2 . Then C2 ≡
−C1 − β1 β2 pα−2 (mod pα ), and the B1 , B2 , C1 , C2 -sum becomes

Here we use that α > 3. The character implies that all variables in the numerator are coprime to p.
Changing variables β1 7→ m̄1 β1 , β2 7→ n2 l2 β2 , C1 7→ n1 l1 n2 l2 C1 , we see that this expression depends only on
the product m1 n1 l1 m2 n2 l2 , not on the six variables individually. Calling this expression T (m1 n1 l1 m2 n2 l2 ),
we obtain finally by another change of variables (e.g. m2 7→ m2 n1 ) that

and the n1 -sum vanishes since χ is not quadratic.
We combine the previous computations to the following useful result:
Corollary 10. Let χ be a primitive non-quadratic character modulo a prime p. Let D1 , D2 , d ∈ N satisfying
p3 | D1 , p3 | D2 and (d, p) = 1. Let x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 , z1 , z2 ∈ Z. Then

where τ3 is the ternary divisor function. Moreover,
χ
Sba,b,d
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0; D1 , D2 ) = 0.

Indeed, the last statement is a direct consequence of (4.6) and Lemma 9. The first bound follows from
the Chinese remainder theorem together with (4.6), (4.7) and Lemmas 7 and 8, noting that τ3 (q) = 3 for
a prime q and q 2 min(α1 ,α2 )−(α1 +α2 ) = (q1α1 , q2α2 )2 /(q1α1 q2α2 ).

for integers x, z and vq (B) 6 α. Indeed, the n-sum vanishes unless lB − x ≡ 0 (mod q α ) in which case
it equals q α . This implies in particular vq (B) 6 vq (x) and defines l modulo q α−vq (B) . Then the l-sum
vanishes unless vq (z) > vq (B), and the result follows easily.
We will now distinguish several cases to estimate Sba,b,d , but the overall strategy is always the same. We
open the Kloosterman sum and pull the B1 , B2 , C1 , C2 -sums outside. Then we sum over n1 , n2 , l1 , l2 , m1 , m2
using orthogonality of additive characters or (4.13). At this point we estimate trivially and just count how
many quadruples (B1 , B2 , C1 , C2 ) survive in the outer sum.
In order to avoid pathological cases, we treat the case α1 α2 = 0 separately. The case α1 = α2 = 0 is
trivial, so let us assume α1 > 0, α2 = 0. In this case the w6 -Kloosterman sum degenerates to an ordinary
Kloosterman sum
S (1) (am1 d, bn2 l2 , n1 l1 , m2 d, q α1 , 1) = S(am1 d, n1 l1 , q α1 )

We open the Kloosterman sum, sum over n1 , l1 by (4.13) and over m1 by orthogonality of characters getting
the bound q −α1 +δ . The case α1 = 0, α2 > 0 is similar. From now on we assume α1 > 0 and α2 > 0.
We return to the definition (4.4) and split the Kloosterman sum in (4.8) into two parts according to
whether q ∤ C1 or q | C1 . This gives a decomposition Sba,b,d = Ta,b,d + Ua,b,d . The second term where q | C1
is easier. In this case q ∤ B1 by (4.9), and the first condition there implies q | B2 (since α1 , α2 > 0), so that
q ∤ C2 . Hence we can choose
Y1 = B̄1 , Z2 = C̄2 , Z1 = Y2 = 0.
Considering the q-powers in the first condition in (4.9) again, we see that vq (B1 B2 ) 6 α2 , but vq (q α2 C1 +
q α1 C2 ) > min(α1 , α2 + 1), and we conclude α1 6 α2 . Thus

We sum trivially over n1 , l1 , we use (4.13) in combination with (4.11) for the sum over n2 , l2 , and we
sum over m1 , m2 using orthogonality of characters. The latter two sums leave q δ choices for B1 and C2
respectively (recall that q ∤ B1 ). Now the first condition in (4.9) determines B2 modulo q α2 which then
determines C1 . Altogether we obtain
(4.14)

|Ua,b,d | 6 q α1 −α2 +2δ = q 2 min(α1 ,α2 )−α1 −α2 +2δ .

Now we turn to the estimation of Ta,b,d where q ∤ C1 , so that

By (4.13), the sum over n2 , l2 contributes q α2 +vq (B2 ) if vq (B2 ) 6 min(vq (x2 ), vq (z2 )) and is zero otherwise.
Similarly the sum over n1 , l1 contributes q α1 +vq (B2 ) if vq (B2 ) 6 min(vq (x1 ), vq (z1 )) and is zero otherwise
(note that by (4.11) we have vq (B2 ) 6 α1 , so that (4.13) is applicable). We conclude that the combined
sum over n1 , n2 , l1 , l2 contributes
(4.16)

q α1 +α2 +2 min(vq (x1 ),vq (x2 ),vq (z1 ),vq (z2 )) .

As before the m1 -sum leaves at most q δ choices for B1 , and we fix one of them.
Let us first assume that q ∤ B2 , so that
(4.17)

Y2 = B̄2 ,

Z2 = 0.

Then the m2 -sum leaves at most q α1 +δ choices for B2 (and trivially there are at most q α2 ) choices for
B2 ). Again we fix one of them. If α1 6 α2 fix a choice for C1 , otherwise fix a choice for C2 . In
either case, the other C-variable is determined by (4.9). We conclude that there are in total at most
q δ+min(α1 +δ,α2 )+min(α1 ,α2 ) 6 q 2 min(α1 ,α2 )+2δ choices for the quadruples (B1 , B2 , C1 , C2 ) satisfying q ∤ B2 .
Let us now assume q | B2 , so that q ∤ C2 and
Y2 = 0,

Z2 = C̄2 .

The m2 -sum leaves at most q δ+vq (B1 ) 6 q δ+α1 choices for C2 (and trivially there are at most q α2 choices
for C2 ). If α1 6 α2 fix a choice for C1 , otherwise fix a choice for B2 . In either case, the other variable is
determined by (4.9). As above we conclude that there are in total at most q 2 min(α1 ,α2 )+2δ choices for the
quadruples (B1 , B2 , C1 , C2 ) satisfying q | B2 .
We conclude from the previous discussion that the sum over m1 , m2 together with the sum over
B1 , B2 , C1 , C2 contributes 2q α1 +α2 +2 min(α1 ,α2 )+2δ , and we obtain by (4.16) the total bound
(4.18)

|Ta,b,d | 6 2q 2 min(α1 ,α2 )−α1 −α2 +2 min(vq (x1 ),vq (x2 ),vq (z1 ),vq (z2 ))+2δ .

This is not quite sufficient to substantiate the claim of Lemma 7, so we proceed to prove an alternative
bound for Ta,b,d as defined in (4.15). Let us first assume that q ∤ B2 , so that (4.17) holds. Then by (4.13),
the n1 , l1 , n2 , l2 -sums contribute q α1 +α2 , while the m1 , m2 -sums leave as above q δ+min(α1 +δ,α2 ) choices for
the pair (B1 , B2 ). Fix a choice for C1 if α1 6 α2 , otherwise fix a choice for C2 ; in either case the other
variable is determined by (4.9). In total we obtain at most q 2δ+2 min(α1 ,α2 ) choices for the quadruples
(B1 , B2 , C1 , C2 ), so that together with the m1 , m2 -sum we obtain a total contribution of
(4.19)

q 2 min(α1 ,α2 )−α1 −α2 +2δ

for the terms q ∤ B2 .
Let us now consider the terms with q | B2 , so that q ∤ C2 and
Y2 = 0,

In the following we assume without loss of generality 1 6 y1 6 q α1 and 1 6 y2 6 q α2 , so that vq (y1 ) 6 α1
and vq (y2 ) 6 α2 . It is convenient to first dispense with the case min(vq (y1 ), vq (y2 )) > α2 (and hence = α2 ).
Here the n1 , n2 , l1 , l2 -sums contribute by (4.13) and (4.11) at most q α1 +α2 +2 min(α1 ,α2 ) while there are at
most q δ choices for B1 and trivially at most q 2α2 6 q 2 min(vq (y1 ),vq (y2 )) choices for (B2 , C2 ) which determines
C1 . This gives the total bound
(4.21)

q 2 min(α1 ,α2 )−α1 −α2 +2 min(vq (y1 ),vq (y2 ))+δ

for (4.20) under the present assumption min(vq (y1 ), vq (y2 )) > α2 . From now on we assume
(4.22)

min(vq (y1 ), vq (y2 )) < α2 .

We distinguish two cases.
Let us first assume vq (y1 ) 6 vq (y2 ). By (4.13) and (4.11) the sum over n1 , l1 , n2 , l2 contributes at most
α
1
q +α2 +2 min(α1 ,α2 ) . The m1 -sum leaves at most q δ choices for B1 and each of them satisfies vq (B1 ) 6 vq (y1 ).
We fix one of them. Similarly then the sum over m2 leaves at most q δ+vq (B1 ) 6 q δ+vq (y1 ) choices for C2 .
If B1 , C2 are fixed, then the first condition in (4.9) leaves at most q vq (B1 ) 6 q vq (y1 ) choices for B2 modulo
q α2 , and the triple B1 , B2 , C2 determines C1 . We conclude that there are at most q 2vq (y1 )+2δ choices for
the quadruple (B1 , B2 , C1 , C2 ), and we obtain the total bound
(4.23)

q 2 min(α1 ,α2 )−α1 −α2 +2 min(vq (y1 ),vq (y2 ))+2δ .

for (4.20) under the present assumption (4.22) and vq (y1 ) 6 vq (y2 ). This bound dominates (4.21).
The other case vq (y1 ) > vq (y2 ) cannot happen: first we observe that the m1 , m2 -sum vanishes unless
dB1 ≡ āy1 (mod q α1 ) and dB1 ≡ −C2 y2 (mod q α2 ). Together with (4.22) this leads to a contradiction
unless vq (y2 ) > α1 . But this is impossible since α1 > vq (y1 ) > vq (y2 ). We summarize that (4.23) is an
upper bound for (4.20) in all cases, and together with (4.19) we conclude
(4.24)

|Ta,b,d | 6 2q 2 min(α1 ,α2 )−α1 −α2 +2 min(vq (y1 ),vq (y2 ))+2δ .

Combining (4.18) and (4.24) with (4.14) completes the proof of Lemma 7.
5. The sixth moment

5.1. Setting up the Kuznetsov formula. We prepare now for the proof of Theorem 1. We recall the
setup that N is a large prime, p is a fixed prime and χ is a primitive non-quadratic character modulo p. All
implied constants may depend on p. Let π ⊆ L2cusp (Γ0 (N )\H3 ) be a cuspidal automorphic representation.
Its L-function has conductor dividing N [JPSS, Théorème]. The contribution in the moment estimate of
Theorem 1 of those π with conductor 1 is independent of N , hence O(1), therefore it suffices to consider
π of conductor N . Fix a newvector ̟ ∈ π and denote its normalized Fourier coefficients, defined in (2.7)
and (2.8), with A̟ (1, 1) = 1. By an approximate functional equation [IK, Theorem 5.2] we have

aπ×χ (n) ≪ n5/14+ε by known bounds towards the Ramanujan conjecture on GL(3) (although much weaker
bounds would suffice for our purpose). Thus we have

We truncate the sums at n 6 N 1/2+ε at the cost of a negligible error. Writing V as its inverse Mellin

We observe that the n1 , n2 -sum is non-negative and that (for ε < 1/2) the variables n1 , n2 are coprime to
N , so that the Fourier coefficients satisfy the unramified Hecke relations, as discussed prior to the statement
of Theorem 6 (recall that for ̟ with A̟ (1, 1) = 0 all coefficients coming up in the previous sum vanish).
We multiply three such expressions together. Applying Hölder’s inequality to the combined ν-sum and
t-integral with exponents 2/3 and 1/3 and using that

N | D1 and N 2 | D2 since N ∤ n1 l1 is prime, so that D1 D2 > N 3 , but n2 l2 m2 d2 n1 l1 ≪ M 5 ≪ N 5/2+ε ,
so that (for sufficiently small ε > 0 and sufficiently large N ) we have Σ5 = 0 by Lemma 3(a) (with

so that automatically (N, D1 D2 ) = 1.
Remark: We pause for a moment and observe that the contribution of the terms M = N 1/2 , d1 =
d2 = d3 = 1, D1 = D2 ≍ N 1/2 without the character χ exhibits no essential cancellation and is of size
N 5/2 as predicted by the contribution of the maximal Eisenstein series: indeed, the maximal Eisenstein
series are P
parametrized by GL(2) cusp forms f for Γ0 (N ), and a typical Fourier coefficient is given by
A(n, 1) = d|n λf (n); thus the maximal Eisenstein contribution is very roughly of the form

In order to obtain the targeted bound N 2 we will have to use the extra oscillation of the character.
We apply Poisson summation in the 6 variables n1 , n2 , m1 , m2 , l1 , l2 . We call the dual variables x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 , z1 , z2 ,
respectively. By Lemma 3(b) the function

as desired. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.
6. Proofs of Theorems 2 - 5
For the proof of Theorems 2, 3 and 5 we choose functions F1 , . . . , FJ as in Lemma 1, and we apply
Lemma 3 with X1 = X2 = 1.
For the proof of Theorem 3 we proceed as follows. The outer sum is over cuspidal automorphic
representations that we interpret as a sum over newvectors. We add artificially the oldforms and the
Eisenstein spectrum and bound the mean value in question by

Here we used also (2.9). We open the square and apply the Kuznetsov formula. The diagonal term
contributes ≪ N 2+ε kαk2 .
The contribution of the long Weyl element is bounded by

by (4.2), since the support condition in Lemma 3(b) with X1 = X2 = 1 restricts D1 , D2 ≪ X.

again by the support condition in Lemma 3(a). The summation condition implies D1 = ndN , D2 = nd2 N 2 ,
which is only possible if N ≪ 1, so that we obtain

by Lemma 5. This term is dominated by the w6 contribution. A similar argument works for the w4 contribution. This completes the proof.
A similar, but simpler, argument shows the bound in Theorem 2.
The proof of Theorem 5 follows along the lines of [BBR, Theorem 2]. If kαπ (p)k∞ > 1 + δ, then
λπ (pl ) > (l + 1)(l + 2) for some sufficiently large l = l(δ), see [BBR, (24)]. Hence for any k > 1 we have

so that by Cauchy-Schwarz and Theorem 2 the right hand side of (6.1) is bounded by

# π ⊆ L2cusp (Γ0 (N )\H3 ) : µπ ∈ Ω, kαπ (p)k > 1 + δ ≪ N 2+ε− 2l log p .

Finally we prove Theorem 4. Here we choose sufficiently large parameters X1 = X2 = X to be determined
later and apply the Kuznetsov formula with the function F (X,X) as in (3.2). Then by Lemma 2 and (2.9)
