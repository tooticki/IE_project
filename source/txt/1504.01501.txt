Abstract
A locally conformally Kähler (LCK) manifold is a comf,
plex manifold, with a Kähler structure on its covering M
f
with the deck transform group acting on M by holomorphic homotheties. One could think of an LCK manifold as
of a complex manifold with a Kähler form taking values in
a local system L, called the conformal weight bundle.
The L-valued cohomology of M is called Morse-Novikov
cohomology; it was conjectured that (just as it happens
for Kähler manifolds) the Morse-Novikov complex satisfies the ddc -lemma, which (if true) would have far-reaching
consequences for the geometry of LCK manifolds. In particular, this version of ddc -lemma would imply existence
of LCK potential on any LCK manifold with vanishing
Morse-Novikov class of its L-valued Hermitian symplectic form. The ddc -conjecture was disproved for Vaisman
manifolds by R. Goto. We prove that ddc -lemma is true
with coefficients in a sufficiently general power of L on any
Vaisman manifold or LCK with potential.

Introduction
LCK manifolds and dθ dcθ -lemma

A locally conformally Kähler (LCK) manifold is a complex manifold which
f such that the monodromy
admits a Kähler metric on its universal covering M
f
acts on M by Kähler homotheties. For more details and the reference on
this subject, please see Section 2.
The LCK property is equivalent to existence of a Hermitian form ω on
M satisfying dω = ω ∧ θ, where θ is a closed 1-form. This form is called the
Lee form of an LCK-manifold.
f as a Kähler form on M taking
One can consider the Kähler form on M
values in a 1-dimensional local system, or, equivalently, in a flat line bundle
L. This bundle is called the weight bundle of M .
The cohomology of this local system is known as the Morse-Novikov
cohomology of an LCK manifold. In locally conformally Kähler geometry,
the Morse-Novikov cohomology shares many properties of the Hodge decomposition with the usual cohomology of the complex manifolds. The locally
conformally Kähler form represents a cohomology class (called the MorseNovikov class) of an LCK manifold, encoding the topological properties of
an LCK structure. However, the ddc -lemma, which plays a crucial role for
the Kähler geometry, is invalid in the Morse-Novikov setting. The main
question of the locally conformally Kähler geometry is to find a replacement
of the ddc -lemma which would allow one to study the interaction between
the complex geometry and the topology of a manifold.

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

The statement of the ddc -lemma seems, on the first sight, to be technical.
It says that on any compact Kähler manifold (M, I), one has im d ∩ ker dc =
im ddc , where dc = IdI −1 is the twisted de Rham differential. However, it
is used as a crucial step in the proof of the degeneration of the DolbeaultFrölicher spectral sequence, and in the proof of homotopy formality of Kähler
manifolds.
For an LCK manifold, one replaces the de Rham differential by its MorseNovikov counterpart dθ := d − θ, where θ is the connection form of its
weight bundle; the twisted de Rham differential is replaced by dcθ = Idθ I −1 .
It was conjectured in [OV1] that the dθ dcθ -lemma would hold on any LCK
manifold, giving im dθ ∩ ker dcθ = im dθ dcθ . The implication of the dθ dcθ lemma would include the topological classification of LCK structures on
some manifolds (such as nilmanifolds) and a construction of automorphic
Kähler potentials on LCK manifolds with vanishing Morse-Novikov class.
However, this conjecture was false, as shown by R. Goto ([G]).

1.2

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology

When the dθ dcθ -lemma is false, one needs to study a more delicate cohomological invariant, called the weighted Bott-Chern cohomology of a
manifold:
ker dθ ∩ ker dcθ 
p,q
HBC
(M, L) :=
Λp,q (M ) .
im dθ dcθ

In [G], Goto has shown that the Bott-Chern cohomology group is responsible
for the deformational properties of an LCK manifold, and computed it for
certain (p, q) and certain examples of LCK manifolds, called the Vaisman
manifolds (see Subsection 2.2).

Definition 1.1. The local system L associated to a LCK manifold M is a
real, oriented line bundle over M with a flat connection. Trivializing this
bundle, we can write its connection as ∇L = d − θ, where θ is the Lee form
of our LCK manifold. For arbitrary a ∈ C, the connection ∇La := d − aθ is
also flat. For a ∈ Z, the corresponding line bundle is identified with the a-th
tensor power of L, denoted as La . One may think of the flat line bundle
(L, ∇La ) as of a real (or complex) power of L. We denote this line bundle
and its local system by La , and call it a-th power of a weight bundle.
In this paper we compute the weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for La ,
on LCK manifolds with proper potential, and show that it vanishes for all
a outside of a discrete countable subset of R (Corollary 4.2). This implies

ddc -lemma for forms with coefficients in La , for these values of a. This result
is based on a computation of Dolbeault cohomology with coefficients in La ,
which also vanishes for all a but a discrete countable subset (Theorem 3.2).

1.3

LCK manifolds with potential

Definition 1.2. A compact LCK manifold (M, ω, θ) is called LCK with
potential if ω = dθ dcθ ψ for a positive function ψ which is called LCK
potential.
An equivalent definition will be given in Subsection 2.3.
LCK manifolds with potential are understood very well now. The following results were proven in [OV2] and [OV3] (see also [OV6]). Recall that
a linear Hopf manifold is a quotient of Cn \0 by a Z-action generated by
a linear map with all eigenvalues |αi | > 1.
Theorem 1.3. Let M be a compact complex manifold. Then M admits
an LCK metric with potential if and only if M admits an embedding to a
linear Hopf manifold.
Theorem 1.4. Let M be an LCK manifold with potential. Then M is
a deformation of a Vaisman manifold (Definition 2.2). In particular, M is
diffeomorphic to a principal S 1 × S 1 -bundle over a projective orbifold.
It would be nice to have a topological characterization of LCK manifolds
with potential. Since [OV1], we were extending much effort trying to prove
the following conjecture, which has many geometric consequences.
Conjecture 1.5. Let (M, ω, θ) be a compact LCK manifold. Assume that
ω is dθ -exact. Then ω is dθ dcθ -exact, that is, M is a LCK with potential.
This conjecture is still open. It would trivially follow if the dθ dcθ -lemma
were true, but it is known now to be false. However, a weaker conjecture
still stands.
Conjecture 1.6. Let (M, ω, θ) be a compact LCK manifold, L its weight
bundle, and La the weight bundle to the power of a ∈ R (Definition 1.1).
Then, for all a outside of a discrete countable set, daθ dcaθ -lemma is true: for
any daθ -exact (1,1)-form η, one has η = daθ dcaθ f (but this does not imply
that the daθ dcaθ -lemma is true for other bidegrees).

In this paper, we prove that Conjecture 1.6 is true for LCK manifolds
with proper potential (Corollary 4.2). This is done by first proving a generic
vanishing result for weighted Dolbeault cohomology (Theorem 3.2).

Locally conformally Kähler geometry

In this section we give the necessary definitions and properties of locally
conformally Kähler (LCK) manifolds.

2.1

LCK manifolds

Definition 2.1. A complex manifold (M, I) is LCK if it admits a Kähler
f, ω
covering (M
e ), such that the covering group acts by holomorphic homotheties.
Equivalently, there exists on M a closed 1-form θ, called the Lee form,
such that ω satisfies the integrability condition:
dω = θ ∧ ω.
Clearly, the metric g := ω(·, I·) on M is locally conformal to some Kähler
metrics and its lift to the Kähler cover in the definition is globally conformal
to the Kähler metric corresponding to ω
e.
To an LCK manifold one associates the weight bundle LR −→ M . It is
a real line bundle associated to the representation1
1

GL(2n, R) ∋ A 7→| det A | n .
The Lee form induces a connection in LR by the formula ∇ = d − θ. ∇ is
associated to the Weyl covariant derivative (also denoted ∇) determined on
M by the LCK metric and the Lee form. As dθ = 0, then ∇2 = dθ = 0, and
hence LR is flat.
The complexification of the weight bundle will be denoted by L. The
Weyl connection extends naturally to L and its (0, 1)-part endows L with a
holomorphic structure.

In conformal geometry, the weight bundle usually corresponds to | det A | 2n . For
1
LCK-geometry, | det A | n is much more convenient.

2.2

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

Vaisman manifolds

Definition 2.2. A Vaisman manifold is an LCK manifold with ∇g -parallel
Lee form, where ∇g is the Levi-Civita connection.
The following definition is implicit in the work of Boyer & Galicki, see
[BG]:
Definition 2.3. A Sasakian manifold is an odd-dimensional contact manifold S such that its symplectic cone CS is equipped with a Kähler structure,
compatible with its symplectic structure, and the standard symplectic homothety map ρt : CS −→ CS is holomorphic.
Compact Vaisman manifolds can be described in terms of Sasakian geometry as follows.
Theorem 2.4. Let (M, I, g) be a compact Vaisman manifold. Then M
admits a conic Kähler covering (W × R+ , t2 gW + dt2 ) such that the covering
group is an infinite cyclic group, generated by the transformation (w, t) 7→
(ϕ(w), qt) for some Sasakian automorphism ϕ and q ∈ Z.
The typical example of a compact Vaisman manifold is the diagonal
Hopf manifold HA := Cn /hAi with A = diag(αi ), with |αi | < 1. An explicit
construction of the Vaisman metric on HA is given in [OV5]. Other Vaisman
metrics appear on compact complex surfaces, [Be].
Among the LCK manifolds which do not admit Vaisman metrics are
some of the Inoue surfaces (cf. [Tr], [Be]) and their generalizations to higher
dimensions ([OT]). The rank 0 Hopf surfaces are also non-Vaisman ([GO]).

2.3

LCK manifolds with potential

Definition 2.5. ([OV2]) A compact complex manifold (M, I) is LCK with
f, ω
f→
potential if it admits a Kähler cover (M
e ) with global potential ϕ : M
R+ , such that and the monodromy map τ acts on ϕ by multiplication with
a constant: τ (ϕ) = const ·ϕ.
If ϕ is proper (inverse images of compact sets are compact), then (M, I)
is called LCK with proper potential.
Remark 2.6.

version 2.0, 5.04.2017

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

L. Ornea, M. Verbitsky, V. Vuletescu

In [OV2, Proposition 2.5] (see also [OV6]) it was proven that ϕ is proper
if and only if the monodromy of the weight bundle is discrete in R+ , that
is, isomorphic to Z.
Vaisman manifolds are LCK with potential (the potential is equal to the
squared norm of the Lee field), which can be easily seen from the Sasakian
description given above ([Ve1]). LCK metrics with potential are in one to
one correspondence with strongly pseudoconvex shells in affine cones, as
shown in [OV5].
We summarize the main properties of compact LCK manifolds with potential:
Theorem 2.7.
(i) ([OV2]) The class of compact LCK manifolds with potential is stable to
small deformations.
(ii) ([OV3, Theorem 2.1]) Any LCK manifold with potential can be deformed to a Vaisman manifold. Moreover, the set of points which
correspond to Vaisman manifolds is dense in the moduli of compact
LCK manifolds with potential
(iii) ([OV2]) Any compact LCK manifold with potential can be holomorphically embedded into a Hopf manifold. Moreover, a compact Vaisman
manifold can be holomorphically embedded in a diagonal Hopf manifold.

Morse–Novikov complex and cohomology of local systems

Let M be a smooth manifold, and θ a closed 1-form on M . Denote by
dθ : Λi (M ) −→ Λi+1 (M ) the map d − θ. Since dθ = 0, d2θ = 0.
Consider the the Morse–Novikov complex, (see e.g. [P], [Ra], [Mi])

Lichnerowicz-Jacobi, or Lichnerowicz cohomology, motivated by Lichnerowicz’s work [Li] on Jacobi manifolds (see e.g. [LLMP] and [B]).

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

Obviously, the flat line bundle L can be viewed as a local system associated with the character χ : π1 (M ) −→ R>0 given by the exponential
eθ ∈ H 1 (M, R>0 ), considered as an element of R>0 -valued cohomology.
Then we have:
Proposition 2.8. (see e.g. [N]) The cohomology of the local system L
is naturally identified with the cohomology of the Morse–Novikov complex
(Λ∗ (M ), dθ ).
The following result was proven in [LLMP] and, with a different method,
in [OV1]:
Theorem 2.9. The Morse–Novikov cohomology of a compact Vaisman manifold vanishes identically.
On the other hand on one of the Inoue surfaces (which is LCK but nonVaisman) the Morse–Novikov class of ω is non–zero, see [B, Theorem 1].

Main result: the generic vanishing theorem

The main result of this paper is:
Theorem 3.2. Let M be an LCK manifold with proper potential, θ its Lee
f its Kähler Z−cover and denote by t : M
f −→ M
f the monodromy
form, M
action. Let α ∈ C be arbitrary and let Lα be the flat line bundle on M
corresponding to α·θ.
Then for any q ∈ N
H q (M, ΩpM ⊗ Lα ) = 0,
for all α ∈ C but a discrete countable subset.
Remark 3.3. For some Hopf manifolds, stronger vanishing results were
obtained by Ise [Is] and Mall [Ma]. In these cases, the set of exceptions is
made explicit.
We describe the main steps of the proof and give the details in the next
section.
Step 1: reduction to the local cohomology. One has the following

Step 2: algebraic proof of generic vanishing. At this step we use the
following result, which will be proven in section 3.3:
Theorem 3.4. For any local Noetherian C−algebra R endowed with a
Z−action given by an automorphism of local C−algebras tR and for any
R−module N endowed also with a Z action tN which is tR -equivariant, i.e.
tN (rm) = tR (r)tN (m),

for all r ∈ R, m ∈ N,

the map tM − α is a C−linear isomorphism for all α ∈ C but a countable
subset.
Step 3. Using the above commutative diagrams (3.2), (3.3), we conclude
that for each α ∈ C but a countable subset and any i, j > 0 the map

on α, the set {α ∈ C ; H i (M, ΩjM ⊗ Lα ) = 0} is analytically Zariski open,
and hence its complement is discrete since it is countable.

Godi+1 (F ) := God(Godi (F )/ Godi−1 (F )).

Since M is finitely generated, mn M/mn+1 M is finite dimensional C-vector
space for all n > 0, so Remark 3.8 applies.

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

L. Ornea, M. Verbitsky, V. Vuletescu

Unfortunately, the cohomology modules Hmi (M ) are usually not finitely
generated, so we need to elaborate further, by first reducing to the case of
regular rings, and then using local duality and the explicit description of the
injective hull of the residue field.
First, since local cohomology does not change under completion (cf
[Hun], Prop. 2.15), we may assume that both R and M are complete.
Next, we reduce to the case when R is regular.
To do this, we choose a minimal system of generators for mR , m1 , . . . , mn
and define a map
π : S = C[[X1 , . . . , Xn ]] −→ R,
by Xi 7→ mi , i = 1, n.
The action tR on R lifts to an action tS on S as follows. Choose lifts
si ∈ S of t(mi ) for all i = 1, . . . , n, and define tS (Xi ) = si . Note that tS is
well-defined as a morphism of local C-algebras by [E, Theorem 7.16].
So we can look at M as an equivariant S-module.
Also, the local cohomology is preserved, since mR = mS R and using
[Hun, Proposition 2.14 (2)], we have Hmi S (M ) ≃ Hmi R (M ).
Denote by ti the endomorphism of Hmi (M ) induced by tM and tR .
By local duality ([Hun, Theorem 4.4]) we have:
n−i
n−i
(M, R), E(k))
(M, R)∨ = HomR (ExtR
Hmi (M ) ≃ ExtR

where E(k) is the injective hull of the residue field.
For regular rings, the injective hull E(k) is described by Lyubeznik ([Ly]):
E(k) = D/mD
where D is the space of differential operators.
Notice that D has a direct sum decomposition of the form D = ⊕n>0 Dn
where Dn is the set of differential operators of order n with no lower-order
terms. Note that Dn is invariant under the map induced by tR and finitely
generated over R. So
M
E(k) =
E(k)n
n>0

where E(k)n = Dm /mDn and each E(k)n is equivariant and finitely generated R−module. This gives a decomposition as follows:
M
n−i
(M, R), E(k)n )
Hmi (M ) ≃
HomR (ExtR

n−i
(M, R), E(k)n ) is finitely generated over R
But each factor HomR (ExtR
so Lemma 3.9 applies to it. Since there are countably many factors in the
above decomposition, we see Spec(ti ) is countable.

Now Theorem 3.2 is completely proven.

3.4

Degeneration of the Dolbeault-Frölicher spectral sequence
with coefficients in a local system

The next result, interesting in itself, proves that on compact LCK manifolds
with proper potential, in the Dolbeault-Frölicher spectral sequence with
coefficients in a local system Lα ,
E1p,q := H q (M, ΩpM ⊗ Lα ) ⇒ H p+q (M, Lα (C)),
all the terms vanish at E2 level: E2p,q = 0 (where Lα (C) denotes the local
system associated to Lα ). This parallels the degeneration of this spectral
sequence at E1 level for compact Kähler manifolds (where Lα is taken to be
trivial). In particular, this gives a new proof to Theorem 2.9 and produces
new examples of compact complex manifolds that do not carry LCK metrics
with potential. One of the approaches to finding such manifolds is due to S.
Rollenske ([Ro]), who showed that on a nilmanifold, the Dolbeault-Frölicher
spectral sequence does not necessarily degenerate, and gave examples when
the n-th differential dn is non-zero, for arbitrarily high n.
Proposition 3.10. Let M be a compact LCK manifold with proper potential, α ∈ Hom(Γ, R+ ) a positive character, and Lα the corresponding line
bundle. For any p, q, consider the map
∂p.q : H p (M, ΩqM ⊗ Lα ) −→ H p (M, Ωq+1
M ⊗ Lα ).
Then ker ∂q,p+1 = im ∂q,p , for all p, q.
f is the exponential of a holomorphic
Proof: The monodromy map e

vector field X. This is proven in [OV4, Theorem 2.3] using the embedding
of M in a Hopf manifold CN \ {0})/hAi where A is linear, with all eigenvalues smaller than 1. The holomorphic vector field is then X = log A. In
particular:
e
t∗ (η) = LieX η.

Let now [η] ∈ H p (M, Ωq+1
M ⊗ Lα ). A representative η can be seen as a
f
(q + 1, p)−form on M which is ∂-closed and automorphic of weight α.

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds

Suppose η is also ∂-closed. Then, since e
t∗ (η) = α · η, we obtain
α · η = LieX (η) = diX η + iX dη,

by Cartan’s formula.
But ∂(η) = ∂η = 0 by assumption, thus iX dη = 0, and we are left with:
α · η = ∂(iX η) + ∂(iX η).
As X is holomorphic, iX η is of type (q, p), and hence ∂(iX η) is of type
(q, p + 1). On the other hand both ∂iX (η) and α · η are of type (q + 1, p),
implying ∂(iX η) = 0 and
α · η = ∂(iX η).

This yields η = ∂iX α1 η , and hence η ∈ im(∂q,p ).

Weighted Bott-Chern cohomology for LCK manifolds with potential

We now generalize [OV1, Theorem 4.7]. We have:
Proposition 4.1. Let (M, I, g) be a compact LCK manifold. Then the
following sequence is exact for all α ∈ C but a discrete countable subset:
∂ +∂

ν

p,q
θ
θ
HBC
(M, Lα ) −→ H p+q (M, Lα (C))
H∂q−1 (ΩpM ⊗ Lα )⊕ H∂p−1 (ΩqM ⊗ Lα ) −→
(4.1)
1,0
0,1
where ν is the tautological map, ∂θ = ∂ − θ and ∂ θ = ∂ − θ .

Proof: We prove that im(∂θ + ∂ θ ) = ker ν. Let η be a (p, q)-form with
values in Lα whose class vanishes in the cohomology of the local system
Lα (C). Then η = dθ β. Suppose that β has only two Hodge components,
β = β p,q−1 + β p−1,q . Then η decomposes as η = ∂ θ β p,q−1 + ∂θ β p−1,q . On the
other hand, as η is of bidegree (p, q), we have ∂θ β p,q−1 = 0 and ∂ θ β p−1,q = 0,
and hence β p,q−1 and β p−1,q produce the cohomology classes in [β p−1,q ] ∈
H∂q−1 (ΩpM ⊗ Lα ) and [β p,q−1 ] ∈ H∂p−1 (ΩqM ⊗ Lα ). Then [η]BC = ∂θ [β p−1,q ] +
∂ θ [β p,q−1 ].
It remains to reduce Proposition 4.1 to the case when β has only two
Hodge components. We may already assume that H p,q (Lα ) = 0 for all
p, q (Theorem 3.2). We use induction by the number of Hodge components. Take the outermost Hodge component of β, say, β p−d−1,q+d , with

d > 0. Then ∂ θ (β p−d−1,q+d ) = 0, hence, by vanishing of the Dolbeault
cohomology group H p−d−1,q+d (Lα ), we have β p−d−1,q+d = ∂ θ (γ), where
γ ∈ Λp−d−1,q−1+d (M, Lα ) is an Lα -valued (p − d − 1, q − 1 + d)-form. Now
if we replace β by β − dθ γ, we obtain another form β ′ such that η = dθ β ′ ,
and β ′ has a smaller number of Hodge components.
As compact LCK manifolds with potential are topologically equivalent
with Vaisman manifolds, Theorem 2.7 (ii), by Theorem 2.9 their cohomology
of the local system Lα (C) vanishes identically. Together with our main result
(Theorem 3.2), this proves the following generic vanishing of Bott-Chern
cohomology (we keep the notations in Section 3):
Corollary 4.2. Let M be an LCK manifold with proper potential, α ∈ C
p,q
and Lα the flat line bundle corresponding to α · θ. Then HBC
(M, Lα ) = 0
for all α ∈ C but a discrete countable subset.
p,q
Remark 4.3. Note that HBC
(M, Lα ) = 0 implies the dαθ dcαθ -lemma at
the level (p, q), and hence our result says that, generically, a compact LCK
manifold with proper potential satisfies the dαθ dcαθ -lemma for all (p, q).
