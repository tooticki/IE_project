Abstract
In this note, continuous transitive maps f on the interval I are re-addressed, where I
denotes one of the intervals: (−∞, ∞), (−∞, a], [b, ∞), [a, b], where a < b are real numbers.
Such maps must have a fixed point, say z, in the interior of I. Some well-known properties of
such maps are re-proved in a systematic way according to the following :
(1) f moves some point c 6= z away from z, i.e., fo some point c 6= z, we have f (c) ≤ c < z
or z < c ≤ f (c);
(2) f moves some point ĉ 6= z towards but not ”over” z, i.e., for some point ĉ 6= z, we have
ĉ < f (ĉ) < z or z < f (ĉ) < ĉ; and
(3) f moves all points x 6= z to the other side of z, i.e., for all points x 6= z, we have
x < z ≤ f (x) and f (x) ≤ x < z.
Those maps satisfying (1) are bitransitive, turbulent, and has periodic points of all periods.
Those satisfying (2) are bitransitive with some periodic points of odd periods ≥ 3, but need not
be turbulent while their second iterates are doubly turbulent. Those satisfying (3) are never
bitransitive nor turbulent, have periodic points of all even periods while their second iterates
are doubly turbulent. The proofs are arranged in such ways that they yield the same results.
For example, Theorem 3 treats maps satisfying Condition (1) or Condition (2) while Theorem
4 treats separately maps satisfying Condition (1) and, Conditions (2) or (3). Characterizations
of continuous bitransitive maps on an interval are re-addressed. A new chaotic property of
continuous bitransitive maps is also introduced (Theorem 8, p.21). In the Appendix, we
generalize Theorem 8 for continuous bitransitive maps on an interval to continuous mixing
maps (Theorem 16, p.56) and continuous weakly mixing maps (Theorem 19, p.85) on infinite
separable locally compact metric spaces without isolated points.
In this revision, we rephrase Theorems 8, 16 & 19 and correct an error in Lemma 18(2).

In this note, by an interval, we always mean a non-degenerate interval in the real line. Let I
denote an interval and let f : I → I be a continuous map. For any interval J in I, let int(J) and
J denote the interior and the closure of J respectively with respct to the topology on the real line.

For each integer n ≥ 1, let f n be defined by: f 1 = f and f n = f ◦ f n−1 when n ≥ 2. For x0
in I, we call x0 a periodic point of f with least period m or a period-m point of f if f m (x0 ) = x0
and f i (x0 ) 6= x0 when 0 < i < m. If f (x0 ) = x0 , then we call x0 a fixed point of f . We let
Of (c) = {f i (c) : i = 0, 1, 2, · · · } denote the orbit of the point c ∈ I with respect to f .
We say that f is (topologically) transitive on I if, for any two nonempty open sets U and V in
I, there exists a positive integer k such that f k (U) ∩ V 6= ∅, or, equivalently, if there exist a positive
integer k and a nonempty open set W in U such that f k (W ) ⊂ V . We say that f is bitransitive on
I if f 2 is transitive on I.
When f is a continuous transitive map defined on the interval I, the transitivity of f is also
equivalent to the existence of a point whose orbit is dense in I. Indeed, if f has a dense orbit in
I then it is clear that f is transitive. Conversely, suppose f is transitive and let V1 , V2 , · · · be an
enumeration of all open intervals in I with rational endpoints. Let a < b be any two points in the
interior of I and let U = (a, b). So, the closure U = [a, b] is a compact interval in the interior of I.
Since f is transitive, there exist a positive integer n1 and an open interval W1 whose length |W1 | is
< 1/2 such that W1 ⊂ U and f n1 (W1 ) ⊂ V1 . Similarly, there exist a positive integer n2 (> n1 ) and
an open interval W2 with length |W2 | < 1/22 such that W2 ⊂ W1 and f n2 (W2 ) ⊂ V2 . Inductively,
we obtain positive integers n1 < n2 < n3 < · · · and open intervals Wi with length |Wi | < 1/2i , i ≥ 1
such that U ⊃ W1 ⊃ W1 ⊃ W2 ⊃ W2 ⊃ W3 ⊃ W3 ⊃ · · · and f ni (Wi ) ⊂ Vi , i ≥ 1. Now since
<
T Wi >i≥1 is a nested sequence of nonempty compact intervals whoseTlengths tend to zero, the set
i≥1 Wi is nonempty and consists of exactly one point which lies in
i≥1 Wi (⊂ U). It is obvious
that this point is a transitive point of f , i.e., it has a dense orbit in I.
Let J be a compact interval in I. If there are two compact intervals J0 and J1 in J with at most
one point in common such that f (J0 ) ∩ f (J1 ) ⊃ J0 ∪ J1 , then we say that f is turbulent on J and on
I [8]. If there are two compact intervals I0 and I1 in I with at most one point in common such that
f is turbulent on I0 and on I1 , then we say that f is doubly turbulent on I. It is well-known that
if f is a continuous transitive map on a compact interval then f has dense periodic points [8, 27],

has periodic points of all even periods [20] and f 2 is turbulent Corollary VI.4 of [8], see also [15] .
On the other hand, continuous transitive
 maps and continuous maps with dense periodic points
are characterized in [4, 5] see also [9] by using the notion of snakelike continua introduced in
[7]. From this characterization of continuous maps with dense periodic points [4], we can see that
nontrivial continuous maps with dense periodic points are closely related to transitive maps. In this
note, we shall re-prove these results with standard arguments (without
resorting to the celebrated

Sharkovsky’s theorem
[26] or the notion of snakelike continua which are more accessible to the

readers cf. [25] .

We first note that each continuous transitive map f on the interval I must have a fixed point z
in the interior of I. So, f satisfies exactly one of the following 3 mutually exclusive conditions:

(1) f moves some point c 6= z away from z, i.e., fo some point c 6= z, we have f (c) ≤ c < z or
z < c ≤ f (c);
(2) f moves some point ĉ 6= z towards but not ”over” z, i.e., for some point ĉ 6= z, we have
ĉ < f (ĉ) < z or z < f (ĉ) < ĉ; and
2

(3) f moves all points x 6= z to the other side of z, i.e., for all points x 6= z, we have x < z ≤ f (x)
and f (x) ≤ x < z.
Since different conditions sometimes produce same results, for the sake of clarity, those conditions which will yield the same results are treated simultaneously. For example, Theorem 1
treats separately maps satisfying Condition (1) and, Conditions (2) or (3) while Theorem 4 treats
separately maps satisfying Conditions (1) or (2) and, Condition (3).
Theorem 1. Let I denote one of the following intervals: (a, b), (a, b], [a, b), [a, b], (−∞, b), (−∞, b],
(a, ∞), [a, ∞) and (−∞, ∞), where a < b are real numbers, and let f be a continuous transitive
map on I. Then exactly one of the following statements hold:

(1) If there exist a fixed point z of f and a point c 6= z in I such that f (c) − z /(c − z) ≥ 1, then
f is turbulent (and so f 2 is doubly turbulent) and has periodic points of all periods.

(2) If f has a unique fixed point z (which lies in the interior of I) and f (x) − x /(z − x) > 0
(i.e., both f (x) and z lie on the same side of x) for all x 6= z in I, then f 2 is doubly turbulent
and f has periodic points of all even periods.
Consequently, if f is a continuous transitive map on I, then f has periodic points of all even periods
and f 2 is doubly turbulent on I.
Proof. For the proof of (1), assume that there exist a fixed point z of f and a point c in I such that
f (c) ≤ c < z if z < c ≤ f (c), the proof is similar . If f (c) = c, then, since f is not constant on
[c, z], there exists a point c∗ in (c, z) such that f (c∗ ) 6= c∗ and so, either f (c) = c < c∗ < f (c∗ ) or
f (c∗ ) < c∗ < z. Without loss of generality, we may assume that f (c) < c < z and assume that there
is no fixed points of f in [c, z) and so, f (x) < x for all c ≤ x < z. We have two cases to consider:

	
Case 1. The point d = max x ∈ I : x ≤ c and f (x) = z exists (if I is a compact interval, then
this case must hold). In this case,
if f (x) > d for all d ≤ x ≤ z,




then f [d, z] ⊂ (d, z] ( [d, z] and so, f f ([d, z]) ⊂ f [d, z] . Thus, f [d, z] is a proper invariant
compact interval of f in [d.z] (⊂ I) which contradicts the transitivity of f . This implies that there
is a point b in (d, z) such that

	
f (b) = min f (x) : d ≤ x ≤ z ≤ d.
Consequently,



f [d, b] ∩ f [b, z] ⊃ [d, z] = [d, b] ∪ [b, z].

Therefore, f is turbulent on [d, z] and clearly f 2 is doubly turbulent on I.
On the other hand,
suppose, for some integer k ≥ 1, there is a point
qk in [d, b] such that f k (qk ) =


qk . Then f k [d, qk ] ⊃ [qk , z] ⊃ [b, z]. So, f k+1 [d, qk ] ⊃ f [b, z] ⊃ [d, z] ⊃ [d, qk ]. Consequently,
3


there is a point qk+1 such that d < qk+1 < qk and f k+1 (qk+1 ) = qk+1 . Since f [d, b] ⊃ [d, z] ⊃ [d, b],
there is a fixed point of f in [d, b]. It follows from the above that, for each m ≥ 1, the point

	
pm = min d ≤ x ≤ b : f m (x) = x

is a period-m point of f in [d, b] ⊂ [d, z] and d < · · · < p3 < p2 < p1 < b < z.

Case 2. f (x) < z for all x in I ∩ (−∞, c). In this case, since we already have f (x) < x for all
c ≤ x < z, we actually have f (x) < z for all x in I ∩ (−∞, z). Consequently, f I ∩ (−∞, z] ⊂
I ∩ (−∞, z]. Since f is transitive on I, we have I ∩ (−∞, z] = I.
If I ∩ (−∞, c] were compact, then I is bounded
 below. Let w be a point in (c, z) such that
w > f (x) for all x in [min I, c]. Then, f [min I, w] ⊂ [min I, w) ( [min I, w] and so, f [min I, w]
is a proper invariant compact interval of f in [min I, w] (⊂ I) which contradicts the transitivity of
f . So, in this case, I ∩ (−∞, c] cannot be compact. Therefore, we have shown that
if f (x) < z for all x ∈ I ∩ (−∞, c], then I = (−∞, z] or I = (a, z] for some point a < z.

The following proof works for I = (−∞, z] and for I = (a, z] for some point a < z.

Since f (c) < c < z, if f (x) < x for all x in I ∩ (−∞, c], then f I ∩ (−∞, c] ⊂ I ∩ (−∞, c] which
contradicts the transitivity of f on I. So, (z >) f (c′) ≥ c′ for some c′ in I ∩ (−∞, c).
If (z >) f (x) > x on I ∩ (−∞, c′ ], let δ be a point in I ∩ (−∞, c′ ) such that

	
δ < min f (x) : c′ ≤ x ≤ z .

Then, since δ < f (x) < z on [c′ , z) and f (x) > x on [δ, c′ ], we have

δ < f (x) ≤ z for all δ ≤ x ≤ z.


This implies that f [δ, z] ⊂ (δ, z] ( [δ, z] and so, f [δ, z] is a proper invariant compact interval of
f in I which contradicts the transitivity of f on I. Consequently, there is a point ĉ1 in I such that
f (ĉ1 ) < ĉ1 < c′ < z. Let

	
ẑ1 = min ĉ1 ≤ x ≤ c′ : f (x) = x .

If f (x) ≤ ẑ1 for all x ∈ I ∩ (−∞, ẑ1 ], then I ∩ (−∞, ẑ1 ] is a proper invariant interval of f in I
which contradicts the transitivity of f on I. So, there is a point t̂1 < ĉ1 such that f (t̂1 ) > ẑ1 .
Consequently, the point

	
dˆ1 = max t̂1 ≤ x ≤ ĉ1 : f (x) = ẑ1

exists. If f (x) > dˆ1 for all dˆ1 ≤ x ≤ ẑ1 , then f [dˆ1 , ẑ1 ] ⊂ (dˆ1 , ẑ1 ] ( [dˆ1 , ẑ1 ] which contradicts the
transitivity of f on I.

	
Therefore, min f (x) : dˆ1 ≤ x ≤ ẑ1 ≤ d1 which implies that f is turbulent on [dˆ1 , ẑ1 ] and, by
arguing as those in Case 1, has periodic points of all periods in [dˆ1 , ẑ1 ].
We note in passing that, in this case, by repeating the above arguments indefinitely, we actually
have sequences of points
· · · < t̂k < dˆk < ĉk < ẑk < · · · < t̂2 < dˆ2 < ĉ2 < ẑ2 < · · · < t̂1 < dˆ1 < ĉ1 < ẑ1 < c < z
4

such that, for each k ≥ 1,
ẑk < f (t̂k ) < z, f (dˆk ) = f (ẑk ) = ẑk , f (ĉk ) < ĉk < ẑk
and, f is turbulent on [dˆk , ẑk ] and has periodic points of all periods in [dˆk , ẑk ].
By combining the above Case 1 and Case 2, we confirm (1).

Let ŭ be a point in I ∩ (−∞, z) with dense orbit in I and let β̆ be a point in I such that

	
β̆ = max f (x) : ŭ ≤ x ≤ z .

On the interval I ∩ (z, ∞), we can do and argue similarly to obtain similar results .


If β̆ ≤ z, then f [ŭ, z] ⊂ (ŭ, z] ( [ŭ, z] and f [ŭ, z] is a proper compact invariant interval of f

	
in [ŭ, z] which contradicts the transitivity of f on I. So, β̆ > z. If min f (x) : z ≤ x ≤ β̆ > ŭ,


then by (*), f [ŭ, β̆] ⊂ (ŭ, β̆] ( [ŭ, β̆]. Consequently, f [ŭ, β̆] is a proper invariant compact
interval
 of f in [ŭ, β̆] (⊂
	 I). This, again, contradicts the transitivity of f on I. Therefore, we have
min f (x) : z ≤ x ≤ β̆ ≤ ŭ.
Let v̆ be a point in [ŭ, z) such that f (v̆) ∈ (z, β̆] and f 2 (v̆) = ŭ < v̆. Let

	
z̆ = min v̆ ≤ x ≤ z : f 2 (x) = x .

Then, since f (v̆) > z and f (z) = z, we have f (x) > z for all v̆ ≤ x ≤ z̆ and, since f 2 (v̆) < v̆ < z̆ ≤ z,
we have f 2 (x) < x < z̆ ≤ z. This implies that
f 2 (x) < x < z̆ ≤ z < f (x) for all v̆ ≤ x < z̆.
In particular, ŭ = f 2 (v̆) < v̆ < z̆ ≤ z < f (v̆). We have two cases to consider:

	
Case I. The point d˘ = max x ∈ I ∩ (−∞, v̆] : f 2 (x) = z̆ exists which, combined with the fact
that f 2 (x) < x < z̆ ≤ z < f (x) for all v̆ ≤ x < z̆, implies that
f 2 (x) < x < z̆ ≤ z < f (x) for all d˘ < x < z̆.
If d˘ < f 2 (x) ≤ z̆ for all d˘ ≤ x ≤ z̆, then, since f (x) > z ≥ z̆ for all d˘ ≤ x < z̆, we have


the set I ∩ (−∞, z̆] ∪ f I ∩ (−∞, z̆] is a union of two intervals
which is invariant under f . Since

f is transitive on I, we have I ∩ (−∞, z̆] ∪ f I ∩ (−∞, z̆] = I and so, by (**), we must have
z̆ = z and f 2 (x) < z < f (x) for all x in I ∩ (−∞, z).

If I ∩ (−∞, v̆] were compact, then I is bounded below. Let w̆ be a point in (v̆, z) such that

compact. Therefore, we have shown that
if f 2 (x) < z̆ = z for all x ∈ I ∩ (−∞, v̆], then I = (−∞, ∞) or

By arguing as those in Case 2 of the proof of (1) above, we obtain sequences of points

z > f 2 (t̆k ) > z̆k , f 2 (d˘k ) = f 2 (z̆k ) = z̆k , f 2 (v̆k ) < v̆k < z̆k ,
f 2 is turbulent on [d˘k , z̆k ] and, by arguing as those in Case I above, f has periodic points of all even
periods in [d˘k , z̆k ] ∪ f [d˘k , z̆k ] .

Finally, similar arguments as those on the interval I ∩ (−∞, z] show that f 2 is turbulent on
I ∩ [z, ∞) and so f 2 is doubly turbulent on I.
By combining the above Case I and Case II, we establish (2).

We need two preliminary results.
Lemma 2. Let I denote one of the following intervals: (a, b), (a, b], [a, b), [a, b], (−∞, b), (−∞, b],
(a, ∞), [a, ∞) and (−∞, ∞), where a < b are real numbers. Let f be a continuous transitive map

on I and let z be a fixed point of f in the interior of I. If there exists aSpoint c 6= z in I such
that f (c) − z /(c − z) > 0, then, for every open interval V in I, we have i≥0 f i (V ) ⊃ int(I). In
particular, there is an integer j ≥ 0 such that z ∈ f j (V ).

Proof. Let V be an open interval in I. Let G be the maximal connected set in i≥0 f i (V ) which

Since z is a fixed point of f which lies in the interior of I, we have, for some integer 0 ≤ j < m,
either z ∈ f j (G) or z is an endpoint of f j (G).
In either case, there exists a sequence < xn >n≥1 of points in G such that limn→∞ f j (xn ) = z.
Consequently, limn→∞ f m (xn ) = z. Since f m (G) ⊂ G, we obtain that
either z ∈ G or z is an endpoint of G.

Since c is a point such that f (c) − z /(c − z) > 0, without loss of generality, we may assume
that c lies in 
the interior

such that z < c < f ℓ (u). Then f ℓ (G) ⊃ z, f ℓ (u) ⊃ (z, c]. Since z is a fixed point of f and

Consequently, f (G) ⊂ G. Since f is transitive

Lemma 3. Let I denote one of the following intervals: (a, b), (a, b], [a, b), [a, b], (−∞, b), (−∞, b],
(a, ∞), [a, ∞) and (−∞, ∞), where a < b are real numbers, and let f be a continuous map on I.
Let J be an interval in I which contains a fixed point z of f and a periodic point q of f with least
period m ≥ 3. Then at least one of the following holds:
(1) f n (J) ⊃ Of (q) for all n ≥ 2m − 2;

(2) m is even, the sets Of 2 (q) and f Of 2 (q) lie on opposites sides of z and f 2n (J) ⊃ Of 2 (q) for
all n ≥ m/2 − 1.
8

Consequently, if J contains a fixed point of f and f s (J) ⊂ J for some positive integer s, then
f 2 (P ∩ J) ⊂ J, where P is the set of all periodic points of f in I.
Remark 1. In the above lemma, if we only require J to contain at least two points of a period-m
orbit of f , then the conclusion need not hold. For example, let f : [1, 9] → [1, 9] be the continuous
map defined by putting


−2x + 19 for 8 ≤ x ≤ 9
and let J = [1, 3]. Then it is easy
 to see that the set{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} forms a period-9 orbit of
f and f [1, 3] = [4, 6], f [4, 6] = [7, 9] and f [7, 9] = [1, 3]. Therefore, the conclusion of Lemma
3 does not hold.

Proof. Let a and b be two adjacent points in the orbit Of (q) such that f (b) ≤ a < b ≤ f (a) and let i
and j be integers in [0, m − 1] such that f i (q) = a and f j (q) = b. If, for some integer 0 ≤ k ≤ m − 1,
both f k (q) and f k+1(q) lie on the same side of z, then we have four cases to consider:
(i) f i (q) = a < b < z; (ii) f k (q) < a < z < b; (iii) a < z < b < f k (q); and (iv) z < a < b = f j (q).
In Case (i), we have f i (J) ⊃ [a, b]. In Case (iv), we have f j (J) ⊃ [a, b]. In Cases (ii) & (iii), since

[a, b] ⊃ Of (q),
n
we have f (J) ⊃ Of (q) for all n ≥ 2m − 2.
On the other hand, if, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1, f i (q) and f i+1 (q) lie on opposite sides of z,
then m is even. Let 0 ≤ r ≤ m − 1 be the even integer such that f r (q) is the farthest point
from z among those points of Of (q)	which lie on the same side of z as q. Then f r+2j (J) ⊃

f 2 (q), f 4 (q), · · · , f m−2 (q), f m (q) = q for all integers j ≥ 0. Therefore, f 2n (J) ⊃ Of 2 (q) for all
n ≥ (m/2) − 1.

Now we use Lemmas 2 & 3 to prove the following result of Barge and Martin [4, 6] which implies
that if f is transitive then f has dense periodic points [8, 27].
Theorem 4. Let I denote one of the following intervals: (a, b), (a, b], [a, b), [a, b], (−∞, b), (−∞, b],
(a, ∞), [a, ∞) and (−∞, ∞), where a < b are real numbers, and let f be a continuous transitive
map on I, or, equivalently, assume that there is a point u in I whose orbit Of (u) is dense in I.
Then exactly one of the following holds:

(1) If, for some fixed point z of f and some point c 6= z, we have f (c) − z /(c − z) > 0, then,
for any compact interval K in I and any compact interval L in the interior of I, there exists
a positive integer N such that f n (K) ⊃ L for all n ≥ N.

(2) There exists a unique fixed point z of f in the interior of I such that f (x)−z /(x−z) ≤ 0 for
all x 6= z in I and, on each of the intervals I ∩ (−∞, z] and I ∩ [z, ∞), f 2 is transitive and has
9

at least
 two fixed points. Consequently, in this case i.e., f is transitive but not bitransitive
on I , I must be a compact interval or an open interval in the real line.

Consequently, if f is transitive on I, then f has dense periodic points in I.

Remark 2. For every integer n ≥ 2, let fn (x) be the classical continuous transitive map [5, 8]
from [1, 2n + 1] onto itself defined by putting fn (1) = n + 1; fn (i) = 2n + 3 − i for 2 ≤ i ≤ n + 1;
fn (j) = 2n + 2 − j for n + 2 ≤ j ≤ 2n + 1; and by linearity on each interval [k, k + 1], 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n
which has exactly one period-(2n + 1) orbit but no period-(2n − 1) orbits. Note that each fn is also
bitransitive, but none is turbulent.

	

	
Proof. Suppose there is no point c 6= z such that z < min c, f (c) or max c, f (c) < z. Then


f I ∩ (−∞, z] ⊂ I ∩ [z, ∞) and f I ∩ [z, ∞) ⊂ I ∩ (−∞, z].
So,



f 2 I ∩ (−∞, z] ⊂ I ∩ (−∞, z] and f 2 I ∩ [z, ∞) ⊂ I ∩ [z, ∞).

Consequently, since f has a dense orbit in I, f 2 has a dense orbit in I ∩ (−∞, z] and in I ∩ [z, ∞).
Since f 2 has a dense orbit in I ∩ (−∞, z] I ∩ [z, ∞) respectively , it has a fixed point ẑ in the
interior of I ∩ (−∞, z) I ∩ [z, ∞) respectively . So, we are back to (1) with f 2 replacing f and ẑ
replacing c. Therefore, it suffices to prove just (1).

	
Now we prove (1). Let z be a fixed point of f and let c be a point such that z < min c, f (c)
or max{c, f (c)} < z. If z is not an interior point of I, then since f is transitive, f must have a fixed
point z ∗in the 	interior of I. In this case, we consider z ∗ < z or z < z ∗ instead of z < min{c, f (c)}
or max c, f (c) < z. So, we may assume that z is a fixed point of f in the interior of I. We may
also assume that c is a point in the interior of I.
Let K be a compact subinterval of I and let L be a compact subinterval of int(I). By considering
a subinterval of int(K) if necessary, we may assume that
K lies in the interior of I and does not contain a fixed point of f.
By Lemma 2, there is a point v in the interior of K and a positive integer n1 such that f n1 (v) = z.
Since int(K) contains a point u with dense orbit, ther exist positive integers
(n1 <) n2 < n3 < n4

n2
n2 +1
n2
such that the point f (u) is so close to the point c that f
(u) − z / f (u) − z > 0, i.e, both
the points f n2 (u) and f n2 +1 (u) lie on the same side of z, and

	

	
f n3 (u) < min min K, min L, z < max max K, max L, z < f n4 (u).
	

	

n3
(K) ⊃ f n3 (u), z . If z < min K, then f n4 (K) ⊃ f n4 (u), z . In either
If max K < z, thenf 	
case, f i (K) ⊃ K ∪ z for i = n3 or n4 depending on the relative locations of K with respect to
z. In particular, since f i (K) ⊃ K, K contains a periodic point of f . Since K is arbitrary in I, we
have actually shown that the periodic points of f are dense in I.
Therefore, we can choose a period-j point q of f in K which is so close to the point u that
f n2 +1 (q) − z
> 0, i.e., both points f n2 +1 (q) and f n2 (q) lie on the same side of z, and
f n2 (q) − z
10


	

	
f n3 (u) ≈ f n3 (q) < min min K, min L, z < max max K, max L, z < f n4 (q) ≈ f n4 (u).

Consequently, since the compact interval f n2 (K) contains the period-j point f n2 (q) and the
fixed point z of f (since v ∈ K, n1 < n2 and f n1 (v) = z), and f n2 (q) and f n2 +1 (q) lie on the same
side of z, it follows from Lemma 3 that
f n (K) ⊃ Of (q) for all n ≥ n2 + 2j − 2.

Since f Of (q) ⊃ Of (q) and

min Of (q) ≤ f n3 (q) < min L < max L < f n4 (q) ≤ max Of (q),

we obtain that
f n (K) ⊃ L for all n ≥ n2 + 2j − 2.

To characterize continuous transitive maps in terms of dense periodic points, we shall need the
following result. For simplicity, in the following result, we shall assume that I denotes one of the
intervals: (−∞, ∞), (−∞, b], [a, ∞), [a, b], where a < b are real numbers. So, we do not need to
use relative topology.
Lemma 5. Let I denote one of the intervals: (−∞, ∞), (−∞, b], [a, ∞), [a, b], where a < b are real
numbers. Assume that f is a continuous map on I whose periodic points are dense in I. Let K be
a proper closed subinterval of I such that f s (K) ⊂ K for some positive integer s. Then f 2 (K) = K
and f 2 (L) = L for each (of the at most two) component L of I \ K.
Proof. Let P denote the set of all periodic points of f in I. Let p be a period-i point of f
in K. Then, since f s (K) ⊂ K, p = (f i )s (p) = (f s )i−1 f s (p) ∈ f s (P ∩ K). This shows that
P ∩ K ⊂ f s (P ∩ K) ⊂ P ∩ f s (K) ⊂ P ∩ K. Therefore,
P ∩ f s (K) = f s (P ∩ K) = P ∩ K.
On the other hand, let q be a period-j point of f in I.
If f s (q) ∈ K, then

q = (f j )s (q) = (f s )j−1 f s (q) ∈ (f s )j−1 (K) ⊂ K since f s (K) ⊂ K.

That is, if q is a periodic point of f in I such that f s (q) ∈ K, then q must be a periodic point of f
in K. So, f s P ∩ (I \ K) ⊂ P ∩ (I \ K). Consequently, if q ∈ P ∩ (I \ K), then



q = (f j )s (q) = (f s )j−1 f s (q) ∈ (f s )j−1 P ∩ (I \ K) ⊂ f s P ∩ (I \ K) .
This, combined with the above, implies that


f s (P ∩ K) = P ∩ K and f s P ∩ (I \ K) = P ∩ (I \ K).
11

(⋆)

In particular, the map f s (x) takes those periodic points of f in K into K and those in I \ K into
I \ K. Since the periodic points of f are dense in I, this implies that
if c is a common boundary point of K and I \ K, then so is the point f s (c).
Now we have two cases to consider:
Case 1. I \ K is an interval. In this case, K and I \ K has a unique common boundary point
d. Consequently, f s (d) = d. In particular, d is also a perodic point of f . Since I denotes one of the
intervals: (−∞, ∞), (−∞, b], [a, ∞), [a, b], where a < b are real numbers, the closure I \ K is also
a closed interval in I.
If there is a point v in I \ K such that f s (v) lies in the interior of K, then, since the periodic
points of f are dense in I, there exists a periodic point
q of f in I \ K such that f s (q) ∈ int(K).

This contradicts, by (⋆), the fact that f s P ∩ (I \ K) = P ∩ (I \ K). Therefore, we obtain that

f s (K) ⊂ K (by assumption) and f s I \ K ⊂ I \ K.

Since both K and I \ K are closed subintervals of I which are invariant under f s (x), without loss
of generality, we may assume that K contains a fixed point of f . By Lemma 3, we obtain that
f 2 (P ∩ K) ⊂ K.
Since f 2 (x) is continuous and the periodic points of f are dense in K, we obtain that
f 2 (K) ⊂ K.
By arguing as those in the beginning of the proof with s replaced by 2, we obtain that


f 2 (K) ⊂ K and f 2 I \ K ⊂ I \ K and f 2 (d) = f 2 K ∩ (I \ K) ⊂ K ∩ (I \ K) = {d}.

This implies that

f 2 (K) = K and f 2 (I \ K) = I \ K
as long as I \ K is an interval.
Case 2. I \ K consists of exactly two intervals which lie on the opposite sides of K. In this case,
K = [a, b] is a compact interval in the interior of I. Then


I \ K = I ∩ (−∞, a) ∪ I ∩ (b, ∞)

	
and so, both a and b are common boundary points of K and I \ K. Thus, f s (a), f s (b) ⊂ {a, b}
and two cases arise:
(A). Suppose f s (a) = a. Then by (⋆), we have


f s P ∩ (I ∩ (−∞, a]) = f s P ∩ (I ∩ (−∞, a)) ∪ {f s (a)}
 
	
  	
 	
⊂ f s P ∩ (I \ K) ∪ f s (a) = P ∩ (I \ K) ∪ a ⊂ (I \ K) ∪ a ,
12


Since f s is continuous
f s I ∩ (−∞, a]
 s 	and the periodic points of f are dense in I, we obtain that
⊂ (I \ K) ∪ f (a) is a connected
interval which contains the point a = f s (a) and is disjoint

from the interior of K = [a, b] . Consequently,

f s I ∩ (−∞, a] ⊂ I ∩ (−∞, a].


Since I \ I ∩ (−∞, a] = I ∩ (a, ∞) is an interval, it follows from Case 1 with K replaced by the
closed subinterval I ∩ (−∞, a] of I that


f 2 (a) = a, f 2 I ∩ (−∞, a] = I ∩ (−∞, a] and f 2 I ∩ [a, ∞) = I ∩ [a, ∞).

On the other hand, I ∩ (−∞, a] ∪ K = I ∩ (−∞, b] is a closed subinterval of I such that




f s I ∩(−∞, b] = f s I ∩(−∞, a]∪K ⊂ f s I ∩(−∞, a] ∪f s (K) ⊂ I ∩(−∞, a] ∪K = I ∩(−∞, b]

and I \ I ∩ (−∞, b] = I ∩ (b, ∞) is an interval.

It follows from Case 1 with K replaced by I ∩ (−∞, b] that


f 2 (b) = b, f 2 I ∩ (−∞, b] = I ∩ (−∞, b] and f 2 I ∩ [b, ∞) = I ∩ [b, ∞).





Consequently, f 2 (K) = f 2 [a, b] ⊂ f 2 I ∩(−∞, b] ∩f 2 I ∩[a, ∞) = I ∩(−∞, b] ∩ I ∩[a, ∞) =
K. Since f 2 (a) = a and f 2 (b) = b, we obtain that f 2 (K) = f 2 [a, b] = [a, b] = K. This, together
with the above, shows that


f 2 (K) = K, f 2 I ∩ (−∞, a] = I ∩ (−∞, a], and f 2 I ∩ [b, ∞) = I ∩ [b, ∞).
(B). Suppose f s (a) = b. Then, by (⋆),


f s P ∩ (I ∩ (−∞, a))
⊂ f s (P ∩ (I \ K)) = P ∩ (I \ K) ⊂ I \ K.



Similar arguments as those in (A) imply that f s I ∩ (−∞, a] ⊂ I \ K = I ∩ (−∞, a] ∪
I ∩ [b, ∞)  is a connected interval which contains the point b and is disjoint from the interior of
K = [a, b] . Therefore, we obtain that

f s I ∩ (−∞, a] ⊂ I ∩ [b, ∞).
If f s (b) = b, then similar arguments imply that


f s I ∩ [b, ∞) ⊂ I ∩ [b, ∞)

which, combined with the above, implies that



f s (I \ K) = f s P ∩ (I ∩ (−∞, a)) ∪ f s I ∩ (b, ∞) ⊂ I ∩ [b, ∞).

Consequently, it follows from (⋆) that


P ∩ I ∩ (−∞, a) ⊂ P ∩ (I \ K) = f s P ∩ (I \ K) ⊂ f s (I \ K) ⊂ I ∩ [b, ∞)
13

which is a contradiction.
So, if f s (a) = b, then f s (b) = a and similar arguments as those in the beginning of the proof of
(B) show that


f s I ∩ (−∞, a] ⊂ I ∩ [b, ∞) and f s I ∩ [b, ∞) ⊂ I ∩ (−∞, a].
Therefore, we have f 2s (a) = a and f 2s (b) = b and


f 2s I ∩ (−∞, a] ⊂ I ∩ (−∞, a], f 2s I ∩ [b, ∞) ⊂ I ∩ [b, ∞) and f 2s (K) ⊂ K.


By similar arguments as those in Part (A) above, we obtain that f 2 (K) = K, f 2 I ∩ (−∞, a] =
I ∩ (−∞, a] and f 2 I ∩ [b, ∞) = I ∩ [b, ∞).

In the following characterizations of bitransitive maps (see also [12]), statements (2), (3), (8)
are taken from [4]. Statements (9) and (10) are from [6]. Statements (4) and (5) in terms of dense
periodic points are derived from [5]. Statements (6) and (7) are well-known. For simplicity, in the
following result, we shall assume that I denotes one of the intervals: (−∞, ∞), (−∞, b], [a, ∞),
[a, b], where a < b are real numbers. So, we do not need to use relative topology.
Theorem 6. Let I denote one of the intervals: (−∞, ∞), (−∞, b], [a, ∞), [a, b], where a < b are
real numbers and let f : I → I be a continuous map. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(1) f is transitive
on
exist

	 I and there

	 a fixed point z of f and a point c 6= z such that either
z < min c, f (c) or max c, f (c) < z, i.e., both points c and f (c) lie on the same side of z.

(2) For any compact subinterval K of I and any compact subinterval L of int(I), there exists
a positive integer M such that f n (K) ⊃ L for all n ≥ M. Consequently, for any positive
integer m, any compact intervals Ki , 1 ≤ i ≤ m, and any intervals Vi , 1 ≤ i ≤ m, in I, by
taking, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, a compact interval Li in the interior of Vi , we obtain that there
exists a positive integer Nm such that f n (Ki ) ⊃ Li for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m and each n ≥ Nm , and
∗
so, there exist compact intervals Kn,i
in Ki , 1 ≤ i ≤ m, which satisfy that
∗
) ⊂ Li ⊂ Vi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m and all n ≥ Nm .
f n (Kn,i

(We phrase it this way for later use in the proof of Theorem 8 below. Note that since we only
∗
∗
require the set f n (Kn,i
) to be contained in Vi , we can choose the compact interval Kn,i
as small

as we wish .

(3) For any open interval U in I, there exists a positive integer m(U) such that f has a period-n
point in U for each integer n ≥ m(U) and f has no proper invariant closed intervals in I.
(4) For some infinite set N of positive integers which contains an odd integer ≥ 3, the periodic
points of f with periods n ∈ N are dense in I and f has no proper invariant closed intervals
in I.
(5) The set of periodic points of f is dense and f 2 has no proper invariant closed interval in I.
14

(6) f is (topologically) mixing, i.e., for any two non-empty open subsets U and V of I, there exists
a positive integer m(U, V ) such that f n (U) ∩ V 6= ∅ for all n ≥ m(U, V ).



(7) f is (topologically) weakly mixing, i.e., the map f ×f defined by f ×f (x, y) = f (x), f (y)
is transitive on I × I.
(8) For any infinite subset M of the positive integers, there is a residual
 set S i.e., a set containing the intersection of countably
 n infinitely many
	 open dense sets in I such that S is dense in
I and if x ∈ S then the set f (x) : n ∈ M is dense in I.

(9) f 2k is transitive on I for some positive integer k.

(10) f is totally transitive, i.e., f k is transitive on I for each integer k ≥ 1.
Proof. The implication (1) ⇒ (2) follows from Theorem 4(1) and the implication (3) ⇒ (4) is clear.
(2) ⇒ (3). Suppose U is an open interval in I whose closure is contained in the interior of I. It
is clear that there exist two disjoint compact intervals K and L in U such that
f (K) ∩ (K ∪ L) = ∅.
By (2), there is a positive integer N0 such that f n (K) ∩ f n (L) ⊃ K ∪ L for all n ≥ N0 . Let
N = mn1 1 mn2 2 · · · mnk k (> N0 ),
where {m1 , m2 , · · · , mk } is the set of all prime numbers ≤ N0 and each ni , 1 ≤ i ≤ k, is a fixed
positive integer such that mni i > N0 . Let m be any integer ≥ N > N0 .
If m has a prime factor s > N0 , then since f s (K) ∩ f s (L) ⊃ K ∪ L, by considering, with
respect to the map f s , the cycle K (m/s)−1 LK of length m/s, we obtain a period-(m/s) point w of
f s in K whose
orbit O
 f s (w) is contained in K ∪ L. Since f (K) ∩ (K ∪ L) = ∅, the orbit
 whole
	
Of (w) ⊃ f (w) ∪ Of s (w) contains at least 1 + (m/s) points. So, w is a period-m point of f in
K ⊂ U.

If all prime factors of m are ≤ N0 , write m = m1 1 m2 2 · · · mk k , with each n′i ≥ 0 and n′j > nj for
n
some 1 ≤ j ≤ k. Let ℓ = mj j . Then ℓ > N0 and so f ℓ (K) ∩ f ℓ (L) ⊃ K ∪ L. Consequently, f ℓ has a
periodic point of least period m/ℓ in K ⊂ U which turns out to be a period-m point of f . On the
other hand, (2) implies trivially that f has no proper invariant closed interval in I.
(4) ⇒ (5). Suppose f 2 had a proper invariant closed subinterval L of I. By Lemma 5, we may
assume that L contains
a fixed point z of f . Thus, L ∩ f (L) is an interval or consists of one point.

Since f L ∩ f (L) ⊂ L ∩ f (L), we have f L ∩ f (L) ⊂ L ∩ f (L). It follows from assumption that
L ∩ f (L) = {z}. Since we also have f f (L) ⊂ L, f can only have periodic points of even periods
(except fixed points) in L. This contradicts the assumption. Therefore, f 2 has no proper invariant
closed intervals in I.
(5) ⇒ (2), (6). Let U and V be nonempty open intervals in I and let K and L be compact
intervals in U and V respectively. Let p be a periodic point of f in K. Let q be a periodic point of
15

f in I with q1 = min Of (q), q2 = max Of (q) and [q1 , q2 ] ⊂ int(I). Let m be a fixed positive integer
such that f m (p) = p and f m (q) = q. Let
W =

∞
[

(f m )k (K).

k=0

Then since f m (p) = p ∈ K, W is an interval and f m (W ) ⊂ W . So, f m (W ) ⊂ W . By Lemma 5,
f 2 (W ) = W . By assumption, W = I. Since W is an interval, W ⊃ int(W ) = int(I) ⊃ [q1 , q2 ].
Therefore, there exist two positive integers i and j such that q1 ∈ (f m )i (K) and q2 ∈ (f m )j (K) and,
since f m (q1 ) =q1 and f m (q2 ) = q2 , we have q1 ∈ f ijm(K) and q2 ∈ f ijm (K) and so Of (q) ⊂ f ijm (K).
Since f Of (q) = Of (q), we have
Of (q) ⊂ f n (K), and so, [q1 , q2 ] ⊂ f n (K) for all n ≥ ijm.

Consequently,
if we choose q to be a periodic point of f such that Of (q) ⊂ int(L),
then we easily obtain that (6) holds, i.e., f is topologically mixing on I. On the other hand,
if we choose q and q̂ to be periodic points of f with
q < min L < max L < q̂ and Of (q) ∪ Of (q̂) ⊂ f k (K) for some k ≥ ijm.
then we obtain that f n (K) ⊃ L for all sufficiently large integers n. Therefore, (2) holds.
(6) ⇒ (7). Let U1 , U2 , V1 , V2 be nonempty open sets in I. By (6), there exist two positive integers
n1 , n2 such that f n (Ui ) ∩ Vi 6= ∅, for all n ≥ ni and all i = 1, 2. In particular, f n1 +n2 (U1 × U2 ) ∩
(V1 × V2 ) 6= ∅. So, f × f is transitive on I × I. That is, f is weakly topologically mixing on I.
(7) ⇒ (2), (6), (10). Firstly we show that
if a < b are any two points in I and c < d are any two points in int(I), then

f i [a, b] ⊃ [c, d] for some positive integer i.

Indeed, let U and V be two nonempty open intervals in I such that U ⊂ (inf I, c) and V ⊂ (d, sup I).

Since f is weakly topologically mixing,

that

(U × V ) 6= ∅. Therefore, f i (a, b) ∩ U 6= ∅ and f i (a, b) ∩ V 6= ∅. Consequently,


f i [a, b] ⊃ f i (a, b) ⊃ [c, d] and so, f is transitive on I.

If we choose c = a and d = b, then this shows that f has a periodic point in [a, b]. Since a < b are
arbitrary in I, this implies that f has dense periodic points in I. Furthermore, since f is transitive
on I, there is a positive integer j such that f j (U) ∩ V 6= ∅. So, there is a nonempty open interval
W in U such that f j (W ) ⊂ V . Since the periodic points of f are dense in I, there is a periodic
point p in W ⊂ U such that f j (p) ∈ f j (W ) ⊂ V and the whole orbit Of (p) is contained in the
16

interior of I. Let p1 = min Of (p) and p2 = max Of (p). Then it follows from what we just proved
that f k [a, b] ⊃ [p1 , p2 ] for some k ≥ 1. Since

p1 ≤ p ∈ W ⊂ U ⊂ (inf I, c] and f j (p) ∈ V ⊂ [d, sup I] and f j (p) ≤ p2 ,

we obtain that f n [a, b] ⊃ [p1 , p2 ] ⊃ [c, d] for all n ≥ k. This establishes trivially (2), (6) and (10).

	
(2) ⇒ (8). Let Vk : k ≥ 1 be an enumeration of all open intervals in the interior of I with
rational endpoints. For each Vk and any open interval USin I, (2) implies
that f n (U) ∩ Vk 6= ∅ for

all sufficiently large n (in M, in particular). So, the set n∈M f −n (Vk ) is open and dense in I.
To show that the set



is dense in I without resorting to Baire Category Theorem, we argue as follows using an idea of
Babilonová [2] (cf. the proof of Theorem 8 below):
Let K be any compact interval in I and, for each k ≥ 1, let Lk be a compact interval in Vk .
By (2), there is an integer n1 in M such that f n1 (K) ⊃ L1 . Let K1 be a compact interval in K
with length < 1/2 such that f n1 (K1 ) ⊂ L1 . Again, by (2), there is an integer n2 > n1 in M such
that f n2 (K1 ) ⊃ L2 . Let K2 be a compact interval in K1 with length < 1/4 such that f n2 (K2 ) ⊂ L2 .
Proceeding in this manner indefinitely, we obtain a sequence n1 < n2 < · · · of positive integers in
M and a sequence < Ki > of compact intervals such that, for each i ≥ 1, Ki T
⊂ Ki−1 the length
i
ni
of Ki is < 1/2 and f (Ki ) ⊂ Li ⊂ Vi , where K0 = K. It is clear that the set i≥0 Ki consists of

k

in I, S is dense in I. This confirms (8).
The implication (8) ⇒ (9) is clear and, by Theorem 4, we have (9) ⇒ (10) ⇒ (1).
To prove the implication (9) ⇒ (2), we may proceed as follows: Let z be a fixed point of f in the
interior of I and let K be any compact interval in the interior of I. Without loss of generality, we
may assume that z < x for all x ∈ K. By Lemma 2, there exist a point v in int(K) and a positive
integer s such that f s (v) = z. Since, for some positive integer k, f 2k is transitive on I, there exist
a point u in the interior of K whose orbit Of 2k (u) with respect to f 2k is dense in I and a positive
integer t > s such that max K < f t (u). Thus, f t (K) ⊃ K. Therefore, K contains a periodic point
of f . Since K is arbitrary in the interior of I, this shows that f has dense periodic points in I.
Let L be any compact interval in int(I). Since the orbit Of 2k (u) of u(∈ int(K)) with respect to
f is dense in I, for some positive integers s < n1 < n2 , we have

	

	
f 2kn1 (u) < min z, min L < max z, max L < f 2kn2 (u).
2k

Since u ∈ int(K) and since we have just shown that the periodic points of f are dense in I,
there is a period-m point p of f in K which is so close to u
17

that the orbit Of (p) is contained in int(I) and

	

	
f 2kn1 (u) ≈ f 2kn1 (p) < min z, min L < max z, max L < f 2kn2 (p) ≈ f 2kn2 (u).

Consequently, the interval f s (K) contains the fixed point z (= f s (v)) and the period-m point f s (p)
of f whose even iterates are distributed on both sides of z and so, the orbit Of (p) is not separated
i
s
by the fixed
 point z. By Lemma 3, we must have f f (K) ⊃ Of (p) for all i ≥ 2m − 2. Therefore,
n
f (K) ⊃ min Of (p), max Of (p) ⊃ L for all n ≥ s + 2m − 2. This confirms (9) ⇒ (2).
(10) ⇒ (2). Suppose f is totally transitive on I. By following arguments as those in the above
proof of the implication (9) ⇒ (2), we obtain that the periodic points of f are dense in I.

Let K and L be any compact intervals in I and int(I) respectively. Since f is (totally) transitive
on I, there is a point w in the interior of K such that Of (w) is dense in I. Let 0 < m1 < m2 < m3
be integers such that
f m1 (w) < min L < max L < f m2 (w) and f m3 (w) ∈ int(K).
Since the periodic points of f are dense in I, there is a period-k point q of f in the interior of K
which is so close to w that
f m1 (w) ≈ f m1 (q) < min L < max L < f m2 (q) ≈ f m2 (w) and f m3 (w) ≈ f m3 (q) ∈ K
and the orbit Of (q) is contained in the interior of I.

Let q̂ = f m3 (q). Then f k (q) = q, f k (q̂) = q̂, and f k [q, q̂] ⊃ [q, q̂]. Consequently, the sequence



[q, q̂] ⊂ f k [q, q̂] ⊂ (f k )2 [q, q̂] ⊂ (f k )3 [q, q̂] ⊂ · · ·

forms an increasing sequence of compact intervals in I. Sincef is totally transitve and so, f k is
transitive on I, the union ∪i≥0 (f k )i (q, q̂) ⊂ ∪i≥0 (f k )i ([q, q̂]) is dense in I. So, ∪i≥0 (f k )i [q, q̂]
is dense in I. Therefore, for some positive integer j,



L ⊂ min Of (q), max Of (q) ⊂ (f k )j [q, q̂] ⊂ (f k )j (K).



Since f Of (q) = Of (q), we see that L ⊂ min Of (q), max Of (q) ⊂ f n (K) for all n ≥ jk. This
shows that (10) ⇒ (2).

In Theorem 6 (9) & (10), we see that f 2 is transitive on I if and only if f is totally transitive
on I. In fact, we can say more.
Proposition 7. Let I denote one of the following intervals: (a, b), (a, b], [a, b), [a, b], (−∞, b),
(−∞, b], (a, ∞), [a, ∞) and (−∞, ∞), where a < b are real numbers. Suppose u is a point in I.
Then the following hold:
(1) If the orbit
	 Of 2 (u) is dense in I, then, for each k ≥ 1, the orbit Of k (u) =
0, 1, 2, · · · is dense in I.
18

 ik

 iℓ
(2) If the orbit
	 Of (u) is dense in I, then, for each odd ℓ ≥ 1, the orbit Of ℓ (u) = f (u) : i =
0, 1, 2, · · · is dense in I.

Ptoof. Suppose Of 2 (u) is dense in I. Let K be any compact interval in the interior of I which
contains no fixed points of f and let L = K. It follows from Theorem 4(1) that f n (K) ⊃ L = K
for all sufficiently large integer n. Consequently, K contains periodic points of f whose periods
are sufficiently large prime numbers. Therefore, since K is arbitrary, this shows that the set of all
periodic points of f whose periods are large odd prime numbers is dense in I. Let k ≥ 2 be a fixed
integer. Let V be any open interval in I and let q ∈ V be a period-ℓ point of f such that ℓ is a
prime number and ℓ > k. Write ℓ = ik + r, where i and r are integers with i ≥ 1 and 0 < r < k.
Then k and r are coprime. Let t1 and t2 be positive integers such that rt1 − kt2 = 1. Since Of (u)
is dense in I, let f n (u) be a point so close to the period-ℓ point q that
{f n (u), f n+ℓ (u), f n+2ℓ (u), · · · , f n+(kt1 −1)ℓ (u), f n+(kt1)ℓ (u)} ⊂ V.

Write n = jk + s, where j and s are integers such that j ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ s < n. Then n+ (k −s)t1 ℓ =
jk+s+(k−s)t1(ik+r) = jk+s+(k−s)t1ik+(k−s)rt1 = jk+s+(k−s)t1ik+(k−s)kt2 +(k−s) ≡ 0
mod k. So, f n+((k−s)t1 )ℓ (u) ∈ V . This implies that the orbit Of k (u) is dense in I. So, (1) holds.
As for the proof of (2), without loss of generality, we may assume that Of (u) is dense in I while
Of 2 (u) is not. It follows from Theorem 4 that there exists a fixed point z of f such that


f I ∩ (−∞, z] = I ∩ [z, ∞) and f I ∩ [z, ∞) = I ∩ (−∞, z].

Without loss of generality, we may assume that u ∈ I ∩ (−∞, z]. Let g = f 2 . Then Og (u) is dense
in I ∩ (−∞, z]. Suppose Og2 (u) were not dense in I ∩ (−∞, z]. Then it follows from Theorem 4
that there exists a fixed point ẑ of g in the interior of I ∩ (−∞, z] such that


g I ∩ (−∞, ẑ] = I ∩ [ẑ, z] and g I ∩ [ẑ, z] = I ∩ (−∞, ẑ]

which is impossible because z is a fixed point of f and of g (= f 2 ). Therefore, Og2 (u) is dense in
I ∩ (−∞, z]. It follows from (1) above that,
for each k ≥ 1, the orbit Ogk (u) = {f 2ik (u) : i = 0, 1, 2, · · · } is dense in I ∩ (−∞, z].

Since, for each odd ℓ ≥ 1, f ℓ I ∩ (−∞, z] = I ∩ [z, ∞) and the orbit Of 2ℓ (u) is dense in I ∩ (−∞, z],
we obtain that the orbit Of ℓ (u) = {f iℓ (u) : i = 0, 1, 2, · · · } is dense in I. This confirms (2).


Remark 3. Let I denote one of the intervals: (−∞, ∞), (−∞, b], [a, ∞), [a, b], where a < b are
real numbers and let f : I → I be a continuous map. Assume that f has dense periodic points in
K and, for some point w in I, f 2 (w) 6= w. Let

Suppose J were not a minimal invariant closed subinterval of f 2 in I and let J ′ be a proper invariant
closed interval of f 2 in J. Then J ′ cannot contain the point w. Otherwise, J ′ ∈ C and so, J ⊂ J ′
which is a contradiction. Therefore, w ∈
/ J ′ . By Lemma 5, let J ∗ be the component of the at most
two components of J \ J ′ which contains the point w and is also invariant with respect to f 2 . This
is again a contradiction. So, J is a minimal invariant closed interval of f 2 = g in I.
Since g has dense periodic points in J, again by Lemma 5, J is also a minimal invariant closed
interval of g 2 in I. By Theorem 6(5)(9), g 2 (= f 4 ) is transitive on J. It is clear that, by Lemma
5, f 2 has at most countably infinitely many minimal invariant closed intervals Jˆi in I such that
ˆ Let J1 , J2 , · · · , Jn , · · · be such an (maybe finite) enumeration.
f 2 (ŵ) 6= ŵ for some point ŵ ∈ J.

Then f 2 (Ji ) = Ji and f 4 is transitive on Ji for each i ≥ 1 and f 2 (x) = x for all x ∈

particular, this proves the main result of [4, 9] for compact I (see also [25]) without using the
notion of snakelike continua introduced in [7].

Recall that, when we say an interval, we mean a non-degenerate interval in the real line. Let
I denote any interval, i.e., let I denote one of the intervals: (a, b), (a, b], [a, b), [a, b], (−∞, a),
(−∞, a], (b, ∞) [b, ∞), (−∞, ∞), where a < b are real numbers. When we say an open (compact
respectively) interval, we mean an open (compact respectively) interval with respect to the topology
on the real line. Same when we say the interior (the closure respectively) of an interval. When we
say a relative open interval, we mean an interval which is relatively open in the relative topology on
I. Let c be a point in I. If there exist a (finite) point y in the closure of I and a strictly increasing
sequence < ni > of positive integers such that limi→∞ f ni (c) = y, then we call y an ω-limit point
of c (with respect to f ). Note that here we do not require y to be a point of I. If y ∈ ωf (c) and
y∈
/ I, then y is an endpoint of I.
On the other hand, let S be a subset of I with at least two distinct points and let β be a positive
number or β = ∞. When β is finite, we say that S is a β-scrambled set of f if, for any two distinct
points x and y in S, we have




lim inf f n (x) − f n (y) = 0 and lim sup f n (x) − f n (y) ≥ β.

lim inf f n (x) − f n (y) = 0 and lim sup f n (x) − f n (y) = ∞.

Following Babilonová [2], we call such a β-scrambled set S an extremely scrambled set of f if,
for any two distinct points c and d in S and any compact interval K in the interior of I, there exists
a positive integer n, depending on x, y and K, such that the interval [f n (c) : f n (d)] with f n (c) and
f n (d) as endpoints contains K.
In [2], Babilonová uses Theorem 6(2) to show the existence of extremely scrambled sets for any
continuous bitransitive map on a compact interval while in [31], Xiong and Yang show a general
result which, in particular, implies that if f : I −→ I is a continuous bitransitive map, then for any
given strictly increasing sequence < pn > of positive integers, there exists an extremely scrambled
20

set B such that, for any non-empty subset A of B and any continuous map g : A −→ I, there exists
a subsequence < qn > of < pn > such that
lim f qn (x) = g(x) for every x ∈ A.

Let M be an infinite set of positive integers and let β be a positive number or β = ∞. We need
a terminology which is inspired by Xiong and Yang [31]. We call a subset S of I a β-scrambled set
(with respect to M) if, for any two distinct points x and y in S, we have

f (x) − f n (y) = 0 and lim sup f n (x) − f n (y) ≥ β.

Following Mai [23], we say that the set C is synchronously proximal (M-synchronously proximal
respectively) to the point v if there exists a strictly increasing sequence < mi >i≥1 of positive integers
(in M respectively) such that the diameter of the set f mi (C) ∪ {v} tends to zero as i tends to ∞.
On the other hand, we say that C is dynamically synchronously proximal to the point v under f if
there exists a strictly
 increasing sequence < ni >i≥1 of positive integers such that the diameter of
ni
the set f C ∪{v} tends to zero as i tends to ∞. It is possible that C is (dynamically respectively)
synchronously proximal to many different points. We say that C is a Cantor set if it is a compact,
perfect and totally disconnected set in the real line.
In the following, we extend ideas of Babilonová [2] and Xiong and Yang [31] to show that every
continuous bitransitive map on I has extremely scrambled sets with a special chaotic property which
is different from that of Xiong and Yang [31]. The construction of the scrambled sets is similar to
that of the classical construction of the Cantor ternary set except that now, at each atage, we take
ever more steps than just one step in the classical construction.
Theorem 8. Let I denote one of the following intervals: (a, b), (a, b], [a, b), [a, b], (−∞, b), (−∞, b],
(a, ∞), [a, ∞) and (−∞, ∞), where a < b are real numbers, and let f : I → I be a continuous
bitransitive map. Let M be an infinite set of positive integers, let

Proof. Since, for each integer m ≥ 1, all points in the orbit Of (xm ) have the same ω-limit set. We
can consider the invariant set {f i (xm ) : m ≥ 1, i ≥ 0} and rename it {x′1 , x′2 , x′3 , · · · }. However,
here we still consider the set {x1 , x2 , x3 , · · · } instead of the invariant set {f i (xm ) : m ≥ 1, i ≥ 0}.
Furthermore, for any infinite set M of positive integers, by choosing the pertaining positive integers
from M at odd stages and from
the set {n! : n = 1, 2, 3, · · · } at even stages, we can replace Part

(3) with Part (3 ): the set S = j=1 S (j) is a dense β-scrambled set (with respect to M) of f in I
and, for each n ≥ 1, the set S is a dense β-scrambled set of f n . However, here we only choose the
pertaining positive integers from the set M for simplicity.

Finally, let z be a fixed point of f . Then, since δ > 0, f is not uniformly rigid and it follows
from [16] that f has an invariant ε-scrambled set for some positive number ε. Here, we show that
f has s dense invariant δ-scrambled set (with respect to M) of totally transitive points of f in I.


For any positive integers n and k, let cn,k be a point in I such that f n (cn,k ) − cn,k  > δn − 1/k.
Since f is a continuous mixing map on I, it follows from the above that f has totally transitive
points. Therefore, for each m ≥ 1, f m is transitive on I and so, f m (I) is dense in I. Consequently,
for each n ≥ 1, each m ≥ 1 and each k ≥ 1, there exists a point cn,m,k in I such that the point
f m (cn,m,k ) is so close to cn,k that

For each n ≥ 1 and each k ≥ 1, let cn,0,k = cn,k .

Let v1 = z. We arrange these countably infinitely many points cn,m,k , n ≥ 1, m ≥ 0, k ≥ 1, in a
sequence and call this sequence

S
and let S′ = t≥1 S ′(t) be the resulting β-scrambled set (with respect to M) of totally transitive
points of f obtained in the theorem.
Let c and d be any points in S′ and let j > i ≥ 0 be any integers.
Since, for each ℓ ≥ 1, the union
S ′(1) ∪ S ′(2) ∪ S ′(3) ∪ · · · ∪ S ′(ℓ)

is M-synchronously proximal to vt for each t ≥ 1, so is the set {c, d}.
Since v1 = z is a fixed point of f and since the set {c, d} is M-synchronously proximal to v1 = z,

For continuous bitransitive maps f on an interval, Theorem 8 guarantees the existence of dense
extremely scrambled sets of totally transitive points of f . We may ask if there exist dense invariant
extremely scrambled sets of totally transitive points of f . In the following, we provide various
examples to demonstrate all possibilities (some examples are mimicking those in [10, 11]):
Example 1. Let I = (−∞, ∞) and let 1/3 > ε0 > ε1 > ε2 > · · · and 1/3 > ε−1 > ε−2 > ε−3 > · · ·
be two strictly decreasing sequences of positive numbers such that limn→∞ εn = 0 = limn→∞ ε−n .
Let f (x) : (−∞, ∞) → (−∞, ∞) be the continuous map defined by putting, for each integer i,
(
(1) f (i) = i, f (i + 1/3) = i + 1 + εi , f (i + 2/3) = i − εi , f (i + 1) = i + 1 and
(2) f is linear on each of the intervals: [i, i + 1/3], [i + 1/3, i + 2/3] and [i + 2/3, i + 1].
46

Let K be any compact interval in (−∞, ∞). If K contains the point i + 1/3 or the point
i + 2/3 for some integer i, then the lengths ratio |f (K)|/|K| is > 1.5. Otherwise, the lengths ratio
|f (K)|/|K| is > 3. Consequently, for some positive integer j, the length |f j (K)|is > 1 and so, f j (K)
contains the interval [k.k + 1] for some integer k. But then, since f [k, k + 1] ) [k, k + 1], we see
that, for any positive integer n, there exists a positive integer m such that f ℓ ([k, k + 1]) ⊃ [−n, n]
for all ℓ ≥ m. Therefore, f is a continuous bitransitive map on I = (−∞, ∞). However, for
every point x, we have |f (x) −x| < 4/3. In particular, if {x0 , f (x0 )} is a δ-scrambled set of f ,
then δ ≤ lim supn→∞ |f n f (x0 ) − f n (x0 )| < 4/3. This implies that f (x) cannot have invariant
∞-scrambled sets on the unbounded interval I = (−∞, ∞) although, by Theorem 8, it has dense
∞-scrambled sets of totally transitive points in I = (−∞, ∞).
Example 2. Let I = (−∞, ∞) and let fˆ(x) : (−∞, ∞) → (−∞, ∞) be the continuous symmetric
map defined by putting

Let K be any compact interval in (−∞, ∞). If K contains the point i for some integer i, then
the lengths ratio |fˆ(K)|/|K| is > 1.5. Otherwise, the lengths ratio |fˆ(K)|/|K| is ≥ 3. Consequently,
for some positive integer j, the length of |fˆj (K)| is > 1 and so, fˆj (K) contains the interval [k.k + 1]
for some integer k. Since

Therefore, fˆ is a continuous bitransitive map on I = (−∞, ∞) such that the point x = 0 is the
unique fixed point of fˆ(x) and, for each integer n ≥ 1, there is a non-recurrent point vn in the interval
[n, n+1] such that fˆ(vn ) = 0 and so, the δ defined in Theorem 8 equals ∞. Therefore, fˆ(x) has dense

8, it has dense ∞-scrambled sets of totally transitive points. Furthermore, if we let g(0) = 0, then
g(x) is a continuous bitransitive map from [0, ∞) onto itself which does not have invariant ∞scrambled sets on I = [0, ∞). By an easy conjugation and modification, this also shows that there
exist continuous bitransitive maps on any bounded interval (compact or not, if compact then both
endpoints are fixed points) which does not have invariant extremely scrambled sets in I.

that ĝ(vn ) = 1, the δ in Theorem 8 equals ∞. So, ĝ(x) has dense invariant ∞-scrambled sets of

or bounded half-open interval which does not have invariant extremely scrambled sets.

By arguing as those in Example 1, we obtain that f˘ is a continuous bitransitive map on I =

in the interval (−∞, −2] and let < vn >n≥1 be a strictly increasing unbounded sequence of nonrecurrent points in [2, ∞) such that f˜(vn ) = z−n for all positive integers n. Then, the set S in
Theorem 8 can be chosen so that b
S is also a dense uncountable invariant extremely scrambled set

Example 6. Let I = (0, ∞) and let h(x) : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) be the continuous map defined by

(4) h(x) is linear on [k, k + 1] for each integer k ≥ 1.

Then, by arguing as those in Example 1, we obtain that h(x) is a continuous bitransitive map on
I = (0, ∞). h(x) is also a continuous bitransitive map from the closed unbounded interval [0, ∞)
onto itself if we let h(0) = 0 and so, the point z = 0 is the unique point in [0, ∞) such that h(z) = 0.
In fact, for the map h(x), whether defined on (0, ∞) or on [0, ∞), there exist a strictly increasing
unbounded sequence < wn >n≥1 of points such that limn→∞ h(wn ) = 0. Therefore, the extremely
scrambled set S in Theorem 8 can be chosen to satisfy that the larger set b
S is also a dense invariant
extremal scrambled set of totally transitive points of h. By an easy conjugation, this also shows that
there exist continuous bitransitive maps on bounded open interval or bounded half-open interval
which have dense invariant extremely scrambled sets of totally transitive points. For continuous
bitransitive map on compact intervals, the tent map T (x) = 2x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2; and T (x) = 2 − 2x
for 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 is such an example that it has dense invariant extremely scrambled sets of totally
transitive points in [0, 1].

In the following, we apply Theorem 4 and Theorem 8 to show that every continuous transitive
map on I has a dense uncountable invariant δ-scrambled set of transitive points for some positive
number δ (cf. [23]).
Corollary 9. Assume that f : I −→ I is a continuous transitive map. Then f has a dense


and z̆ is the unique fixed point of f .

Proof. If f 2 is transitive on I, then the existence of dense uncountable invariant ξ-scrambled sets
of transitive points of f in I follows from Theorem 8. So, in the following, we assume that f is
transitive but f 2 is not transitive on I. Then by Theorem 4, there exists a unique fixed point z̆ of
f (which lies in the interior of I) such that


f I ∩ (−∞, z̆] ⊂ I ∩ [z̆, ∞) and f I ∩ [z̆, ∞) ⊂ (−∞, z̆]
and, on each of the intervals I ∩ (−∞, z̆] and I ∩ [z̆, ∞), f 2 is transitive and has at least two fixed
points (and so f 2 is bitransitive). Without loss of generality, we may assume that
I ∩ (−∞, z̆] is unbounded if I is

or I ∩ (−∞, z̆] has longer length if I is bounded.

Then, by choosing the point z in Theorem 8 to be the unique fixed point z̆ of f in the interior of I
and since f 2 is bitransitive on I ∩ (−∞, z̆], Theorem 8 guarantees that f 2 has a dense uncountable

the set u, f (u ) is synchronously proximal to the fixed point z̆ of f . Consequently, we have

n→∞

On the other hand, it follows from (†) above that, for each i ≥ 0, f i (u) and f i (u′ ) lie on opposite
sides of z̆. Since the orbit Of 2 (u) of u with respect to f 2 is dense in I ∩ (−∞, z̆] and since the orbit
Of 2 (u′) is contained entirely in I ∩ [z̆, ∞), we easily obtain that


lim sup f n (u) − f n (u′ ) ≥ ξ.

50

This implies that the set {u, u′} is a ξ-scrambled set of f if u and u′ lie in opposite sides of z̆.
Therefore, S̈ is a dense uncountable invariant ξ-scrambled set of transitive points of f in I. 
Remark 4. In [13, 14, 28, 29] (see also [30]), we call a map f chaotic if there exists a positive
number ε such that for every point x and
every nonempty open set V (not necessarily an open neighborhood of x),
there is a point y in V such that




lim inf f n (x) − f n (y) = 0 and lim sup f n (x) − f n (y) ≥ ε.

onto itself and the point v = 2 is a non-recurrent point of g with

we can apply Theorem 8 to the map g(x) on the interval [0, 2] with the same given ρ to obtain a

be a Cantor set in C \ {Ci1 } which lies in U2 . Then U3 \ Ci1 ∪ Ci2 is a nonempty open set. Let
we let Cin
Ci3 be a Cantor set in U3 \ Ci1 ∪ Ci2 . Inductively, after choosing Cik , 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, S
be a Cantor set in C \ {Cik : 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1} which lies in Un . It is clear that the
S union k≥1 Cik is
dense in the interval [1, 2] and, since eack Ci∗k is contained in Uk∗ , the union k≥1 Ci∗k is dense in
the interval [2, 3]. Furthermore, since each Uk contains countably infinitely many Uij (⊃ Cij ), each
Uk∗ contains countable infinitely many Ci∗j and, since g(Ci∗k ) = g(Cik ), each Ci∗k is a synchronously
proximal Cantor set in the interval [2, 3]. Let

Then, g(Y) = g(Y ) and, since Y is a dense uncountable 2-scrambled set of g in the interval [0, 2],

In the above Theorem 8, we obtain dense scrambled sets which are unions of countably infinitely
many Cantor sets with zero
 Lebesgue measure. By the following result of Oxtoby and Ulam [25,
Theorem 9] see also [18] , there exists a homeomorphism h of (−∞, ∞) onto itself which takes
these scrambled sets to sets of full Lebesgue measure. Therefore, these maps are topologically
conjugate to maps with scrambled sets of full Lebesgue measure (cf. [2]). We omit the details.
Theorem 10 (Oxtoby & Ulam 1941[24]). Let B be any subset of the n-dimensional euclidean space
Rn . In order that there exists an automorphism h of Rn (i.e., a homeomorphism from Rn onto
itself ) such that h(B) has Lebesgue measure zero it is necessary and sufficient that the complement
of B contains a sequence of perfect sets whose union is dense in Rn .
In [2], Babilonová shows that each continuous bitransitive map on the unit interval I = [0, 1]
is topologically conjugate to a continuous bitransitive map g : I −→ I which is extremely chaotic
almost everywhere. Since every homeomorphism from an interval to itself must be strictly monotonic, by combining Theorems 8 & 10, we extent the result of Babilonová from any compact interval
to any interval in the real line.
Corollary 11. Let I denote any interval in the real line. Let f be a continuous bitransitive map
from I onto itself. Then f is topologically conjugate to a map in C(I, I) which is extremely chaotic
almost everywhere.
By applying Theorem 10 to Examples 5 & 6 above, we obtain the following result pertaining to
the existence of invariant extremely scrambled sets of transitive points of full Lebesgue measure.
Corollary 12. Let I denote any interval in the real line. Then there exists a continuous bitransitive
map from I onto itself which has an invariant extremely scrambled set of transitive points of full
Lebesgue measure.

Appendix.
In this appendix, we generalize Theorem 8 for continuous bitransitive maps on an interval to
continuous mixing maps (Theorem 16) and continuous weakly mixing maps (Theorem 19) on infinite
separable locally compact metric spaces without isolated points. The proofs of these three results
are almost the same except that we use different lemmas to prove them. In the following, for easy
reading, we include the complete self-contained proof of each of the generalizations (i.e., Theorems
16 & 19).
The problem on the existence of β-scrambled sets and invariant δ-scrambled sets for continuous
mixing maps and continuous weakly mixing maps on some nontrivial metric spaces have long been
addressed by many people, e.g., Babilonová [2], Balibrea, Guirao and Oprocha [3], Foryś, Huang
and Li [16], Iwanik [21], Li and Ye [22], Ruette [25], Xiong and Yang [31] and, Yuan and Lü [32]
and so on. In this appendix, we re-address this problem by a different approach. This approach is
similar to the classical construction of the Cantor ternary sets on an interval which is obtained by
constructing sequences of suitable nested compact sets.
Let X be an infinite topological space. We say that X is locally compact if, for each x in X , there
is an open neighborhood U of x such that the closure U is compact. For locally compact Hausdorff
spaces, we have the following well-known result. We include a (standard) proof for compeleteness.
Lemma 13. Let X be an infinite locally compact Hausdorff space and let x be any point in X .
Then, for any open neighborhood U of x, there is an open neighborhood V of x such that the closure
V is compact and is contained in U.
Proof. Since X is locally compact, there exists an open neighborhood W of x such that the closure
W is compact. Since the boundary set ∂(U ∩ W ) is a closed subset of the compact set W , ∂(U ∩ W )
is compact too. Since X is Hausdorff, for each y in ∂(U ∩ W ), y 6= x andso, there exist two disjoint
	
open sets Ux and Uy such that x ∈ Ux and y ∈ Uy . Then the collection Uy : y ∈ ∂(U ∩ W ) is an
open cover of the compact set ∂(U ∩ W ). So, it has a finite open subcover, say, Uy1 , Uy2 , · · · , Uyn
and the corresponding open sets Ux1 , Ux2 , · · · , Uxn . Let
\

∩ni=1 Uxi ⊂ ∩ni=1 Uxi .
V = (U ∩ W )

Then V and the setUyi ∪ Uy2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uyn are disjoint. Therefore, V is contained in the set X \
Uyi ∪ Uy2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uyn which
 is closed. This implies that the closure V is contained in the closed set
X \ Uyi ∪ Uy2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uyn . Since the boundary set ∂(U ∩ W ) is contained in Uyi ∪ Uy2 ∪ · · · ∪ Uyn ,
we have V ∩ ∂(U ∩ W ) = ∅. Consequently,
since V ⊂ U ∩ W = (U ∩ W ) ∪ ∂(U ∩ W ), we obtain that V ⊂ U ∩ W ⊂ U
and V ⊂ W ⊂ W . Since W is compact, so is V .

Let X be an infinite metric space. We say that X is separable if it has a countable dense
subset. By considering balls centered at points in this dense subset with rational radii, we see that
any infinite separable metric space has a countable base. Therefore, by Lemma 13, we have the
54

following well-known result which will be our starting point of proving Theorem 16 below. We
include a (standard) proof for completeness.
Lemma 14. Let X be an infinite separable locally compact metric space. Then X has a countable
basis of open sets with compact closures.
Proof. Since X is a separable space, it has a countable dense subset, say {a1 , a2 , · · · }. Then the
countable collection B of all open balls centered at ai , i ≥ 1, with rational radii is a countable basis
of open sets for X . Let

b = {B ∈ B : B is compact}.
B

b of B is also a basis for X .
We now show that this countable subcollection B

Let U be a nonempty open set and let x ∈ U. Since X is a locally compact metric (Hausdorff)
space, it follows from Lemma 13 that there exists an open neighborhood V of x with compact closure.
Since B is a basis of open sets for X , there is an open set B in B such that x ∈ B ⊂ V . Since the
b
closure B is a closed subset of the compact set V , we obtain that B is compact. Therefore, B ∈ B.
b is a countable basis of open sets with compact closures.
This shows that B

Let (X , ρ) be an infinite locally compact metric space with metric ρ and let f : X → X be a
continuous map. We say that f is (topologically) mixing if, for any nonempty open sets U and V
in X , there exists a positive integer N such that f n (U) ∩ V 6= ∅ for all n ≥ N. In particular, for
each n ≥ N, there exist
a point xn and an open neighborhood Un of xn in U such that f n (Un ) ⊂ V.
Since X is also a locally compact space, by applying Lemma 13,
we can actually choose Un to be an open neighborhood of xn such that
the closure U n is a compact subset of U and f n (U n ) ⊂ V.
We shall need the following easy result. For any set W in X , we define the diameter diam(W )
as diam(W ) = sup{ρ(x, y) : x ∈ W, y ∈ W }.
Lemma 15. Assume that (X , ρ) is an infinite locally compact metric space with metric ρ and
f : X → X is a continuous mixing map (so, X has no isolated points). Let m be a positive integer
and
let K1 , K2 , · · · , Km ; V1 , V2 , · · · , Vm be sets in X with nonempty interiors.
Then there exists a positive integer N such that, for each n ≥ N, there exist compact sets Kn,j ⊂ Kj ,
1 ≤ j ≤ m, in X with nonempty interiors such that,
f n (Kn,j ) ⊂ Vj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m.
(Since we only require the sets f n (Kn,j )’s to be contained in Vj , we can choose the compact sets
Kn,j ’s to be as small as we wish).

Let (X , ρ) be an infinite metric space with metric ρ and let M be an infinite set of positive
integers. Let C be a nonempty set and v a point in X . Following Mai [23], we say that the set C
is synchronously proximal (M-synchronously proximal respectively) to the point v if there exists
a strictly increasing sequence < mi >i≥1 of positive integers (in M respectively) such that the
diameters of the sets f mi (C) ∪ {v} tend to zero as mi tends to ∞. On the other hand, we say that
C is dynamically synchronously proximal to the point v under f if there exists a strictly
 increasing
ni
sequence < ni >i≥1 of positive integers such that the diameters of the sets f C ∪ {v} tend to zero
as ni tends to ∞. It is possible that C is (dynamically respectively) synchronously proximal to many
different points. We say that C is a Cantor set if it is compact, perfect and totally disconnected.
Let S be a subset of X with at least two distinct points and let β be a positive number or
β = ∞. When β is finite, we say that S is a β-scrambled set of f if, for any two distinct points x
and y in S, we have

i=0 f (S) is a dense invariant δ-scrambled set (with respect to

Consequently, if f also has a fixed point, then, by taking

Proof. Since, for each m ≥ 1, all points in the orbit Of (xm ) have the same ω-limit set. We
can consider the invariant set {f i (xm ) : m ≥ 1, i ≥ 0} and rename it {x′1 , x′2 , x′3 , · · · }. However,
here we still consider the set {x1 , x2 , x3 , · · · } instead of the invariant set {f i (xm ) : m ≥ 1, i ≥ 0}.
Furthermore, for any infinite set M of positive integers, by choosing the pertaining positive integers
from M at odd stages and from
{n! : n = 1, 2, 3, · · · } at even stages, we can replace Part
S∞the set
(j)

(3) with Part (3 ): the set S = j=1 S is a dense β-scrambled set (with respect to M) of f in X
and, for each n ≥ 1, the set S is a dense β-scrambled set of f n . However, here we only choose the
pertaining positive integers from the set M for simplicity.
The following proof is almost the same as that of Theorem 8 except that now we apply Lemma
15 instead of Theorem 6(2). We include it for easy reading.

Firstly, we introduce some notations.
Since X is separable, it has a countable open base, say U1 , U2 , U3 , · · · .
Let a1 , a2 , a3 , · · · and b1 , b2 , b3 , · · · be two sequences of points in X such that

For any point x0 in X and any positive integer n, let Vn (x0 ) denote a nonempty open set in X
of diameter < 1/n which contains the point x0 .
For each i ≥ 1, let yi (∈ X ) be an ω-limit point of xi . For each n ≥ 1, let Vbn (yi ) be a nonempty
open set in X with diameter < 1/n such that

Finally, suppose f has a fixed point z. Since δ > 0, f is not uniformly rigid. It follows from [16]
that f has an invariant ε-scrambled set for some ε > 0. Here, we show that there exists a dense

For any positive integers n and k, let cn,k be a point in X such that ρ f n (cn,k ), cn,k > δn − 1/k.

points in X . Therefore, for each m ≥ 1, f m is transitive on X and so, f m (X ) is dense in X .
Consequently, for each n ≥ 1, each m ≥ 1 and each k ≥ 1, there exists a point cn,m,k in X such that
the point f m (cn,m,k ) is so close to cn,k that

and let S′ = t≥1 S ′(t) be the resulting β-scrambled set (with respect to M) of totally transitive
points of f obtained in the theorem.
Let c and d be any points in S′ and let j > i ≥ 0 be any integers.
Since, for each ℓ ≥ 1, the union S ′(1) ∪ S ′(2) ∪ S ′(3) ∪ · · · ∪ S ′(ℓ) is M-synchronously proximal to
vt for each t ≥ 1, so is the set {c, d}.

Let X be a topological space and let f : X → X be a continuous map. Let Z+ denote the set
of all positive integers. For any point x0 and any nonempty open sets U and V in X , since we do
not know if f i (U) has nonempty interior, we define

N(x0 , V ) = {n ∈ N : f n (x0 ) ∈ V } and N f i (U), V = {n ∈ N : f n+i (U) ∩ V 6= ∅}.

It is clear that if f is (topologically) transitive then, for any nonempty open sets U and V in
X , N(U, V ) is an infinite subset of Z+ . We say that f is (topologically) weakly mixing [19] if
f × f : X × X → X × X is (topologically) transitive, i.e., for any nonempty open sets U1 , U2 , V1
and V2 in X , there exists a positive integer m such that
(f × f )m (U1 × V1 ) ∩ (U2 × V2 ) 6= ∅,
i.e., f m (U1 ) ∩ U2 6= ∅ and f m (V1 ) ∩ V2 6= ∅ (in particular, f is transitive).
The following result is the well-known Furstenberg Intersection Lemma [17].
Lemma 17. Suppose f × f : X × X −→ X × X is transitive. Then, for any positive integer n and
bn and Vbn such
any nonempty open sets Ui , Vi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, in X , there exist nonempty open sets U
that

is transitive and, for any nonempty open sets U and V , the set N(U, V ) contains arbitrarily long
string of consecutive positive integers.
Proof. Since f is weakly mixing, f is transitive and so, for any nonempty open sets U and V in X ,
the set N(U, V ) = {m ∈ Z+ : U ∩ f −m (V ) 6= ∅} is an infinite set of positive integers.
Let U1 , V1 , U2 , V2 , · · · , Un , Vn , n ≥ 2, be nonempty open sets in X . Then, since f is weakly
mixing, for some m ∈ Z+ , the sets U1 ∩ f −m (U2 ) and V1 ∩ f −m (V2 ) are nonempty open sets.
Therefore, by putting
b2 = U1 ∩ f −m (U2 ) and Vb2 = V1 ∩ f −m (V2 ),
U
b2 , Vb2 ) 6= ∅. Now, for any k ∈ N(U
b2 , Vb2 ), we have
we obtain that N(U

which implies that U1 ∩ f −k (V1 ) 6= ∅ and U2 ∩ f −k (V2 ) 6= ∅ and so, k ∈ N(U1 , V1 ) ∩ N(U2 , V2 ). This
implies that
b2 , Vb2 ) ⊂ N(U1 , V1 ) ∩ N(U2 , V2 ).
∅=

Now U3 and V3 are nonempty open sets in X . Since f is weakly mixing, we obtain that, for
b2 ∩ f −m′ (U3 ) 6= ∅ and Vb2 ∩ f −m′ (V3 ) 6= ∅. Let

We shall base our method of constructing the appropriate scrambled sets on the following result
in which Part (1) is an easy consequence of Lemma 17 while Part (2) is essentially due to Akin and
Kolyada (see the proof of Theorem 3.8 in [1]).
Lemma 18. Let (X , ρ) be an infinite separable locally compact metric space with metric ρ and let
f : X → X be a continuous weakly mixing map. Then the following hold:
(1) For any positive integer m, let K1 , K2 , · · · , Km be compact sets with nonempty interiors
and let V1 , V2 , · · · , Vm be nonempty open sets in X . Then there exist arbitrarily long string
of consecutive positive integers k and so, for each positive integer ℓ, by choosing one such
long string of consecutive
 positive integers of length > ℓ!, there exists an integer in this string
which is divisible by ℓ! and corresponding compact sets Kk,j ⊂ Kj , 1 ≤ j ≤ m, with nonempty
interiors such that
for each such k, f k (Kk,j ) ⊂ Vj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m.

(2) Suppose f has a point x0 in X whose orbit Of (x0 ) has compact closure Of (x0 ). Let i ≥ 0 be
an integer and let G(x0 ) be an open cover of Of (x0 ). Then there exists an (open) member, say
Gi (x0 ), of G(x0 ) such that, for any integer m ≥ 2, any nonempty compact sets Lj , 1 ≤ j ≤ m,
with nonempty interiors, and any nonempty open sets Vj , 1 ≤ j ≤ m, by considering

L1 , L2 , · · · , Lm : V1 , V2 , · · · , Vm ; Gi (x0 ) note this extra open set Gi (x0 ) at the end ,

there exist infinitly many positive integers ℓk,m,i , k ≥ 1 and corresponding compact sets
Lℓk,m,i ,j ⊂ Lj , 1 ≤ j ≤ m, with nonempty interiors such that,

for each k ≥ 1, f ℓk,m,i f i (Lℓk,m,i ,j ) ⊂ Vj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m and f ℓk,m,i (x0 ) ∈ Gi (x0 ).

them as small as we wish .

Proof. We only need to prove Part (2). Since G(x0 ) is an open cover of the compact set Of (x0 ), it
has a finite subcover, say, {G1 , G2 , · · · , Gn }. In particular, we have
N(x0 , G1 ) ∪ N(x0 , G2 ) ∪ N(x0 , G3 ) ∪ · · · ∪ N(x0 , Gn ) = N.

In the following theorem, we show that continuous weakly mixing maps have similar results as
those for continuous mixing maps except that
(1) the scrambled sets (invariant or not) obtained for continuous weakly mixing maps are with
respect to some infinite subsets of Z+ while those for continuous mixing maps are with respect
to any given infinite set of positive integers and
(2) the points xi ’s for continuous weakly mixing maps f have compact orbit closures Of (xi )’s
instead of nonempty ω-limit sets for continuous mixing maps.
Let (X , ρ) be an infinite metric space with metric ρ and let M be an infinite set of positive
integers. Let C be a nonempty set and v a point in X . Following Mai [23], we say that the set C
is synchronously proximal (M-synchronously proximal respectively) to the point v if there exists
a strictly increasing sequence < mi >i≥1 of positive integers (in M respectively) such that the
diameters of the sets f mi (C) ∪ {v} tend to zero as mi tends to ∞. On the other hand, we say that
C is dynamically synchronously proximal to the point v under f if there exists a strictly
 increasing
ni
sequence < ni >i≥1 of positive integers such that the diameters of the sets f C ∪ {v} tend to zero
as ni tends to ∞. It is possible that C is (dynamically respectively) synchronously proximal to many
different points. We say that C is a Cantor set if it is compact, perfect and totally disconnected.
Let S be a subset of X with at least two distinct points and let β be a positive number or
β = ∞. When β is finite, we say that S is a β-scrambled set of f if, for any two distinct points x

Proof. For simplicity, in the following proof, we assume that f has points xi ’s with
compact orbit

closures Of (xi )’s. Otherwise, skip all arguments pertaining to the points xi ’s . In this case, we
can consider the invariant set {f i (xm ) : i ≥ 0, m ≥ 1} and rename it {x′1 , x′2 , x′3 , · · · }. However,
here we still consider the set {x1 , x2 , x3 , · · · } instead of the invariant set {f i (xm ) : i ≥ 0, m ≥ 1}.
The following proof is almost the same as that of Theorem 16 except that now we apply Lemma
18 instead of Lemma 15. We include it for easy reading.
Firstly, we introduce some notations.
Since X is separable, it has a countable open base, say U1 , U2 , U3 , · · · .
Let a1 , a2 , a3 , · · · and b1 , b2 , b3 , · · · be two sequences of points in X such that
(

if X is unbounded,

	
lim ρ(an , bn ) = β =
n→∞
diam(X ) = sup ρ(x, y) : {x, y} ⊂ X , if X is bounded.

For any point x0 in X and any positive integer n, let Vn (x0 ) denote a nonempty open set in X
of diameter < 1/n which contains the point x0 .
Recall that, for each m ≥ 1, the point xm has compact orbit closure Of (xm ). For each i ≥ 0
and each k ≥ 1, let Gi,k (xm ) be a cover of Of (xm ) of nonempty open sets with diameters < 1/k.
It follows from Lemma 18(2) that there exists a member Gi,k (xm ) of Gi,k (xm ) such that, for any
integer n ≥ 2 and any nonempty open sets V1 , V2 , V3 , · · · , Vn , in X , the set

Finally, suppose f has a fixed point z and δ = inf δn = sup{ρ(f n (x), x : x ∈ X } : n ≥ 1 is

For any positive integers n and k, let cn,k be a point in X such that ρ f n (cn,k ), cn,k > δn − 1/k.
Since f is a continuous weakly mixing map on X , it follows from the above that f has totally
transitive points in X . Therefore, for each m ≥ 1, f m is transitive on X and so, f m (X ) is dense in
X . Consequently, for each n ≥ 1, each m ≥ 1 and each k ≥ 1, there exists a point cn,m,k in X such

This, combined with the above case when j > i ≥ 0 and the above (††) with lim inf, implies
that the set

is a dense invariant δ-scrambled set (with respect to M) of totally transitive points of f in X .
Since, for each n ≥ 1, n divides all sufficiently large positive integers in M, we obtain that Sb′′ is a
dense invariant δ-scrambled set of f n for each n ≥ 1.

Remark. Let (X , ρ) be an infinite metric space with metri ρ and let f : X −→ X be a continuous
map. In [13, 14, 28, 29] (see also [30]), we say that f is a chaotic map if there exists a positive
number ε such that, for any point x and any nonempty open set V (not necessarily an open
neighborhood of x) in X , there exists a point y in V such that

In light of Theorem 19, we obtain that if X is an infinite compact metric space without isolated
points, then every continuous weakly mixing map f from X into itself is chaotic.
