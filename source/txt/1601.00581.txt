Abstract. We make explicit a triple crystal structure on higher level Fock spaces,
by investigating at the combinatorial level the actions of two aﬃne quantum groups
and of a Heisenberg algebra. To this end, we ﬁrst determine a new indexation of
the basis elements that makes the two quantum group crystals commute. Then,
we deﬁne a so-called Heisenberg crystal, commuting with the other two. This gives
new information about the representation theory of cyclotomic rational Cherednik
algebras, relying on some recent results of Shan and Vasserot and of Losev. In
particular, we give an explicit labelling of their ﬁnite-dimensional simple modules.

1. Introduction
Since Ariki’s proof [1] of the LLT conjecture [21], it is understood that higher
ce ) play, via categorification, a very imporlevel Fock spaces representations of Uq′ (sl
tant role in understanding some classical structures related to complex reflection
ce ) with
groups. More precisely, if Fs,e is the level l Fock space representation of Uq′ (sl
multicharge s and V (s) the irreducible highest weight submodule of Fs,e of weight
Λs (determined by s), then one can compute the decomposition numbers for the
corresponding Ariki-Koike algebra by specialising at q = 1 Kashiwara’s canonical
basis of V (s).
The Fock space itself is no longer irreducible, but one can however define a canonical basis for it, which turns out to give, at q = 1, the decomposition numbers of a
corresponding q-Schur algebra, as was proved by Varagnolo and Vasserot [34], hence
generalising Ariki’s result.
The introduction of quiver Hecke algebras by Rouquier [26] and by Khovanov
and Lauda [20] has shed some new light about the role of the parameter q. In fact,
quiver Hecke algebras are graded, and graded versions of these results (which do not
require to specialise q at 1) hold for these structures, see [3].
Moreover, Ariki’s categorification theorem also permits to interpret the Kashiwara crystal of V (s) as the branching rule for the associated Ariki-Koike algebra [2].
Shan has proved in [29] that the crystal of the whole Fock space is also categorified
by a branching rule, but for another structure, namely a corresponding cyclotomic
rational Cherednik algebra.
Very recently, Dudas, Varagnolo and Vasserot [5] have proved a similar result
suggested by Gerber, Hiss and Jacon [11] in the context of finite unitary groups. In
this case, there is a notion of parabolic (or Harish-Chandra) induction for unipotent
representations which, provided one works with the appropriate Levi subgroups,
defines a branching graph which also categorifies the crystal of Fs,e .
Therefore, the study of Fs,e , and in particular of its crystal structure, which
yields the theory of canonical bases in Kashiwara’s approach [18], is crucial for

approaching fundamental problems in the representation theory of many classical
algebraic structures.
In Uglov’s paper [33], canonical bases of higher level Fock spaces have been thoroughly studied, generalising Leclerc and Thibon’s level one results in [22] and [23].
In his work, the Fock space is identified with a subspace of the level one Fock space
Λs . This space Λs is essentially the direct sum of all Fock spaces Fs,e over all lcharges s whose components sum up to s. Three algebras act on Λs : two quantum
ce ) and U ′ (sl
bl ), where p = −1/q, and a Heisenberg algebra H. A
groups, namely Uq′ (sl
p
fundamental result is that these three actions are pairwise commutative [33, Proposition 4.6], and that the Fock space can be decomposed in a very simple way: it
suffices to act on the empty multipartition by the three algebras for some restricted
values of the multicharge to reach any vector [33, Theorem 4.8].
ce )-module,
This emphasizes the relevance of considering Λs not only as a Uq′ (sl
bl )-module and as a H-module. This triple module structure is
but also as a Up′ (sl
well-defined because one has a three natural ways to index the elements of Λs : either
bl ) is understood
by partitions, by l-partitions, or by e-partitions. The action of Up′ (sl
provided the correspondence between l-partitions and e-partitions is known, which is
the case (it is explicit and based on taking e-quotients and “modified” l-quotients).
This double quantum group structure is referred to as “level-rank” duality, and
has been investigated in particular in the works of Rouquier, Shan, Varagnolo and
Vasserot [28] and Webster [35] in the context of rational Cherednik algebras.
The action of H has been less studied, but has recently been proved to have important applications when it comes to the representation theory of rational Cherednik
algebras. More precisely, Shan and Vasserot [31] have categorified the Heisenberg
action on the Fock space, and used it to characterise finite-dimensional simple modules for the corresponding cyclotomic Cherednik algebra. In a recent preprint [25],
Losev has given a combinatorial interpretation of this categorical action, but without
using Uglov’s approach to the Fock space. Finally, in the context of finite classical
groups, it has been shown that H plays a role in the study of unipotent modular
representations, by relating the notion of weak cuspidality to the classical one, see
[6, Section 5].
However, Uglov’s work says very little about crystals, and it is not clear how
level-rank duality nor the action of H is expressed at the crystal level.
The aim of this paper two-fold. First, complete Uglov’s study of higher level Fock
spaces at the crystal level. This is achieved by explicitely determining a triple crystal
structure which yields a nice decomposition of the whole crystal in the spirit of [33,
bl )Proposition 4.6] and [33, Theorem 4.8]. This requires to make explicit the Up′ (sl
ce )-crystal, and to define an appropriate
crystal structure commuting with the Uq′ (sl
notion of Heisenberg crystal which shall commute with both affine quantum group
crystals. Second, place it into the context of the representation theory of Cherednik
algebras to deduce new results using explicit combinatorics. In order to do this, we
must in particular prove a compatibily with a recent result of Losev [25]. Throughout

the paper, we will give a significant amount of examples to illustrate the notions
and procedures that we introduce.
This article has the following structure. In Section 2, we recall the important
combinatorial notions used in all the paper, in particular Uglov’s algorithms which
permit to juggle the different indexations of the level one Fock space. This section
does not contain any new material, however we take some time to reintroduce all
notions carefully.
ce )-module structure on higher level Fock space
In Section 3, we recall the Uq′ (sl
which was explicited in [15]. Note that this requires an order on i-boxes of multipartitions which gives the so-called “Uglov” realisation of the Fock space, which
is not consensual in the literature. We also introduce the conjugation procedure,
which is capital, and the correspondence (3.8). Essentially, it enables to put a new
ce )- and U ′ (sl
bl )-structure on the Fock space, which is the appropriate one for
Uq′ (sl
p
our purpose of studying crystals.
bl )-crystal graph
Section 4 gives a crystal version of level-rank duality. The Up′ (sl
ce )-crystal is explicited (Section 4.3). The
rule commuting with the classic Uq′ (sl
bl ) therefore give U ′ (sl
ce )-crystal isomorphisms in level l Fock
crystal operators of Up′ (sl
q
spaces, adding to the list in [9]. It is explicit and easy to describe on l-partitions.
The use of Correspondence (3.8) is indispensable.
In Section 5, we study “doubly highest weight vertices”, that is to say, vertices that
ce )-crystal and in the U ′ (sl
bl )are simultaneously highest weight vertices in the Uq′ (sl
p
crystal. We use a result of Jacon and Lecouvey [13, Theorem 5.9] to characterise
these multipartitions, and then give some essential properties. The proofs there are
quite technical and require a careful analysis of Correspondence (3.8).
Section 6 is devoted to defining the Heisenberg crystal. We start by introducing
maps b̃−κ and b̃σ which shift periods to the left and to the right respectively in
ce )the abacus representation of a multipartition. These are simultaneously Uq′ (sl
bl )-crystal isomorphisms. The Heisenberg crystal is then defined as a graph
and Up′ (sl
where the arrows are given by the action of “Heisenberg operators” which are refined
versions of b̃−κ and b̃σ . We end with a decomposition theorem (Theorem 6.19) which
is an analogue of [33, Theorem 4.8].
Finally, Section 7 relates the various results of the previous sections to the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras. We first give a general interpretation of the crystal level-rank duality. Then, we show that Losev’s independent
results on the crystal version of the Heisenberg action [25] are compatible with those
of Section 6, this is Theorem 7.6. This enables us to give an explicit characterisation of the finite-dimensional simple modules for the cyclotomic rational Cherednik
algebras using the notion of FLOTW multipartitions (Theorem 7.7).

Let l be a positive integer. An l-charge (or simply multicharge) is an l-tuple
s = (s1 , . . . , sl ) of integers. An l-partition (or simply multipartition) is an l-tuple
λ = (λ1 , . . . , λl ) of partitions. One considers that a partition has an infinite number
of size zero parts. The set of partition will be denoted by Π and the set of l-partitions
by Πl . The rank of λ is the sum of the ranks of the partitions λj , j = 1, . . . , l. A
charged l-partition is the data of an l-charge s and an l-partition λ, denoted |λ, si.
It can be represented by an l-tuple of Young diagrams (corresponding to λ), whose
boxes (a, b, j) (where a is the row of the box, b is its column and j its component)
are filled with the integers b − a + sj . This integer is called the content of the box
(a, b, j).
Example 2.1. Take l = 2, s = (−1, 2) and λ = (2.1, 12). Then
|λ, si = ( -1 0 , 2 )

2.2. Abaci.
Equivalently, one can use Z-graded abaci to represent a charged multipartition,
following [14]. Given a charged l-partition |λ, si, we can compute, for each j =
1 . . . , l, the numbers βkj = λjk + sj − k + 1 for k ≥ 0 where the λjk (k ≥ 1) are the
parts of λj . For each j, this give a set of β-numbers for λj in the sense of [14], which
is infinite by the convention that λj has an infinite number of size zero parts. Note
that these β-numbers are precisely the “virtual” contents that appear just to the
right of the border of |λ, si in its Young diagram representation.
Formally, we define the abacus A(λ, s) to be the subset of {1, . . . , l} × Z defined
by

	
A(λ, s) = (j, βkj ) , j ∈ {1, . . . , l}, k ≥ 0 .
We can depict A(λ, s) by drawing l horizontal Z-graded rows, numbered from bottom to top, and by drawing a bead on row j at position βkj for all j = 1, . . . , l and
for all k ≥ 0.
Example 2.2. Take the same values as Example 2.1. Then the β-numbers are given
by
j=2:
(. . . , −5, −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 2, 3)
j=1:
(. . . , −5, −4, −3, −1, 1)
and we get the following abacus

From this abacus, one recovers the l-charge by shifting all beads to the left and
by looking at the position of the rightmost bead on each row; and the partition λj
(for all j = 1 . . . , l) by counting the number of empty spots to the left of each bead
on the j-th row.

2.3. Uglov’s algorithms.
In this section, we want l ≥ 2 and we fix another integer e ≥ 2. Following Uglov
[33], we explain a way to associate to a charged l-partition a charged 1-partition, as
well as a charged e-partition.
Consider the l-abacus representing a charged l-partition |λ, si. Divide it into
rectangles Rk , with k ∈ Z, of size e × l such that each rectangle contains the
positions (j, (k − 1)e + 1), (j, (k − 1)e + 2), . . . , (j, ke) for some k ∈ Z and for all
j ∈ {1, . . . , l}. Then for (j, c) ∈ Rk , set τ −1 (j, c) = (1, c − e(j − 1) + elk). Then one
can show (see [33]) that τ −1 is a bijection between {1, . . . , l} × Z and 1 × Z, and we
denote τ its inverse (whose formula can also be explicited). In fact, τ −1 (A(λ, s)) is
a 1-abacus representing a charged partition, which we denote |λ, si. It is easy to see
P
that s = lj=i sj .
Starting from |λ, si, we can define
  a variant of τ which uses e. For (1, c) ∈ A(λ, s),
set τ̇ (1, c) = ((−c) mod e + 1, ec ). Then τ̇ is also bijection between 1 × Z and
{1, . . . , e} × Z. In fact, τ̇ (A(λ, s)) is an e-abacus representing a charged e-partition,
P
which we denote |λ̇, ṡi, and we also have s = ei=1 si if ṡ = (ṡ1 , . . . , ṡe ).

Example 2.3. We illustrate these procedures on Example 2.1. Take for instance
e = 3. We see in Figure 1 that τ “stacks horizontally” the elements of A(λ, s) into
rectangles of height l and width e, and that τ̇ “stacks vertically” the elements of
A(λ, s) into rectangles of height e and width l. Notice also that the composition
τ̇ ◦ τ −1 consists in flipping each rectangle through the diagonal joining the top left
corner to the bottom right corner, and then “ ‘regluing” the rectangles to get an
abacus.

Figure 1. The bijections τ and τ̇

TRIPLE CRYSTAL ACTION IN FOCK SPACES

Remark 2.4. Notice that shifting a bead one step to the left in |λ̇, ṡi amounts to
removing an e-ribbon in |λ, si. In fact, the bijection τ̇ gives the e-quotient (in the
sense of [14]) of the partition |λ, si. The e-core of λ is obtained after shifting all
beads of |λ̇, ṡi to the left and computing the associated partition using τ̇ −1 . Note
finally that this does not hold for τ .
2.4. Addable/removable boxes, residues and order on boxes.
We keep the notations of the previous section. Recall that the content of a box
γ = (a, b, j) of a multipartition |λ, si is the integer cont(γ) = b − a + sj . The residue
of γ is the integer
res(γ) = cont(γ) mod e.
For i ∈ {0, . . . , e − 1}, γ is called an i-box if res(γ) = i.
A box γ is called removable for λ if γ is a box of λ and if λ\{γ} is still a
multipartition. Similarly, it is called addable if λ ∪ {γ} is still a multipartition. In
the abacus, this corresponds to a bead which can be shifted one step to the left
(respectively to the right). As seen in Remark 2.4, removing (respectively adding) a
box in |λ̇, ṡi corresponds to removing (respectively adding) an e-ribbon in |λ, si =
τ̇ −1 (|λ̇, ṡi).
For a charged l-partition |λ, si and i ∈ {0, . . . , e − 1}, there is a total order on
the set of its removable and addable i-boxes defined by

cont(γ) < cont(γ ′ ) or
′
(2.1)
γ<γ ⇔
cont(γ) = cont(γ ′ ) and j > j ′
where γ = (a, b, j) and γ ′ = (a′ , b′ , j ′ ).
For charged l-partitions |λ, si and |µ, si such that µ = λ ∪ {γ} where γ is an
addable i-box of |λ, si, we define the quantities
(2.2)
Ni (|λ, si) = #{addable i-boxes of |λ, si}
−#{removable i-boxes of |λ, si}
Ni< (|λ, si, |µ, si) = #{addable i-boxes γ ′ of |λ, si such that γ ′ < γ}
−#{removable i-boxes γ ′ of |µ, si such that γ ′ < γ}
Ni> (|λ, si, |µ, si) = #{addable i-boxes γ ′ of |λ, si such that γ ′ > γ}
−#{removable i-boxes γ ′ of |µ, si such that γ ′ > γ}.

Λs , namely:
– by charged l-partitions |λ, si, via the bijection τ ,
– by charged e-partitions |λ̇, ṡi, via the bijection τ̇ .
This yields the following correspondence:

3.3. Conjugating multipartitions.

Here, we have decided to use the notation |λ̇ , ṡ′ i for the charged e-partition in

component of λ̇ and reverse it), and ṡ′ = (−ṡe , . . . , −ṡ2 , −ṡ1 ) where (ṡ1 , . . . , ṡe ) = ṡ.
In other words, the conjugation commutes with τ̇ . It also commutes with τ .

T = τ̇ ◦ (.)′ ◦ τ −1

Using Theorem 3.2, one recovers an explicit formula. As usual, we have a similar

Proof. One way to see it is to use the explicit action of Uq′ (sl

(respectively addable) (−i)-box of |λ′ , s′ i, and that it reverses the way these boxes
are ordered. The result follows.

Then (L, B) is the crystal basis of Fs,e at q = 0.
Thanks to this theorem, we can identify the set of charged l-partitions (which is
the standard basis of Fs,e ) with B. We will do so in the rest of the paper.
In order to describe the crystal graph of Fs,e combinatorially, we need to indroduce
the notion of good boxes for l-partitions. Fix i ∈ {0, . . . , e − 1}, and let |λ, si be a
charged l-partition. Recall that we have defined in Section 2.4 a total order < on
the set of removable and addable i-boxes of |λ, si. List the addable and removable
i-boxes of |λ, si in increasing order with respect to <, and encode each addable
i-box by a sign + and each removable i-box by a sign −. This yields a word in the
letters + and −, denoted wi (|λ, si) (or simply wi ) and called the i-word of |λ, si.
Now, delete recursively the subwords of the form (−+) in wi , in order to obtain a
word of the form (+)α (−)β , denoted w
bi (|λ, si) (or simply w
bi ) and called the reduced
i-word of |λ, si.

corresponding to the leftmost sign − (respectively the rightmost sign +) in w

Of course, we could have stated the same results with crystal bases at q = ∞ (or
equivalently at p = 0) instead. We decide to work at q = 0 in the following, and use

bl )-crystal structure and e-partitions. Let us recall the notion
same holds for the Up′ (sl
of totally periodic multipartition, cf [13, Definition 2.2].
Consider the abacus A representing a charged multipartition |λ, si. The first
e-period in A is, if it exists, the sequence
P = ((j1 , β1 ), . . . , (je , βe ))
of e beads in A such that
– β1 is the greatest β-number appearing in A,

16

THOMAS GERBER

– βi = βi−1 − 1 for all i = 2, . . . , e,
– ji ≤ ji−1 for all i = 2, . . . , e,
– for all i = 1, . . . , e, there does not exist (j0 , βi ) ∈ A such that j0 ≤ ji .
The first period of A\P , if it exists, is called the second period of A. We define
similarly the k-th period of A by induction.
The abacus A is said to be totally e-periodic if it has infinitely many e-periods.
In this case, there exists a non-negative integer N such that the abacus obtained
from A by removing its first N periods corresponds to the empty multipartition.
We call an e-period P trivial if
(j, β) ∈ P

⇒

(j, β − c) ∈ A for all c ∈ Z>0 .

In other words, a period is trivial if it encodes only size zero parts.
The key property of periods is the following:
Proposition 5.1. An e-period does not contribute to the computation of the reduced
i-words (for all i = 0, . . . , e − 1).
Proof. Let P = ((j1 , β1 ), . . . , (je , βe )) be the first e-period in A = A(λ, s). Fix
a residue i ∈ {0, . . . , e − 1} and look at the i-word (respectively reduced i-word)
wi (respectively w
bi ) for A on the one hand, and the i-word (respectively reduced
i-word) vi (respectively b
vi ) for A\P on the other hand. Let us show that w
bi = vbi .
Suppose first that i = β1 mod e. Then (j1 , β1 ) corresponds to a rightmost sign
+ in wi . Now, either (je , βe − 1) ∈ A, in which case (je , βe − 1) ∈ A\P , (je , βe − 1)
corresponds to a rightmost sign + in vi ; or (je , βe − 1) ∈
/ A, in which case (je , βe )
corresponds to a sequence (−+) in wi , which simplifies in w
bi . So in both cases,
w
bi = b
vi .
Suppose now that i 6= β1 mod e. Then there is an element (jk0 , βk0 ) ∈ P such
that i = βk0 mod e. If jk0 +1 = jk0 , this means that (jk0 , βk0 ) and (jk0 +1 , βk0 +1 ) do
not contribute to the computation of wi , and therefore neither in w
bi . In the case
where jk0 +1 < jk0 , then either (jk0 , βk0 − 1) ∈ A, in which case there is a rightmost
+ in wi , corresponding to (jk0 +1 , βk0 +1 ), which also exists in vi , corresponding to
(jk0 , βk0 − 1) ∈ P ; or (jk0 , βk0 − 1) ∈
/ A, in which case there is a sequence (−+) in
P , corresponding to the beads (jk0 , βk0 ) and (jk0 +1 , βk0 − 1), which simplifies in w
bi .
Again, in both cases, w
bi = vbi .

Proof. This is a direct consequence of Theorem 5.2 together with Theorem 4.8. 
Example 5.4. Take l = 3, e = 2, λ = (3, 3.1, 1) and s = (−1, 0, 0). Then we have
′
λ̇ = (22 .13 , 2.13 ) and ṡ′ = (0, 1).

Figure 8. The abacus A(λ, s)
One sees that A(λ, s) has two e-periods, and is totally e-periodic. The first
period corresponds to parts of size 3 (colored in red) and the second to parts of size
1 (colored in green).

′

Figure 9. The abacus A(λ̇ , ṡ′ )

Similarly, A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) has three l-periods, and is totally l-periodic. The first period
corresponds to parts of size 2 (blue) and the next two to parts of size 1 (green,
orange). The other periods are trivial.
Therefore, the associated charged partition |λ, si = |(10.8.4.2), −1i is a doubly
highest weight vertex.
5.2. Properties of doubly highest weight vertices.
We now list some properties of such charged partitions. In what follows, we let
|λ, si be a doubly highest weight vertex.
Lemma 5.5.
′
(1) In A(λ, s) (respectively A(λ̇ , ṡ′ )), all beads of a given period correspond to
parts of the same size. We then denote Sk (respectively Ṡk ) the part size
′
corresponding to the k-th period in A(λ, s) (respectively A(λ̇ , ṡ′ )).
(2) Let N (respectively Ṅ) be the number of non-trivial periods in A(λ, s) (re′
spectively A(λ̇ , ṡ′ )). We have #{Sk ; 1 ≤ k ≤ N} = #{Ṡk ; 1 ≤ k ≤ Ṅ }.
Proof. We prove this by induction on n = N. Write A = A(λ, s). Suppose first
′
that n = 0. Then we also have Ṅ = 0 since |λ̇ , ṡ′ i is totally l-periodic, and both
statements hold. Let now n > 0 and suppose that the lemma is true for all charged
multipartitions whose number of non-trivial e-periods is smaller than n. Since n ≥ 1,

18

THOMAS GERBER

there is at least a position (j, c) ∈
/ A such that (j, c + 1) ∈ A. Consider the position
(j0 , c0 ) verifying this property, such that c0 is maximal and such that j0 is maximal
among {(j, c0 ) ∈
/ A | (j, c0 + 1) ∈ A} Then (j0 , c0 + 1) ∈ A and therefore belongs to
an e-period P of A, since A is totally e-periodic. Let Q = ((j1 , c1 ), . . . , (jr , cr )) be
the sequence of empty positions in A(λ, s) located directly to the left of the beads
′
of P . In particular, (j1 , c1 ) = (j0 , c0 ). Since Ȧ = A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) is totally l-periodic and
since all elements of Q correspond to beads in Ȧ, Q corresponds to a whole l-period
in Ȧ, r = l and jk = l − k + 1 for all k = 1, . . . l. Similarly, if there is an empty
spot directly to the left of a position in the set Q1 = Q, this yields a set Q2 of l
beads corresponding to an l-period in Ȧ. Iterating, we get sets Qk for k = 1, . . . , t
where t is the part size encoded by, say, the first bead of P . Consider the abacus
A′ = A\(P1 ∪ · · · ∪ Pu ) where Pk is the k-th e-period of A and Pu = P . This is
mapped to Ȧ′ = Ȧ\(Q1 ∪ · · · ∪ Qt ) by Correspondence (3.8), and therefore is again
a doubly highest weight vertex, whose number of non-trivial e-periods is smaller
than n. By induction hypothesis, both points of the lemma hold for A′ and Ȧ′.
It is straightforward that adding P1 ∪ · · · ∪ Pu to A′ (which corresponds to addin
Q1 ∪ · · · ∪ Qt to Ȧ′ ) preserves these properties, thus proving the claim for |λ, si. 
Corollary 5.6.
′

(1) The multiplicity of each part in λ (respectively λ̇ ) is divisible by e (respectively l).
(2) The rank of λ is divisible by el.
Proof.
(1) This is straightforward from Lemma 5.5 (1), since each part of λ (respectively
′
λ̇ ) is read off the abacus by looking at each bead of the non-trivial periods.
′
(2) By Point (1) above, the multiplicity of each part in λ̇ is divisible by l. Using
Remark 2.4 and the definition of the correspondence 3.8, we can see λ′ as
′
the partition with e-quotient λ̇ and e-core determined by ṡ′ . Therefore the
rank of λ′ is divisible by el, hence so is that of λ.

Recall that we have defined the domains A(s) and Ȧ(s) in Notation 3.3.
Proposition 5.7. We have
s ∈ A(s)

and ṡ′ ∈ Ȧ(s).

Proof. Recall that the multicharge is read from the abacus by shifting all beads to
the left and looking at the index of the rightmost bead in each row of the resulting
abacus. By Lemma 5.5, all periods in a doubly highest weight vertex correspond
to the same part. Therefore, a doubly highest weight charged l-partition |λ, si is
obtained from |∅, si by shifting whole e-periods to the right. This is a key fact and
will be used in what comes next. Therefore, it suffices to prove the claim for vertices

TRIPLE CRYSTAL ACTION IN FOCK SPACES

19

of the form |λ, si. In this case, let us observe the corresponding charged e-partition
′
|λ̇ , ṡ′ i defined via Formula (3.8). By definition of T , if s ∈
/ A(s), then:
– either there exists and index j such that sj > sj+1, in which case the difference δ = sj − sj+1 creates δ empty spots in the l-abacus which are beads in
the e-abacus but do not form an l-period,
– or there exists two indices j and j ′ such that j ′ < j and sj ′ < sj − e, in which
case the difference sj − sj ′ also gives beads in the corresponding e-abacus
which do not form an l-period.
′

In both cases, A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) is not totally l-periodic, which is a contradiction, so the
claim is proved.

5.3. Shifting periods in abaci. We now consider the crucial procedure of shifting
periods one step to the left. Let P be an e-period in A(λ, s) which is shiftable
one step to the left. By Lemma 5.5 above, it is equivalent to say that there exists
(j, β) ∈ P such that (j, β − 1) ∈
/ A(λ, s) (i.e. there is one empty spot left adjacent
to some bead in P ). Then by the same observation as in the proof of Lemma 5.5,
′
there is a corresponding l-period P ′ in A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) which is shiftable one step to the
left. Define then
ϕP : A(λ, s) −→ 
{1, . . . , l} × Z
(j, c − 1) if (j, c) ∈ P
(5.12)
(j, c) 7−→
(j, c)
otherwise.
The image of A(λ, s) under ϕP is the l-abacus obtained from A(λ, s) by shifting P
one step to the left. We define ϕ̇P ′ similarly, that is to say, the map shifting P ′ one
′
step to the left in the e-abacus A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ).
Lemma 5.8. We have
ϕP = Ṫ ◦ ϕ̇P ′ ◦ T.
Proof. Assume, without loss of generality, that l ≤ e. We have already explained
how an l-period P ′ corresponds to a given e-period P . Now, write
P = {(jk , βk ) ; k ∈ {1, . . . , e}} ⊆ A(λ, s).
By definition of ϕP (5.12), ϕP only affects P , namely ϕP (P ) is an e-period Pb defined
by
Pb = {(jk , βk − 1) ; k ∈ {1, . . . , e}} .
If k is such that jk = jk+1 (which is a case that necessarily happens if e > l), then
βk+1 = βk − 1. Moreover,
ϕ

P
{(jk , βk − 1), (jk , βk+1 − 1)}
{(jk , βk ), (jk , βk+1)} 7−→
= {(jk , βk+1 ), (jk , βk − 2)},

so ϕP fixes (jk , βk+1 ). Therefore, ϕP fixes all elements of P that are on the same
row but one, so it moves exactly e beads, and in fact these are the beads of P ′ and

20

THOMAS GERBER
′

they are moved in A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) one step to the left. This is precisely the action of ϕ̇P ′
′
on A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) by definition.

Remark 5.9. Note that the use of T and its inverse only means that we look at the
action of ϕP on the e-abacus using Indexation 3.8. In fact, this lemma claims that
′
shifting an l-period of A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) one step to the left amounts to shifting an e-period
′
of A(λ, s) one step to the left. Of course, the same holds by switching A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) and
A(λ, s) and e and l. In particular, this procedure is always well defined when the
considered period is the last non-trivial period. This will be used in Section 6.1.
Example 5.10. To illustrate the phenomenon explained in the proof of Lemma 5.8,
look at Example 5.4. We get the following picture.

′

Figure 10. Shifting the last non-trivial period of A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) one step

Denote S = {Sk ; 1 ≤ k ≤ N} and S˙ = Ṡk ; 1 ≤ k ≤ Ṅ . The elements of

S (respectively S˙ ) are the different non-zero size parts of λ (respectively λ̇ ), see
Lemma 5.5 (2). Note that we have

Sk < Sk−1

for all k ∈ {2, . . . , N}.

Similarly,
Ṡk < Ṡk−1 for all k ∈ {2, . . . , Ṅ}.
For Sk in S (respectively Ṡk in S˙ ), denote M(Sk ) (respectively Ṁ(Ṡk )) the multiplicity of the non-zero part Sk (respectively Ṡk ) in the l-partition λ (respectively the
′
e-partition λ̇ ). By Corollary 5.6, M(Sk ) (respectively Ṁ (Ṡk )) is divisible by e (respectively l). Let m(Sk ) (respectively ṁ(Ṡk )) be the integer M(Sk )/e (respectively
Ṁ(Ṡk )/l).

Remark 5.11. Equivalently, κ can be defined as the ordered multiset {Sk ; 1 ≤ k ≤ N}
(and similarly for κ̇).
Proposition 5.12. The sequences κ and κ̇ are partitions, and κ̇ = κ′l .
Proof. Because Sk < Sk−1 for all k ∈ {2, . . . , N} and Ṡk < Ṡk−1 for all k ∈
{2, . . . , Ṅ} as already observed, κ and κ̇ are partitions. Further, each period P in
the l-abacus corresponds to a period P ′ in the e-abacus, and therefore the partition
κ̇ can be read off the partition κ. In fact, by definition of the correspondence T
(3.8), it is obtained by conjugating the original partition κ.

Example 5.13. Take the charged multipartition in Example 5.4. We have S =
{3, 1}, with M(3) = 2 and M(1) = 2. Similarly, we have S˙ = {2, 1} with Ṁ (2) = 3
and Ṁ (1) = 6. We get κ = (3.1) =
and κ̇ = (2.12 ) = .
Note that using the multiset definition of κ and κ̇ (Remark 5.11), we have directly
κ = S = {3, 1} and κ̇ = S˙ = {2, 1, 1}.
Remark 5.14. Note that κ depends on |λ, si. In fact, it induces two maps
κ:
and

In the rest, we want to use the notation κ(|λ, si), or simply κ(λ) (or κ(λ)). Importantly, note that the map κ is surjective: starting from a partition σ, it is easy
to construct a doubly highest weight l-partition (respectively e-partition) |λ, si (re′
spectively |λ̇ , ṡ′ i) such that κ(λ) = σ, so κ is surjective.
Moreover, if we restrict κ to the set of doubly highest weight vertices, it is clearly
injective since two doubly highest weight l-partitions with different κ are different.
So κ restricted to the set of doubly highest weight vertices is a bijection.
We end this section on a refinement of Corollary 5.6.
Corollary 5.15. We have

(1) |λ| = e|κ| and |λ̇ | = l|κ|

Proof.
(1) The partition κ encodes the position of the non-trivial e-periods in A(λ, s).

Each e-period consists of e beads, so that |λ| = e|κ|. Similarly, |λ̇ | = l|κ|.

6. The Heisenberg crystal
The aim of this section is to obtain a “crystal version” of Theorem 3.4. More
precisely, we want to construct crystal Heisenberg operators, such that
ce )- and U ′ (sl
bl )-crystals which commute with
(1) they induce maps between Uq′ (sl
p
the two kinds of crystal operators. Such maps are called double crystal
isomorphisms.
(2) every charged l-partition can be obtained from the empty partition charged
by s ∈ A(s) for some s ∈ Z by applying some sequence of Kashiwara crystal
ce ) and U ′ (sl
bl ) and of Heisenberg crystal operators.

Notation: If φ : B −→ B is a map between crystals, then we will also write
φ for the map from Ḃ ′ to Ḃ ′ as well as for the map going from the set of charged
partitions to itself induced by the correspondence (3.8).
6.1. The maps b̃−κ .
Definition 6.1. Let |λ, si be a charged partition which is a doubly highest weight vertex. We identify |λ, si with the charged l-partition |λ, si and the charged e-partition
′
|λ̇ , ṡ′ i using (3.8). Define
b̃−1 |λ, si = |µ, si

and

b̃′−1 |λ, si = |ν, si

where |µ, si (respectively |ν, si) is identified with |µ, si (respectively |ν̇ ′ , ṡ′ i) using
(3.8) where
′

– A(ν̇ ′ , ṡ′ ) is obtained from A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) by shifting its last non-trivial period one
step to the left.
– A(µ, s) is obtained from A(λ, s) by shifting its last non-trivial period one
step to the left.
Remark 6.2. Remember that we had defined a map ϕP in (5.12) which shifts the
period P one step to the left in the l-abacus. Therefore, identifying abaci and
charged multipartitions, b̃−1 = ϕP where P is the last non-trivial e-period of A(λ, s)
(which we have noticed earlier is well-defined). Similarly, b̃′−1 = ϕe,Q where Q is the
′
last non-trivial l-period of A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ).
Note that by Remark 2.4 together with Lemma 5.8, both b̃−1 and b̃′−1 act on |λ, si
by removing l e-ribbons.

Example 6.3. In Example 5.10, we have depicted the action of b̃−1 on both the
e-abacus and the l-abacus. In terms of multipartitions, we have
b̃−1 |(3, 3.1, 1), (−1, 0, 0)i = |(3, 3, ∅), (−1, 0, 0)i , i.e.
b̃−1 |(10.8.4.2), −1i = |(10.8), −1i
and

b̃′−1 |(22 .13 , 2.13 ), (0, 1)i = |(22 .1, 2.12 ), (0, 1)i , i.e
b̃′−1 |(10.8.4.2), −1i = |(6.6.4.2), −1i

Recall that we have denoted B the crystal graph of the Fock space Fs,e and Ḃ ′
the crystal graph of the Fock space Fṡ′ ,l in Section 4.3. We have two induced maps
between crystals which we denote the same way:

b̃′−1 :

Ḃ ′
−→
Ḃ ′
|ν̇ ′ , ṡ′ i 7−→ b̃′−1 |ν̇ ′ , ṡ′ i,

where b̃−1 (|ν, si) is computed as follows:
(1) Find the highest weight vertex in the connected component of B containing
|ν, si (either recursively via a sequence of Kashiwara crystal operators, or
more explicitely via the algorithm exposed in [9, Remark 6.4]).
(2) Use the correspondence (3.8) to get an element of Ḃ ′ , and find the highest
weight vertex in the connected component of Ḃ ′ of this e-partition. This is
a doubly highest weight vertex in view of Theorem 4.8.
(3) Apply b̃−1 using again the correspondence (3.8).
(4) Do the reverse operations of Points (2) and (1). The resulting l-partition is
b̃−1 |ν, si.
The map b̃′−1 : Ḃ ′ −→ Ḃ ′ is defined similarly, switching indexations using (3.8) and
replacing b̃−1 by b̃′−1 in the above procedure. In particular b̃−1 and b̃′−1 are double
crystal isomorphisms.
By extension, we define b̃−z : B −→ B by saying that, for a doubly highest weight
vertex |λ, si ∈ B, b̃−z |λ, si is obtained from |λ, si by shifting its last non-trivial eperiod z steps to the left, if possible. We extend this to B in the same way as b̃−1
(Formula (6.14) above). We define similarly b̃′−z : Ḃ ′ −→ Ḃ ′ .
Remark 6.4. One sees that b̃−z is the z-fold composition of b̃−1 if and only if SN = z
(see Lemma 5.5, i.e. if and only if the last non-trivial e-period of λ corresponds to
a part z). We have the similar property for b̃′−z .
Definition 6.5. For a partition σ = (σ1 , σ2 , . . . , σt ), we define b̃−σ : B −→ B and
b̃′−σ : Ḃ ′ −→ Ḃ ′ through the formulas
(6.15)

b̃−σ = b̃−σ1 ◦ b̃−σ2 ◦ · · · ◦ b̃−σt and
b̃′−σ = b̃′−σ1 ◦ b̃′−σ2 ◦ · · · ◦ b̃′−σt .

24

THOMAS GERBER

When one of the b̃−σk is not well defined on (b̃−σk+1 ◦· · ·◦b̃−σt )|λ, si, we set b̃−σ |λ, si =
0 (and similarly for b̃′−σ ).
Remember that the partition κ (respectively κ′ ) associated to |λ, si (see 5.13)
is written κ = (κ1 , κ2 , . . . , κt ) where each κi is a certain Sk (respectively κ′ =
(κ′1 , κ′2 , . . . , κ′u ) where each κ′i is a certain Ṡk ). So because of Remark 6.4, b̃−κ and
b̃′−κ′ are well-defined on |λ, si.
Proposition 6.6.
(1) If |λ, si is a doubly highest weight partition, then b̃−κ |λ, si = |∅, si and

where here, the partition κ depends on the chosen multipartition (see Remark
5.14). Therefore, we write b̃−κ = b̃′−κ′ .
Proof.
(1) By definition of b̃′−σ on Ḃ ′ and by construction of κ, it is straightforward

the e-partition b̃′−κ′ |λ̇ , ṡ′ i is empty (and b̃−κ′ does not modify the e-charge).
Similarly, we have b̃−κ |λ, si = |∅, si.

the diagram.

Notation 6.7. If |λ, si is a doubly highest weight vertex, we will use the notation
|λ̄, si for the charged partition b̃−κ(λ) |λ, si.
Proposition 6.8. The map b̃−κ is a double crystal isomorphism.
Proof. This is a direct consequence of the definition of b̃−κ together with the fact
that b̃−1 is a double crystal isomorphism and Remark 6.4.

6.2. The inverse maps.
Recall that we have introduced the notion of trivial period in Section 5.1.
Definition 6.9. Let |λ, si be a charged partition which is a doubly highest weight vertex. We identify |λ, si with the charged l-partition |λ, si and the charged e-partition
′
|λ̇ , ṡ′ i using (3.8). Define
b̃1 |λ, si = |µ, si

and

b̃′1 |λ, si = |ν, si

TRIPLE CRYSTAL ACTION IN FOCK SPACES

where |µ, si (respectively |ν, si) is identified with |µ, si (respectively |ν̇ ′ , ṡ′ i) using
(3.8) where
′

– A(ν̇ ′ , ṡ′ ) is obtained from A(λ̇ , ṡ′ ) by shifting its first trivial period one step
to the right.
– A(µ, s) is obtained from A(λ, s) by shifting its first trivial period one step to
the right.
We extend this definition and write, for a positive integer z, b̃z |λ, si to be the
l-partition obtained by shifting the first trivial period of |λ, si z steps to the right.
′
Similarly, b̃′z |λ̇ , ṡ′ i to be the e-partition obtained by shifting the first trivial period
′
of |λ̇ , ṡ′ i z steps to the right. Finally, for a partition σ = (σ1 , . . . , σt ), we define
b̃σ = b̃σt ◦ · · · ◦ b̃σ1 and b̃′σ = b̃′σt ◦ · · · ◦ b̃′σ1 . When this is not well-defined, we set again
′
b̃σ |λ, si = 0 (respectively b̃′σ |λ̇ , ṡ′ i = 0. All of these maps induce maps between
crystals B −→ B or Ḃ ′ −→ Ḃ ′ by the procedure explained in (6.14). In particular,
the following property is straightforward.
Proposition 6.10. The map b̃σ is a double crystal isomorphism.
Remark 6.11. By definition of κ in Section 5.13 and Proposition 6.6, it is clear that
for all charged partition |λ, si which is a doubly highest weight vertex,
|λ, si = b̃κ |λ̄, si.
So, it is enough to understand the connected components in B and Ḃ ′ containing
˙ ṡ′ i respectively. This is the case we consider in the following proposi|∅, si and |∅,
tion.
Remark 6.12. The maps b̃σ and b̃−σ are defined so that they are inverse to each
other, that is
b̃σ ◦ b̃−σ = IdB = b̃−σ ◦ b̃σ
and
b̃′σ ◦ b̃′−σ = IdḂ′ = b̃′−σ ◦ b̃′σ ,
whenever the first identities make sense.
As a consequence of Remarks 6.11 and 6.12, we see that b̃σ |λ, si =
6 0 if and only
if the first part of σ is not greater than the last part of κ = κ(|λ, si). In this case,
we have
b̃σ |λ, si = (b̃η ◦ b̃−κ )|λ, si
(6.16)
= b̃η |∅, si,
where η is the partition obtained by adding the parts of σ to κ.
Proposition 6.13. For all partition σ, we have b̃σ |λ̄, si = b̃′σ′ |λ̄, si.

26

THOMAS GERBER

Proof. First of all, |λ̄, si is a doubly highest weight vertex for all s ∈ Z, which
ensures that b̃σ |λ̄, si and b̃′σ′ |λ̄, si are well-defined. In fact, the l-partition and the epartition corresponding are empty by Proposition 6.6, and the l-charge (respectively
e-charge) is an element of A(s) (respectively Ȧ(s)) by Proposition 5.7.
By Lemma 5.8, the action of b̃1 on the l-abacus (shifting its first trivial e-period
one step to the right) corresponds to shifting an l-period one step to the right in
the e-abacus. Since this e-abacus corresponds to the empty e-partition, it has only
trivial l-periods, and one can only shift its first trivial l-period to the right. This
forces b̃1 to be the same as b̃′1 . Hence, the result holds for σ = (1). In fact, one can
look directly at the action of b̃z (= b̃σ with σ = (z)) on the empty l-partition. Using
the combinatorial definition of the correspondence (3.8), one sees that moving the
first trivial e-period in the empty l-abacus z steps to the right creates z l-periods
in the e-abacus which are obtained from the empty e-abacus by recursively shifting
its first period one step to the right. In other terms, it corresponds to applying
b̃′1 ◦ · · · ◦ b̃′1 (with z factors) to the empty e-abacus. That is to say, b̃(z) = b̃′(1z ) .
Therefore, the result holds for σ = (z). Similarly, it holds for σ = (1z ). Using
the same observation, we deduce that for an arbitrary σ, the map b̃σ acts on the
empty l-abacus exactly like b̃′σ′ acts on the empty e-abacus, with the identification
(3.8).

Remark 6.14. In the level 1 case, Leclerc and Thibon [23] have made explicit the
action of some elements Sσ ∈ H, defined from the basis of Schur functions in the
space of symmetric functions, on the canonical basis of the Fock space, see [23,
Theorem 6.9]. This induces an action of H at the combinatorial level, i.e. on the
crystal on partitions: the operator Sσ acts on a partition λ by adding e times each
part of σ in λ. For instance, if e = 3,

S

(

) =

.

In the 1-abacus representing λ, this amounts to shifting recursively the first trivial
e-period σk steps to the right, where σ = (σ1 , σ2 , . . . ). So this is exactly the same
procedure as our map b̃σ . Hence, these maps b̃σ can be interpreted as generalisations
of the operators Sσ coming from the action of H in the level 1 case. However,
throughout this paper, l = 1 is not allowed. In fact, in the level 1 case, the structure
of the Fock space is somewhat different since there is only one quantum group and
the Heisenberg algebra H acting.
6.3. Definition of the Heisenberg crystal.

TRIPLE CRYSTAL ACTION IN FOCK SPACES

We can now define an oriented colored graph structure on the set of charged
c
partitions, by setting |λ, si −→ |µ, si if κ(µ) is obtained from κ(λ) by adding a
box (a, b) such that b − a = c. As usual, we define it on doubly highest weight
vertices and we extend it as in (6.14). We call it the Heisenberg crystal, or simply
the H-crystal, of Λs .
Remark 6.15. The rule for drawing an arrow in the Heisenberg crystal is in fact the
Uq (sl∞ )-crystal graph rule on {|κ(λ), 0i ; λ ∈ Π} , which is equal to {|σ, 0i ; σ ∈ Π}
by the surjectivity of κ explained in Remark 5.14. Hence, one can see the Heisenberg crystal as the preimage under the map κ of the Uq (sl∞ )-crystal on the set of
partitions, which justifies the terminology “crystal”.
c

Now, observe that the procedure |λ, si −→ |µ, si is in fact a composition of maps
b̃±σ , namely
b̃−κ(λ)

b̃κ(µ)

|λ, si −−−−−−−→ |λ̄, si −−−−−−→ |µ, si.
This is a generalisation of Formula (6.16).
Therefore, we call the map
(6.17)

b̃1,c = b̃κ(µ) ◦ b̃−κ(λ)
c

Heisenberg crystal operator, and there is an arrow |λ, si −→ |µ, si in the Heisenberg
crystal if and only if |µ, si = b̃1,c |λ, si. This is an analogous result to Theorem 6.22,
in the sense that the Heisenberg crystal graph is explicitely described in combinatorial terms (via an explicit formula of the Heisenberg crystal operator). In fact, b̃1,c
ce ).
is an analogue for H of the Kashiwara crystal operator f˜i for Uq′ (sl

Remark 6.16.
(1) The map b̃1,c can be seen as a “weighted” version of the map b̃1 (Definition
6.9), in the sense that it shifts an e-period one step to the right in the labacus, which is determined by c (and is not necessarily the first trivial
one).
(2) By Remark 2.4, a Heisenberg crystal operator acts on a doubly highest weight
vertex |λ, si by adding an e-ribbon to the corresponding charged partition
|λ, si.
(3) The terminology “operator” may seem abusive, since the Heisenberg crystal
operators are simply defined as combinatorial maps, unlike the Kashiwara
crystal operators, which are operators on the vector space L/qL (where L
is a crystal lattice at q = 0). It will be shown in [10] that these maps are
in fact specialisations at q = 0 of some linear operators on the C(q)-vector
space Λs , in complete analogy with the Kashiwara crystal operators.

Each l-charge s ∈ A(s) determines a connected component of the H-crystal. A
source vertex in the H-crystal is called a highest weight vertex (by analogy with the
quantum group case): it is a charged partition |λ, si such that b̃−σ |λ, si = 0 for all
σ ∈ Π. In other terms, the highest weight vertices in the H-crystal are the elements

28

THOMAS GERBER

of the form |λ̄, si for some partition λ. The number of arrows necessary to go from
|λ̄, si to |λ, si in the H-crystal is called the depth of |λ, si and is equal to |κ(λ)|.
By definition, a map b̃σ (with σ a partition) is a composition of maps of the form
b̃z with z positive integer. We can now give an alternative description of b̃σ using
composition of Heisenberg crystal operators. Let {γk ; k = 1, . . . , |σ|} be the set of
boxes of σ, ordered from bottom to top, and from right to left. If γk = (ak , bk ) (row
and column indices), then write ck = bk − ak . In particular, one always has c|σ| = 0.
We have
(6.18)

b̃σ = b̃1,c1 ◦ b̃1,c2 ◦ · · · ◦ b̃1,c|σ| .

Theorem 6.17. The Heisenberg crystal operators simultaneously commute with the
ce )-crystal operators and with the U ′ (sl
bl )-crystal operators when computed with
Uq′ (sl
p
respect to Indexation (3.8).
Proof. By definition, the Heisenberg crystal operators are a composition of a map
b̃−κ and a map b̃σ . Both these maps are double crystal-isomorphisms by Propositions
6.8 and 6.10. This proves the claim.


To sum up, we have constructed a new crystal structure, so that we have in total
three crystal structures on the space Λs :
ce )-crystal,
- a Uq′ (sl
bl )-crystal,
- a Up′ (sl
- an H-crystal,
which are all explicited and pairwise commute provided one uses the correspondence
(3.8) to switch between the different indexations.
6.4. The decomposition theorem.
Notation 6.18. Let r (respectively t) be a non-negative integer and, let i1 , . . . , ir
(respectively j1 , . . . , jt ) be elements of {0, . . . , e − 1} (respectively {0, . . . , l − 1}). We
denote
F̃(i1 ...ir ) = f˜i1 . . . f˜ir and Ḟ˜(j1 ...jt ) = f˜˙j1 . . . f˜˙jt .
The following theorem says that every charged l-partition is obtained from the
empty l-partition charged by an element of A(s) by applying some crystal operators
ce ), of H, and of U ′ (sl
bl ). So this is an analogue of Theorem 3.4 at the crystal
of Uq′ (sl
p
level.
Theorem 6.19. For all charged l-partition |λ, si, there exist r, t ∈ Z≥0 , i1 , . . . , ir ∈
{0, . . . , e − 1}, j1 , . . . , jt ∈ {0, . . . , l − 1}, and a partition σ such that

Here, we have implicitely used the correspondence (3.8) to switch between the indexations by l-partitions, partitions, and e-partitions. Note that by Identity (6.18),
the map b̃σ in the middle is indeed a composition of Heisenberg crystal operators.
Proof. We identify as usual the l-partitions, e-partitions, and 1-partitions using
bl )-crystal to the highest
(3.8). Starting from |λ, si, one first goes back in the Up′ (sl
weight vertex, say |ν, si. One then computes b̃−κ(ν) |ν, si = |ν̄, si. Finally, one can go
ce )-crystal to the highest weight vertex. By Theorem 6.17, the order
back in the Uq′ (sl
of these operations does not matter, and by Proposition 6.6, the resulting l-partition
is empty, and charged by an element of A(s) according to Proposition 5.7.

6.5. An application using FLOTW multipartitions.
A consequence of Theorem 6.19 is the existence of a labelling of each charged
l-partition by a triple consisting of a particular l-partition, a partition and a particular e-partition. More precisely, let us introduce the convenient class of FLOTW
multipartitions.
Definition 6.20. Let λ = (λ1 , . . . , λl ) be an l-partition and s = (s1 , . . . , sl ) be an
l-charge in A(s) (cf Notation 3.3). For j ∈ {1, . . . , l}, write (λj = (λj1 , λj2 , . . . ). We
call |λ, si FLOTW if the two following conditions are satisfied.
(1) – λjk ≥ λj+1
k+sj+1 −sj ∀j ∈ {1, . . . , l − 1} and ∀k ≥ 1, and
l
1
– λk ≥ λk+e+s1−sl , ∀k ≥ 1.
(2) For all α > 0, the residues of the rightmost boxes of the parts of size α do
not cover {0, . . . , e − 1}.
Denote by Ψs the set of FLOTW l-partitions with charge s, and set
Ψ = {|λ, si ∈ Ψs | s ∈ A(s)}.
We define similarly the level-rank duals Ψ̇ṡ and Ψ̇ by exchanging the roles of e
and l.
Remark 6.21. Throughout this paper, we have assumed that l > 1. This definition
is however still valid when l = 1. In this case, l-partitions are simply partitions, and
the FLOTW partitions are precisely the e-regular partitions (and in this case, the
charge is insignificant).
Theorem 6.22 ([7, Theorem 2.10]). The vertices of the connected component of the
ce )-crystal graph of Fs,e containing |∅, si are the FLOTW l-partitions.
Uq′ (sl

The relevance of this theorem is that a priori, the vertices in the crystal graph
of Fs,e are computable, but only have a recursive definition: one starts with the
highest weight vertex and recursively applies some crystal operators of the form f˜i ;
whereas the FLOTW l-partitions have a more explicit (in particular non-recursive)
combinatorial definition.

Remark 6.25. The map ι is not surjective, since for arbitrary |µ, ri ∈ Ψ and |ν̇, ṫi ∈
˙ ṫi in Correspondence 3.8. In fact,
Ψ̇, one does not necessary have |∅, ri ←→ |∅,
the image of ι is of the form Im(ι) = Φ × Π × Φ̇, where Φ ⊂ Ψ and Φ̇ ⊂ Ψ̇. In
[9, Remark 6.5], we have constructed an affine analogue of the Robinson-Schensted
correspondence, which maps bijectively an element |λ, si ∈ B to a pair consisting
of an FLOTW l-partition |µ, ri and a combinatorial “recording data” (Q, α). The
FLOTW l-partition is precisely the one appearing in the above theorem. It would
be interesting to determine Φ and Φ̇ and to investigate the relationship between
Φ × Π × Φ̇ and the set of pairs (|µ, ri, (Q, α)) appearing in [9].
7. Application to the representation theory of cyclotomic
rational Cherednik algebras
For a charge s ∈ Zl (s) and a non-negative integer n, one associates the Cherednik
algebra Hc,n with parameter c = (− 1e , s) arising from the complex reflection group
G(l, 1, n) = (Z/lZ)n ⋊ Sn (this is the so-called cyclotomic case). The parameter c
is sometimes expressed differently in the literature. For some background, one can
refer to e.g. [29].
There is a corresponding category O, see [12] for its definition, denoted Oc,n ,
and one can consider, for n varying, all categories Oc,n together. Denote it Oc .
The simple objects in Oc are parametrised by the elements of Irr(G(l, 1, n)) for n
varying, i.e. by l-partitions.
It is known that the Fock space plays an important role in the representation
theory of Hc,n , with n varying, via categorification phenomenons. In particular, the
crystal of Fs,e is categorified by the branching rule on Hc,n with n varying, where
the Kashiwara operators ẽi (respectively f˜i ) correspond to the parabolic restriction
(respectively induction) in Oc , see Shan [29, Theorem 6.3] and Losev [24, Theorem
5.1].
Moreover, the action of the Heisenberg algebra (cf Section 3.2) has also been
categorified by Shan and Vasserot [31], and some of the associated combinatorics
has been recently studied by Losev [25].
7.1. Interpretation of the crystal level-rank duality.
Recall that the crystal level-rank duality is given by Correspondence (3.8), thanks
to which one can compute the two commuting quantum group crystals, see Section
4.3. This is a combination of Uglov’s level-rank duality given by Correspondence
(3.4) and of the conjugation isomorphism.
The categorical interpretations of these dualities have been studied by Shan,
Varagnolo and Vasserot [30], by Rouquier, Shan, Varagnolo and Vasserot [28] and
by Webster [35] to prove conjectures of Rouquier [27] and [4]. In fact, it is known that
Uglov’s level-rank duality between Fs,l and Fṡ,e is categorified by the Koszul duality
between the corresponding Cherednik categories O, see for instance [35, Section 6].
Moreover, conjugating is categorified by the Ringel duality [28, Section 6.2.2]. The
composition of both, that is Correspondence (3.8) is therefore categorified by the

32

composition of the Ringel and Koszul dualities, sending simple to tilting modules
in the respective categories O and giving rise to an equivalence of bounded derived
categories [4, Conjecture 6], [28, Theorem 7.4]. It commutes with the categorical

bl )-crystal and compatibility with the results
7.2. Propagation in the Up′ (sl
of Losev.
In [25], Losev has introduced a combinatorial recipe to compute a so-called sl∞ crystal 2 on the set of charged l-partitions which reflects, at a combinatorial level,
an abstract crystal structure on the set of classes of simple objects in the category
Oe , arising from the action of the Heisenberg algebra at a categorical level (whose
existence goes back to Shan and Vasserot [31]).
This recipe consists of two ingredients:
– An explicit description of some operators ãσ (parametrised by partitions σ,
first introduced in [31]) on charged l-partitions, in the case where the l-charge
is asymptotic.
– A formula for wall-crossing bijections, that permits to pass from the asymptotic case to the general case.
Notice that the formula for these wall-crossing bijections is unfortunately not very
explicit. Moreover, these ingredients are introduced for highest weight vertices in
ce )ce )-crystal; however, the commutation of this sl∞ -crystal with the U ′ (sl
the Uq′ (sl
q
crystal ensures that one can extend it to the whole set of partitions (see [25, Remark
5.4]). Finally, Losev does not use the combinatorial level-rank duality at all, and
there is no triple crystal structure involved. In this section, we will show that Losev’s
sl∞ -crystal coincides with the Heisenberg crystal introduced in Section 6.2 above.
Let j0 ∈ {1, . . . , l}. An l-charge s is called j0 -asymptotic if there exists a positive
integer N such that sj0 > sj + N for all j ∈ {1, . . . , l − 1}, j 6= j0 . Actually, in what
follows, we will consider the maximal such N for simplicity. In this case, we will
also call an element |λ, si asymptotic (charged) multipartition.
Lemma 7.1. Let s be an j0 -asymptotic l-charge. If |λ, si is a highest weight vertex
ce )-crystal such that |λ| ≤ N, then there exists a partition θ = (θ1 , θ2 , . . . )
in the Uq′ (sl
such that λj0 = (θ1e , θ2e , . . . ).

Proof. Because of Theorem 5.2, we know that A(λ, s) is totally e-periodic. In view
of the condition on the rank of λ, the first periods of A(λ, s) consist only of elements
of the form (j, β) with j = j0 (in other terms, the first periods are entirely included
in the j0 -th row of the abacus). Hence, the partition λj0 is of the form (θ1e , θ2e , . . . )
for some non-negative integers θi .


Notice that this partition θ is constructed in a similar way as the partition κ for
doubly highest weight vertices (except that for θ, one focuses exclusively on the j0 -th

terminology is justiﬁed by the same kind of arguments as that of Remark 6.15.

TRIPLE CRYSTAL ACTION IN FOCK SPACES

33

component of |λ, si). We will show in Theorem 7.6 that θ is in fact the partition κ
associated to the corresponding doubly highest weight vertex.
Let us now recall the result of Losev that is relevant in our context. Let s be an
ce )-crystal
j0 -asymptotic l-charge, and |λ, si be a highest weight vertex in the Uq′ (sl
such that |λ| + e|θ| ≤ N (cf Lemma 7.1 above). The following is [25, Section 5.1.2
and Proposition 5.3].
Theorem 7.2.
(1) The depth of |λ, si in the sl∞ -crystal is equal to the rank of θ.
(2) If θ = ∅ and σ = (σ1 , σ2 , . . . ) is a partition such that |λ| + e|σ| ≤ N, then
ãσ (|λ, si) = |µ, si, where µj = λj for all j 6= j0 , and µj0 = (σ1e , σ2e , . . . ).
ce )-crystal.
(3) The sl∞ -crystal commutes with the Uq′ (sl
Here, we have slightly “rephrased” the original result of Losev. In particular,
the notion of asymptoticity must be reversed in order to be compatible with the
language of Fock spaces, as well as the convention on “multiplicating/dividing” of
partitions by e (one recovers Losev’s convention by conjugating, see also [25, Section
5.5]).
Example 7.3. Take l = 2, λ = (13 , ∅) , s = (0, 14), e = 3 and σ = (2, 1). So we have
j0 = 2 and N = s2 − s1 − 1 = 13. Since |λ| + e|σ| = 3 + 3.3 = 12, we are in the
conditions of the theorem. The abacus of |λ, si is

Applying ãσ , we get the following abacus

So we see that ãσ acts by shifting periods in λj0 to the right according to σ: the
first period is shifted two steps and the second one step.
One first thing to notice is that Losev’s formula for ãσ is similar to the formula of
the operators b̃σ of Section 6 (shifting e-periods to the right). However, one sees that
the property of being asymptotic is somehow antagonistic to the property of being
a doubly highest weight vertex. More precisely, a doubly highest weight vertex can
never be asymptotic; and conversely, an asymptotic multipartition can never be a
doubly highest weight vertex (except for the trivial cases). This is clear for instance
looking at Proposition 5.7. Still, we have explained how to extend the definition of
the new operators to the whole set of partitions, in (6.14). In this section, we will
show that the operator ãσ actually coincides with b̃σ for all partition σ. Moreover,
we show that the partition θ arising in the asymptotic case is in fact equal to the

partition κ arising in the doubly highest weight vertex case. Note that the maps
b̃−1 and b̃−κ implicitely then corresponds to taking the inverse maps to ã(1) and ãκ .
For every asymptotic charged l-partition |λ, si which is a highest weight vertex
ce )-crystal, one can consider the corresponding doubly highest weight
in the Uq′ (sl
vertex. One can apply to it an operator b̃−κ , and go back to the highest weight

stated in the next proposition.
ce )-crystal. Write
Proposition 7.4. Let |λ, si be a highest weight vertex in the Uq′ (sl
|λ̃, s̃i for the corresponding doubly highest weight vertex, and set κ = κ(|λ̃, s̃i) =
(κ1 , κ2 , . . . , κN ). Then |λ, si has at least N non-trivial periods, and
(1) b̃−κ acts on |λ, si by shifting the k-th period of A(λ, s) by κk steps to the left,
for all k = 1, . . . , N, starting from k = N, . . . and finishing by k = 1,
(2) if κ = ∅, then for all partition σ = (σ1 , σ2 , . . . , σr ), b̃σ acts on |λ, si by
shifting the k-th period of A(λ, s) by σk steps to the right, for all k = 1, . . . , r,
starting from k = r, . . . and finishing by k = 1.
Remark 7.5. Note that in the case |λ, si = |λ̃, s̃i, this procedure coincides with the
procedure for b̃−κ described in Definition 6.5. The subtlety here is that we might
have more than N non-trivial periods in |λ, si, so we have to modify the statement.
Proof. We have already explained in Section 4.3 how the crystal operators f˜˙j of
bl ) act on the l-abacus, see Section 4.3. They are U ′ (sl
ce )-crystal isomorphisms,
Up′ (sl
q
and in fact they transform an e-period P = ((jk , βk ))k=1,...,e of A(λ̃, s̃) into another
e-period P ′ = ((jk′ , βk′ ))k=1,...,e , where either
– (jk′ , βk′ ) = (jk , βk ) for all k but one, denoted k0 , for which (jk′ 0 , βk′ 0 ) = (jk0 −
1, βk0 ), or
– (jk′ , βk′ ) = (jk , βk ) for all k > 1 and (j1′ , β1′ ) = (l, βe +e) (in which case je = 1).
This is true because A(λ̃, s̃) is totally e-periodic (and so are all elements in the
bl )-crystal). We see directly that such a procedure can only preserve the number
Up′ (sl
of periods, or make it increase, proving the opening statement.
Let us prove Point (1). We first need to show that it is possible to apply the
shifting procedure in the proposition, that is to say, that each element of the Nth period has at least κN empty spots to its left, and so on (formally, (j, β) ∈
PN ⇒ (j, β − a) ∈
/ A(λ, s) ∀a = 1, . . . , κN , and so on, if Pk denotes the k-th period
in A(λ, s)). By contradiction, suppose that applying the operator f˜˙j to a highest
ce )-crystal moves a bead of a period Pk in the abacus to
weight vertex in the Uq′ (sl
˜
a spot (j, β) (j ∈ {1, . . . , l} and meaning f˙0 if j = l) such that a period Pk′ , with

TRIPLE CRYSTAL ACTION IN FOCK SPACES

35

k > k ′ , contains an element of the form (j, β ′ ) and has exactly κk′ empty spots to
′
its left. In this case, the element (j, β ′ ) creates a − in the j-word ẇj (|λ̇ , ṡ′ i), which
˜
directly simplifies with the + created by the bead that is moved by f˙j , which is a
contradiction.
In fact, this procedure indeed gives the crystal action of the Heisenberg algebra
ce )-crystal. It suffices to notice that shifting
for the highest weight vertices in the Uq′ (sl
the considered e-periods preserves the reduced j-words ẇj , because this amounts to
potentially make subwords of the form (−+) collapse. In addition, one observes that
˜
f˙j acts on the modified l-abacus by moving the bead corresponding to the bead of
˜
the original abacus A(|λ, si) which is moved by f˙j . This is the same as applying
b )-crystal isomorphism (Proposition
the procedure to f˜˙ |λ, si. Because b̃ is a U ′ (sl

6.8), this procedure is indeed the action of b̃−κ on l-abaci.
Using the exact same arguments and looking at the reverse procedure, Point (2)
is also proved.

Theorem 7.6. The Heisenberg crystal coincides with Losev’s sl∞ -crystal.

Proof. It suffices to show that b̃σ = ãσ for all σ ∈ Π, and that θ = κ.
In fact, we first show that b̃σ and ãσ coincide on highest weight vertices in the
′ c
Uq (sle )-crystal which are j0 -asymptotic for some j0 ∈ {1, . . . , l}. This is enough
because we know that in both cases, the maps commute with the crystal operators of
ce ) (Theorem 6.17 for b̃σ and Theorem 7.2 for ãσ ). Every such charged l-partition
Uq′ (sl
|λ, si is obtained from a doubly highest weight vertex by applying a sequence of
Kashiwara crystal operators f˜˙j1 f˜˙j2 . . . f˜˙jr . By Proposition 7.4, we know how these
operators act. In the asymptotic case, if |λ| + e|σ| ≤ N (where the N comes
from the asymptotic property), applying b̃σ only affects the j0 -th row of A(λ, s).
Moreover, the shifting procedure on abaci described in Proposition 7.4 is exactly
Losev’s formula for ãσ on charged l-partitions, see Theorem 7.2. So we have b̃σ = ãσ
for all partition σ.
Similarly, the action of b̃−κ is entirely described on the j0 -th row of A(λ, s),
and the procedure of Proposition 7.4 on abaci is in this case precisely the reverse
procedure of Losev’s formula for ãθ on l-partitions, with θ = κ. Therefore, κ = θ. In
particular, the depth of |λ, si in the Heisenberg crystal is by definition |κ| = |θ|. 
Therefore, we can now use the results of Losev [25] and Shan and Vasserot [31]
on the Heisenberg crystal.
7.3. A combinatorial characterisation of finite-dimensional simple modules.
One important result of Shan and Vasserot is [31, Proposition 5.18], which gives
a characterisation of the finite-dimensional simple modules for cyclotomic rational
Cherednik algebras. They show that this property is equivalent to being “primitive”.
Combinatorially, this amounts to saying that the l-partition labelling this module is

36

THOMAS GERBER

ce )-crystal and in the Heisenberg
simultaneously a highest weight vertex in the Uq′ (sl
crystal, see e.g. [25, Section 5.1.1].
Using the results of Section 6.4, we can give an explicit combinatorial description
of these l-partitions. For this, recall that we have introduced the notion of FLOTW
e-partitions in Definition 6.20, and that we can use the correspondence (3.8) between
l-partitions charged by s and e-partitions charged by ṡ′ .
Theorem 7.7. A simple Hc,n -module is finite-dimensional if and only if it is labelled
′
by an l-partition λ of rank n such that |λ̇ , ṡ′ i is an FLOTW e-partition.
Proof. As already explained, a simple Hc,n -module is finite-dimensional if and only
if it is labelled by an l-partition λ of rank n such that |λ, si is a highest weight

vertex in the Uq′ (sl
crystal, i.e. λ = λ̄.

Assume first that |λ, si is a highest weight vertex in the Uq′ (sl

Remark 7.8. In the context of modular representations of finite classical groups,
there is a characterisation of cuspidal unipotent modules by Dudas, Varagnolo and
Vasserot [6, Theorem 5.11] similar to Shan and Vasserot’s characterisation of finitedimensional modules for cyclotomic Cherednik algebras. Therefore, we obtain an
explicit description of these cuspidal modules which is exactly that of Theorem 7.7
with l = 2, see also [6, Section 5.5.3].
