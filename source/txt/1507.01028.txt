Abstract
We reprove the λ-Lemma for finite dimensional gradient flows by generalizing the well-known contraction method proof of the local (un)stable
manifold theorem. This only relies on the forward Cauchy problem. We
obtain a rather quantitative description of (un)stable foliations which allows to equip each leaf with a copy of the flow on the central leaf – the
local (un)stable manifold. These dynamical thickenings are key tools in
our recent work [Web]. The present paper provides their construction.

Throughout (M n , g) denotes a Riemannian manifold of finite dimension n and
f is a function on M of class C r+1 with r ≥ 1. We assume further that the

Figure 1: Local coordinates near non-degenerate critical point
sets M a = {f ≤ a} are compact. By x we denote throughout a non-degenerate
critical point of f of Morse index k = ind(x) with 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1; for k ∈ {0, n}
there is no λ-Lemma. In the following we give an overview of the contents of
this paper. Definitions and proofs are given in subsequent sections.
The λ-Lemma1 was proved by Palis [Pal67, Pal69] in the late 60’s. Its backward version asserts that, given a hyperbolic singularity x of a C 1 vector field
X on a finite dimensional manifold, the corresponding backward flow applied
to any disk D transverse to the unstable manifold W u (x) converges in C 1 and
locally near x to the stable manifold of x; cf. [PdM82, Ch. 2 §7] and Figure 2.
Since the λ-Lemma is a local result we pick convenient coordinates about x.
Definition 1.1 (Local coordinates and notation – Figure 1).
(H1) Associated to the Hessian operator A = D(∇f )x there is the spectral
splitting X := Tx M = E − ⊕ E + in (7) with spectral projections π± and
where E −/+ = Tx W u/s (x). Consider the spectral gap d > 0 of A, see (6),
and fix a constant λ ∈ (0, d) – which will become the rate of exponential
decay. Consider the constants 0 < δ < µ < d defined by Figure 4.
(H2) Express the downward gradient equation (1) via exponential coordinates
in the form of the ODE (12) on a ball Bρ0 ⊂ X := Tx M whose radius
ρ0 ≤ 1 satisfies (14). In these coordinates the origin represents x and the
local flow will be denoted by φ = {φt }. The non-linearity h of this ODE,
also shown in (12), satisfies the Lipschitz estimates of Lemma 2.5.
Notation. The notation of coordinate representatives of global objects
such as W s (x) ⊂ M will be the global notation without the x such as W s .
(H3) By Remark 3.9 we take our local model of the form V = D− × D+ where
u/s
V ⊂ Bρ0 and D−/+ = W2ς ⊂ E ∓ represent a/de/scending disks, see (18)
and Remark 3.6, whose parameter 2ς is determined by the inclusions (25).
In this local model the graph maps (20) and (23) of the local un/stable
manifolds take on the rather simple form
F ∞ = (id, 0) : D− → D− × D+ ,

G ∞ = (0, id) : D+ → D− × D+ .

1 The naming inclination or λ-Lemma is due to the fact that it asserts C 1 convergence
of a family of disks to a given one in the (un)stable manifold, so the inclination of suitable
tangent vectors converges. In [Pal69] these inclinations were denoted by λ` .

Remark 1.3 (Contraction method proof of λ-Lemma). The contraction method
proof presented below has its own dis/advantages. On the worrying side, for
f ∈ C 2 , that is X = −∇f ∈ C 1 , we only obtain C 0 convergence so far, whereas
we do get C 1 convergence if f is of class C 2,1 near x, e.g. if f ∈ C 3 . On the
bright side, we get rather useful quantitative control on each of the involved
variables such as time t, the variable describing the dislocated disks, and their
dependence on the base point; for details see Theorem 1.2. Most importantly,
this quantitative control lends itself to construct foliations around critical points,
foliations associated to global objects, namely sublevel sets, and to equip each
leaf with its own semi-flow; see [Web14b, Web] for first applications.
Remark 1.4. Theorem 1.2 is a family backward λ-Lemma, namely for the family of disks D = Sεu × Bκ+ . Given a general hypersurface D0 whose intersection
with the unstable manifold is transverse and equal to Sεu , one needs to change
coordinates to bring D0 into the required normal form Sεu × Bκ+ . To achieve this
apply the parametrized Implicit Function Theorem to construct a C r diffeomorphism of V which is the identity outside a small neighborhood U of the compact
intersection locus Sεu and maps the part of D0 near Sεu to Sεu × Bκ+ for some κ.
We substituted the backward flow of the disk Dz− by its pre-image φT −1 Dz− ,
because there are interesting situations, cf. [Hen81], with only a forward semiflow. For instance, the heat flow on the loop space of a closed Riemannian
manifold [SW06] is just a forward semi -flow. Surprisingly, although there is no
backward flow, there is a backward λ-Lemma [Web14a] under which the hypersurface D moves backward in time and foliates an open set. Furthermore, it is
even still possible to construct a non-trivial Morse complex [Web13, Web14b].
Consequently the – in finite dimensions – common situation of a genuine forward and backward flow with stable and unstable manifolds, all being finite
dimensional, allows for (too) many choices. In order to emphasize the necessary
elements and, at the same time, to introduce the reader tacitly to the infinite
dimensional heat flow scenario, we subject ourselves to the following convention.
Convention 1.5 (No backward Cauchy problem). We shall use existence of a
solution to the Cauchy problem only in forward time and ignore the backward Cauchy problem alltogether. However, on the unstable manifold there is
still a natural procedure to define a backward flow; see Definition 3.3. Since
there is no Cauchy problem involved, we will (and need to) use this so-called
algebraic backward flow; this is coherent with the infinite dimensional case
cited above. In finite dimensions the algebraic backward flow coincides with the
one obtained via the Cauchy problem. So we do use a backward flow, but without solving the backward Cauchy problem and only along the unstable manifold.
To put things positively, our self-imposed lack of mathematical structure eliminates the possibility of choices and therefore reveals those elements which are
essential to define a Morse complex – or even just an unstable manifold.
The simple but far reaching idea, see [Web14a, Web14b], which avoids any
backward Cauchy problem is to look at the pre-image under the time-T -map of

Figure 3: Conley pair (Nxs , Lsx ) associated to critical point x
a given disk Dq (x) transverse at q to the unstable manifold W u (x). The obvious
but non-trivial problem is then to show that these sets are in fact submanifolds
of M . To show this we shall write them locally near x as graphs over the
stable tangent space E + = Tx W s (x) using the contraction method which
in this case consists of interpreting the backward Cauchy problem as a “mixed
Cauchy problem”. The latter can be reformulated in terms of the fixed point of
a contraction, both depending on parameters. Thereby we obtain a new proof
of the λ-Lemma in finite dimensions; see [Web14a] for the infinite dimensional
semi-flow case of a parabolic PDE where this program has been carried out first.
A key point of interest will be to control how the pre-images depend on time T .
Stable foliations
Borrowing from [Sal90] we define for each choice of constants ε, τ > 0 a pair
Nxs = Nxs (ε, τ ) : = {p ∈ M | f (p) ≤ c + ε, f (ϕτ p) ≥ c − ε}x ,

(3)

where {. . .}x denotes the path connected component that contains x, and
Lsx = Lsx (ε, τ ) := {p ∈ Nxs | f (ϕ2τ p) ≤ c − ε}.

(4)

Figure 3 shows a typical such pair, illustrates what is called the exit set property
of Lsx , and indicates hypersurfaces which are characterized by the fact that each
point reaches the level set {f = c − ε} in the same time. The points on the
stable manifold never reach level c − ε, so they are assigned the time label
∞. By the backward λ-Lemma, Theorem 1.2, these hypersurfaces foliate some
neighborhood of x. However, the neighborhood and so the leaves have no global
meaning so far. It is the content of Theorem 5.1 that the pairs (Nxs , Lsx ) which
are defined in terms of level sets are foliations; for a first application see [Web].
Remark 1.6 (Forward λ-Lemma and unstable foliations). Since the backward
λ-Lemma as well as the stable foliations (Nxs , Lsx ) with respect to f are of local
nature at x one can simply obtain the forward version of Theorem 1.2 and the
unstable foliations (Nxu , Lux ) with respect to f by taking the former ones with
respect to −f . (If necessary, cut off −f to obtain a complete forward flow.)

Preliminaries

Throughout we denote by ∇ = ∇g the Levi-Civita connection associated to the
Riemannian metric g on M which we also denote by h·, ·i. Given a singularity
p of a vector field X on M we denote by DXp linearization dXp : Tp M →
TX(p) T M ∼
= Tp M ⊕Tp M followed by projection onto the second component. The
isomorphism is natural, because X(p) = 0. There is the identity DXp = (∇· X)p .
Hessian and spectrum
By Critf we denote the set of critical point of f . Given p ∈ Critf , in other
words a singularity of X = ∇f , then there is a linear symmetric operator
A = Ap : Tp M → Tp M uniquely determined by the identity
Hessp f (v, w) = hAv, wi

(5)

for all v, w ∈ Tp M . The bilinear form Hessp f is defined in local coordinates in
terms of the (symmetric) matrix with entries (∂ 2 f /∂xi ∂xj )(p). It holds that
Av = D(∇f )p v = (∇ṽ ∇f )p where ṽ is a vector field on M with ṽp = v. By
symmetry the spectrum of the Hessian operator A is real. If it does not
contain zero, then p is called a non-degenerate critical point of f .
Suppose x is a non-degenerate critical point of f . Then by the spectral
theorem for symmetric operators the spectrum of A = Ax is given by n reals
λ1 ≤ · · · ≤ λk < 0 < λk+1 ≤ · · · ≤ λn

(6)

counting multiplicities. The distance d > 0 between 0 and the spectrum of
A is called the spectral gap of A. The number k of negative eigenvalues is
called the Morse index of the critical point x and denoted by ind(x). Denote
by E − and E + the span of all eigenvectors associated to negative and positive
eigenvalues, respectively. Then there is the orthogonal splitting
Tx M = E − ⊕ E +

(7)

with associated orthogonal projections π− : Tx M → E − and π+ : Tx M →
E + . Since A preserves E − and E + it restricts to linear operators A− := A ◦ π−
and A+ := A ◦ π+ on E − and E + , respectively. If 0 < k < n, then λ1 < 0 < λn .
Linearized equation and linearized flow
Linearizing the downward gradient equation (1) at a constant solution u(t) ≡
p ∈ Critf in direction of a vector field ξ : R → Tp M along u leads to the linear
autonomous ODE
˙ = −Aξ(t)
ξ(t)
(8)
for ξ where A = Ap is the Hessian operator determined by (5).

Interpreting −A : Tp M → Tp M in (8) as a vector field on the manifold
Tp M it is easy to see that the flow generated by −A is the 1-parameter family
{Φt }t∈R of invertible linear operators on Tp M given by
Φt = e−tA :=

If the spectrum of A is given by {λ1 , . . . , λn } ⊂ R, then {e−tλ1 , . . . , e−tλn } ⊂
−
+
(0, ∞) is the spectrum of e−tA . We will use Φt = e−tA = e−tA ⊕ e−tA only for
−
t ≥ 0. However, the part e−tA will be needed for all t ∈ R. Since this part acts
on the (linear) unstable manifold E − and is defined by a matrix exponential
– thus without employing any backward Cauchy problem – there is no conflict
with Convention 1.5.
Lemma 2.1 (Linearized flow satisfies linearized equation). Given p ∈ Critf ,
then the family of linearizations {dϕt (p)}t≥0 coincides with the time-t-maps
{Φt }t≥0 associated to the linearized vector field −A = −D(∇f )p on Tp M .
Proof. See e.g. [Web06, Le. 2.5].
Proposition 2.2 (Exponential estimates). Consider the Hessian operator A =
A− ⊕ A+ associated to a non-degenerate critical point x of Morse index k and
with induced splitting Tx M = E − ⊕ E + provided by (7). Fix a constant µ in the
spectral gap [0, d] of A. In this case there are the estimates
 −tA+ 
 −tA− 
e
 ≤ e−tλk+1 ≤ e−tµ ,
e
 ≤ e−tλ1 ,
for every t ≥ 0 and
 −tA+ 
e
 ≤ e−tλn ,

 −tA− 
e
 ≤ e−tλk ≤ etµ ,

for every t ≤ 0. Thus ke−tA k ≤ max{e−tλk+1 , e−tλ1 } ≤ max{e−tµ , e−tλ1 } whenever t ≥ 0 and ke−tA k ≤ max{e−tλn , e−tλk } ≤ max{e−tλn , etµ } whenever t ≤ 0.
Proof. Eigenvectors associated to λj and e−tλj can be chosen equal.
Exponential map
Given any point q of our Riemannian manifold M , we denote by expq : Tq M ⊃
Oιq → M the associated exponential map. Here Oιq is the open ball whose
radius ιq > 0 is the injectivity radius of exp at the point q. The infimum ι ≥ 0
of ιq over M is called the injectivity radius of M . The map
exp : T M ⊃ Oι → M
is called the exponential map of the Riemannian manifold. It is a piece of
mathematical folklore that one can introduce global maps E1 and E2 which
can be viewed as partial derivatives of the exponential map in the direction of
M and in the fiber direction, respectively. Also derivatives Eij of second and
higher order can be introduced; see e.g. [Web14a, §2.1].

Theorem 2.3. Given u ∈ M and ξ ∈ Oιu ⊂ Tu M , then there are linear maps
Ei (u, ξ) : Tu M → Texpu ξ M,

Eij (u, ξ) : Tu M × Tu M → Texpu ξ M,

for i, j ∈ {1, 2} such that the following is true. If u : R → M is a smooth curve
and ξ, η are smooth vector fields along u such that ξ(s) ∈ Oιu(s) for every s,
then the maps Ei and Eij are characterized3 by the identities
d
expu (ξ) = E1 (u, ξ)∂s u + E2 (u, ξ)∇s ξ
ds
∇s (E1 (u, ξ)η) = E11 (u, ξ) (η, ∂s u) + E12 (u, ξ) (η, ∇s ξ) + E1 (u, ξ)∇s η

(10)

∇s (E2 (u, ξ)η) = E21 (u, ξ) (η, ∂s u) + E22 (u, ξ) (η, ∇s ξ) + E2 (u, ξ)∇s η.
These maps satisfy the identities
E1 (x, 0) = E2 (x, 0) = 1l,

E11 (x, 0) = E21 (x, 0) = E22 (x, 0) = 0.

(11)

Tangent coordinates near critical point
Lemma 2.4. Pick p ∈ Critf and let ιp > 0 be its injectivity radius. Then in
the neighborhood expp Oιp of p in M the solutions to u̇ = −(∇f ) ◦ u correspond
via the identity u(t) = expp ξ(t) precisely to the solutions of the ODE
˙ + Aξ(t) = h(ξ(t)),
ξ(t)

h(ξ) = −E2 (p, ξ)−1 (∇f )expp ξ + Aξ,

(12)

where ξ takes values in the open ball Oιp ⊂ Tp M and h(ξ) abbreviates h(ξ(t)).
Proof. Given any smooth curve ξ in Oιp , set u(t) = expp ξ(t). Take the derivative to get that u̇ = E2 (p, ξ)ξ˙ pointwise in t. Thus we obtain that


E2 (p, ξ)ξ˙ = u̇ = −(∇f ) ◦ u = −E2 (p, ξ)Aξ − (∇f )expp ξ − E2 (p, ξ)Aξ
pointwise in t and where the last step is by adding zero.
Lipschitz continuity of the non-linearity
Lemma 2.5 (Lipschitz near p ∈ Critf ). Recall that f ∈ C r+1 (M, R) for r ≥ 1.
Fix p ∈ Critf and let ιp be its injectivity radius. Set ρ0 := ιp /4. Then there is a
continuous and non-decreasing function κ : [0, ρ0 ] → [0, ∞) vanishing at 0 such
that the following is true. The non-linearity h : Bρ0 → Tp M given by (12) is of
class C r . It satisfies h(0) = 0 and dh(0) = 0 and the Lipschitz estimate
kh(ξ) − h(η)k ≤ κ(ρ) kξ − ηk
and its consequence

whenever kξk, kηk ≤ ρ ≤ ρ0 and v ∈ Tp M . If f is of class C 2,1 locally near p,
then there is a constant κ∗ > 0 such that dh satisfies the Lipschitz estimate
kdh(ξ)v − dh(η)vk ≤ κ∗ kξ − ηk kvk ,
whenever kξk, kηk ≤ ρ ≤ ρ0 and v ∈ Tp M .
Proof of the Lipschitz Lemma 2.5. That f ∈ C r+1 implies h ∈ C r follows immediately from the definition of h; see (12). Pick ξ, η ∈ Bρ0 and set X := η − ξ.
It is useful to view ξ as being fixed and η(X) = ξ + X as depending on X.
Consider the map defined by
I(X) := h(ξ) − h(η) = −E2 (p, ξ)−1 (∇f )expp ξ + Aξ
+ E2 (p, ξ + X)−1 (∇f )expp (ξ+X) − A(ξ + X)
and note that I(0) = 0. Moreover, for any v ∈ Tp M it holds that

where brackets [. . . ] indicate (multi)linearity. Thus we obtain that

where for instance E2 abbreviates E2 (p, ·) and L∞ denotes the sup-norm. Moreover, existence of some constant σ ∈ [0, 1] is asserted by Taylor’s theorem. That
the function κ(ρ) is non-decreasing is due to the fact that the supremum is
taken over the closed ball of radius 3ρ. Indeed the supremum is obviously nondecreasing if it is taken over larger balls, that is if ρ grows. For ρ = 0 all maps
are evaluated at the origin of Tp M , thus κ(0) = 0 since4 E22 (p, 0) = 0 and
E2 (p, 0) = 1l by (11) and since D(∇f )p − A = 0. This proves the Lipschitz
estimate. Concerning its consequence recall that dh(ξ)v = limτ →0 h(ξ+τ v)−h(ξ)

and apply the Lipschitz estimate.

In fact, we don’t even need to use the identity E22 (p, 0) = 0 since anyway (∇f )p = 0.

Cauchy problem and integral equation
Proposition 2.6. Given a non-degenerate critical point x ∈ Critf , let ιx be its
injectivity radius and consider the ODE (12) in Tx M with non-linearity h. Fix
a radius
ρ0 ∈ (0, min{1, ιx /4}]
(14)
sufficiently small such that the image expx Bρ0 ⊂ M of the closed ball Bρ0 ⊂
Tx M contains no critical point of f other than x. Pick T ≥ 0 and assume that
ξ : [0, T ] → Tx M is a map bounded by ρ0 . Then the following are equivalent.
(a) The map ξ : [0, T ] → Tx M of class C 1 is the (unique) solution of
the Cauchy problem given by the localized downward gradient flow equation (12) with initial value ξ(0).
(b) The map ξ : [0, T ] → Tx M is continuous and satisfies the integral equation

Invariant manifolds

Suppose x ∈ M is a hyperbolic singularity of the vector field X = −∇f , that is
a non-degenerate critical point of f . The stable manifold of the flow-invariant
set {x} is defined by

	

W s (x) := q ∈ M  lim ϕt q exists and is equal to x .
(16)
t→∞

In case of a genuine complete flow one simply considers the limit t → −∞ to
define the unstable manifold W u (x). Note that – despite the naming – these
sets are, at this stage, nothing but sets. They are invariant under the flow
though. A common strategy to endow them with a differentiable structure is
to represent them locally near x as graphs of differentiable maps and then use
the flow and flow invariance to transport the resulting coordinate charts to any
location on the un/stable manifold. To carry out the graph construction one
introduces in an intermediate step what is called local un/stable manifolds.

Unstable manifold theorem
In view of our Convention 1.5 to ignore the backward Cauchy problem, already
defining W u (x) by the analogue of (16) is not possible. A way out is to consider
10

an asymptotic boundary value problem instead: Consider the set of all forward
semi-flow lines that emanate at time −∞ from the non-degenerate critical point
x, then evaluate each such solution at time zero and define W u (x) to be the set
of all these evaluations. In symbols, the unstable manifold of x is defined by


	
W u (x) := u(0)  u : (−∞, 0] → M , (1), lim u(t) = x .
(17)
t→−∞

It is non-empty since the constant trajectory u ≡ x contributes the element x.
Theorem 3.1 (Unstable manifold theorem). Non-degeneracy of x together with
ϕ being a gradient flow implies that the unstable manifold W u (x) is an embedded
submanifold of M of class C r tangent at x to the vector subspace E − ⊂ Tx M
of dimension k = ind(x) and diffeomorphic to E − .
Corollary 3.2 (Descending disks). Given x ∈ Critf non-degenerate, then there
is a constant εx > 0 such that the following is true.
a) Each descending disk defined by
Wεu (x) := W u (x) ∩ {f ≥ f (x) − ε},

ε ∈ (0, εx ],

(18)

r

is C diffeomorphic, as a manifold-with-boundary, to the closed unit disk
Dk ⊂ Rk where k = ind(x). The boundary
Sεu (x) = W u (x) ∩ {f = f (x) − ε}
of a descending disk is called a descending sphere.
b) Each open neighborhood of x in M , thus each open neighborhood of x in
W u (x), contains a descending disk.
Suggestion for proof. Apply Theorem 3.1 and the version of the Transversality
Theorem for manifolds-with-boundary, see [Hir76, Ch. 1 §4], to obtain the C r
manifold structure of the descending disk. Use the Morse Lemma [Hir76], which
causes loss of regularity, only to control the locus.
The proof of the unstable manifold Theorem 3.1 is a Corollary of the local
unstable manifold Theorem 3.4 below. The standard argument is to use the
forward flow to move the coordinate charts provided by Theorem 3.4 near x
to any point of W u (x). This shows that W u (x) is injectively immersed. Now
exploit the gradient flow property. To prove Theorem 3.4 we need a backward
flow, but only on the unstable manifold, which is coherent with Convention 1.5.
Definition 3.3 (Algebraic5 backward flow on unstable manifold). Given u(0) ∈
W u (x), set q := u(0) and define ψ−t q := u(−t) for t ≥ 0. Note that ψ−t ψ−s =
ψ−t−s and that ψ−t q solves the backward time Cauchy problem (1) with initial
value q. Therefore it doesn’t violate Convention 1.5 if, for any q ∈ W u (x), we
use the notation ϕt q for any time t, positive or negative.
While W u (x) is obviously backward and forward flow invariant, a descending
disk still is backward invariant since its boundary lies in a level set.
5 The wording “algebraic” backward flow is only meant to indicate that no backward
Cauchy problem is involved in its definition. It arises naturally along the unstable manifold
each of whose points has a past by definition. Thus along W u (x) it turns into a genuine flow.

Stable manifold theorem
Whereas the stable manifold is easier to define – given only a forward flow – than
the unstable manifold, the step from local to global is not obvious any more,
given Convention 1.5. We shall use this oportunity to promote Henry’s [Hen81],
widely unkown as it seems, argument to pull back the local coordinate charts
near x in the backward time direction utilizing only the forward flow.
Theorem 3.5 (Stable manifold theorem). Non-degeneracy of x together with ϕ
being a gradient flow implies that the stable manifold W s (x) defined by (16) is
an embedded submanifold of M n of class C r tangent at x to the vector subspace
E + ⊂ Tx M . Thus dim W s (x) is equal to the Morse co-index n − k of x.
Remark 3.6. The ascending disk Wεs (x) and the ascending sphere Sεs (x)
are defined as in Corollary 3.2, just replace the superlevel set {f ≥ f (x) − ε}
by the sublevel set {f ≤ f (x) + ε}. They also have analogous properties, in the
assertions just replace k by n − k where n = dim M .
Theorem 3.7 (Local stable manifold, Hadamard-Perron [Had01, Per28]). Assuming (H1–H2) in Definition 1.1 there is a constant ρ = ρ(λ) ∈ (0, ρ20 ) such
that a neighborhood of 0 in the local stable manifold

The proof of Theorem 3.7 is by the contraction method. In fact, our
proof of the Backward λ-Lemma, Theorem 1.2, presented below generalizes the
contraction method proof from invariant manifolds, which is well known, to
invariant foliations. The details missing in the following sketch of proof can be
easily recovered by formally setting T = ∞ in the proof of Theorem 1.2.
Pick z+ ∈ E + near 0. Our object of interest is a flow line ξ : [0, ∞) → Bρ0
whose initial value projects to z+ under π+ and which converges to 0, as t → ∞.

Remark 3.8. Further methods to prove the local (un)stable manifold theorems:
• Graph transform method: A geometrically appealing method, nicely
sketched in [PdM82, p.80]; for details see [Shu87].
• Irwin’s space of sequences: See former two references. Another excellent
reference for those who care about details is Zehnder’s recent book [Zeh10].
Proof of the stable manifold Theorem 3.5 (Henry [Hen81, Thm. 6.1.9]).
By Theorem 3.7 the stable manifold is locally near x a C r submanifold of M
of dimension n − k where k is the Morse index of x and n = dim M . Thus
there is a neighborhood Σ of x in W s (x) which is represented as a zero set
{y ∈ U | h(y) = 0} where U is an open set in M and h : U → Rk is a C r map
such that dhy : Ty M → Rk is surjective at each point
y ∈ h−1 (0) = U ∩ Σ = U ∩ W s (x).
Note that here only the first identity is part of the submanifold property of Σ.
To obtain the second identity choose U smaller, if necessary, and use the fact
that a flow line of a gradient flow cannot come back to itself asymptotically.
Nearby arbitrary elements q0 of W s (x) one obtains local submanifold charts
as follows. Pick T ≥ 0 such that ϕT q0 ∈ Σ and consider the C r map
ϕT

h

h ◦ ϕT : UT −→ U −→ Rk ,

UT := ϕT −1 (U ),

whose zero set is UT ∩ W s (x); see Figure 6. The pre-image UT is an open
neighborhood of q0 in M since U is open and ϕT is continuous. By the regular
value theorem it remains to show that the map
d(ϕT )q

dhy

d(h ◦ ϕT )q : Tq M −→ Ty=ϕT q M −→ Rk
is surjective whenever q ∈ (h◦ϕT )−1 (0) = UT ∩W s (x). Since dhϕT q is surjective
it suffices to show that d(ϕT )q is surjective.7 The following argument avoids
backward flows. In finite dimensions surjectivity of d(ϕT )q is equivalent to
dense range which itself is equivalent, even in the general Banach space case, to
injectivity of the adjoint (or transposed) operator (dϕT |q )∗ . But the latter is
equivalent to backward uniqueness of the (forward Cauchy problem associated
to the) adjoint equation. In our case A = A∗ so the adjoint equation is just
the linearized equation itself. But an ODE associated to a Lipschitz continuous
vector field exhibits forward and backward uniqueness; see e.g. [AL93].
7 In infinite dimensions [Hen81] the operator dϕ |q is not surjective in general, but still
T
admits dense image. This suffices to show surjectivity of the composition since k is finite.

starting from the “Ansatz” u(t) = expx ϑ−1 ξ(t) for ξ. Obviously the new

linearization. Since ϑ is of class C r and defined on the compact set V it admits
uniform C r -bounds. Therefore relevant estimates for the new and the old ODE

the Hessian operator A = Ax satisfy λ1 < 0 < λn . Consider the continuous

and such that the closed ρ-neighborhood Uρ (Wςu ) in X of the descending disk

radius ρ2 ball B + ⊂ E + is contained in D+ . Fix T2 = T2 (µ) > 0 such that
e−T2 µ/4 ≤ 1/8; this will be used in Step 5. Set
T0 = T0 (λ, µ(λ), κ) := max{T1 , T2 , 1} ≥ 1.

Remark 4.1 (Mixed Cauchy problem). The key observation to represent the
pre-image φT −1 Dz− under the time-T -map φT as a graph over the stable tangent
space E + is the fact that there is a well posed mixed Cauchy problem.
Namely, instead of prescribing precisely the endpoint, by the representation
formula (15) it makes sense to prescribe only the (π+ )-part of the initial point,
but in addition the (π− )-part of the endpoint. This way one circumvents using
a general backward flow – only the (by Convention 1.5 legal) algebraic one on
the unstable manifold is used; cf. [Web14a, Rmk. 3].
We prove below that for each z+ ∈ E + with kz+ k ≤ ρ/2 there is precisely one
flow line ξ = ξzT− ,z+ with initial condition π+ ξ(0) = z+ and endpoint condition
ξ(T ) ∈ Dz− . The latter is equivalent to
π− ξ(T ) = z−

kξ(T ) − z− k ≤ κ.

The proof takes six steps. Fix z− ∈ Sεu and z+ ∈ B + . Abbreviate ΨT = ΨTz− ,z+ .
Step 1. For T > 0 the set Z T equipped with the exp norm metric is a complete
metric space, any ξ ∈ Z T takes values in V ⊂ B1 , and ΨT acts on Z T .
Proof. For the compact domain [0, T ] the space C 0 ([0, T ], X) is complete with
respect to the sup norm, hence with respect to the exp norm as both norms
are equivalent by compactness of [0, T ]. By its definition the subset Z T of
C 0 ([0, T ], X) is closed with respect to the exp norm. Since Uρ (Wεu ) ⊂ Uρ (Wςu ) ⊂
V by our choice of ρ, the elements of Z T take values in V ⊂ B1 .
To see that ΨT acts on Z T we need to verify that ΨT ξ is continuous and
satisfies the exponential decay condition whenever ξ ∈ Z T . By definition ΨT ξ
is a sum of four terms each of which is continuous as a map [0, T ] → X. For
terms one and three continuity, in fact smoothness, follows from definition (9)
of the exponential as a power series. Continuity of both integral terms, terms
two and four, uses the same argument. Denote term two by F (t) from now
on. Continuity of F : [0, T ] → X and the fact that F (0) = 0 (used in Step 3
below) both follow from continuity and boundedness of the map h̃ := π+ ◦ h ◦ ξ :
[0, T ] → E + which holds true since ξ : [0, T ] → X is continuous and bounded
by definition of Z T and so is the non-linearity h by the Lipschitz Lemma 2.5.
We prove exponential decay. For t ∈ [0, T ] consider the flow trajectory given
T

where z−

where we used the exponential decay estimates in Proposition 2.2. To the nonlinearity h we applied the Lipschitz Lemma 2.5 to bring in the constant κ(ρ).
We also used the fact that the norm of a projection is bounded by 1. Moreover,
we multiplied both integrands by e−σλ eσλ to obtain the exp norms which are
bounded by ρ by definition of Z T . Inequality three uses that z+ ∈ B + and the

t = 0 in the definition (35) of ΨT and use the identities π+ π− = π− π+ = 0,

are naturally isomorphic.) Observe that ΨT is linear, hence smooth, in z− and
in z+ and of class C r in ξ, because h is of class C r by the Lipschitz Lemma 2.5.
Hence by the uniform contraction principle, see e.g. [CH82, §2.2], the map
θ = θT : Sεu × B + → Z T

(40)

(z− , z+ ) 7→ ξzT− ,z+

which assigns to (z− , z+ ) the unique fixed point of ΨTz− ,z+ is of class C r and so
is its composition with the (linear) evaluation map ev0 : Z T → X, ξ 7→ ξ(0),
and the (linear) projection π− : X → E − . But the composition of these maps
is GT by its definition (36). So GT , thus G, is of class C r in z− and z+ .

by Definition (36). The first identity also uses the fixed point property and the
initial condition from Step 2. The final identity is by π− ⊕ π+ = 1lX .
Step 4. The map T 7→ G(T, z− , z+ ) is Lipschitz continuous. If f is of class C 2,1

G(T, z− , z+ ) is also Lipschitz continuous.

Coming back to inequality two, it remains to explain the estimate for term four.
Here we used that ξ T +τ ∈ Z T +τ takes values in B1 by Step 1.
Inequality three uses (37) for the integrals and the fact that kz− k ≤ 1. Inequality
four uses estimate (43) and the smallness assumption (30) on ρ by which κ(ρ) ≤
1. Now take the supremum over t ∈ [0, T ] to obtain that
 T +τ

ξ

with constant c1 = 2(|λ1 | + 1). By (41) this shows that

Gz− (z+ ) − GzT− (z+ ) = ξ T +τ (0) − ξ T (0) ≤ c1 τ

for all T ≥ T0 and τ ≥ 0. In other words, the map T 7→ G(T, z− , z+ ) = GzT− (z+ )
is Lipschitz. The difference ξ T +τ − ξ T is illustrated by [Web14a, Fig. 5].

Inequality two uses the following arguments. Estimate the first pair of integrals

Z T (and Z T +τ ) take values in B1 . We also used that κ(ρ) ≤ 1 by (30) and that
e(t−T )µ ≤ 1. The estimate for the difference ξ T +τ (T + τ ) − ξ T (T ) ∈ X in line
four will be carried out separately below; see (51) for the result.
Inequality three uses the smallness assumptions (30) on ρ and estimate (43).

(51)

for every τ ≥ 0. This concludes the proof of (50) and therefore of Step 4.
Step 5. (Exponential C 0 convergence) Given z− ∈ Sεu and z+ ∈ B + , then it
λ
holds that kG ∞ (z+ ) − GzT− (z+ )k ≤ e−T 8 for every T ≥ T2 .
Proof. Assumption T ≥ T2 will be used in (52). Fix z+ ∈ B + and z− ∈ Sεu
and consider the fixed point ξ T = ξzT− ,z+ of ΨTz− ,z+ on Z T and the fixed point
ξ = ξz+ of Ψz+ on Z; cf. proof of Theorem 3.7. Since GzT− (z+ ) = ξ T (0) by (41)
and G ∞ (z+ ) = ξ(0) it remains to estimate the difference ξ(0)−ξ T (0). Motivated
by [Web14a, Fig. 6] the key idea is to suitably decompose the interval [0, T ].
The decomposition is illustrated by [Web14a, Fig. 5] which is surrounded by

Since kG ∞ (z+ ) − GzT− (z+ )k = kξ(0) − ξ T (0)k ≤ kξ − ξ T kCT0 /2 this proves Step 5.

maps should use convergence of the graph maps themselves. Indeed estimate (54) above is a key ingredient. Fix T ≥ T0 , z− ∈ Sεu , z+ ∈ B + , and
v ∈ E + . We proceed in three steps. Step I and Step II are preliminary.

Invariant stable foliations and induced flow

Given x ∈ Critf non-degenerate, set c := f (x). Consider the local model on
u
s
V = W2ς
× W2ς
⊂ Tx M provided by (H3) in Definition 1.1 and recall that the
assertions of the backward λ-Lemma, Theorem 1.2, hold true for each ε ∈ (0, ς).

Invariant stable foliations
Theorem 5.1 (Invariant stable foliation). Given x ∈ Critf non-degenerate, set
k = ind(x) and c = f (x). Then for every sufficiently small ε > 0 the following
is true. Pick a tubular neighborhood D(x) (associated to a radius κ normal disk
bundle) over the descending sphere Sεu (x) in the level hypersurface {f = c − ε}.
Denote the fiber over q ∈ Sεu (x) by Dq (x); see Figure 3. Then the following
holds for every sufficiently large τ > 1.
(Foliation) The subset Nxs of M is compact and contains no critical points
except x. Moreover, it carries the structure of a continuous codimension
k foliation8 whose leaves are parametrized by the k disk ϕ−τ Wεu (x) =
Nxs ∩ W u (x). The leaf Nxs (x) over x is the ascending disk Wεs (x). The
other leaves are the codimension k disks given by

Nxs (q T ) = ϕT −1 Dq (x) ∩ {f ≤ c + ε} qT ,
q T := ϕ−T q,
whenever T ≥ τ and q ∈ Sεu (x).
(Invariance) Leaves and semi-flow are compatible in the sense that
p ∈ Nxs (q T )

⇒

ϕσ p ∈ Nxs (ϕσ q T )

∀σ ∈ [0, T − τ ).

(Contraction onto ascending disk) The leaves converge uniformly to the
ascending disk in the sense that

λ
(66)
dist Nxs (q T ), Wεs (x) ≤ e−T 8
for all T ≥ τ and q ∈ Sεu (x).9 If U is a neighborhood of Wεs (x) in M ,
then Nxs (ε, τ∗ ) ⊂ U for some constant τ∗ .
(Shrink to critical point) Assume U is a neighborhood of x in M . Then
there are constants ε∗ and τ∗ such that Nxs (ε∗ , τ∗ ) ⊂ U .
Theorem 5.1 is illustrated by Figure 8. Theorem 1.2 asserts that some neighborhood of x is the union of images of (n−k)-disks. The first step (Corollary 5.3)
is to show that these images are disjoint and compatible with the flow. The actual proof of Theorem 5.1 coincides word by word with the infinite dimensional
version [Web14b, Thm. C]. To see this coincidence set R = ρ4 and impose on
+
+
ε > 0 the condition Wεs ⊂ BR
. Note that B2R
= B + ⊂ D+ .

For the precise degrees of smoothness away from Wεs (x) see Theorem 1.2.
Here dist denotes the infimum over all Riemannian distances of any two points and the
constant λ ∈ (0, d) has been fixed in (H2).

Local non-intrinsic foliation
Definition 5.2. A set D has the no return property with respect to a forward
flow φ if D ∩ φt −1 D = ∅, equivalently φt D ∩ D = ∅, whenever t > 0.
Clearly any subset of a level set has the no return property with respect to
a gradient semi-flow. Recall that G ∞ denotes the stable manifold graph map
provided by Theorem 3.7 and G is the graph map which appears in the backward
λ-Lemma, Theorem 1.2.
Corollary 5.3 (to the Backward λ-Lemma). Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.2 and with the additional assumption that (D, φ) has the no return property the following is true. The subset
F = F ε,T0 := (im G ∪ im G ∞ ) ⊂ D− × B + ⊂ V
of X = Tx M carries the structure of a continuous foliation of codimension k =
ind(x).10 The leaf over the singularity 0 is given by the subset F (0) := G ∞ (B + )
s
of the ascending disk W2ς
= D+ and the leaf over the points
αT := φ−T α = GαT (0),

T ≥ T0 ,

α ∈ Sεu ,

are given by the graphs F (αT ) := GαT (B + ). Leaves and flow are compatible in
the sense that
z ∈ F (αT ) ⇒ φσ z ∈ F (φσ αT )
whenever the flow trajectory from z to φσ z remains inside F .
Proof of Corollary 5.3. By Theorem 1.2 it remains to check that the sets F (αT )
and F (β S ) are disjoint whenever αT 6= β S , that is (T, α) 6= (S, β). Assume by
contradiction that GαT (z+ ) = GβS (z+ ) =: z for some z+ ∈ B + . Then by (41) the
point z is the initial value of a flow trajectory ξ T ending at time T on the fiber
Dα and also of a flow trajectory ξ S ending at time S on Dβ . By uniqueness
of the solution to the Cauchy problem with initial value z the two trajectories
coincide until time min{T, S}. If T = S, then α = β and we are done. Now
assume without loss of generality that T < S, otherwise rename. Hence ξ S
meets Dα at time T and Dβ at the later time S. But this contradicts the no
return property of D.
We prove compatibility of leaves and flow. The fixed point 0 is flow invariant.
Its neighborhood F (0) in the ascending disk is trivially flow invariant in the
required sense, namely up to leaving F (0). Pick z ∈ F (αT ) := GαT (B + ). By (41)
the point z is the initial value of a flow trajectory ξ T ending at time T on the fiber
Dα . Assume the image ξ T ([0, T ]) = φ[0,T ] z is contained in F := im G ∪ im G ∞
and pick σ ∈ [0, T − T0 ]. This implies that z+ := π+ φσ z ∈ B + . The flow
line φ[0,T −σ] φσ z runs from φσ z to φT z ∈ Dα . Thus by uniqueness this flow
10 For the definition of foliation see e.g. [Law74] or [Pes04, Sec. 4.1] and for the precise
degrees of smoothness away from Wεs (x) see Theorem 1.2.

by definition of F and αT −σ .

Induced flow – Dynamical thickening
Theorem 5.4 (Strong deformation retract). Consider a pair of spaces (Nxs , Lsx )
as defined by (3–4). Then the following is true for all pair parameters ε > 0 sufficiently small and τ > 1 sufficiently large. Firstly, the pair strongly deformation
retracts onto its part in the unstable manifold, that is onto
(D, A) = (Dxs , Asx ) := (Nxs ∩ W u (x), Lsx ∩ W u (x)).
Moreover, this pair consists of the closed disk D = ϕ−τ Wεu (x) whose dimension
k is the Morse index of x and an annulus A which arises by removing from D
the smaller open disk int ϕ−2τ Wεu (x); see Figure 3.
Corollary 5.5. For any pair of spaces in Theorem 5.4 it holds that
(
Z , ` = k := ind(x),
s

H` (Nx , Lx ) =
0 , otherwise.

(67)

To construct a deformation to prove Theorem 5.4 there is the immediate
temptation to use the already present forward flow ϕt . Unfortunately and obviously, this only works along the stable manifold where indeed the flow moves
any point into the unstable manifold, as time t → ∞. Along the complement
of the stable manifold this does not work at all.11 However, given the foliation
in Theorem 5.1 of Nxs in terms of graphs, it is then a natural idea to turn this
foliation into a dynamical foliation in the sense that each leaf will be endowed
with its own flow. The natural candidate for these flows is our given flow ϕt on
the ascending disk Wεs (x) = Nxs ∩W s (x) transported to any leaf via conjugation
by the corresponding graph map; see Figures 812 and 9. This way the set Nxs
turns into a disjoint union of copies of the dynamical system (Wεs (x), ϕ). So
one could call this procedure a dynamical thickening of the stable manifold;
see [Web] for an application to a classical theorem.
Proof of Theorem 5.4. Throughout we work in the local model provided by Definition 1.1. In particular, we will use these notation conventions in our construction of a strong deformation retraction θ of N onto its part D in the unstable manifold. As pointed out above on the stable manifold the forward flow
11 This is known as discontinuity of the flow end point map on unstable manifolds and
obstructs simple geometric proofs of a number of desirable results such as the one that the
unstable manifolds of a Morse-Smale gradient flow on a closed manifold naturally provide a
CW decomposition; see e.g. [Bot88, BH04, Nic11, BFK11, Qin11].
12 In Figure 8 we use simultaneously global and local coordinate notation for illustration.

Figure 8: Dynamical thickening (N, θ) = (Nxs , θxs ) of ascending disk Wεs (x)
{φt }t∈[0,∞] itself does the job. Indeed φ∞ pushes the whole leaf N (0), that is the
ascending disk Wεs by Theorem 5.1, into the origin – which lies in the unstable
manifold. Since φt restricted to the origin is the identity, the origin is a strong
deformation retract of N (0). If the Morse index k is zero, then N = N (0) and
we are done; similarly for k = n. Assume from now on 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. The main
idea is to use the graph maps G ∞ and GTα provided by Theorems 3.7 and 1.2,
respectively, and their left inverse π+ to extend the good retraction properties
of φt on the ascending disk N (0) to all the other leaves N (αT ) provided by
Theorem 5.1.
Definition 5.6 (Induced semi-flow – Dynamical thickening). By Theorem 5.1
each z ∈ N = N ε,τ lies on a leaf N (αT ) for some T ≥ τ and some α in
the ascending disk Sεu and where αT := φ−T α. Then the continuous map
θ : [0, ∞] × N → X defined by
θt z := GαT ◦ π+ ◦ φt ◦ G ∞ ◦ π+ (z) = GαT ◦ φt ◦ π+ (z),

(68)

is called the induced semi-flow on N ; see Figure 9. It is of class C r away
from the stable manifold. Here (68) simplifies as G ∞ = (0, id) and π+ |E + = 1l.
Observe that while θ apriori only takes values in the image F ⊃ N of the
graph maps, it does preserve the leaves of F ; see Corollary 5.3. Now continuity
on [0, ∞) × N follows from continuity of the maps involved. Given z ∈ N (αT ),
set z+ := π+ z. Since z+ lies in the stable manifold by construction of our ”flat”
coordinates, we obtain that z+ (t) := φt z+ → 0, as t → ∞. So firstly the limit
θ∞ z := lim θt z = GαT lim z+ (t) = GαT (0) = αT
t→∞

t→∞

exists and lies in the unstable manifold indeed. Here we used continuity of GαT
and the final identity holds by Theorem 1.2. Secondly θt z → θ∞ z, as t → ∞.
This shows, firstly, that the map

Figure 9: Leaf preserving semi-flow θt
is a retraction and, secondly, that the map θ extends continuously to [0, ∞] × N .
The fact that the origin is a fixed point of π+ and φt implies that
θt αT = GαT ◦ φt ◦ π+ (0) = GαT (0) = αT .
Hence θt |D = idD , for every t ∈ [0, ∞]. It remains to show that θt actually
preserves N . It suffices to show that θt preserves each leaf of the foliation
[
N = N (0) ∪
N (αT ).
T ≥τ
α∈Sεu

In contrast to the infinite dimensional case [Web14b] a simple compactness
argument will do. Note that any leaf, other than N (0) = Wεs , is of the form
N (αT ) = GαT (B + ) ∩ {f ≤ c + ε},

∂N (αT ) = GαT (B + ) ∩ {f = c + ε},

whereas N (0) = G ∞ (B + ) ∩ {f ≤ c + ε} = Wεs and ∂N (0) = Sεs . Now since the
boundary of N (αT ) lies in a level set of f and θs preserves the graph of GαT we
only need to show that there is a constant −µ < 0 such that

d 
f (θt z) ≤ −µ < 0,
∀z ∈ ∂N (αT ), ∀αT ∈ D.
(70)
dt t=0
This means that the θ flow is inward pointing along the boundary of each leaf
and then we are done. But (70) holds true for some constant, call it −2µ, along
the (compact) boundary Sεs of the leaf N (0), just because θt = φt on N (0) and
f strictly decreases along its downward gradient flow – unless there is a critical
point which it isn’t on Sεs . Compactness of the leaf space D and of the boundary
d
θt ,
of each leaf, together with continuity of the maps whose composition is dt
then implies that (70) holds true for all nearby leaves. To restrict to nearby
leaves just fix ε > 0 sufficiently small and τ > 1 sufficiently large.

33

Global foliation
To extend the foliation of the neighborhood Nxs of x all along the stable manifold
W s (x), that is in the backward time direction, according to Convention 1.5, that
is without using the backward flow, is an interesting open problem – even more
so in heat flow situations such as [Web14b].
