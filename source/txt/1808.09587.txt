Abstract. We extend a factorization theorem by Gwoździewicz and Hejmej from
the ring of formal power series to any complete regular local ring R. More precisely, let f ∈ R and assume that its Newton polyhedron has a loose edge such
that the initial formal of f along the latter is a product of two coprime polynomials, where one of them is not divided by any variable. Then this provides a
factorization of f in R. As a consequence we obtain a factorization theorem for
Weierstraß polynomials with coefficients in R, which generalizes an earlier result
by Rond and the author.

1. Introduction
The goal of this article is a generalization of a factorization result by Gwoździewicz
and Hejmej from K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]] to any (complete) regular local ring. (See the results
below). We reduce their proof to the essence which is the fact that K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]
is complete and provide a new viewpoint via projections of the Newton polyhedron.
Note that R may even have mixed characteristics.
Let (R, m, K = R/m) be a regular local ring (not necessarily complete) with regub the m-adic completion
lar sytem of parameters (x) = (x1 , . . . , xn ). We denote by R
b = R). For an element f ∈ R, one can define
of R. (If R is complete, we have R
the notion of a Newton polyhedron NP(f ) ⊂ Rn≥0 . The latter is a closed convex
set with the property NP(f ) + Rn≥0 = NP(f ) and coming from the set of exponents
of an expansion of f . A loose edge of NP(f ) is a compact face of dimension one,
say E ⊂ NP(f ), that is not contained in any compact face of NP(f ) of dimension
≥ 2. (In fact, we study loose edges in the slightly more general setting of F -subsets
later). Associated to such an edge, we have the initial form inE (f ) of f (determined
by those terms of an expansion contributing to the edge in the polyhedron) which
lies in a graded ring grE (R) that is isomorphic to a polynomial ring K[X1 , . . . , Xn ].
(In the remaining introduction, we use this identification without mentioning). For
more details on these objects, we refer to sections 2 and 3.
Theorem 1.1. Let R be a regular local ring. Let f ∈ R be an element in R such
that the Newton polyhedron NP(f ) has a loose edge E. Suppose that the initial form
inE (f ) of f along E is a product of two coprime polynomials G and H, where G is
b in the completion of
not divided by any variable. Then there exist elements gb, b
h∈R
R such that

f = gb · b
h in R
h) = H, for certain faces E1 , E2 of dimension at most one
g ) = G and inE2 (b
and inE1 (b
such that E = E1 + E2 .
We cannot avoid to pass to the completion since the construction of the elements
gb and b
h is not necessarily finite and hence may lead to an infinite series.

Corollary 1.2. Assume that the Newton polyhedron of f ∈ R has a loose edge and
b
at least three vertices. Then f is not irreducible in R.

Corollary 1.3. Assume that the Newton polyhedron of f ∈ R has a loose edge E.
b then E is the only compact edge of NP(f ) and
If f is irreducible in R,
inE (f ) = ǫ · P k ,

where ǫ ∈ K× is a unit and P ∈ K[X1 , . . . , Xn ] is an irreducible polynomial. Moreover, if the residue field K is algebraically closed, P = X α + λX β , for some λ ∈ K×
and α − β ∈ Zn is a primitive lattice vector.
An edge E is called descendant if it is parallel to a vector δ = (δ1 , . . . , δn ) ∈ Rn
such that δi ≥ 0, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and δn < 0.
Theorem 1.4. Let f ∈ R[z]. Assume that the Newton polyhedron NP(f ) has a
descendant, loose edge E. If inE (f ) is a product of two coprime polynomials G, H ∈
b
K[X1 , . . . , Xn , Z], where G is monic with respect to Z, then there exist gb, b
h ∈ R[z]
such that
b
f =b
g ·b
h in R[z]

b
b is monic, inE (b
where gb ∈ R[z]
1 g ) = G and inE2 (h) = H, for certain faces E1 , E2 of
dimension at most one such that E = E1 + E2 .

In Theorems 1.1 and 1.4, E1 is an compact edge of NP(b
g ) parallel to E and E2 is
b
either a compact edge of NP(h) parallel to E or a vertex.
Theorems 1.1, 1.4 and Corollaries 1.2, 1.3 generalize Theorems 1.1, 1.4 and Corollaries 1.2, 1.3 of [GHe], where the case R = K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]] is considered. The key
step to transfer the proofs of [GHe] into the more general setting is to lift an element
G ∈ grE (R) of the graded ring to an element g ∈ R. (Note that g is not unique in
general). Besides that, we provide a different perspective on the refinement of the
grading of grE (R), by considering the projection of Rn≥0 along the vector δ ∈ Rn
determined by the direction of the edge E. In particular, we show that E being
loose implies that the projection of the Newton polyhedron along δ has exactly one
vertex corresponding to E (Lemma 3.10). In contrast to [GHe], we formulate convex
geometry results that are used to study Newton polyhedra with loose edges in a
more general variant in terms of F -subsets.
In [GHe] section 3, one may find other known results for which our results can
be considered as generalizations. In particular, Theorem 1.4 is some kind of generalization of a result by Rond and the author [RS], where R = K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]],
for any field K and f ∈ R[z] is a Weierstraß polynomial of degree d such that the
projection of NP(f ) along an edge containing (0, . . . , 0, d) ∈ Rn+1
≥0 has exactly one
vertex. This type irreducibility criterion is very useful in the study of quasi-ordinary
hypersurfaces (see [ACLM] or [MS]). Therefore, our main results open interesting
new directions in the context of constructing Teissier’s overweight deformations [T]
following the philosophy of [MS].

2. Newton Polyhedron and Graded Rings
We provide the definitions of the Newton polyhedron and the initial form along
a face of the Newton polyhedron.
Let (R, m, K = R/m) be a regular local ring (not necessarily complete) and let
(x) = (x1 , . . . , xn ) be a regular system of parameters for R. We consider f ∈ R\{0}.

The Newton polyhedron NP(f ) := NP(f, x) of f is defined as the smallest closed
convex subset of Rn≥0 containing all points of the set
{A ∈ Zn≥0 | ρA 6= 0} + Rn≥0 .
A linear form L = Lλ : Rn → R is a map defined by
L(v) := λ1 v1 + . . . + λn vn = hλ, vi,
for v = (v1 , . . . vn ) ∈ Rn and some fixed λ = (λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈ Rn≥0 . Given L, we define
∆(L) := {v ∈ Rn≥0 | L(v) ≤ 1}.
If λ ∈ Qn≥0 , then L is called rational. If λ ∈ Rn+ , then we say that L is positive.
A closed convex subset ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 such that ∆ + Rn≥0 = ∆ is called a F -subset of
Rn≥0 , see [H] p. 260. We extend this notion by calling a closed convex subset ∆ ⊂ Rn
a F -subset if ∆ + Rn≥0 = ∆. Clearly, NP(f ) is an example of a F -subset.
Definition 2.1. Let ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 be a F -subset of Rn≥0 . A convex subset F ⊂ ∆ is
called a face of ∆ if there exists a linear form L such that
∆ ∩ ∆(L) = F.
If L is positive, then F defines a compact face. A vertex of ∆ is a compact face
v ∈ ∆ of dimension zero. An edge of ∆ is a compact face E ⊂ ∆ of dimension one.
A positive linear form L : Rn → R, induces a monomial valuation νL on R via

νL (f ) = min{L(A) | A ∈ Zn≥0 : ρA ∈ R× }.

Definition 2.2. Let (R, m, K) be as before and let L : Rn → R be a positive linear
form. The graded ring of R associated to L is defined as
M
grL (R) :=
Pa /Pa+ ,
a∈R≥0

where Pa :=

inL (f ) := inL (f )x :=

A:L(A)=νL (f )

where ρA := ρA mod m ∈ K and (X) = (X1 , . . . , Xn ) denotes the images of (x) in
grL (R).
Since L takes only values in a discrete subset of R, the set {a ∈ R≥0 | Pa /Pa+ 6= 0}
is a discrete subset of R. We observe that inL (f ) is weighted homogenous of degree
νL (f ) with respect to the weights on (x) given by L. Since L is positive, we have

3. Loose Edges and Projected Polyhedra
We recall the notion of a loose edge and some of their properties proven in [GHe].
Furthermore, we provide a different viewpoint via a suitable projection of a given
F -subset. Even though [GHe] considers only the case R = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] the proofs
apply in our more general setting since the statements are either on the convex geometry of a F -subset or on the properties of the graded ring grL (R) ∼
= K[X1 , . . . , Xn ],
for some positive linear form L.
Definition 3.1. Let ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 be a F -subset of Rn≥0 . A loose edge of ∆ is a compact
edge E ⊂ ∆ that is not contained in any compact face of ∆ of dimension ≥ 2.
Lemma 3.2. Let ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 be a F -subset with a loose edge E ⊂ ∆ that has ends
α, β ∈ Rn≥0 . Let L : Rn → R be a linear form such that L(α) = L(β). For every
γ ∈ ∆, we have L(γ) ≥ L(α).
The same proof as for [GHe] Lemma 2.1 applies. In fact, this is also a corollary from
Lemma 3.10 below.
The crucial point in the previous result is that L is a linear form that is not
necessarily positive, see the example below. For positive linear forms the statement
is true for any compact face of ∆.
Example 3.3. Let ∆ ⊂ R3≥0 be the F -subset defined given by the three vertices
α = (1, 0, 0), β = (0, 1, 0), and γ = (0, 0, 1). Consider the linear form L : R3 → R
with L(v1 , v2 , v3 ) = v1 + v2 . Clearly, the edge E with ends α and β is not loose. We
observe that L(α) = L(β) = 1 > 0 = L(γ).
Lemma 3.4. Let ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 be a F -subset with a loose edge E ⊂ ∆ that has ends
α = (α1 , . . . , αn ), β = (β1 , . . . , βn ) ∈ Rn≥0 . If min{α1 , β1 } = . . . = min{αn , βn } = 0,
then α and β are the only vertices of ∆.
The same proof as for [GHe] Lemma 2.2 applies. This can also be deduced from
Lemma 3.10.
A F -subset ∆ ⊂ Rm
≥0 , m ∈ Z+ , is called orthant if it has exactly one vertex, i.e.,
if ∆ = v + Rm
,
for
some
v ∈ Rm
≥0
≥0 . This notion plays an important role in [RS].
Remark 3.5. The main result of [RS] uses the associated polyhedron
∆P := ∆(P ; x; z) ⊂ Rd≥0
P
of a Weierstraß polynomial P = z d + (A,b) ρA,b xA z b ∈ K[[x1 , . . . , xn ]][z], where
ρA,b ∈ K. Here, ∆P ⊂ Rn≥0 is the projection of the Newton polyhedron NP(P ) ⊂
Rn+1
≥0 from the distinguished point (0, . . . , 0, d) onto the subspace determined by the
variables (x1 , . . . , n
xn ). In other words,
o ∆P is the smallest F -subset containing all
A
points of the set d · d−b | ρA,b 6= 0 . The interesting case in [RS] is when ∆P is
orthant. Then the unique vertex corresponds to a descendant edge of NP(P ) (that
is not necessarily loose).
The idea of projecting from the distinguished point corresponding to z d comes
from resolution of singularities and is used to provide refined information on a given
singularity, see [H], [CP2], [CS], [S].
Setup 3.6. We fix a F -subset ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 that has a loose edge E ⊂ ∆ with ends
α, β ∈ E. Let L : Rn → R be a positive linear form determining the edge E. We
define
δ := β − α.
Since α = (α1 , . . . , αn ) 6= β = (β1 , . . . , βn ), we may assume without loss of generality
βn < αn . This implies δn < 0. Note that L(δ) = L(β) − L(α) = 0 and hence there
exists at least one i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} such that δi > 0.

Further, let (R, m, K) be a regular local ring with regular system of parameters
(x1 , . . . , xn ). Recall that we denote the images of the latter in grL (R) by capital
letters (X1 , . . . , Xn ) and grL (R) ∼
= K[X1 , . . . , Xn ].
We adapt the idea of projecting a F -subset ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 in a suitable way to some
L
Our goal is to obtain a refinement of the grading grL (R) = a Pa /Pa+ . For
this, we do not project from a particular point, but along the vector δ that is defined
by the difference of the ends of the fixed loose edge E.

Construction 3.7 (Projection in direction δ). Let δ = (δ1 , . . . , δn ) ∈ Rn be any
vector with δn < 0 and δi > 0, for at least one i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}. Let v =
(v1 , . . . , vn ) ∈ Rn≥0 . The projection of v along δ to Rn−1 is given by

Note that v −

For w ∈ Rn−1 , we define

Iδ,w := pr−1

Given a F -subset ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 , we define the projection of ∆ along δ, denoted by
n−1

∆δ , as the smallest F -subset of Rn−1 containing prδ (∆), i.e., ∆δ = prδ (∆) + R≥0
We define
Rδn−1 := (Rn≥0 )δ ⊂ Rn−1
Remark 3.8.
(1) The condition δn < 0 and δi > 0, for at least one i, (up
to reordering the coordinates) is equivalent to the property that the line
generated by δ does intersect Rn≥0 only in the origin, i.e., (δ · R) ∩ Rn≥0 = {0}.
This is essential to obtain that Iδ,w is a finite set.
n−1
(2) It is possible that prδ (v) ∈ Rn−1 \ R≥0
. For example, if we consider δ =
(−1, 1, −1) and v = (0, 0, a), then (prδ (v), 0) = v + a·δ = (−a, a, 0), for every
a ∈ R≥0 . We observe that R2δ has a non-compact face that is not parallel to
a coordinate axis:

n−1
in this case.
In particular, Rδn−1 = R≥0

The previous leads to
Definition 3.9. Let δ = (δ1 , . . . , δn ) ∈ Rn be any vector with δn < 0 and δi > 0,
for at least one i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}. A F -subset ∆ ⊂ Rn−1 is called δ-orthant if it is

of the form ∆ = w + Rδn−1 + R≥0
Using this notation, we can provide a connection to [RS].

Lemma 3.10. Let ∆, E, δ be as in Setup 3.6. Since E is a loose edge, we obtain
that the projection ∆δ ⊂ Rn−1 is δ-orthant. In particular, if E is descendant, then
n−1
is orthant.
∆δ ⊂ R≥0
In general, the converse statement is not true, i.e., if ∆δ is δ-orthant for some
vector δ ∈ Rn , then δ does not necessarily determine a loose edge of ∆.
Proof. The result follows by the same arguments as [RS] Corollary 2.7 iv): Let
w1 = prδ (α) = prδ (β) be the vertex of ∆δ coming from the projection of the ends of
E. Suppose ∆δ is not orthant. Then there exists at least one further vertex w2 ∈ ∆δ ,
w2 6= w1 , such that the segment [w1 , w2 ] is contained in the boundary of ∆δ . Hence,
there exists a vertex γ ∈ ∆ with prδ (γ) = w2 . Clearly, α, β, γ are pairwise different
and the triangle defined by these three points is a face of ∆. This contradicts the
assumption that the edge given by α and β is loose.

we have

grL (R) =

where Sδ,w is the K-vector space with basis Bδ,w := {X A | A ∈ Iδ,w }. Let us point
out that the set {w ∈ Rn−1 | Sδ,w 6= 0} ⊂ Rn−1 is a discrete subset. Further, for all
w ∈ Rn−1 such that Sδ,w 6= 0, there exists at least one v ∈ Zn≥0 with prδ (v) = w.

The black triangle are all points v ∈ R3≥0 for which L(v) = a, for some fixed positive

(from R3≥0 to R2 × {0}) along a vector δ ∈ R3 with L(δ) = 0 (with δ descendant on
the left and δ not descendant on the right). The triangle on the right determined
by the dotted lines is a subset of {v ∈ R3 | L(v) = a}. As we see, there are v ∈ R3≥0
such that prδ (v) ∈ R2 \ R2≥0 .

In the situation of the previous observation, we have L(α) = L(β) if α and β
denote the end points of the loose edge E. (Recall Lemma 3.2). Furthermore, we
have prδ (α) = prδ (β) =: u, by construction, and hence X α , X β ∈ Sδ,u .
Let
on grL (R) ∼
= K[X1 , . . . , Xn ] given
L
L us point out that the constructed grading
by w∈Rn−1 Sδ,w is a variant of the grading w∈Zn−1 Rw by [GHe] (which is defined
≥0

by a certain weight ω, see loc. cit. before Lemma 2.4). The key in their construction
is to choose a particular basis ξ1 , . . . , ξn ∈ Zn≥0 of the vector space Rn such that the
projection along δ becomes the projection to the first this n − 1 coordinates with
respect to ξ1 , . . . , ξn (see loc. cit. Lemma 2.3).
The following two lemmas are the ingredients for the proof of Theorem 1.1. For
them, we need to introduce a variant of the set M defined in [GHe] before Lemma 2.4:
Let L : Rn → R be a positive linear form and let δ ∈ Rn be a vector with δn < 0
and L(δ) = 0. We define
Mδ := prδ (Zn≥0 ) ⊂ Rδn−1 .
Clearly, for w1 , w2 ∈ Mδ , we have w1 + w2 ∈ Mδ and dim Sδ,u > 0 implies u ∈ Mδ .
Note that Mδ 6= M (of [GHe]). In particular, dim Sδ,w 6= 0 for every w ∈ M.
Lemma 3.12. Let ∆, E, L, δ, R be as in Setup 3.6. Let u ∈ Rn−1 and w ∈ Mδ .
Assume that Sδ,u contains two coprime monomials. Then
dim Sδ,u+w = dim Sδ,u + dim Sδ,w − 1.

The same arguments as in the proof for [GHe] Lemma 2.4 apply: Using that the
dimension of Sδ,u coincides with the number of elements in Iδ,u (analogously for
dim Sδ,w ), the proof reduces to the combinatorial problem of determining the number
of points in Zn≥0 appearing on the sum of two parallel segments. For more details,
we refer to [GHe].
The assumption that Sδ,u contains two coprime monomials is essential as the
following example shows. This is the reason, why we have to impose in Theorem 1.1
that G is not divided by any variable. Another example for this (in the context of
factoring a given element f ∈ R) is given in [GHe] Remark 2.6.
Example 3.13. Let R := K[[x1 , x2 ]], for any field K. Consider δ = (3, −2) ∈ R2 .
For w ∈ R, we have
prδ−1 (w) = {v = (v1 , v2 ) ∈ R2≥0 | 2v1 + 3v2 = 2w}.

The following picture shows pr−1
δ (3.5) (red), prδ (6.5) (blue), and prδ (10) (black),
where filled points are lattice points corresponding to elements in Iδ,w .

e1
Thus, dim Sδ,3.5 = #Iδ,3.5 = 1, dim Sδ,6.5 = #Iδ,6.5 = 2, and dim Sδ,10 = #Iδ,10 = 4.
In particular, dim Sδ,3.5 + dim Sδ,6.5 − 1 = 2 6= 4 = dim Sδ,10 . But clearly, Sδ,6.5 does
not contain two coprime monomials.

Lemma 3.14. Let ∆, E, L, δ, R be as in Setup 3.6. Let G ∈ Sδ,u and H ∈ Sδ,w be
coprime polynomials. If G is not divisible by any monomial, then
GSδ,w+i + HSδ,u+i = Sδ,u+w+i ,

for every i ∈ Mδ .

The same proof as in [GHe] Lemma 2.5 applies: The idea is to show that the sequence
Φ

Ψ

0 → Sδ,i → Sδ,w+i × Sδ,u+i → Sδ,u+w+i → 0 is exact, where Φ(η) := (ηH, −ηG), for
η ∈ Sδ,i , and Ψ(ψ, ϕ) := ψG + ϕH, for (ψ, ϕ) ∈ Sδ,w+i × Sδ,u+i . The non-trivial part
is the surjectivity of Ψ which can be deduced using Lemma 3.12. For more details,
we refer to [GHe].
In order to adapt the proof of Theorem 1.1 for Theorem 1.4, one needs the following two results.
Lemma 3.15. Let ∆, E, L, δ, R be as in Setup 3.6. Let G ∈ Sδ,u and Hj ∈ Sδ,wj ,
for u, wj ∈ Mδ and j ∈ {1, 2}. Assume that, for every i ∈ Mδ ,
GSδ,wj +i + Hj Sδ,u+i = Sδ,u+wj +i , j ∈ {1, 2}.
Then, we have, for every i ∈ Mδ ,
GSδ,w1 +w2 +i + H1 H2 Sδ,u+i = Sδ,u+w1+w2 +i .
The same proof as in [GHe] Lemma 2.7 applies: This is a short computation applying
the hypothesis in a clever way. For details, we refer to [GHe].
Lemma 3.16. Let ∆, E, L, δ, R, (x1 , . . . , xn ) be as in Setup 3.6. Let G ∈ Sδ,u and
H ∈ Sδ,w be coprime polynomials. If G is monic with respect to Xn , then
GSδ,w+i + HSδ,u+i = Sδ,u+w+i ,

for every i ∈ Mδ .

The same proof as in [GHe] Lemma 2.8 applies (recall also the paragraph before
Lemma 2.8 in [GHe]): First, one proves the special case G = Xn and H ∈ Sδ,w ∩
K[X1 , . . . , Xn−1 ]. The rest follows then by Lemmas 3.14 and 3.15. For more details,
we refer to [GHe].
Remark 3.17. In contrast to [RS], we do not project from a distinguished point to
Rn−1 . (One candidate for such a point would be the end point β of the loose edge).
The reason for projecting along the vector δ given by the loose edge is to obtain an
appropriate refinement of the grading of grE (R) such that Lemma 3.12 holds which
is one of the key ingredients for the proofs.
Let us mention that the projection of NP(f ) along δ is δ-orthant if and only if
n−1
is orthant. Hence, this is another reason
the projection of NP(f ) from β to R≥0
why Lemma 3.10 yields a connection to [RS].

4. Proofs
We come to the proofs of the main theorems. The key step that allows to extend
the results in [GHe] to any complete regular local ring is the following:
Let (R, m, K) be a regular local ring, still not necessarily complete, with regular
system of parameters (x) = (x1 , . . . , xn ). Let ∆ ⊂ Rn≥0 be a F -subset, E ⊂ ∆ be a
loose edge, and L : Rn → R be a positive linear form defining E. As in Setup 3.6,
we introduce δ ∈ Rn with δn < 0 and L(δ) = 0.
Let w ∈ Mδ and let G ∈ Sδ,w ⊂ grL (R) ∼
= K[X1 , . . . , Xn ]. We can write G as a
finite sum

G=

Note that λA 6= 0 implies prδ (A) = w. For every A ∈ Zn≥0 with λA 6= 0, we choose
ρA ∈ R× with the property
ρA ≡ λA mod m.
Otherwise, we set ρA := 0 ∈ R. Using this, we define
X
g :=
ρA xA ∈ R.

Clearly, the image of g in grL (R) is G. (In fact, we can apply this procedure for any
element in grL (R), not only for those in Sδ,w ). Note that g is not unique and, in
particular, g depends on a choice of a system of representatives in R for the residue
field K = R/m. On the other hand, if K ⊂ R, then we can uniquely choose ρA := λA .
Using the above, we adapt the proofs of [GHe] to prove our results. Even though
this is straight forward, we believe it is more pedagogical to give the proofs of the
theorems. Moreover, we present a slightly different argument using Lemma 3.10.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let L : Rn → R be a positive linear form defining the edge
E. Let
a0 := νL (f ) and v := prδ (α) = prδ (β) ∈ Mδ ⊂ Rn−1 ,
where α, β ∈ E are the end points of the loose edge E. Without loss of generality,
we may assume that δ ∈ Rn fulfills the properties of Setup 3.6.
By hypothesis, we have inL (f ) = G · H ∈ Sδ,v . We set Gu := G ∈ Sδ,u and
Hw := H ∈ Sδ,w , for u, w ∈ Mδ . Let gu ∈ R (resp. hw ∈ R) be a lift of Gu (resp. Hw ),
as described before. We define φ1 := gu · hw , which is our first approximation of f .
For
f1 := f − φ1 = f − gu · hw ,
we have a1 := νL (f1 ) > a0 .
n
The vertices of NP(f1 ) lie in Z≥0 which implies that the vertices of NP(f1 )δ are
contained in Mδ . Since the projection NP(f )δ is δ-orthant (Lemma 3.10), we get
that each vertex of NP(f1 )δ is of the form
v + i = u + w + i,

for some i ∈ Mδ , i 6= 0.

In particular, inL (f1 ) ∈ grL (R) can be written as
X
(1)
(1)
inL (f1 ) =
Fu+w+i , for Fu+w+i ∈ Sδ,u+w+i.
i∈Mδ
L(u+w+i,0)=a1

By assumption Gu is not divisible by a monomial, hence, by Lemma 3.14, we have
Gu Sδ,w+i + Hw Sδ,u+i = Sδ,u+w+i,

for every i ∈ Mδ .

Thus, for every i ∈ Mδ with L(u + w + i, 0) = a1 , there are Hw+i ∈ Sδ,w+i and
(1)
Gu+i ∈ Sδ,u+i such that Fu+w+i = Gu Hw+i + Hw Gu+i . We choose hw+i , gu+i ∈ R,
as described before and define the second approximation of f by

Note that φ2 = gu hw + i6=0 (gu hw+i + hw gu+i ) + i,j6=0 gu+i hw+j and, by construction, νL (gu+i hw+j ) > a1 since L is positive. If we define
f2 := f − φ2 ,

we have

a2 := νL (f2 ) > a1 .

Corollary 1.2 is the same as for [GHe] Corollary 1.2, except that the reference to

Since E is descendant and G is monic in Z, the Newton polyhedron of g has a vertex
of the form (0, . . . , 0, d), for some d ∈ Z+ . Hence, the monomial ǫz d appears in an
