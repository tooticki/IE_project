Analytic p-adic Banach spaces and the
fundamental lemma of Colmez and Fontaine
Jérôme Plût
December 1, 2010
Abstract
This article gives a new proof of the fundamental lemma of the “weakly
admissible implies admissible” theorem of Colmez-Fontaine that describes
the semi-stable p-adic representations. To this end, we introduce the
category of spectral Banach spaces, which are p-adic Banach spaces with a
Cp -algebra of analytic functions, and the subcategory of effective BanachColmez spaces. The fundamental lemma states the surjectivity of certain
analytic maps and describes their kernel. It is proven by an explicit count
of solutions of the equations defining these maps. It is equivalent to the
existence of functions of dimension and height of effective Banach-Colmez
spaces.

Introduction
The “weakly admissible implies admissible” theorem of Colmez and
Fontaine [CF00, Théorème A] states that there exists an equivalence of categories between the semi-stable p-adic representations and an explicitly described
category of filtered (ϕ, N )-modules.
This theorem rests on a “fundamental
	 lemma” [CF00, 2.1], of an analytic
+
nature: let U = x ∈ Bcris
, ϕ(x) = px , and for h > 1, let Y = U h ×Chp Cp ,
where Cp → Chp is any Cp -linear map, and U h → Chp is the restriction of
+
the reduction map θ : Bcris
→ Cp . The fundamental lemma states that any
map f : Y → Cp of the form f (u1 , . . . , uh ) = u1 v1 +. . .+uh vh (for any vi ∈ Bcris
such that f does map Y to Cp ) is either surjective, or has a Qp -finite-dimensional
image.
This lemma was later improved by Colmez [Col02, 6.11], who proved that
in the case where the map f is surjective, its kernel has dimension h over Qp .
His proof uses sheaves of vector spaces over a suitable category of Cp -Banach
algebras.
This article gives an independent proof of the strong version of the fundamental lemma. To this aim, we introduce the new category of spectral Banach
spaces and we see the Qp -vector spaces spaces and linear maps involved in the
1

theorem as objects and morphisms of this category. The fundamental lemma
is then closely related to the structure of the subcategory of effective BanachColmez spaces. The spectral Banach spaces are also interesting objects by
themselves since, for example, they give a framework for the Fargues-Fontaine
theory [FF11, §8].
The spectral Banach spaces are Banach spaces, plus an extra analytic structure provided by a Cp -Banach algebra of analytic functions. This category naturally contains all finite-dimensional vector spaces over Qp or Cp . The objects
of the full subcategory of effective Banach-Colmez spaces are the extensions
of finite-dimensional Cp -vector spaces by finite-dimensional Qp -vector spaces.
This is for example the case of the spaces

	
+
Ed,h = x ∈ Bcris
, ϕh (x) = pd x
for 0 6 d 6 h.
(0.0.1)

These objects are fundamental to the proof of the fundamental lemma, as it
reduces to the two following facts:
– any effective Banach-Colmez space of dimension one is isomorphic to the
direct sum of E1,h and a finite-dimensional Qp -vector space;
– for all f0 , . . . , fh−1 ∈ Cp , the map E1,h → Cp , x 7→ f0 θ(x) +
+
. . . fh−1 θ(ϕh−1 (x)) (where θ : Bcris
→ Cp is the reduction morphism),
is either zero, or surjective with a kernel of dimension h over Qp .
The fundamental lemma is also interpreted as the existence of natural functions
of dimension and height on the category of effective Banach-Colmez spaces.

The first part of this article describes the category of spectral Banach spaces
and explains the analytic structure on some usual objects of p-adic Hodge theory.
The second part proves the fundamental lemma. It first establishes the main
properties of the objects Ed,h , then the structure theorem of effective BanachColmez spaces and the fundamental lemma for E1,h as described above.
This is part of a work accomplished during a PhD thesis at Université ParisSud 11 (Orsay) under the supervision of Pr. Jean-Marc Fontaine.

Notations
Throughout this document, we use the following notations from [Fon94]:p is a
prime number, Qp is the field of p-adic integers, and Cp is the completed algebraic closure of Qp . For any integer h, Qph is the unique unramified extension
of Qp of degree h. We write ϕ for the absolute Frobenius automorphism and [·]
for the Teichmüller lift. We define Zp (1) as the Tate module of the multiplicative
p
group C×
p : its elements are families (εn ) such that εn+1 = εn and ε0 = 1.
For any p-adic ring B, OB is the ring of integers of B. The multiplication
map by p on OCp /p is a ring homomorphism; we define the ring R as the
projective limit of OCp for this map. The projection map R → OCp /p extends
to a natural map θ : W (R) → OCp , where W (R) is the ring of Witt vectors
2

with coefficients in R. Let Acris be the p-adic completion of the divided power
hull of W (R), relative to the canonical divided powers on the ideal ker θ; also
+
define Bcris
= Acris [ p1 ]. It is a discrete valuation ring, with quotient ring Cp and
maximal ideal generated by an element t such that ϕ(t) = p · t.
For any two integers d > 0, h > 1, we define the slope space

+
+
Ed,h = ker ϕh − pd : Bcris
−→ Bcris
.
(0.0.2)

For any non-negative rational α = hd with d, h coprime, we also write Eα = Ed,h ;
in particular, Ed = Ed,1 . The slope spaces, and in particular E1,h , play a
central role in the proofs given below. These spaces also appear in [FF11] under
ϕh =pd
the name BE
. They are the graded quotients of the structure ring of the
Fargues-Fontaine curve [FF11, 9.1,10.1].

Spectral Banach spaces

For the convenience of the reader, we give a self-contained presentation of spectral Banach spaces. Some results are only stated; complete proofs can be found
in [Plû09].

1.1

Spectral affine varieties

Let p be a prime number. Let Qp be the field of p-adic numbers, Cp be the
completion of the algebraic closure of Qp , and OCp be the ring of integers of Cp .
We consider the categories of Banach spaces (and algebras) over Qp as topological spaces, that is, up to equivalence of norm. A lattice of a Banach space E
over Qp is a closed subgroup E such that the canonical map E ⊗Zp Qp → E is
an isomorphism.
Definition 1.1.1. Let A be a topological Cp -algebra. The spectrum Sp A of A
is the set of all continuous Cp -algebra morphisms from A to Cp .
By the Gelfand transform, any element a of a topological Cp -algebra A may
be seen as a function on S = Sp A by defining a(s) = s(a) ∈ Cp for s ∈ Sp A.
The spectrum is endowed with the weak topology, i.e. the coarsest topology for
which all elements of a are continuous on S.
To each open set Ω ⊂ S and each a ∈ A, we attach the semi-norm on A
defined by
kakΩ = sup {|a(s)|, s ∈ Ω} ∈ [0, +∞].
(1.1.2)
The set Ω is bounded if there exists an open set A ⊂ A and a constant M < +∞
such that kakΩ < M for all a ∈ A.
Definition 1.1.3. A topological Cp -algebra A is pro-spectral if Sp A is nonempty, Sp A is the reunion of all bounded open sets Ω, and the topology on A is
defined by the family of semi-norms k·kΩ . It is spectral if S = Sp A is bounded
and k·kS is a norm defining the topology on A.
3

If A is a pro-spectral Cp -algebra, then the natural morphism from A to the
algebra of continuous functions on Sp A is injective. In particular, A is reduced.
Conversely, if A is reduced and topologically of finite type over Cp , then it is
spectral [FVdP04, 3.4.9].
For example, the set Cp {X} of formal series with radius of convergence > 1 is a spectral algebra, with spectrum homeomorphic to the closed
ball OCp [FVdP04, II.4.4]. The set of formal series with infinite radius of convergence is a pro-spectral algebra, with spectrum homeomorphic to Cp .
Definition 1.1.4. The category of affine spectral varieties (over Cp ) is the
opposite category to that of pro-spectral algebras (and continuous Cp -algebra
morphisms).
We shall only consider affine spectral varieties, and consequently omit the
word “affine”.
The forgetful functor from the category of spectral varieties to that of topological spaces is faithful; therefore, we may see a spectral variety as a topological
space with some extra structure. A morphism of spectral varieties will also be
called analytic. For any pro-spectral Cp -algebra A, we write Sp A for the spectral variety attached to A.
Let S = Sp A be a spectral variety. We say that S is
– bounded if A is spectral;
– étale if S is a locally profinite topological space, and A = C 0 (S, Cp );
– connected if A has no idempotent elements apart from zero and one;
– rigid if A is topologically of finite type over Cp .
There is a natural functor from the category of locally profinite topological
spaces to that of spectral varieties. It is fully faithful and left-adjoint to the forgetful functor: all continuous applications from an étale spectral variety to any
spectral variety are analytic [Plû09, 1.4.4]. The only analytic morphisms from
a connected spectral variety to an étale variety are the constant maps [Plû09,
1.6.10].
A morphism of spectral varieties is surjective if the underlying continuous
function is surjective. This implies that the corresponding Cp -algebra morphism
is an (always injective) isometry for the spectral norm [Plû09, 1.6.1].
The category of spectral varieties has projective limits for families of surjective morphisms indexed by N, corresponding to completed unions of pro-spectral
algebras; it also has finite fibre products, corresponding to completed tensor
products of pro-spectral algebras [Plû09, 1.6.5,1.6.7]. These constructions are
compatible with the underlying topological spaces.

1.2

Spectral groups and Banach spaces

Definition 1.2.1. An (affine, commutative) spectral group is a group object in
the category of affine spectral varieties.
4

Since all groups considered will be affine and commutative, these adjectives
will henceforth be omitted.
The spectral groups inherit from the spectral varieties the existence of finite
fibre products and projective limits of countable surjective morphisms. Since finite fibre products exist, this category has kernels. We say that a short sequence
of spectral groups is exact if the underlying group sequence is exact.
A prorigid spectral group is a projective limit of a countable family of rigid
spectral groups and surjective spectral group morphisms. Prorigid spectral
groups admit the following two properties ([Plû09, 3.4.4 and 3.4.9]):
Proposition 1.2.2 (Global inversion). Let f : G → H be a morphism of
prorigid spectral groups. If f is bijective, then it is an (analytic) isomorphism.
Proposition 1.2.3 (Connected-étale sequence). Let G be a prorigid spectral
group. Then G admits a biggest étale quotient π0 (G) and a biggest connected
subgroup G0 , and there exists a canonical exact sequence
0 −→ G0 −→ G −→ π0 (G) −→ 0.
Definition 1.2.4. An effective spectral Banach space is a spectral
  group E
that is a Banach space and such that the multiplication map × p1 : E → E is
analytic.
If E is an effective spectral Banach space, then any lattice E of E is a
spectral group. An effective spectral Banach space E is prorigid if there exists
a lattice E ⊂ E that is prorigid as a spectral group. In this case, in view of the
global inversion theorem, the condition of analyticity of the multiplication by p1
is automatically satisfied. Any prorigid Banach space admits a connected-étale
sequence; moreover, this sequence splits (non-canonically) [Plû09, 3.5.5].
Examples 1.2.5. Some examples of effective spectral Banach spaces and spectral groups are:
(i) The étale effective spectral Banach spaces are exactly the finitedimensional Qp -vector spaces V , as well as the set c0 (Qp ) of all convergent
sequences [BGR84, 2.8.2/2].
(ii) Any finite-dimensional Cp -vector space L = Cdp has a canonical structure
as a (connected, prorigid) spectral Banach space, where the analytic functions are the everywhere convergent formal series in d variables [Plû09,
3.3.3].
(iii) Since multiplication by p on OCp is analytic and surjective, the projective
limit R is a spectral group. Its ring structure and the canonical ring
morphism R → OCp /p are analytic [Plû09, 4.2.1].
(iv) The ring of Witt vectors W (R) is spectral, as well as the W (R)-module
of Witt bivectors

BW (R) = (xn )n∈Z , lim inf vR (xn ) > 0 .

Moreover, the ring morphism θ : BW (R) → Cp and Frobenius ϕ :
BW (R) → BW (R) are analytic [Plû09, 4.3.4].
+
The ring Bcris
does not have a (canonical) analytic structure. However,
+
there exists a canonical
P −n pninjection η : BW (R) ֒→ Bcris , which maps the bivector (xn )n∈Z to
p xn ; this map is easily seen to be W (R)-linear and continuous.

Proposition 1.2.7 ([Plû09, 4.4.3]). Let d 6 h be two integers such that 0 6
d 6 h, h > 1.
(i) Ed,h is the set of all bivectors (xn )n∈Z ∈ BW (R) satisfying the periodicity
h−d
condition xn−d = xnp
for all n ∈ Z.
(ii) The analytic structure given by this homeomorphism between Ed,h and mdR
makes Ed,h an effective spectral Banach subspace of BW (R).
(iii) The Frobenius morphism ϕ : Ed,h → Ed,h and the reduction morphism θ :
Ed,h → Cp are analytic.
(iv) For any c ∈ Qph , the multiplication map by c on Ed,h is analytic; for
any d + d′ 6 h, the multiplication map Ed,h × Ed′ ,h → Ed+d′ ,h is analytic.

Effective Banach-Colmez spaces

Definition 2.0.1. The category of effective Banach-Colmez spaces is the full
subcategory of all effective spectral Banach spaces E that insert in an analytic
short exact sequence
0 −→ V −→ E −→ L −→ 0,
(2.0.2)
with V being a finite-dimensional Qp -vector space and L being a finitedimensional Cp -vector space. Such a short exact sequence is a presentation
of E.
The integers h = dimQp V and d = dimQp L are called the height and dimension of this presentation.
Although effective Banach-Colmez spaces seem to be a very specific case
of spectral Banach spaces, the logarithmic exponential sequence proves that
the group of p-division points of any rigid group has a natural structure as a
Banach-Colmez space [FF11, 7.32].
The integers d and h do a priori depend on the choice of the presentation.
The strong version of the fundamental lemma is equivalent to the fact, which we
prove in this section, that these integers actually depend only on the effective
Banach-Colmez space E itself.
We start this section by precising the structure of some Banach-Colmez
spaces via p-divisible groups; we then compute the extension group Ext1 (L, V ),
which in turns allow to state a structure theorem for one-dimensional BanachColmez spaces. This allows us to prove the “fundamental lemma” by reducing
to the case where E = E1/h .

2.1

p-divisible groups and effective Banach-Colmez spaces

Let k be a perfect subfield of Fp and Γ be a p-divisible group [Dem72, II.11]
over k. There exists an anti-equivalence of categories between p-divisible groups
over k and Dieudonné modules [Dem72, III.8] over the ring of Witt vectors W (k).
A Dieudonné module is a free module of finite type M over W (k), with a semilinear map ϕ : M → M such that ϕ(M ) ⊃ pM . We write M (Γ) for the
Dieudonné module associated with a p-divisible group Γ.
Proposition 2.1.1. Let M be a Dieudonné module.
+
(i) For any continuous morphism f : M → Bcris
commuting with ϕ, the image
of f is contained in BW (R).

(ii) The group

+
E(M ) = HomW (k),ϕ (M, Bcris
)

has a canonical structure as a spectral Banach space.
Proof. (i) Up to a finite extension k ′ of the field k, M is isomorphic( [Dem72,
IV.4]) to a direct sum of modules of the form Md,h = W (k)[ϕ]/(ϕh − pd ).
Since E(M ⊗k k ′ ) = E(M ), its is enough to prove this when M = Md,h . The
condition ϕ(M ) ⊃ pM then means that d 6 h, and thus by 1.2.7(ii), the image
of f lies in Ed,h ⊂ BW (R).
(ii) Let h be the rank of the free module M over W (k). Then E(M ) is the
kernel of the map F : x 7→ x◦ϕ−ϕ◦x from HomW (k) (M, BW (R)) = BW (R)h to
itself. The map F is analytic by 1.2.7(iii) and therefore its kernel is spectral. ⊳
Proposition 2.1.2. Let Γ be a p-divisible group over k, of dimension d and
height h, and let M be the Dieudonné module of Γ. Let R be the complete,
perfect ring of characteristic p defined in 1.2.5(iii). Then the group Γ(R) has a
canonical structure as a spectral Banach space, and it is canonically isomorphic
to the space E(M ) defined in Prop. 2.1.1.
Proof. Let d be the dimension of Γ. Since Γ is smooth, by [Dem72, II.10,II.11],
the choice of a basis of the tangent space to Γ defines an isomorphism between
the affine algebra of Γ and the formal series algebra kJx1 , . . . , xd K. Such an
isomorphism also identifies the set Γ(R) with mdR . Moreover, any other choice
of coordinates amounts to a k-linear automorphism of mdR , which is always
analytic. We thus define the analytic structure on Γ(R) by transport from mdR .
By definition of the Dieudonné functor [Fon77, III.1.2], we know that Γ(R) =
HomW (k),ϕ (M, CW (R)). Since Γ(R) is p-divisible, there exists a group isomorphism
Γ(R) = HomW (k),ϕ (M, CW (R)) = HomW (k),ϕ (M, BW (R)).

(2.1.3)

By 1.2.7(i), there exists a natural group isomorphism η : E(M ) → Γ(R).
Let (e1 , . . . , eh ) be a W (k)-basis of M such that (e1 , . . . , ed ) is a basis
of M/ϕ(M ). Identifying E(M ) with a subspace of BW (R)h through this choice
of coordinates, the map η is then (x1 , . . . , xh ) 7→ (x1,0 , . . . , xh,0 ), where (xi,0 ) is
7

the zero component of the Witt bivector xi . This map is therefore analytic.
Since both spaces are prorigid, by the global inversion theorem, η is an analytic
isomorphism. ⊳
Proposition 2.1.4. Let B be a complete, perfect k-algebra. There exists a
natural bijection between the set of continuous algebra morphisms
HomW (k),cont (W (B), OCp )

≃

Homk,cont (B, R).

Proof. Let f : B → R be a continuous k-algebra morphism. Since B is perfect,
p
there exists a unique sequence of maps fn : B → R such that f0 = f and fn+1
=
fn .
P n
Let x = (xn )n>0 ∈ W (B). Then the series
p θ(fn (xn )) converges to
some value g(x) ∈ OCp , and the map g : W (B) → OCp is a continous W (k)algebra morphism. We define a map Θ : Hom(W (B), OCp ) → Hom(B, R) by
defining Θ(f ) = g.
Conversely, given a continous morphism g : W (R) → OCp and x ∈ B,
−n
let xn = pn [x]p
be the Witt vector with n-th coordinate equal to x, and
define f (x) = (g(xn ))n>0 . We see that the map g 7→ f is the inverse of Θ. ⊳
Proposition 2.1.5. Let Γ be a connected p-divisible group over k and G be a
smooth formal group over W (k) such that G ⊗W (k) k = Γ. Then the following
hold:
(i) The group E(M ) is canonically isomorphic to Hom(Qp , G(OCp )).
(ii) Let tG be the tangent space to G at zero and T (Γ) be the Tate module Hom(Qp /Zp , Γ). Then there exists an analytic exact sequence
0 −→ T (Γ)(k) ⊗Zp Qp −→ E(M ) −→ tG (OCp ) ⊗Zp Qp −→ 0.
In particular, E(M ) is an effective Banach-Colmez space.
Proof. (i) Let A and B be the affine algebras of G and Γ, and [p]A : A → A,
[p]B : B → B be the multiplication by p in the corresponding groups. Let A′
and B ′ be the projective limits of A and B for the maps [p]A and [p]B . Since Γ is
connected, [p]B is cofinal to the Frobenius map of B, and B ′ is therefore canonically isomorphic to the completion of the radical closure of B. The reduction
map A → B then extends to a map A′ → B ′ , whose reduction modulo p is an
isomorphism A′ /pA′ ≃ B ′ . Since A′ is p-adically separated and complete and B ′
is perfect, A′ is isomorphic to to the ring of Witt vectors W (B ′ ). Moreover, A′
represents, by construction, the group functor U (G) = Hom(Qp , G).
there exists a bijection between the
By Proposition 2.1.4,
sets Hom(A′ , OCp ) = U (G)(OCp ) and Hom(B ′ , R) = Γ(R). Moreover,
this bijection being functorial in Γ, it is actually a group isomorphism.
Therefore, the three group functors U (G)(OCp ), Γ(R) and (by 2.1.2) E(M )
are functorially isomorphic. In particular, the first of those three groups is
independent of the choice of the lift G.
8

The exact sequence in 2.1.5(ii) is the logarithmic exact sequence from [Tat67,
§4], tensored with Qp . Since T (Γ)(k) ⊗Zp Qp is étale, the left morphism is
analytic; the right morphism is the formal group logarithm of G and, therefore,
is analytic. ⊳
Let Md,h = W (k)[ϕ]/(ϕh − pd ). Then Md,h is a Dieudonné module
and E(Md,h ) = Ed,h . By 2.1.2, there exists a canonical analytic structure
on Ed,h = E(Md,h ). Moreover, the choice of a lift of the p-divisible group
associated to Md,h gives a presentation of Ed,h with height h and dimension d.
Proposition 2.1.6. Let M be a Dieudonné module. Then the group of analytical linear applications from E(M ) to Cp is canonically isomorphic to M ⊗W (k)
Cp .
See [Plû09, 5.2.7] for a complete proof.
Sketch of proof. The map F : M ⊗W (k) Cp → Homan (M, Cp ) associates to an
element x ⊗ λ the analytic function
E(M ) −→ Cp

To prove that F is bijective, we may, as in Prop. 2.1.1, assume that there exist
integers 0 6 d 6 h such that M = Md,h . In this case, we identify Md,h ⊗ Cp
to Chp , and thus F (λ0 , . . . , λh−1 ) = λ0 θ + . . . + λh−1 θ ◦ ϕh−1 . This map is
injective.
Finally, the surjectivity of F may be proven using an explicit computation
of the analytic structure of E(M ) as a projective limit of rigid Banach spaces
associated to particular submodules of M . ⊳

‹

For any effective Banach-Colmez space E, let ECp be the Cp -vector space
of analytic morphisms from E to Cp , and ECp for the dual Cp -vector space
to ECp . The biduality morphism ι : E → ECp is called the vector hull of E.
We see by taking coordinates that any morphism from E to a Cp -vector space
factorizes uniquely through ι. In particular, according to proposition 2.1.6, for
any 0 6 d 6 h, the space (Ed,h )Cp is canonically isomorphic to Chp , with the
hull map being given by ι(x) = (θ(ϕr (x)))r=0,...,h−1 .

2.2

The universal extension of Cp by Qp


	
+
The Banach-Colmez space E1 = x ∈ Bcris
, ϕ(x) = x has the canonical presentation [Fon94, 5.3.7.(ii)]
θ

0 −→ Qp (1) −→ E1 −−→ Cp −→ 0,

(2.2.1)

+
where θ is the restriction to E1 of the reduction map θ : Bcris
→ Cp .
This extension is universal in the following way. Let V be a h-dimensional
Qp -vector space, L be a d-dimensional Cp -vector space, and f : L → V ⊗ Cp

9

be a Cp -linear application. We may then form the fibre product E(f ) in the

Then E(f ) is an effective spectral Banach space, and (2.2.2) is a presentation
of E(f ) as an effective Banach-Colmez space. The Banach space E(f ) is connected if f (L) ∩ V = V (or equivalently, if the transpose map t f : VQp → LCp is
injective); it is étale if L = 0.
Lemma 2.2.3. Define a p-extractible element of Cp {X} as an element that
admits a pm -th root in Cp {X} for all m.
Let g ∈ Cp {X} be such that g(0) = 1 and g(x)p /g(px) is p-extractible. Then
g is the product of an exponential function and a p-extractible element.
m

p
Proof. Write g(x)Q
/g(px) = um (x)p for all m ∈ N. Then, for any n, the
product vn (x) = m>0 un+m+1 (pm x) converges, and vn ∈ Cp {X}. Moreover,
p
vn+1
= vn by construction, so that v0 is p-extractible. Let w = g/v0 .
n
Then from the relations vn (x) = un+1 (x)vn+1 (px) and w = vnp /g we deduce w(x)p = w(px). Taking the logarithmic derivative of this relation yields
(w′ /w)(x) = (w′ /w)(px), so that w′ (x) = w(x)w′ (0) for all x. Therefore w is
an exponential function. ⊳

Proposition 2.2.4. Any analytic extension of a d-dimensional Cp -vector
space L by a h-dimensional Qp -vector space V is of the form (2.2.2).
Proof. Let (ui ) be a basis of L. Then the fibre product Ei = E ×L (Cp ui )
is an analytic extension of Cp by V , and proving the proposition for all Ei
proves it for E. Therefore, we may assume that L = Cp . Moreover, let (fj )
be a basis of the dual of V . Then, for each j, the push-out E j = E +V Qp
has an analytic structure, its affine algebra being the quotient of that of E
by the closed ideal of the functions that are zero on Ker fj . Therefore, the
extension 0 → Qp → E j → L → 0 is analytic, and proving the result for all E j
proves it for E.
We thus see that it suffices to prove the case where L = Cp and V = Qp ;
by multiplication by a suitable power of p, we may even reduce to the case of
extensions of OCp = Sp Cp {X} by the spectral group Zp .
Let S = Sp A be such an extension. The diagram Zp (1) ֒→ S ։ OCp
ρ

corresponds to continuous algebra morphisms Cp {X} ֒→ A −−−։ C 0 (Zp (1), Cp ).
Let ε = (εn )n>0 be a topological generator of Zp (1), and define in : Zp − > Cp
by in (m) = εm
n . Then A is topologically generated over Cp {X} by elements fn
such that ρ(fn ) = in . Multiplying fn by elements of Cp {X}, we can assume
m
p
that fn+1
≡ fn (mod p). Therefore, for all n, the sequence (fn+m )p converges
10

to some element gn of A. The family (gn ) again topologically generates A;
p
moreover gn+1
= gn by construction, while g0 ∈ Cp {X}, g0 (0) = 1, and g0 takes
its values in OC×p .
For any n, gnp and gn (px) coincide on Zp (1), so that ρ(gnp /gn ◦ [p]) = 1
and un = gn (x)p /gn (px) ∈ Cp {X}. By construction, g0 (x)p /g0 (px) = u0 (x) and
u0 is extractible as defined in Lemma 2.2.3. Therefore there exists a sequence vn
n
in Cp {X} and a ∈ OC with vp (a) > 1/(p − 1) such that g0 (x) = exp(a x)vnp .
Replacing gn by vn gn we may assume that g0 (x) = exp(a x).1
A point s ∈ Sp A is thus determined by the values sn = gn (s) ∈ Cp , satisfying
the condition vp (s0 ) > vp (α) and spn+1 = sn . Therefore, Sp A is homeomorphic
+
to a closed ball of mR . The map Sp A → Bcris
, s 7→ log[s] is then an analytic
isomorphism between Sp A and a lattice of E1 . ⊳

Structure of effective Banach-Colmez spaces of dimension one

The following results give a full description of the category of Banach-Colmez
spaces “of dimension one”, i.e. having a presentation 0 → V → E → Cp → 0.
Namely, for these spaces, there exists an integer h such that the connected-étale
sequence is of the form
0 −→ E1/h −→ E −→ π0 (E) −→ 0;

(2.3.1)

since this sequence splits, the space E is (non-canonically) isomorphic to E1/h ⊕
π0 (E), with π0 (E) being a finite-dimensional Qp -vector space.
Proposition 2.3.2. Let E be an effective Banach-Colmez space having a presentation of dimension one. Assume that E is connected and not isomorphic
to Cp . Then there exists an integer h > 1 such that E is isomorphic to E1,h .
The proof uses the following lemma.
Lemma 2.3.3. Let V be a h-dimensional Qp -vector subspace of Cp . Write λ :
V → Cp the canonical injection and ι : E1/h → Chp the vector hull of E1/h . Then
the map ι ⊗ λ : E1/h ⊗Qp V → Chp is surjective, and its kernel is a h-dimensional
vector space over Qph .
Proof. The strategy involves the following steps:
(i) write f as a left D1/h -linear map, where D1/h is the division algebra
over Qp with Brauer invariant 1/h;
(ii) compute lattices E of E1/h and S of Chp such that f (E) ⊂ S, and thus
reduce the problem modulo p;
(iii) prove that the reduced map f : E/πE → S/πS (where π is a uniformizer
of D1/h ) is surjective;
g (x+y)

1A

different way to reach the same result is to consider instead the cocycle g 0(x)g (y)
0
0
[Laz75, II.6.1][Plû09, 5.5.4]; we find it simpler to use its multiplication-by-p analogues instead.

11

(iv) count the elements of Ker f and thus proving that its is one-dimensional
over Fph .
The points (iii) and (iv) are proven here only in the special case where V has
a basis consisting of elements (λi ) with vp (λi ) = 0. The full proof, similar in
spirit but somewhat longer, is detailed in [Plû09, 6.2.3].
Step (i). The division algebra D1/h , having Brauer invariant 1/h over Qp , is
the non-commutative algebra generated over Qph by a uniformizer π satisfying
the relations π h = p and, for all x ∈ Qph , π · x = ϕ(x) · π.
The division algebra D1/h acts on E1/h with π acting by the Frobenius
morphism ϕ, and on Chp by π(x0 , . . . , xh−1 ) = (x1 , . . . , xh−1 , px0 )
Let (λ1 , . . . , λh ) be a basis of V ; then the map ι ⊗ λ may be written as

(2.3.4)

r=0,...,h−1

From this, we immediately see that f (ϕ(x)) = π(f (x)); therefore, the map f is
D1/h -linear.
Step (ii). By selecting an appropriate basis of V over Qp , and up to multiplication by powers of p, we may assume that the λi are sorted by increasing
p-adic valuation, and that vp (λi ) ∈ [0, 1[. Finally, the reductions of all the λi
with same p-adic valuation modulo the appropriate ideal of OCp are linearly
independent over Fp .
For any r ∈ R, define

	
g(ρ) = min {vp (θ(x)), x ∈ R, vR (x) > ρ} = min pnh ρ − n, n ∈ Z . (2.3.5)
Then g : R → R is a strictly monotonous function, piece-wise affine, with
slope pnh on intervals of width p−nh . This means that it is possible to find
elements ρ1 , . . . , ρh ∈ R such that, for all r = 0, . . . , h − 1, the quantity τr =
g(pr ρi ) + v(λi ) does not depend on i ∈ {1, . . . , h}. Therefore f (E) ⊂ S, where
h
and Chp defined by
E and S are the lattices of E1/h

h
E = (xi )i=1,...,h ∈ E1/h
, vR (xi ) > ρi ,
(2.3.6)

	
S = (yr )r=0,...,h−1 ∈ Chp , vp (yr ) > τr .
The maximal order D1/h of D1/h is generated by Zph and π; it is separated
an complete for the p-adic topology and D1/h /πD1/h = Fph . Both E and S
are stable under the action of D1/h , and the map f reduces to a Fph -linear
map f : E/ϕ(E) → S/ϕ(S). The surjectivity of f is equivalent to that of f ,
and the dimension (finite or not) of Ker f over D1/h is equal to the dimension
of Ker f over Fph .
Step (iii). For any x ∈ E, only a finite number of terms of the series f (x) do
not belong to π(S); therefore, the Lemma reduces to counting the solutions of
a system of polynomials over mR .
12

We address here only the case where all vi are zero. In this case, the images λi
of the λi in Fp are Fp -linearly independent, and we may write

For all z ∈ OCp , let zb be an element of R such that zb(0) = z. For b =

where ̟ is an element of R such that vR (̟) = p−1
p . Since the λi (mod p)
are Fp -linearly independent, we can eliminate h − 2 variables using the linear
equations, thus reducing to two equations in (z1 , z2 ) of the following form:
h

z1p + α1 z1 + α2 z2 = c,
h

z2p + ̟β1 z1 + ̟β2 z2 = c′ ,

(2.3.11)

where α1 β2 − α2 β1 is a unit in R. This has exactly p2h solutions in Frac R, all of
which are integral over R and therefore belong to R. Therefore f is surjective.
Step (iv). It remains to compute the dimension of the kernel of f . Equation 2.3.9 has exactly p2h solutions in E; this must be divided by the number solutions in ϕ(E), which are the solutions such that vR (xi ) > p/(ph − 1).

Let ξ ∈ R such that ξ p −1 = ̟; then the change of variables zi = ξwi linearizes
the second equation of (2.3.10). Therefore this system has exactly ph solutions,
so that the kernel of f has dimension 1 over Fph .
Finally, since f is the reduction of f modulo the maximal ideal, f is surjective
and its kernel is a line over the division algebra D1/h . ⊳

Proof of Proposition 2.3.2. The presentation of E of dimension one corresponds
by 2.2.4 to a Cp -linear map f : Cp → VQp ⊗Qp Cp whose transpose λ : V → Cp is
injective. Lemma 2.3.3 shows that ι ⊗ λ : E1,h ⊗ V → Chp is injective with kernel
of dimension one over the division algebra D1/h . This means that Ker(ι ⊗ λ) is
generated by an element a = (a1 , . . . , ah ), with ai ∈ E1/h .

Define u : Qph h → E1/h
as the linear map u(x0 , . . . , xh−1 ) =

r
and δ = det u = det(ϕ (ai ))r,i ∈ Bcris . Then δ is also the determinant of the
map D1/h → Ker(ι ⊗ λ), c 7→ c · a. Since a is a generator of Ker(ι ⊗ λ), we
have δ 6= 0.
The constuction (2.2.2) makes E a sub-space of E1 ⊗ V = E1h . Let t
be a topological generator
of Zp (1) ⊂ E1 . For any x = (x1 , . . . , xh ) ∈ E1h ,
P

define g(x) = t
ai xi . The map g is analytic by construction and ver+
ifies ϕh (g(x)) = pg(x). It only remains to show that g(E) ⊂ Bcris
, and
that g : E → E1,h is an isomorphism.
P
Let x = (x1 , . . . , xh ) ∈ E ⊂ E1h and y = g(x). Then t y =
ai xi ,
and therefore for any r > 0, θ(t ϕr (y)) = p−r θ(ϕr (ty)) = 0, which means

. By [Fon94, 5.3.7], this implies that y ∈ Bcris
that tϕr (y) ∈ Fil1 Bcris

Since ϕ (t xi ) = t xi , the vector (ϕ (y)) is the product of the matrix (ϕr (ai )) with the vector (t−1 xi ). From δ 6= 0 we thus deduce that g is
injective. Since g is also a morphism of presentations of effective Banach-Colmez
spaces between E and E1/h , it is easy to check that it is surjective, and therefore
an analytic isomorphism. ⊳
Corollary 2.3.12. Let E be a Banach-Colmez space having a presentation 0 →
V → E → Cp → 0. Then there exists an integer h such that the connected-étale
sequence for E is isomorphic to
0 −→ E1/h −→ E −→ π0 (E) −→ 0.
Proof. This can be directly deduced from applying the proposition 2.3.2 to the
connected component of E. ⊳

2.4

Dimension and height

The original version of the fundamental lemma ([CF00, 2.1]) examines a map f :
Y → Cp , where the object Y is built as a fibre product of Cp and E1h in the
same way as in 2.2.4 and is therefore an effective Banach-Colmez space, and the
map f is analytic. Therefore, it can be deduced from the theorem 2.4.1.
Moreover, 2.4.1 is also equivalent to the strong version of the fundamental
lemma [Col02, 6.11]: the category of Banach-Colmez spaces is equivalent to that

14

of “Espaces Vectoriels de dimension finie”, which are sheaves of finite-dimensional
vector spaces over certain Banach algebras over Cp .
Theorem 2.4.1. Let 0 → V → E → Cp → 0 be a presentation of an effective
Banach-Colmez space with dimension one and height h > 0, and f : E → Cp be
any analytic morphism. Then either
(i) f (E) is a finite-dimensional Qp -vector space with dimension at most h, or
(ii) f is surjective and f (E) is finite-dimensional over Qp with dimension h.
By Proposition 2.3.2, it is enough to prove this when E = E1/h . Since this
spectral space is connected, the fundamental lemma then takes the shorter form
below.
Proposition 2.4.2. Let f : E1/h → Cp be a nonzero analytic morphism.
Then f is surjective and dimQp ker f = h.
Proof. By 2.1.6, there exist f0 , . . . , fh−1 ∈ Cp such that f = f0 θ + . . . +
fh−1 θϕh−1 . Replacing f by f ◦ ϕj , we may assume that vp (f0 ) = 0 and vp (fi ) >
− hi .
By 1.2.7(i), we may identify E1,h with the set of all bivectors (xn )n∈Z ∈
h−1
BW (R) with the periodicity condition xn−1 = xnp
; this isomorphism to mR
is analytic by 1.2.7(ii), so we may identify E1/h with mR and write
X
i
f (x) =
fi θ([xp ])
(2.4.3)
i∈Z

where the sequence (fi ) is extended over Z by fi+h = p−1 fi . Since this application is Qp -linear, we need only to prove that its image contains a ball of Cp .
We use here an extension of the theory of Newton polygons to the ring R.
Define the formal series f + and the polynomial P , both with coefficients in Cp ,
P
n
h−1
as f + (x) = n>0 fn xp and P (x) = f0 x + · · · + fh−1 xp . They verify the
h

functional equation f + (x) = P (x) + p1 f + (xp ). We recall that the Newton
polygon of f [Rob00] is the inferior convex hull of the set {(pn , vp (un )), n ∈ N},
and that its slopes are the valuations of the zeroes of f . Since vp (fi ) > − hi
and vp (f0 ) = 0, it has the vertices (pnh , −nh) for n ∈ N.
1
Define ρ = h(p−1)
and let b ∈ OCp such that vp (b) > ρ. By the theory of
Newton polygons, the equation f + (x) = b has exactly one solution x0 ∈ Cp
such that v(x0 ) = ρ. Starting from x0 , we recursively define a sequence (xi )
h
such that f + (xi ) = p−i b and lim inf vp (xpi+1 − xi ) − vp (xi ) > 0. Assume that xi
h
is known, and let y ∈ Cp such that y p = xi . Then f + (y) = P (y) + p1 f + (y q ) =
P (y) + p−(i+1) b. Let xi+1 = y + t; then f + (xi+1 ) = p−(i+1) b if, and only if,
f + (y + t) = f + (y) − P (y).

(2.4.4)

The Newton polygon for this equation in t shows that there exists exactly q
solutions t such that vp (t) > q −1 ρ. Choose any of them and define xi+1 = y + t.
15

Then the sequence (xi ) satisfies the condition vp (xqi+1 − xi ) >
m

(xpn+m )m>0

q−1
q ρ.

Thus, for

x′n

converges to an element
of OCp ; and the
all n, the sequence
sequence (x′n )n∈N is an element x′ of mR such that f (x′ ) = b.
It remains to count the dimension of the kernel of f . This is given by the
number of solutions when solving (2.4.4) for t; since this number is exactly q =
ph , the kernel is of dimension h over Qp . ⊳
As a corollary of the fundamental lemma, we obtain the existence of natural
functions of dimension and height on the category of effective Banach-Colmez
spaces. These functions are additive over short exact sequences. Moreover, for
any p-divisible group Γ, the dimension and height of Γ as a p-divisible group
are equal to the dimension and height of the Banach-Colmez space Γ(R).
Corollary 2.4.5. Let E be an effective Banach-Colmez space.
(i) There exists integers d = dim E and h = ht E such that, for any presentation 0 → V → E → L → 0, we have d = dimCp L and d = dimQp V .
(ii) Let 0 → E ′ → E → E ′′ → 0 be an exact sequence of spectral BanachColmez spaces. Then dim(E) = dim(E ′ ) + dim(E ′′ ) and ht(E) = ht(E ′ ) +
ht(E ′′ ).
These integers are called the dimension and height of E.
Proof. We prove (ii) first. Let 0 → E ′ → E → E ′′ → 0 be an exact sequence of
effective Banach-Colmez spaces having the presentations 0 → V → E → L → 0,
0 → V ′ → E ′ → L′ → 0, and 0 → V ′′ → E ′′ → L′′ → 0.
Let (ui ), (u′′i ) be bases of L and L′′ respectively. By replacing E ′′ by E ′′ ×L′′
(Cp u′′i ) and E by E ×L (Cp ui ), we may assume that L = L′ = Cp . We may
then directly deduce (ii) from applying the fundamental lemma to the composite
map E → E ′′ → L′′ .
Finally, (i) is the special case of (ii) where E ′ = 0. ⊳
