DOUBLE BRANCHED COVERS OF THETA-CURVES
JACK S. CALCUT AND JULES R. METCALF-BURTON
Abstract. We prove a folklore theorem of W. Thurston which provides necessary and sufficient conditions for primality of a certain class of theta-curves.
Namely, a theta-curve in the 3-sphere with an unknotted constituent knot
κ is prime if and only if lifting the third arc of the theta-curve to the double branched cover over κ produces a prime knot. We apply this result to
Kinoshita’s theta-curve.

1. Introduction
Consider the multigraph Γ with two vertices v1 , v2 and three edges e1 , e2 , e3 none
of which are loops. A theta-curve is a locally flat embedding of Γ in S 3 or in R3 .
Each theta-curve θ has three constituent knots: e2 ∪ e3 , e1 ∪ e3 , and e1 ∪ e2 . Given
a constituent knot κ, there is exactly one arc e of θ not contained in κ.
A theta-curve is unknotted provided it lies on an embedded S 2 and is knotted
otherwise. We will use two operations on knots and theta-curves: the order-2 connected sum #2 and order-3 connected sum #3 . An order-2 connected sum θ#2 J of
a theta-curve θ ⊂ S 3 and a knot J ⊂ S 3 is the result of deleting unknotted ball-arc
pairs from each of (S 3 , θ) and (S 3 , J), and then identifying the resulting boundary
spheres. The ball-arc pair in (S 3 , θ) must be disjoint from the vertices v1 and v2 .
An order-3 connected sum θ1 #3 θ2 of two theta-curves is the result of deleting an
unknotted ball-prong neighborhood of a vertex from each theta-curve, and then
identifying the resulting boundary spheres. Each of these operations yields a thetacurve in S 3 .
Remark 1.1. Wolcott has shown that the order-3 connected sum is independent of
the glueing homeomorphism provided one specifies the vertices at which to sum and
the pairing of the arcs [Wol87]. The operations θ#2 J and θ1 #3 θ2 are ambiguous
as presented. The former could mean up to six different theta-curves and the latter
could mean up to 24 different theta-curves. In each instance below, this ambiguity
is either irrelevant or is sufficiently eliminated by context.
A theta-curve θ is prime provided the following three conditions are satisfied:
(i) θ is knotted, (ii) θ is not an order-2 connected sum of a nontrivial knot and
a (possibly unknotted) theta-curve, and (iii) θ is not an order-3 connected sum of
two knotted theta-curves. We adopt the convention that the unknot is not prime.

Let S 3 ⊂ R4 be the unit sphere. Let g ∈ SO(4) denote the orientation preserving involution of S 3 whose matrix is diagonal with entries [−1, −1, 1, 1]. Note
that Fix(g) is a great circle in S 3 and is therefore unknotted. Let G = {e, g} be
the group of order two. Throughout this paper, equivariance is with respect to
G. Recall that a subset D ⊂ S 3 is equivariant provided g(D) = D (setwise) or
g(D) ∩ D = ∅.
Suppose the theta-curve θ has an unknotted constituent knot κ and θ = e ∪ κ.
By an ambient isotopy, we can assume κ = Fix(g). Let b : S 3 → S 3 be the double
branched cover with branch set Fix(g) and such that b ◦ g = b. Lifting the arc e
of θ yields the knot K := b−1 (e) in S 3 . We call K the lifted knot of θ with respect
to κ. By stereographic projection from (0, 0, 0, 1) ∈ S 3 , the map g descends to the
rotation of R3 about the z-axis by half a revolution.
Moriuchi attributes the following theorem to W. Thurston without proof [Mor04,
Prop. 4.1], and Moriuchi references an unpublished letter of Litherland for Thurston’s
statement of this theorem [Mor09, Prop. 5.1].
Main Theorem (W. Thurston). Suppose θ has an unknotted constituent knot κ,
and let K be the lifted knot of θ with respect to κ. The theta-curve θ is prime if
and only if the lifted knot K is prime.
Our proof of the Main Theorem uses the equivariant Dehn Lemma in two places.
In the proof of Lemma 2.3, Kim and Tollefson’s version [KT80, Lemma 3] suffices as
noted by the referee. In the proof of Lemma 2.7, we use Edmond’s version [Edm86].
It’s possible that with some tinkering Kim and Tollefson’s version suffices.
In the final section of this paper, we use the Main Theorem to prove that Kinoshita’s theta-curve is prime. We also explain how primality of Kinoshita’s thetacurve yields an alternate proof of the irreducibility of certain tangles.
Acknowledgment. We thank the referee for simplifying the proof of Lemma 2.3
and for several other helpful comments.
2. Proof of Main Theorem
We will prove the contrapositive in both directions. First, we observe two useful
lemmas.
Lemma 2.1. Suppose θ, θ1 , and θ2 are theta-curves, and J ⊂ S 3 is a nontrivial
knot.
(2.1) If θ#2 J has an unknotted constituent knot κ, then κ ⊂ θ (that is, κ is the
union of two edges in θ). Let K be the lifted knot of θ with respect to κ.
Then, the lifted knot of θ#2 J with respect to κ is K#J#J.
(2.2) If θ1 #3 θ2 has an unknotted constituent knot κ, then there are unknotted
constituent knots κ1 ⊂ θ1 and κ2 ⊂ θ2 such that the order-3 connected sum
θ1 #3 θ2 induces the connected sum κ = κ1 #κ2 . Let Kj be the lifted knot of
θj with respect to κj for j ∈ {1, 2}. Then, the lifted knot of θ1 #3 θ2 with
respect to κ is K1 #K2 .
Proof. For the first claim in (2.1), label the edges of θ so that the sum θ#2 J is
performed along e3 ⊂ θ and let e be the resulting edge in θ#2 J. The knot e1 ∪ e is

the connected sum of the knots e1 ∪e3 and J. As J is nontrivial and nontrivial knots
do not have inverses under connected sum, we see that the knot e1 ∪ e is nontrivial.
Similarly, the knot e2 ∪ e is nontrivial. Hence, e1 ∪ e2 must be an unknot as desired.
The first claim in (2.2) follows similarly.
The remaining claims follow from the definitions of order-2 and order-3 connected
sum and from the definition of the double branched cover b : S 3 → S 3 .

For the remainder of this section, we assume θ is a theta-curve with unknotted
constituent knot κ = Fix(g) and θ = e ∪ κ. Let K be the lifted knot of θ with
respect to κ.
Lemma 2.2. If Σ is an equivariant 2-sphere in S 3 that meets κ in exactly two
points, then b(Σ) is an embedded 2-sphere in S 3 transverse to κ and meeting κ in
exactly two points.
Proof. As Σ meets κ = Fix(g), equivariance implies g(Σ) = Σ. Equivariance also
implies that Σ is transverse to κ, b(Σ) is a closed connected surface, and b(Σ) is
transverse to κ. Let Σ′ be the equivariant annulus obtained from Σ by deleting the
interiors of disjoint equivariant 2-disk neighborhoods of the two points Σ ∩ κ. The
restriction of b to Σ′ → b(Σ′ ) is a double cover and b(Σ) is obtained from b(Σ′ ) by
glueing in two 2-disks. It follows that the Euler characteristic of b(Σ′ ) is 0 and the
Euler characteristic of b(Σ) is 2. Hence, b(Σ) is a 2-sphere.

Lemma 2.3. The theta-curve θ is unknotted if and only if K is unknotted.
Proof. Clearly, if θ is unknotted, then K is unknotted.
Suppose K is unknotted. Let N be a closed regular equivariant neighborhood
of K in S 3 . As S 3 − Int N is a solid torus, it has compressible boundary. By
the equivariant Dehn Lemma [KT80, Lemma 3], there exists a properly embedded
equivariant compressing disk D ⊂ S 3 −Int N . If g(D) = D, then a slight pushoff D′
of D is an equivariant compressing disk with g(D′ ) ∩ D′ = ∅ and we may redefine
D to be D′ instead. Hence, we may assume D ∩ g(D) = ∅. As D ∩ N = ∂D is a
longitude of the solid torus N , there exists an embedded annulus A ⊂ N such that
∂A = K ∪ ∂D and A ∩ g(A) = K. The 2-sphere Σ = D ∪ A ∪ g(A) ∪ g(D) contains
K, is transverse
 to κ = Fix(g), and meets κ in exactly two points. Therefore, Σ
divides S 3 , κ into two equivariant unknotted ball-arc pairs. Each of these balls
contains an equivariant 2-disk with boundary K and containing that balls arc of
κ. The union of these two disks is a new 2-sphere Σ′ such that b(Σ′ ) is a sphere
containing θ as desired.

To prove the reverse implication of the Main Theorem, suppose θ is not prime.
If θ is unknotted, then K is the unknot which is not prime. If θ = θ0 #2 J and J
is nontrivial, then, by Lemma 2.1, K = K0 #J#J which is not prime. Otherwise,
θ = θ1 #3 θ2 , where θ1 and θ2 are both knotted. Then, by Lemma 2.1, K = K1 #K2
is a sum of knots which are nontrivial by Lemma 2.3. This proves the reverse implication of the Main Theorem.
To prove the forward implication of the Main Theorem, suppose K is not prime.
If K is unknotted, then so is θ by Lemma 2.3. Otherwise, there is a sphere Σ that
splits (S 3 , K) into two knotted ball-arc pairs.

Lemma 2.4. If Σ ∩ g(Σ) = ∅, then θ is a nontrivial order-2 connected sum. If
Σ = g(Σ) and Σ meets κ at exactly two points distinct from v1 and v2 , then θ is a
nontrivial order-3 connected sum.
Proof. If Σ∩g(Σ) = ∅, then Σ bounds a ball B disjoint from g(Σ). It follows that B
is disjoint from g(B). As κ = Fix (g) is connected and disjoint from Σ, κ must also
be disjoint from B. Thus (B, B ∩ K) maps homeomorphically by b to a nontrivial
ball-arc pair in (S 3 , θ). Thus, θ is a nontrivial order-2 connected sum.
Suppose Σ = g(Σ) meets κ at exactly two points distinct from v1 and v2 . As
g(Σ ∩ K) = Σ ∩ K and g interchanges the two lifts α and β of e, Σ meets each of
α and β once. Therefore, the vertices v1 and v2 must lie in different components
of S 3 − Σ, and so Σ meets each arc of κ once. In particular, the G-action does not
interchange the balls in S 3 bounded by Σ. By Lemma 2.2, b(Σ) is a sphere and it
splits θ as an order-3 connected sum. Each of these summands must be nontrivial
since Σ splits (S 3 , K) into two knotted ball-arc pairs.

Let Σ be a sphere such that:
(2.1) Σ separates (S 3 , K) into two knotted ball-arc pairs.
(2.2) Σ and g(Σ) are in general position with each other.
(2.3) Σ ∩ g(Σ) ∩ K = ∅.
Condition (2.2) is achieved by the proof of Lemma 1 from [GL79, p. 148]. By
Lemma 2.4, it suffices to show that we can either improve Σ (while maintaining (2.1)–(2.3)) and make it disjoint from g(Σ), or we can produce a sphere Σ′
which bounds two knotted ball-arc pairs in (S 3 , K) such that g(Σ′ ) = Σ′ and Σ′
meets κ at exactly two points distinct from v1 and v2 .
Lemma 2.5. Any curves of Σ∩g(Σ) which are inessential in Σ−K can be removed
without introducing new intersections.
Proof. Note that a curve in Σ∩g(Σ) is essential in Σ− K if and only if it is essential
in g(Σ) − K. Consider a component c of Σ ∩ g(Σ) that is inessential in Σ − K and is
innermost in g(Σ)−K. Then c bounds closed disks D1 ⊂ g(Σ)−K and D2 ⊂ Σ−K
and D1 ∪ D2 is an embedded 2-sphere. As D1 and D2 are both disjoint from K,
D1 ∪ D2 bounds a ball B disjoint from K.
Case 1: D1 ∩ g(D1 ) = ∅. Then, there is a neighborhood N of D1 such that
N ∩ g(N ) = ∅ and N ∩ Σ ∩ g(Σ) = c. Improve Σ by pushing D2 past D1 into N
using B. Since the only part of Σ that changed now lies in N and N is now disjoint
from Σ ∩ g(Σ), there are no new intersections.
Case 2: D1 ∩ g(D1 ) 6= ∅. Since D1 is innermost, this means that c = g(c) and
D1 = g(D2 ). Using B, push D2 past D1 to a parallel copy of D1 . This removes c
without adding new intersections.

By Lemma 2.5, we may assume all components of Σ∩g(Σ) are essential in Σ−K.
Let c1 , c2 , . . . , cn be the components of Σ ∩ g(Σ) and let Aij ⊂ Σ be the annulus
with ∂Aij = ci ∪ cj for i 6= j. We assume ci and ci+1 are adjacent in Σ − K for
1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Let π ∈ Sym(n) be the permutation such that g(ci ) = cπ(i) . As g is
an involution, either π is the identity or π has order two.
Lemma 2.6. If π(i) = i and ci bounds a disk D ⊂ Σ such that Int D ∩g(Int D) = ∅,
then either ci can be removed without introducing intersections or θ is a nontrivial
order-3 connected sum.

Proof. Suppose D and i are as indicated. Then, D ∪ g(D) is a sphere invariant
under g. Since g is orientation preserving, D ∪ g(D) must have at least one fixed
point under g; in fact, it must have two because κ meets D ∪ g(D) transversely. As
Int D ∩ g(Int D) = ∅, all such fixed points must lie in ci . As Σ is transverse to κ, ci
contains a finite number of fixed points under g. Let a ⊂ ci be an arc intersecting
κ exactly at its endpoints, so κ ∩ a = ∂a. Then a ∪ g(a) is a simple closed curve,
so ci = a ∪ g(a) and thus ci cannot contain more than two fixed points. Thus, if
D ∪ g(D) bounds two knotted ball-arc pairs, then we are done by Lemma 2.4.
Otherwise, D ∪ g(D) bounds an unknotted ball-arc pair (B, B ∩ K). Using B,
we can push D (and any other components of Σ ∩ B) past g(D) to remove ci . 
Thus, we must show that as long as Σ ∩ g(Σ) 6= ∅, there is a curve ci as in
Lemma 2.6.
Lemma 2.7. Suppose T ⊂ S 3 is a torus such that g(T ) = T and T ∩ κ = ∅.
Let Z ⊂ S 3 be the half bounded by T containing κ. If c ⊂ T is essential in T ,
null-homotopic in Z, and equivariant, then it is invariant (setwise).
Proof. Suppose T , Z, and c are as indicated. Since κ ⊂ Z, it is clear that g(Z) =
Z. As c is equivariant, null-homotopic in Z, and disjoint from κ, c bounds an
equivariant disk D ⊂ Z by the equivariant Dehn Lemma [Edm86].
Suppose, by way of contradiction, that g(c) 6= c. Then, as c and D are equivariant, we have c ∩ g(c) = ∅ and D ∩ g(D) = ∅. The set Z − (D ∪ g(D)) has
two components, the closures in Z of these are B1 and B2 . Each of B1 and B2 is
bounded by the disks D and g(D) as well as an annulus in T , so both B1 and B2
are 3-balls. Now, κ is contained in one of these balls. Without loss of generality,
κ ⊂ B1 . So, both B1 and B2 must be fixed setwise by g. As B1 is fixed by g and g
is orientation preserving, g must have a fixed point on ∂B1 ⊂ T ∪ D ∪ g(D). But,
the set of fixed points of g is exactly κ, and T , D, and g(D) are all disjoint from κ.
This is a contradiction, so c must be invariant.

In the following lemma, we take i, j, k, l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}.
Lemma 2.8. If π(j) > j, then there is some j < i < π(j) such that π(i) = i. In
particular, there is some i such that π(i) = i.
Proof. Suppose, by way of contradiction, that π(j) > j and there is no such i.
Choose k such that:
(2.1) j ≤ k < π(k) ≤ π(j).
(2.2) π(k) − k is minimal such that (2.1) is satisfied.
If k < l < π(k), then we cannot have k < π(l) < π(k). So, Akπ(k) ∩ g(Akπ(k) ) =
ck ∪ cπ(k) and T = Akπ(k) ∪ g(Akπ(k) ) is a torus. Furthermore, T = g(T ) and T is
disjoint from κ. As κ is connected, one component of S 3 − T contains κ. Let Z be
its closure in S 3 . Since T is also disjoint from K and K ∪ κ is connected, we have
K ⊂ Z. Let m be minimal such that cm ⊂ T . Then, cm bounds a disk in Σ with
interior disjoint from T which intersects K. So, cm and all other curves in T of the
same homotopy type are null-homotopic in Z. In particular, ck is essential in T ,
null-homotopic in Z, and equivariant. Hence, ck is invariant by Lemma 2.7. This
implies that π(k) = k, a contradiction.
The second part is immediate as either π(1) = 1, or π(1) > 1 and there is
1 < i < π(1) such that π(i) = i.

Let i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} be minimal such that π(i) = i (this i exists by Lemma 2.8).
Let D ⊂ Σ be a disk with ∂D = ci such that: (i) D contains ci−1 in case i > 1, (ii)
D does not contain ci+1 in case i < n, and (iii) D is either disk in Σ bounded by
c1 in case i = 1. We claim that D ∩ g(D) = ci . Suppose, by way of contradiction,
that ck ⊂ D ∩ g(D). Then, 1 ≤ k < i and 1 ≤ π(k) < i. If π(k) = k, then k
contradicts minimality of i. If k < π(k), then Lemma 2.8 yields k < i′ < π(k) < i
such that π(i′ ) = i′ , which contradicts minimality of i. If π(k) < k, then let
j = π(k). So, j = π(k) < k = π(j) since π 2 is the identity. Again, Lemma 2.8
yields j < i′ < π(j) < i such that π(i′ ) = i′ , which contradicts minimality of i.
Hence, the claim D ∩ g(D) = ci holds. By Lemma 2.6, either ci can be removed
or θ is a nontrivial order-3 connected sum. Thus, if θ is not a nontrivial order-3
connected sum, then Σ can be made disjoint from g(Σ) and θ is a nontrivial order-2
connected sum by Lemma 2.4. This completes the proof of the Main Theorem.
3. Application
To employ the Main Theorem, we must produce the lifted knot for a given
theta-curve. Fortunately, this is not difficult. Given a theta-curve θ = κ ∪ e with
unknotted constituent knot κ, draw the lifted knot using the following algorithm:
(3.1) Draw θ in R3 ∪ {∞} so that κ comprises the z-axis and the point at infinity.
Consider the diagram given by projecting θ onto the zy-plane.
(3.2) By an ambient isotopy fixing κ, arrange for all self-crossings of e to have
positive y-coordinate. By a further isotopy, we may assume the diagram
appears as shown in Figure 1(a).

(3.3) Now, lifting e yields the knot K given as the union of the following: (i) the
diagam J, (ii) a copy of J rotated one half of a revolution about the z-axis,
and (iii) arcs between (i) and (ii) as shown in Figure 1(b).

Example 3.1. Kinoshita’s well-known theta-curve [Kin72] is shown in Figure 2(a).
All three of its constituent knots are unknotted. Applying the algorithm to Kinoshita’s theta-curve, we obtain the lifted knot K in Figure 2(b). With K exhibited as a positive 3-braid, it is a simple exercise to isotop K to the standard
(3, 5)-torus knot (this fact was also observed by Wolcott [Wol87]). As torus knots
are prime [BZ03, p. 95], K is prime and the Main Theorem implies that Kinoshita’s
theta-curve is prime as well.
Remark 3.2. Previously, the authors [CMBRS14] produced uncountably many
isotopically distinct unions of three rays in R3 with the Brunnian property (namely,
all three rays are knotted, but any two of them are unknotted). To achieve this, we
used sequences of three-component tangles lying in thickened spheres. Our main
tangle A is shown in Figure 3. We discovered this tangle independently as described

Figure 3. Tangle A in a thickened sphere.
in [CMBRS14]. A key property of the tangle A proved in [CMBRS14] was that A is
irreducible (namely, no sphere separates A into two nontrivial tangles). By taking
the thickened sphere containing A and crushing each of the boundary spheres to a
point, one obtains Kinoshita’s theta-curve. As we have just observed, Kinoshita’s
theta-curve is prime. This immediately implies that the tangle A is irreducible and
provides an alternate proof of [CMBRS14, Theorem 6.1].
