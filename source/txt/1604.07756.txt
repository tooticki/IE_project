ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING FOR TIME-DOMAIN MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS IN AN
UNBOUNDED STRUCTURE

YIXIAN GAO AND PEIJUN LI
A BSTRACT. The goal of this work is to study the electromagnetic scattering problem of time-domain Maxwell’s
equations in an unbounded structure. An exact transparent boundary condition is developed to reformulate the
scattering problem into an initial-boundary value problem in an infinite rectangular slab. The well-posedness and
stability are established for the reduced problem. Our proof is based on the method of energy, the Lax–Milgram
lemma, and the inversion theorem of the Laplace transform. Moreover, a priori estimates with explicit dependence on the time are achieved for the electric field by directly studying the time-domain Maxwell equations.

1. I NTRODUCTION
Consider the propagation of an electromagnetic wave which is excited by electric current density and is
scattered by infinite rough surfaces. An infinite rough surface is a non-local perturbation of an infinite plane
surface such that the whole surface lies within a finite distance of the original plane. The goal of this paper is
to examine the electromagnetic scattering problem of time-domain Maxwell’s equation in such an unbounded
structure. The problem studied in this work falls into the class of rough surface scattering problems, which
arise from various applications such as modeling acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation over outdoor
ground and sea surfaces, optical scattering from the surface of materials in near-field optics or nano-optics,
detection of underwater mines, especially those buried in soft sediments. These problems are widely studied
in the literature and various methods have been investigated [8, 9, 19, 21, 24, 27].
The infinite rough surfaces scattering problems are quite challenging due to unbounded domains. The
usual Sommerfeld (for acoustic waves) or Silver–Müller (for electromagnetic waves) radiation condition is
not valid any more [1,28]. The Fredholm alternative theorem is not applicable due to the lack of compactness
result. We refer to [2–4, 13, 15] for some mathematical studies on the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation.
The rigorous mathematical analysis is very rare for the three-dimensional Maxwell equations. In [17], the
electromagnetic scattering by unbounded rough surfaces was considered by assuming that the medium was
lossy in the entire space. The well-posedness was established by a direct application of the Lax–Milgram
theorem after showing that the sesquilinear form was coercive. In [11], the authors considered the electromagnetic scattering by an unbounded dielectric medium which was deposited on a perfectly electrically
conducting plate. Based on the limiting absorption principle, the problem was shown to have a unique weak
solution from a prior estimates. The magnetic permeability was assumed to be a constant and the electric
current was assumed to be divergence free. The assumption was also restrictive for the dielectric permittivity. In [18], the generalized Lax–Milgram theorem was adopted to establish the well-posedness for the same
problem as that in [11]. Although all the assumptions were relaxed, such as the magnetic permeability was
allowed to be a variable function and the divergence free condition was removed for the electric current, the
assumption was still quite restrictive for the dielectric permittivity. Despite the tremendous effort made so
far, it is still unclear what the least restrictive conditions are for the dielectric permittivity and the magnetic
permeability to assure the well-posedness of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations in unbounded structures.
Ultimately, one wishes to answer the following question: Is the scattering problem in unbounded structures
well-posed for the real and dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability?
Key words and phrases. Time-domain Maxwell’s equations, unbounded rough surfaces, Laplace transform, stability, a priori
estimates.

In this work, an initial attempt is made to study the time-domain electromagnetic scattering by infinite
rough surfaces for the most difficult case of the time-harmonic counterpart: the dielectric permittivity and
the magnetic permeability are assumed to be real and bounded measurable functions. An exact time-domain
transparent boundary condition (TBC) is developed to reduce the scattering problem into an initial-boundary
value problem in an infinite rectangular slab. To show the well-posedness, we split the reduced problem
into two sub-problems: one has homogeneous initial conditions and another has a homogeneous boundary
condition. Hence two auxiliary scattering problems need to be considered: one is the time-harmonic Maxwell
equations with a complex wavenumber and another is the time-domain Maxwell equations with perfectly
electrically conducting (PEC) boundary condition. Based on the stability results for the auxiliary problems,
the reduced problem is shown to have a unique solution. Our proofs rely on the Laplace transform, the Lax–
Milgram theorem, and the Parseval identity between the frequency domain and the time-domain. Moreover,
a priori estimates, featuring an explicit dependence on the time and a minimum regularity requirement of
the initial conditions and the source term, are established for the electric field by studying directly the timedomain Maxwell equations.
The time-domain scattering problems have recently attracted considerable attention due to their capability
of capturing wide-band signals and modeling more general material and nonlinearity [5, 12, 14, 20, 26], which
motivates us to tune our focus from seeking the best possible conditions for those physical parameters to
the time-domain problem. Comparing with the time-harmonic problems, the time-domain problems are less
studied due to the additional challenge of the temporal dependence. The analysis can be found in [6, 25] for
the time-domain acoustic and electromagnetic obstacle scattering problems. We refer to [16] for the analysis
of the time-dependent electromagnetic scattering from a three-dimensional open cavity. Numerical solutions
can be found in [10, 23] for the time-dependent wave scattering by periodic structures.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the model problem is introduced and reduced equivalently
into an initial-boundary value problem by using a TBC. Some regularity properties of the trace operator are
presented. In section 3, two auxiliary problems of Maxwell’s equations are discussed to pave the way for
the analysis of the main result in section 4. Section 4 is devoted to the well-posedness and stability of the
reduced time-domain Maxwell equations and a priori estimates of the solution. The paper is concluded with
some general remarks in section 5.

FORMULATION

In this section, we introduce the model problem and present an exact time-domain transparent boundary
condition to reduce the scattering problem into an initial-boundary value problem in an infinite rectangular
slab.
2.1. A model problem. Let us first introduce the problem geometry which is shown in Figure 1. Let Sj , j =
1, 2 be Lipschitz continuous surfaces which are embedded in the infinite rectangular slab
Ω = {x = (x, y, z)⊤ ∈ R3 : h2 < z < h1 },
where hj are constants. Denote by Γj = {x : z = hj } the two plane surfaces which enclose Ω. Let
Ω1 = {x : z > h1 } and Ω2 = {x : z < h2 }. The medium is assumed to be homogeneous in Ωj , but it is
allowed to be inhomogeneous in Ω.
The electromagnetic field is governed by the time-domain Maxwell equations in R3 for t > 0:
∇ × E(x, t) + µ∂t H(x, t) = 0,

∇ × H(x, t) − ε∂t E(x, t) = J(x, t),

(2.1)

where E is the electric field, H is the magnetic field, J is the electric current density which is assumed to
be compactly supported in Ω, the material parameters ε and µ are the dielectric permittivity and the magnetic
permeability, respectively. We assume that ε ∈ L∞ (R3 ) and µ ∈ L∞ (R3 ) satisfy
0 < εmin ≤ ε ≤ εmax < ∞,

0 < µmin ≤ µ ≤ µmax < ∞,

F IGURE 1. Problem geometry of the electromagnetic scattering by an unbounded structure
where εmin , εmax , µmin , µmax are constants. Since the medium is homogeneous in Ωj , there exist constants
εj and µj such that
ε(x) = εj , µ(x) = µj in Ωj .
The system is constrained by the initial conditions:
E|t=0 = E 0 ,

H|t=0 = H 0

in R3 ,

(2.2)

where E 0 and H 0 are also assumed to be compactly supported in Ω. Due to the unbounded structure of the
medium, it is no longer valid to impose the usual Silver–Müler radiation condition. We employ the following
radiation condition: the electromagnetic fields (E, H) consist of bounded outgoing waves in Ωj .
2.2. Functional spaces. We introduce some Sobolev space notation. For u ∈ L2 (Γj ), we denote by û the
Fourier transform of u, i.e.,
Z
1
u(ρ, hj )e−iρ·ξ dρ,
û(ξ, hj ) =
2π R2
where ξ = (ξ1 , ξ2 )⊤ ∈ R2 and ρ = (x, y)⊤ ∈ R2 . Denote by Cρ∞ the linear space of infinitely differentiable
functions with compact support with respect to the variable ρ on Ω. Let L2 (Ω) be the space of complex
square integrable functions on Ω. It follows from the Parseval identity that we have

H 0 (curl, Ω) = {u ∈ H(curl, Ω), u × nj = 0 on Γj },

which are Sobolev spaces with the norm

where û′j (ξ, z) = ∂z ûj (ξ, z).
Lemma 2.1. Cρ∞ (Ω)3 is dense in H(curl, Ω).
Proof. Noting that C0∞ (R3 )3 is dense in H(curl, R3 ) , we have C0∞ (R3 )3 |Ω is dense in H(curl, R3 )|Ω . From
the Sobolev extension theorem, H(curl, R3 )|Ω = H(curl, Ω). Therefore Cρ∞ (Ω)3 ⊇ C0∞ (R3 )3 |Ω is dense
in H(curl, Ω).

This density lemma is useful to deal with the infinite domain Ω. We may prove the results only on Cρ∞ (Ω)3
and then extend them by limiting argument to more general functions such as those in H(curl, Ω). Consequently, the boundary integrals only on Γj need to be considered when formulating the variational problems
in Ω.
For any vector field u = (u1 , u2 , u3 )⊤ , denote by
uΓj = nj × (u × nj ) = (u1 (x, y, hj ), u2 (x, y, hj ), 0)⊤

the tangential component on Γj , where n1 = (0, 0, 1)⊤ and n2 = (0, 0, −1)⊤ are the unit outward normal
vectors on Γ1 and Γ2 , respectively. For any smooth vector u = (u1 , u2 , u3 )⊤ defined on Γj , let divΓj u =
∂x u1 + ∂y u2 and curlΓj u = ∂x u2 − ∂y u1 be the surface divergence and surface scalar curl of the field u. For
a smooth scalar function u, denote by ∇Γj u = (∂x u, ∂y u, 0)⊤ the surface gradient on Γj .

H −1/2 (div, Γj ) = {u ∈ H −1/2 (Γj )3 : u3 = 0, divΓj u ∈ H −1/2 (Γj )},

which are equipped with the norms:

The following two lemmas are concerned with the duality between the spaces H −1/2 (div, Γj ) and H 1/2 (curl, Γj )
and the trace regularity in H(curl, Ω). The proofs can be found in [17, Lemma 2.3, Lemma 2.4].
Lemma 2.2. The spaces H −1/2 (div, Γj ) and H 1/2 (curl, Γj ) are mutually adjoint with respect to the scalar
product in L2 (Γj )3 defined by

Lemma 2.3. Let C = max{ 1 + (h1 − h2 )−1 , 2}. We have the estimate
kukH −1/2 (curl, Γj ) ≤ CkukH(curl,Ω) ,

∀ u ∈ H(curl, Ω).

Next we introduce some properties of the Laplace transform. Let s = s1 + is2 with s1 > 0, s2 ∈ R. Define
by ŭ(s) the Laplace transform of u(t), i.e.,
Z ∞
e−st u(t)dt.
ŭ(s) = L (u)(s) =

Using the integration by parts yields

TIME-DOMAIN MAXWELL’S EQUATION IN AN UNBOUNDED STRUCTURE

where L −1 is the inverse Laplace transform. It is also easy to verify that

u(t) = F −1 es1 t L (u)(s1 + s2 ) ,

(2.5)

where F −1 denotes the inverse Fourier transform with respect to s2 . Recall the Plancherel or the Parseval
identity for the Laplace transform (cf. [7, (2.46)]):

e−2s1 t u(t)v(t)dt, ∀ s1 > λ,

ŭ(s)v̆(s)ds2 =

where ŭ = L (u), v̆ = L (v) and λ is abscissa of convergence for the Laplace transform of u and v.
The following lemma ( [22, Theorem 43.1]) is an analogue of the Paley–Wiener–Schwarz theorem for the
Fourier transform of distributions with compact support in the case of the Laplace transform.
Lemma 2.4. Let h̆(s) be a holomorphic function in the half-plane s1 > σ0 and be valued in the Banach
space E. The following two statements are equivalent:
′ (E) whose Laplace transform is equal to h̆(s);
(1) There is a distribution h̆ ∈ D+
(2) There is a real σ1 with σ0 ≤ σ1 < ∞ and an integer m ≥ 0 such that for all complex numbers s with
Res = s1 > σ1 , it holds that kh̆(s)kE . (1 + |s|)m ,

′ (E) is the space of distributions on the real line which vanishes identically in the open negative
where D+
half line.

2.3. Transparent boundary condition. We introduce an exact time-domain TBC to formulate the scattering
problem into the following initial-boundary value problem:


in Ω, t > 0,
∇ × E + µ∂t H = 0, ∇ × H − ε∂t E = J
(2.7)
E|t=0 = E 0 , H|t=0 = H 0
in Ω,


Tj [E Γj ] = H × nj
on Γj , t > 0,

where E Γj is the tangential component of E on Γj and Tj is the time-domain electric-to-magnetic capacity
operator.
In what follows, we shall derive the formulation of the operators Tj and show some of their properties.
Since the derivation of T1 and T2 is analogous, we will only show the details for T1 and state the corresponding result on T2 without derivation.
Notice that J is supported in Ω and ε = ε1 , µ = µ1 in Ω1 , the system of Maxwell equations (2.1) reduce
to
∇ × E + µ1 ∂t H = 0, ∇ × H − ε1 ∂t E = 0 in Ω1 , t > 0.
(2.8)
Let Ĕ(x, s) and H̆(x, s) be the Laplace transform of E(x, t) and H(x, t). Recall that
L (∂t E) = sĔ − E 0 ,

L (∂t H) = sH̆ − H 0 .

Taking the Laplace transform of (2.8), and noting that E 0 and H 0 are supported in Ω, we obtain the Maxwell
equations in the s-domain:
∇ × Ĕ + µ1 sH̆ = 0,

∇ × H̆ − ε1 sĔ = 0 in Ω1 , s1 > 0, s2 ∈ R.

(2.9)

Let Ĕ = (Ĕ1 , Ĕ2 , Ĕ3 )⊤ and H̆ = (H̆1 , H̆2 , H̆3 )⊤ . Denote by Ĕ Γ1 = (Ĕ1 (ρ, h1 ), Ĕ2 (ρ, h1 ), 0)⊤ the tangential component of the electric field on Γ1 . Let H̆ × n1 = (H̆2 (ρ, h1 ), −H̆1 (ρ, h1 ), 0)⊤ be the tangential
trace of the magnetic field on Γ1 . It follows from (2.9) that

Observe that the medium is homogeneous in Ω1 , which gives ∇ · Ĕ = 0 in Ω1 . Eliminating the magnetic
field from (2.9) and using the divergence free condition in Ω1 , we obtain the Helmholtz equation for the
components of the electric field:
(
∆Ĕj (ρ, z) − ε1 µ1 s2 Ĕj (ρ, z) = 0

∂z Ĕj (ξ, h1 ) = −β1 (ξ)Ĕj (ξ, h1 ).

For any vector field Ĕ ∈ H(curl, Ω), it follows from Lemma 2.3 that its tangential component Ĕ Γj ∈

Bj [Ĕ Γj ] = H̆ × nj

on Γj ,

(2.16)

where the capacity operator Bj maps the tangential component of the electric field to the tangential trace of
the magnetic field. Taking the inverse Laplace transform of (2.16) yields the TBC in the time-domain:

where Tj = L −1 ◦ Bj ◦ L . Equivalently, we may eliminate the magnetic field and obtain an alternative
TBC for the electric field in the s-domain:
−1

j s (∇ × Ĕ) × nj + Bj [Ĕ Γj ] = 0 on Γj .

(2.17)

In the forthcoming sections, we shall use the method of energy to prove the well-posedness and stability
of the reduced problem (2.7). We point out that the method has also been adopted in [16] for solving the
time-dependent electromagnetic scattering problem from an open cavity.

AUXILIARY PROBLEMS

In this section, we present the energy estimates for two auxiliary problems, one is the time-harmonic
Maxwell equations with a complex wavenumber and another is the time-domain Maxwell equations with a
perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) boundary condition. These estimates will be used for the proof of the
main results for the time-domain Maxwell equations (2.7).
3.1. Time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations with a complex wavenumber. We shall study the variational
formulation for a time-harmonic Maxwell equations with a complex wavenumber, which is a frequency version of the initial-boundary value problem of the Maxwell equations under the Laplace transform.
Consider the auxiliary boundary value problem:

on Γj ,
µj s (∇ × u) × nj + Bj [uΓj ] = 0
where s = s1 + is2 with s1 > 0, s2 ∈ R and j is assumed to be compactly supported in Ω.
Multiplying the complex conjugate of a test function v ∈ H(curl, Ω), integrating over Ω, and using
integration by parts, we arrive at the variational formulation of (3.1): Find u ∈ H(curl, Ω) such that
Z
j · v̄dx, ∀ v ∈ H(curl, Ω),

Proof. It suffices to show the coercivity of the sesquilinear form of aTH since the continuity follows directly

3.2. Time-domain Maxwell’s equations with PEC condition. Consider the initial-boundary value problem
for the time-domain Maxwell equations with the PEC boundary condition:


∇ × U + µ∂t V = 0, ∇ × V − ε∂t U = 0
(3.7)
U × nj = 0
on Γj , t > 0,


U |t=0 = E 0 , V |t=0 = H 0
in Ω,

where E 0 , H 0 are assumed to be compactly supported in Ω.
Let Ŭ = L (U ) and V̆ = L (V ). Taking the Laplace transform of (3.7) and eliminating V̆ , we obtain
the boundary value problem:
(

∇ × (sµ)−1 ∇ × Ŭ + sεŬ = j̆
in Ω,
(3.8)
Ŭ × nj = 0
on Γj ,
where j̆ = εE 0 + s−1 ∇ × H 0 . The variational formulation for (3.8) is to find Ŭ ∈ H 0 (curl, Ω) such that
Z
j̆ · v̄dx, ∀ v ∈ H 0 (curl, Ω),
(3.9)
aTD (Ŭ , v) =

Following the same proof as that in Theorem 3.1, we may obtain the well-posedness of the variation problem
(3.9) and its stability estimate.
Lemma 3.2. The variational problem (3.8) has a unique solution Ŭ ∈ H 0 (curl, Ω) which satisfies
−1
k∇ × Ŭ kL2 (Ω) + ksŬ kL2 (Ω) . s−1
1 ksE 0 kL2 (Ω) + s1 k∇ × H 0 kL2 (Ω) .

Theorem 3.3. The auxiliary problem (3.7) has a unique solution (U , V ), which satisfies the stability estimates:
kU kL2 (Ω) + kV kL2 (Ω) . kE 0 kL2 (Ω) + kH 0 kL2 (Ω) ,

k∂t U kL2 (Ω) + k∂t V kL2 (Ω) . k∇ × E 0 kL2 (Ω) + k∇ × H 0 kL2 (Ω) ,

k∂t2 U kL2 (Ω) + k∂t2 V kL2 (Ω) . k∇ × (∇ × E 0 )kL2 (Ω) + k∇ × (∇ × H 0 )kL2 (Ω) .
Proof. Let Ŭ = L (U ) and V̆ = L (V ). Taking the Laplace transform of (3.7) and using the initial
condition lead to

∇ × Ŭ + sµV̆ = µH 0 , ∇ × V̆ − sεŬ = −εE 0
in Ω,
(3.10)
Ŭ × nj = 0
on Γj .
It follows from Lemma 3.2 that
−1
k∇ × Ŭ kL2 (Ω) + ksŬ kL2 (Ω) . s−1
1 ksE 0 kL2 (Ω) + s1 k∇ × H 0 kL2 (Ω) .

Combing the above inequality and (3.10) gives
−1
k − sµV̆ + µH 0 kL2 (Ω) + kε−1 ∇ × V̆ + E 0 k . s−1
1 ksE 0 kL2 (Ω) + s1 k∇ × H 0 kL2 (Ω) ,

which shows that
−1
k∇ × V̆ kL2 (Ω) + ksV̆ kL2 (Ω) . (1 + s−1
1 |s|)kE 0 kL2 (Ω) + kH 0 kL2 (Ω) + s1 k∇ × H 0 kL2 (Ω) .

It follows from [22, Lemma 44.1] that Ŭ and V̆ are holomorphic functions of s on the half plane s1 > γ̄ > 0,
where γ̄ is any positive constant. Hence we have from Lemma 2.4 that the inverse Laplace transform of Ŭ
and V̆ exist and they are supported in [0, ∞).

Taking the first and second partial derivative of (3.7) with respect to t yields

priori estimates for the scattering problem (3.7).
4.1. Well-posedness. Let e = E − U and h = H − V . Noting U × nj = 0, we have U Γj = 0 and
Tj [U Γj ] = 0. It follows from (2.7) and (3.7) that e and h satisfy the following initial-boundary value

Our strategy is to show the well-posedness and stability of (4.2) in the s-domain. The well-posedness of
(4.1) follows from Lemma 2.4 and the inverse Laplace transform.

(4.12)

Taking the derivative of (2.7) with respect to t, we know that (∂t E, ∂t H) satisfy the same set of equations
with the source J replaced by ∂t J, and the initial conditions replaced by ∂t E|t=0 = ε−1 ∇×H 0 , ∂t H|t=0 =
−µ−1 ∇ × E 0 . Hence we may follow the same steps as above to obtain (4.12) for (∂t E, ∂t H), which
completes the proof of (4.7) after combing the above estimates.

4.2. A priori estimates. Now we intend to derive a priori stability estimates for the electric field. Eliminating
the magnetic field in (2.1)–(2.2) and using the TBC in (2.18), we consider the following initial-boundary value

Theorem 4.4. Let E ∈ H(curl, Ω) be the solution of (4.14). If E 0 , E 1 ∈ L2 (Ω) and F ∈ L1 (0, T ; L2 (Ω)),
then E ∈ L∞ (0, T ; L2 (Ω)). Moreover, we have for any T > 0 that

Taking the L∞ - norm with respect to ξ on both sides of (4.24) yields
kEk2L∞ (0,T ;L2 (Ω)) . kE 0 k2L2 (Ω) + T (kF kL1 (0,T ;L2 (Ω)) + kE 1 kL2 (Ω) )kEkL∞ (0,T ;L2 (Ω)) .
Therefore, the estimate (4.15) follows directly from the Young inequality.
Integrating (4.24) with respect to ξ over (0, T ) and using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we obtain
kEk2L2 (0,T ;L2 (Ω)) . T kE 0 k2L2 (Ω) + T 3/2 (kF kL1 (0,T ;L2 (Ω)) + kE 1 kL2 (Ω) )kEkL2 (0,T ;L2 (Ω)) .
Using Young’s inequality again, we derive the L2 estimate (4.16), which completes the proof.



In Theorem 4.4, it is required that E 0 , E 1 ∈ L2 (Ω), and F ∈ L1 (0, T ; L2 (Ω)), which can be satisfied if
the data satisfy
E 0 ∈ L2 (Ω), H 0 ∈ H(curl, Ω), J ∈ H 1 (0, T ; L2 (Ω)).
5. C ONCLUSION
The scattering problems by unbounded structures have attracted much attention due to their wide applications and ample mathematical interests. Although extensive study have been done for the time-harmonic
problems, it is still not clear what the best conditions are for those material parameters such as the dielectric
permittivity and magnetic permeability to assure the well-posedness of the problems. In particular, it remains
an open problem whether it is well-posed for the real dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability.
In this paper, we studied the time-domain scattering problem in an unbounded structure for the real dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. The scattering problem was reduced to an initial-boundary
value problem by using an exact time-domain TBC. The reduced problem was shown to have a unique solution by using the energy method. The main ingredients of the proofs were the Laplace transform, the
Lax–Milgram lemma, and the Parseval identity. Moreover, by directly considering the variational problem of
the time-domain wave equation, we obtained a priori estimates with explicit dependence on time.
