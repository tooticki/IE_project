Abstract
We show that every countable group embeds in a group of type F P2 .

Introduction

In the late 1940’s, Higman, Neumann and Neumann showed that every countable group
embeds in a 2-generator group, in the same paper in which they introduced HNNextensions [6]. Neumann had already shown that there are uncountably many 2-generator
groups, from which it follows that they cannot all embed in finitely presented groups [9].
It was not until the early 1960’s that Higman was able to characterize the finitely generated subgroups of finitely presented groups [5]. The Higman embedding theorem is
a high-point of combinatorial group theory that makes precise the connection between
group presentations and logic: it states that a finitely generated group G embeds in some
finitely presented group if and only if G is recursively presented, i.e., there is an algorithm
to write down the relations that hold in G [5].
A group G is almost finitely presented1 or F P2 if its augmentation ideal IG is finitely
presented as a module for its group algebra ZG (see [3, VIII.5] or [2] for more details).
Every finitely presented group is F P2 , and every F P2 group is finitely generated. Bestvina
and Brady gave the first examples of F P2 groups that are not finitely presented [1],
although these examples arose as subgroups of finitely presented groups. In [7] the author
constructed groups of type F P2 that do not embed in any finitely presented group. Given
these examples it becomes natural to look for an analogue of the Higman embedding
theorem for F P2 groups. Our main theorem answers this question.
Theorem 1.1. Every countable group embeds in an F P2 group.
Although the statement is similar to the Higman-Neumann-Neumann embedding theorem, the proof is much closer to the Higman embedding theorem. In fact it is modelled
on Valiev’s proof of the Higman embedding theorem as described in [8, Sec. IV.7], which

This definition was used by Bieri and Strebel [2]; many authors use the phrase ‘almost finitely
presented’ for the weaker condition that the augmentation ideal in the mod-2 group algebra is finitely
presented.

is a simplification of Valiev’s first proof [11]. Our proof is simpler than these antecedents
because we are not obliged to consider recursively enumerable sets. We make the following
definition, which is an analogue of Higman’s notion of a benign subgroup.
Definition 1.2. A subgroup H of a finitely generated group G is a homologically benign
subgroup if the HNN-extension
GH = hG, t : t−1 ht = h h ∈ Hi
can be embedded in an F P2 group.
Theorem 1.1 implies that all subgroups of finitely generated groups are homologically
benign, however showing that various subgroups are homologically benign plays a major
role in the proof of Theorem 1.1. The result below details what we need from [7]; after
the statement we outline how to deduce it from results stated in [7].
Theorem 1.3. For any fixed l ≥ 4 and any set S of integers with 0 ∈ S, there is an F P2
group J = J(l, S) and a sequence j1 , . . . , jl of elements of J such that j1s j2s · · · jls = 1 if
and only if s ∈ S.
Proof. The groups GL (S) that are constructed in [7] depend on a connected flag simplicial
complex L and a set S ⊆ Z. If L has perfect fundamental group and contains an edge
loop of length l that is not homotopic to a constant map, then J = GL (S) has the claimed
properties. See [7, section 2] for an explicit example of a suitable L in the case l = 4;
examples for larger l can be obtained by taking subdivisions of this L.
We expand a little by giving the precise results within [7] that guarantee the various
properties of the group J = J(l, S). When 0 ∈ S ⊆ Z, [7, theorem 1.2] gives a presentation for GL (S) with generators the directed edges of L. By [7, theorem 1.3], the
group GL (S) is F P2 if and only if the fundamental group of L is perfect. If j1 , . . . , jl
is a directed loop in L that does not bound a disk then by [7, Lemma 14.4], the word
j1s j2s · · · jls in the given generators for J is equal to the identity if and only if s ∈ S.
Theorem 1.3 enables one to encode arbitrary subsets of the natural numbers N in
presentations for F P2 groups. This theorem replaces those parts of Valiev’s proof that
concern Diophantine equations or those parts of Higman’s proof that concern recursive
functions, each of which is used to encode recursively enumerable subsets of N in finite
presentations.

The proofs

Since this section is closely modelled on Lyndon and Schupp’s account of the Higman
embedding theorem [8, Sec. IV.7], we have tried to stay close to the notation that they
use. We also omit arguments that are identical to those in [8].
Since we will be working with presentations, it is convenient to have a characterization of the F P2 property in terms of presentations. Recall that the Cayley complex for
a presentation of a group G is the universal cover of the presentation 2-complex. The
group G acts freely on its Cayley complex, with one orbit of vertices and with orbits of
2

1- and 2-cells corresponding to the generators and relators respectively in the presentation. We define a partial Cayley complex to be a G-invariant subcomplex of the Cayley
complex; partial Cayley complexes are in bijective correspondence with subcomplexes of
the presentation complex.
Proposition 2.1. Let H be given by a presentation with finitely many generators and a
countable set of relators r1 , r2 , . . .. The following are equivalent.
(i) H is F P2 .
(ii) There exists m so that for each i > m, the loop defined by ri represents zero in the
homology of the partial Cayley complex corresponding to all the generators and the
relators r1 , . . . , rm .
(iii) There is a connected free H-CW-complex with finitely many orbits of cells and
perfect fundamental group.
Proof. Equivalence of (i) and (ii). Let X be the Cayley complex for H and let Xm be
the partial Cayley complex containing all 1-cells and only the 2-cells that correspond to
the relators r1 , . . . , rm . Let C∗ (X) and C∗ (Xm ) denote the cellular chain complexes of X
and Xm . The image of the map d1 : C1 (X) → C0 (X) is isomorphic to the augmentation
ideal IH . Hence H is F P2 if and only if the kernel of d1 is finitely generated as a
ZH-module. Since H1 (X) is trivial, this kernel is equal to the image d2 (C2 (X)). The
stated condition on loops is equivalent to d2 (C2 (Xm )) = d2 (C2 (X)). If this holds then
clearly d2 (C2 (X)) is finitely generated. Conversely, any finite subset of d2 (C2 (X)) is
contained in some d2 (C2 (Xm )), so if d2 (C2 (X)) is finitely generated then there exists m
with d2 (C2 (Xm )) = d2 (C2 (X)).
(ii) =⇒ (iii) and (iii) =⇒ (i). Each Xi is a connected H-CW-complex with finitely
many orbits of cells, and if (ii) holds then H1 (Xm ) ∼
= H1 (X) is trivial. Given any HCW-complex Y as in (iii), pick a maximal subtree T in Y /H, let Te be the set of lifts
of T in Y , and note that Te is equivariantly isomorphic to T × H. The cellular chain
complex C∗ (Y, Te) gives a finite presentation for the relative homology group H1 (Y, Te) as
a ZH-module. Since H1 (Y ) = 0, H1 (Y, Te) is isomorphic to IH .
Next we give the homological version of the Higman Rope Trick [8, IV.7.6].
Lemma 2.2. If R is a homologically benign normal subgroup of a finitely generated group
F , then F/R is embeddable in an F P2 group.
Proof. Fix R as in the statement, and let H be an F P2 group containing the group
FR = hF, t : t−1 rt = r, r ∈ Ri. Let L be the subgroup of FR ≤ H generated by F and
t−1 F t, so that L ∼
= F ∗R F . As in [8, IV.7.6] there is a homomorphism φ : L → F/R
whose restriction to F is equal to the quotient map F → F/R and whose restriction to
t−1 F t is the trivial homomorphism. Viewing L as a subgroup of H, the map l 7→ (l, φ(l))
defines a second copy of L inside H × F/R. Let K be the HNN-extension in which the
stable letter conjugates these two copies:
K = hH × F/R, s : s−1 (l, 1)s = (l, φ(l)), l ∈ Li.

3

The group K is generated by the generators for H, the generators for F/R and the element s. As defining relators we may take the relators for F/R, the relators for H, finitely
many relators stating that the generators for H and the generators for F/R commute,
and finitely many relators of the form s−1 (l, 1)s(l, φ(l))−1 for l in some generating set
for L. As in [8, IV.7.6], the relators that hold between the generators for F/R can be
eliminated from this presentation for K, leaving just the relators for H and finitely many
other relators.
To see that K is F P2 , we use Proposition 2.1 applied to the presentation 2-complex
with the generators and relators described above. The generators and relators for H
are contained in those for K, so we may look at the partial Cayley complex for K
corresponding to just these generators and relators. This 2-complex is isomorphic to a
disjoint union of copies of the Cayley complex for H (one copy for each coset of H in K).
Let r1 , r2 . . . be an enumeration of the relators for H. Since H is F P2 , there exists m
so that for i > m, the relator ri represents zero in the homology of the partial Cayley
complex for H with just the relators r1 , . . . , rm . It follows that these same loops represent
zero in the homology of the partial Cayley complex for K discussed above.
Now consider the partial Cayley complex for K, taking all the generators, the commutation relators between generators for H and F/R, the finitely many relators involving s,
and the relators r1 , . . . , rm . For i > m, the loops in this complex defined by ri represent
the zero element of homology, since they already represent 0 in the smaller partial Cayley
complex consisting of a disjoint union of copies of the Cayley complex for H. Hence this
presentation for K satisfies condition (ii) of Proposition 2.1, and so K is F P2 .
Lemma 2.3. Let G be a finitely generated group which is embeddable in an F P2 group.
• Every finitely generated subgroup of G is homologically benign in G.
• If H and K are homologically benign subgroups of G, then so are their intersection
and the subgroup that they generate.
Proof. Almost identical to the proof of [8, Lemma IV.7.7], except that it relies on the fact
that a free product with amalgamation P = M ∗G N is F P2 provided that M and N are
F P2 and G is finitely generated rather than on a similar statement for finite presentability.
This can be proved easily using Proposition 2.1.
Lemma 2.4. Fix l ≥ 4, and for any integer s define vs := cs0 cs1 · · · csl des , an element of
the free group H = hc0 , . . . , cl , d, ei of rank l + 3. For any S ⊆ Z with 0 ∈ S, the subgroup
VS := hvs : s ∈ Si ≤ hc0 , . . . , cl , d, ei
is homologically benign and is freely generated by the given elements.
Proof. If a reduced word in the elements vs is written out in terms of the elements
c0 , . . . , cl , d, e, the only cancellation that can take place involves c0 and e. Thus the
subwords (cs1 cs2 · · · csl d)±1 survive uncancelled, which implies that the elements vs are free
generators for the subgroup VZ of H.
We claim that VZ is benign, and hence homologically benign. To see this, define an
ascending HNN-extension of the free group H = hc0 , . . . , cl , d, ei by
−1
−1
u−1 ci u = c0 c1 · · · ci−1 ci c−1
i−1 ci−2 · · · c0 ,

4

u−1du = c0 c1 · · · cl de,

u−1 eu = e.

Since u−1 vs u = vs+1 for all s ∈ Z and v0 = d it follows that
hd, ui ∩ H = VZ .
Hence VZ is benign in hc0 , . . . , cl , d, e, ui and therefore also in the free group H.
Fix some S ⊆ Z, and claim that VS is homologically benign in H. To see this, let
J = J(l, S) and j1 , . . . , jl ∈ J be as in the statement of Theorem 1.3, and let K = K(S)
be
K = hc0 , d, ei ∗ (hc1 , c2 , . . . , cl i × J) = H ∗hc1 ,...,cl i (hc1 , c2 , . . . , cl i × J).
The group K is F P2 , since it has a presentation in which the only relators are the relators
of J and finitely many commutation relators between c1 , . . . , cl and the generators of J.
Define an HNN-extension M = M(S) of K, with base group H and stable letter t via
t−1 c0 t = c0 ,

t−1 ci t = ci ji for i > 0,

t−1 dt = d,

t−1 et = e.

The group M is F P2 and its subgroups VZ , t−1 VZ t and H are all homologically benign.
The elements t−1 vs t freely generate the free group t−1 VZ t. In terms of the generators
for K, t−1 vs t = cs0 cs1 · · · csl j1s · · · jls des . When a reduced word in the elements t−1 vs t is
written in these terms, the only cancellation that can take place involves c0 and e, thus
the subwords (cs1 · · · csl j1s · · · jls d)±1 survive uncancelled. It follows that such a reduced
word is in H if and only if each subword j1s · · · jls is equal to 1, or equivalently each s that
occurs lies in S. Hence VS is equal to t−1 VZ t ∩ H and is homologically benign in M and
in H.
As in [8, IV.7], let L be the free group L = ha, bi, and let F be the free group of rank
l + 6 with F = ha, b, c0 , . . . , cl , d, e, hi. Define a Gödel numbering γ of all words on the
alphabet {a, b, a−1 , b−1 } by the formula
γ(∅) = 0,

γ(a) = 1,

γ(a−1 ) = 3,

γ(b) = 2,

γ(b−1 ) = 4,

and extending to longer words by concatenation, viewing a concatenation of digits as a
number. Thus γ is a bijection between the words and the subset of N consisting of zero
and all integers whose decimal digits lie in the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.
To any word w on {a, b, a−1 , b−1 }, associate a codeword gw ∈ L defined by
γ(w) γ(w)
c1

gw := whc0

γ(w)

· · · cl

deγ(w) .

The subgroup G of F generated by all the elements gw is freely generated by them.
Lemma 2.5. The subgroup G is benign in F .
Proof. Almost identical to the argument in [8, IV.7]. Make a group F ∗ defined as the
fundamental group of a graph of groups with one vertex group F , and four edges corresponding to stable letters uλ for λ ∈ {a, b, a−1 , b−1 }, each of which defines an ascending
HNN-extension of F with relations
u−1
λ auλ = a,

γ(λ) γ(λ)
c1

u−1
λ buλ = b,
γ(λ) γ(λ)
c1

u−1
λ duλ = c0

In F ∗ , we have that for any word w = λ1 · · · λn ,
−1

λ1 · · · uλn g∅ uλn · · · uλ1 = uλ1 · · · uλn hduλn · · · uλ1 = gw ,

and if w = uλ then uλ gw u−1
λ = gu .
To show that G is benign in F , it suffices to show that in F ∗ ,
G = F ∩ hg∅ , ua, ub , ua−1 , ub−1 i.
From the equations given above, it is clear that the left-hand side is contained in the righthand side. As in [8, IV.7], to prove the converse it suffices to show that whenever z ∈ G
−1
and λ ∈ {a, b, a−1 , b−1 } are such that uλ zu−1
λ ∈ F , then in fact uλ zuλ ∈ G, or equivalently
ǫ1
ǫn
z ∈ u−1
λ Guλ . For this, write z = gw1 · · · gwn as a reduced word in the elements gw , with
ǫi = ±1. When this expression for z is rewritten in terms of the generators for F and
γ(w ) γ(w )
γ(w )
reduced, each subword of the form (c1 i c2 i · · · cl i d)ǫi survives uncancelled, and any
two such subwords are separated by a non-trivial word in the other generators a, b, c0 , e, h.
γ(λ) γ(λ)
γ(λ)

Each of the natural free generators for u−1
c1 · · · cl deγ(λ)
λ F uλ except uλ duλ = c0
has total exponent of each ci divisible by 10. From this it follows that each γ(wi ) is
congruent to γ(λ) modulo 10, and hence that wi = xi λ for some shorter word xi , so that
z ∈ u−1
λ Guλ as required.
Corollary 2.6. Every subgroup of the free group L = ha, bi is homologically benign.
Proof. Let N be a subgroup of L, and define a subset S = S(N) ⊆ N as the set of Gödel
codes for words w on {a, b, a−1 , b−1 } that are equal (as elements of L) to an element of N:
S = {γ(w) : w ∈L N}.
Now let YS be the free product ha, b, hi ∗ VS ≤ F , where VS is as defined in the statement
of Lemma 2.4. By that lemma, VS is homologically benign, and hence YS is homologically
benign in F . Since YS is freely generated by {a, b, h, vs : s ∈ S}, it is easy to see that
G ∩ YS is freely generated by {gw : w ∈ N}. (Recall that vs = cs0 cs1 · · · csl des .) Hence
G ∩ YS is homologically benign. The subgroup generated by G ∩ YS and the finite set
{c0 , . . . , cl , d, e, h}, which is equal to N ∗ hc0, . . . , cl , d, e, hi, is therefore also homologically
benign and the intersection of this group with L is equal to N.
We are now ready to complete the proof of Theorem 1.1. By the Higman-NeumannNeumann embedding theorem [6, 8], any countable group can be embedded in a 2generator group. This 2-generator group is isomorphic to L/N for some normal subgroup
N. By Corollary 2.6, N is homologically benign, and so by Lemma 2.2, L/N can be
embedded in an F P2 group.

Closing remarks

An opinion attributed to Gromov [4, Ch. 1] is that any statement that is valid for every
countable group should be trivial. With this in mind, is there an easier, more direct proof
of Theorem 1.1? Is there one that is not modelled on a proof of the Higman embedding
theorem and that does not does not rely on Theorem 1.3, or other results from [1, 7]?
6

To prove Theorem 1.1, we only need the groups J(l, S) for some fixed l ≥ 4. Our
motivation for allowing l to vary comes from the above question. For any l ≥ 4 and any
S with 0 ∈ S ⊆ Z, define a group J ′ (l, S) by the presentation
J ′ (l, S) = hj1 , . . . , jl : j1s j2s · · · jls = 1 s ∈ Si.
If one could show that J ′ (l, S) embeds in a group of type F P2 and that j1s j2s · · · jls 6= 1 if
s∈
/ S without invoking [1, 7], one would obtain a different proof of Theorem 1.1. If l ≥ 13,
the given presentation for J ′ (l, S) satisfies the C ′ (1/6) small cancellation condition [8,
Ch. 5]. This can be used to give a different proof that j1s j2s · · · jls 6= 1 for s ∈
/ S.
The proof of the Higman-Neumann-Neumann embedding theorem in [8, IV.3] implies
that any F P2 group embeds in a 2-generator F P2 group. It follows that every countable
group embeds in a 2-generator F P2 group.
The groups J = J(l, S) in Theorem 1.3 may be chosen to have cohomological dimension cd J = 2 in addition to the stated properties. By keeping track of the cohomological
dimension at each stage of the argument one obtains the following strengthened version
of Corollary 2.6, and hence a strengthened version of Theorem 1.1:
Corollary 3.1. For every subgroup N of the free group L = ha, bi, the HNN-extension
hL, t : t−1 nt = n n ∈ Ni embeds in an F P2 group of cohomological dimension five.
Theorem 3.2. Every countable group G embeds in a 2-generator F P2 group G∗ , with
cd G∗ ≤ cd G + 5. Every torsion element in G∗ is conjugate to an element of G.
The proof of the Higman embedding theorem in [8, IV.7] shows that every recursively presented group G of finite cohomological dimension embeds in a finitely presented
group G∗ of finite cohomological dimension. However, cd G∗ increases with the complexity of the Diophantine equation used to encode the relators in G. Applying Sapir’s
aspherical version of the Higman embedding theorem [10] gives the following.
Theorem 3.3. For every recursive subgroup N of the free group L = ha, bi, the HNNextension hL, t : t−1 nt = n n ∈ Ni embeds in a finitely presented group of cohomological
dimension two.
Combining this with the Higman rope trick [8, IV.7.6] gives a version of the Higman
embedding theorem which is an analogue of Theorem 3.2, but with a better bound on
cd G∗ .
Theorem 3.4. Every recursively presented group G embeds into a finitely presented 2generator group G∗ with cd G∗ ≤ cd G + 2. Every torsion element in G∗ is conjugate to
an element of G.
