REPRESENTATION GROWTH OF COMPACT LINEAR GROUPS
JOKKE HÄSÄ AND ALEXANDER STASINSKI
Abstract. We study the representation growth of simple compact Lie groups
and of SLn (O), where O is a compact discrete valuation ring, as well as the
twist representation growth of GLn (O). This amounts to a study of the abscissae of convergence of the corresponding (twist) representation zeta functions.
We determine the abscissae for a class of Mellin zeta functions which include
the Witten zeta functions. As a special case, we obtain a new proof of the
theorem of Larsen and Lubotzky that the abscissa of Witten zeta functions is
r/κ, where r is the rank and κ the number of positive roots.
We then show that the twist zeta function of GLn (O) exists and has the
same abscissa of convergence as the zeta function of SLn (O), provided n does
not divide char O. We compute the twist zeta function of GL2 (O) when the
residue characteristic p of O is odd, and approximate the zeta function when
p = 2 to deduce that the abscissa is 1. Finally, we construct a large part of
the representations of SL2 (Fq [[t]]), q even, and deduce that its abscissa lies in
the interval [1, 5/2].

1. Introduction
For a group G, let ri (G) denote the number of isomorphism classes of irreducible
complex representations of G of dimension i. When G is a topological group, we
only consider continuous representations. If G is such that ri (G) is finite for every
i ∈ N and the sequence ri (G) grows at most polynomially, then the Dirichlet series
ζG (s) =

∞
X
ri (G)
i=1

is

converges for all s in a complex right half plane, and we then call ζG (s) the representation zeta function of G. Groups satisfying the above conditions include arithmetic
groups with the congruence subgroup property, as well as compact Lie groups and
rational points of semisimple group schemes over compact discrete valuation rings,
such as SLn (Zp ) and SLn (Fq [[t]]) (see [23] and Remark 5.11).
Representation growth pertains to the asymptotic properties of the sequence
PN
RN (G) = i=1 ri (G). If RN (G) grows at most polynomially, the series defining
ζG (s) converges for some real s, and if RN (G) → ∞, the series defining ζG (s)
diverges for some negative real s. It follows that in this case
lim sup
N →∞

log RN (G)
= inf{s ∈ R | ζG (s) converges}
log N

is the abscissa of convergence of ζG (s), which we denote by α or α(G) and sometimes
refer to simply as the abscissa of G. Thus the series defining ζG (s) converges in
the right half-plane Re(s) > α and diverges in the left half-plane Re(s) < α (see
e.g., [2, Theorem 8.2]). Moreover, RN (G) = O(N α+ε ) for every real ε > 0, and α
is minimal with this property, so the abscissa of convergence controls the rate of
representation growth.
A systematic study of the representation growth of arithmetic and compact
groups was initiated by Michael Larsen and Alex Lubotzky in [21]. Among other
things, they proved that if G is a sufficiently nice simple group scheme over the
ring of integers OK in a number field K such that G(OK ) has the Congruence
Subgroup Property (CSP), then ζG(OK ) (s) has an Euler product:
Y
ζG(OK ) (s) = ζG(C) (s)[K:Q]
ζG(OK,p ) (s),
p

where p runs through the non-zero prime ideals of OK and OK,p denotes the completion of OK at p (see [21, Proposition 1.3]). Note that each archimedean factor is
equal to ζG(C) (s), which counts rational (equivalently, smooth) representations of
the Lie group G(C). It is well known that the representations of G(C) are in one
to one correspondence with those of the compact real form.
In the present paper, we study the abscissae of convergence of local factors of
the above Euler product. In addition, we consider some zeta functions ζG(C) (s) and
ζG(OK,p ) (s) which do not necessarily arise as local factors of an Euler product (this
happens for groups which do not satisfy the CSP, for example, SL2 (Z)).
Witten and Mellin zeta functions. Zeta functions of the form ζG(C) (s), or
more precisely, their meromorphic continuations, are called Witten zeta functions.
In [35] Witten related some of their special values to geometric invariants. The

Witten zeta functions are defined by series which are special cases of series of the
form
∞
X
ζ(P ; s) =
P (x1 , . . . , xr )−s ,
x1 ,...,xr =1

where P ∈ C[x1 , . . . , xr ] is a polynomial such that the real parts of its coefficients
are positive. Such series were first studied by Hjalmar Mellin [26], who proved that
they converge in a half-plane and admit meromorphic continuation to the whole
complex plane. We will refer to these meromorphic continuations as Mellin zeta
functions. Subsequently, several authors considered variants of these functions with
different restrictions on the coefficients of P (see, for example, [25], [28] and [10]).
Witten zeta functions are obtained when P is a polynomial originating from the
Weyl dimension formula for representation degrees of compact Lie groups.
One of the main theorems proved by Larsen and Lubotzky [21, Theorem 5.1]
is that the Witten zeta function ζG(C) (s) = ζ(P ; s) has abscissa of convergence
r/κ, where r is the rank and κ is the number of positive roots in the root system
associated to G(C). In fact, here r is also the number of variables of P and κ is the
degree of P . In Section 2 we give a new proof of this, and in fact we determine the
abscissa for a more general class of Mellin zeta functions. Namely, let P = P1 · · · Pκ ,
where each Pi is a linear polynomial in r variables over R of the form
Pi = ai1 x1 + ai2 x2 + · · · + air xr .
We assume all the coefficients aij are non-negative and at least one of them is
positive for each i. One can show that Witten zeta functions are of the form
ζ(P ; s) (after the change of variables xi 7→ xi − 1), but not every ζ(P ; s) comes
from a Witten zeta function.
To describe the abscissa of ζ(P ; s), we need information on the structure of the
linear factors Pi . For any subset of variables {xj1 , . . . , xjl }, we consider subpolynomials P [j1 , . . . , jl ], which we define as the product of those linear factors of P
which contain only the variables xj1 , . . . , xjl with a non-zero coefficient. For any
subpolynomial Q of P , we write r(Q) for l, the number of variables appearing in Q,
and κ(Q) for the number of linear factors in Q, which is also the degree of Q. Let
SP be the set of all proper subpolynomials of P , including the ‘empty’ subpolynomial 1 with no variables and degree 0. In Theorems 2.1 and 2.3, we show that the
abscissa of convergence of ζ(P ; s) equals
max

Q∈SP

r − r(Q)
.
κ − κ(Q)

The main idea of the proof (see the proof of Theorem 2.3) is the following. First,
we partition the domain of summation for the series (i.e. the positive orthant) into
components. Then, we use the structure of the linear factors Pi to find a certain
monomial term xe1i · · · xerr from P for each component separately, to obtain an upper
bound for P (x1 , . . . , xr )−s . The idea is that in each component, the variables xi
dominate each other in a certain order, and the monomial is chosen so that the
contribution of each variable is maximised in that component.
In the case where ζ(P ; s) is a Witten zeta function, the structure of the linear
factors in the polynomial P is translated via the Weyl dimension formula into the
structure of the root system. We obtain the result of Larsen and Lubotzky as a
special case of our general result by applying the following property of irreducible

4

root systems: taking the ratio r/κ for all Levi subsystems of the root system,
the minimal value is obtained for the full system (Lemma 2.7). This result is
not original, as it is used in the proof in [21]. However, having considered the
more general zeta functions ζ(P ; s), we are able to show that this property is in
fact necessary for the result: if the polynomial P does not have the corresponding
property with respect to its substructure, the abscissa will be strictly greater than
r/κ (cf. Corollary 2.4).
Zeta functions of SLn and GLn over compact local rings. In the remainder of the paper we study the abscissae of convergence of certain zeta functions
ζSLn (OK,p ) (s), including the case where OK is the ring of integers in a global function field K. Prior to the present work, most results have been in the number field
case, as this case allows the use of the Kirillov orbit method. Let O denote one
of the rings OK,p , that is, O is any compact discrete valuation ring with residue
field of characteristic p. Andrei Jaikin-Zapirain [18, Theorem 7.5] showed that
α(SL2 (O)) = 1 when p 6= 2. Nir Avni, Benjamin Klopsch, Uri Onn and Christopher Voll proved that when char O = 0, we have α(SL2 (O)) = 1 for any p (see [3,
Corollary 2.3]) and α(SL3 (O)) = 2/3 for p large enough (see [3, Theorem 1.4], [4,
Theorem E] and [5, Corollary D]). Furthermore, Michele Zordan [36] has proved
that the abscissa of α(SL4 (O)) = 1/2 for char O = 0 and p 6= 2. While these
known values equal r/κ, it is also known, by a result of Larsen and Lubotzky
[21, Theorem 8.1], that α(SLn (O)) ≥ 1/15, so the abscissa is greater than r/κ for
n > 30. In [1], Avraham Aizenbud and Nir Avni showed that if char O = 0, we have
α(SLn (O)) ≤ 22, for any n (they also proved similar results for other semisimple
groups).
Twist representation growth of GLn (O). In Section 3, we initiate the study of twist
representation zeta functions of GLn (O), where the representations are counted
up to one-dimensional twists. Such twist zeta functions have already been studied
for nilpotent groups (cf. [33] and [15]). The idea is that the abscissa of ζSLn (O) (s)
is closely related to that of the twist zeta function of GLn (O). This is useful
because from some points of view, the representation theory of GLn (O) (even up
to twisting) is easier than that of SLn (O). We show that the number of twist
isoclasses of irreducible representations of GLn (O) of a given dimension is finite,
and hence that the twist representation zeta function ζ̃GLn (O) (s) can be defined by
the Dirichlet series counting twist isoclasses of a given dimension. We also prove
that if char O does not divide n, then the abscissa of ζ̃GLn (O) (s) is equal to that of
ζSLn (O) (s) (see Proposition 3.4).
Twist zeta functions of GL2 (O). In Section 4, we study the twist zeta functions
ζ̃GL2 (O) (s) for any O, using Clifford theory. In Theorem 4.14, we give an exact
formula for ζ̃GL2 (O) (s) when the residue characteristic p of O is odd. This formula
does not follow from the known formula for ζSL2 (O) (s) (with p 6= 2) in any straightforward way. As part of the formula for ζ̃GL2 (O) (s), we compute the twist zeta
function of GL2 (Fq ). Even this was, as far as we are aware, not known previously,
and the computation hinges on certain properties of Deligne–Lusztig induction. In
Theorem 4.18, we give an asymptotic upper bound for the number of twist isoclasses of given dimension, and deduce that the abscissa of ζ̃GL2 (O) (s), for O of
characteristic 0 and p = 2, is 1. As mentioned above, it was previously known

REPRESENTATION GROWTH OF COMPACT LINEAR GROUPS

that the abscissa of ζSL2 (O) (s) is 1 whenever char O = 0. Our computations of the
abscissa of ζ̃GL2 (O) (s) in this case, together with Proposition 3.4, give a new proof
of this fact. We also show that the abscissa of ζ̃GL2 (O) (s) is 1 when char O = 2,
that is, when O = Fq [[t]] with q even. This does not follow from any previously
known results and our computation is substantially harder than in the cases where
char O 6= 2.
The zeta function of SL2 (Fq [[t]]), q even. In Section 5, we assume that char O = 2,
that is, O = Fq [[t]] with q even. We give a Clifford theory construction of the
representations of SL2 (Fq [[t]]/(tr )) for r even, which is completely explicit apart
from the order of certain finite groups V (β, θ) (see Definition 5.7) and certain
integers c ∈ {1, 2, 3} (see Lemma 4.21). We use this construction to approximate
the zeta function ζSL2 (O) (s), and show that its abscissa lies between 1 and 5/2
(Theorem 5.9). The lower bound 1 follows from a general result of Larsen and
Lubotzky [21, Proposition 6.6], but we give an independent proof of this.
Section 6 is devoted to a proof of Lemma 4.21, which is crucial for our results
about ζ̃GL2 (Fq [[t]]) (s) and ζSL2 (Fq [[t]]) (s) when q is even. The lemma gives the number
of solutions, up to a factor c ∈ {1, 2, 3}, in Fq [[t]]/(ti ), i ≥ 1, to the equation

Remark. After the present paper had been accepted for publication, Hassain M and
Pooja Singla [24] announced results about the representations of SL2 (O), p = 2,
which in particular imply that the abscissa of ζSL2 (Fq [[t]]) (s) is 1.
Notation. We let N stand for the set of natural numbers, not including 0.
In Sections 4 and 5, we will use the Vinogradov notation f (r) ≪ g(r) for two
functions f (r), g(r) of r (or of l = ⌈r/2⌉). Note that f (r) ≪ g(r) is equivalent to
f (r) = O(g(r)). We will also write f (r) ≍ g(r) when f (r) ≪ g(r) and g(r) ≪ f (r).

2. Representation zeta functions of simple Lie groups
In this section, we will determine the abscissa of convergence of a class of Mellin
zeta functions which contains the Witten zeta functions. Let P be a polynomial in
r variables over R with positive coefficients. As mentioned in the introduction, the
series
∞
X
(1)
ζ(P ; s) =
P (x1 , . . . , xr )−s
x1 ,...,xr =1

has an abscissa of convergence and extends meromorphically to a Mellin zeta function. Both the series (1) and the continued function will be denoted by ζ(P ; s). We
will speak of the abscissa of convergence either of the series (1) or its meromorphic

continuation (where, in the latter case, we mean the maximum of the real parts of
its poles), and since one determines the other, there is no ambiguity.
In the following, we will write x̄ = (x1 , . . . , xr ) and use the convention that for
PN

PN
PN
positive integers n and N , a sum x̄=n means x1 =n x2 =n · · · xr =n .
Let κ stand for the degree of P . Since the coefficients of P are positive real
numbers, we can estimate the partial sums of (1), when s is real and positive, as
follows:
N
X
P (x̄)−s ≥ N r P (N, . . . , N )−s .
x̄=1

It is then clear that the series (1) diverges whenever s < r/κ (for real s), so the
abscissa of convergence is always at least r/κ.
We will restrict our attention to the case where P is a product of linear factors.
In Subsection 2.1, we compute the exact abscissa of convergence for these types of
series. In particular, polynomials of this form arise from the Weyl formula for the
dimensions of irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. In that context,
the Mellin zeta function is the representation zeta function of the group, also known
as the Witten zeta function. Larsen and Lubotzky showed in [21, Theorem 5.1] that
the abscissa of convergence of the Witten zeta function corresponding to a simple,
simply-connected, complex Lie group is r/κ, where r is the rank of the root system
of the group and κ the number of positive roots. This result follows from our more
general setting, as will be explained in Subsection 2.2.
Mellin zeta functions of a certain type were also studied by Kurt Mahler in
[25], among others. Mahler considered polynomials P (x̄) satisfying the following
hypothesis: P does not vanish for x1 ≥ 0, . . . , xr ≥ 0, and its top degree homogeneous part vanishes only at the origin. This class of polynomials is also described in
[12]. For these polynomials, he could prove that the abscissa of convergence has the
minimal possible value r/κ. It was claimed in [6, Theorem 20] that the abscissa of
convergence of Witten zeta functions follows directly from Mahler’s result and the
Weyl dimension formula. However, we note that this is not the case, since the polynomials arising from the Weyl dimension formula are usually not included in the
class of polynomials considered by Mahler. In fact, it follows from our results that
one can not prove the Larsen–Lubotzky result without proving a certain property
of the root systems, which we record as Lemma 2.7.
Having explained in detail how the abscissa of convergence of a Witten zeta
function is affected by the structure of the root system, it is possible to consider
the partial contributions of certain classes of representations to the abscissa. In
Subsection 2.3, we define a representation to be regular if its dominant weight
corresponds to a semi-simple element via the Killing form, and irregular otherwise.
We then show in Proposition 2.8 that only the regular representations contribute
to the abscissa of convergence (and hence to the representation growth) of a simple
compact Lie group.
2.1. The abscissae of convergence. We will determine the abscissae of convergence of Mellin zeta functions associated to a certain class of polynomials, which
we now define. Let P = P1 · · · Pκ , where each Pi ∈ R[x̄] is a linear polynomial of
the form
Pi = ai1 x1 + ai2 x2 + · · · + air xr .

We assume all the coefficients aij are non-negative and at least one of them is
positive for each i. The degree of P is κ, the number of linear factors.
For any subset of variables {xj1 , . . . , xjl }, we define the subpolynomial P [j1 , . . . , jl ]
as the product of those linear factors of P which contain only the variables xj1 , . . . , xjl
with a non-zero coefficient. For any subpolynomial Q of P , we write r(Q) for l, the
number of variables appearing in Q, and κ(Q) for the number of linear factors in
Q, which is also the degree of Q.
For example, if P = x1 x2 (x1 + 3x2 )(2x1 + x3 ), we have r = 3 and κ = 4. The
polynomial P has subpolynomials P [1, 2] = x1 x2 (x1 + 3x2 ) and P [1] = x1 , among
others. We have r(P [1, 2]) = 2, κ(P [1, 2]) = 3 and r(P [1]) = 1, κ(P [1]) = 1.
Let SP be the set of all proper subpolynomials of P , including the ‘empty’
subpolynomial 1 with no variables and degree 0. Define
α = max

Q∈SP

r − r(Q)
.
κ − κ(Q)

Note that because we are taking the empty subpolynomial into account, we have
α ≥ r/κ. We proceed to prove that the abscissa of convergence of ζ(P ; s) equals α.
Theorem 2.1. Suppose s ∈ R, s < α. Then the series ζ(P ; s) diverges.
Proof. Since s < α, we can choose a proper subpolynomial Q of P satisfying
r − r(Q)
> s.
κ − κ(Q)
By relabeling the variables, we may assume that Q = P [1, . . . , l], with l = r(Q).
Consider the polynomial P ′ = P (1, . . . , 1, xl+1 , . . . , xr ). By this substitution, all
linear factors contained in the subpolynomial Q become constants. The number
of these factors is κ(Q), and all the remaining factors contain at least one of the
variables xl+1 , . . . , xr with a non-negative coefficient. We can now estimate
N

x̄=1

P (x̄)−s ≥

N

P ′ (xl+1 , . . . , xr )−s .

xl+1 ,...,xr =1

The sum on the right hand side is taken over r − r(Q) variables, and the degree of
the polynomial P ′ is κ − κ(Q). As all the coefficients in P ′ are still non-negative,
the abscissa of convergence of ζ(P ′ ; s) is known to be at least (r − r(Q))/(κ − κ(Q))
(as remarked in the beginning of Section 2). Since s is smaller than this ratio, we
know that the right hand side of the above inequality diverges as N → ∞. This
proves the claim.

The above theorem shows that α is a lower bound for the abscissa of convergence
of ζ(P ; s). Next, we will prove that α is also an upper bound, and hence that the
abscissa equals α. We will use the following integral test for convergence of our
multi-variable series:

converges if the corresponding integral [1,∞)r f (x̄) dx̄ is finite.

Proof. Since all terms in the infinite series are non-negative, one can show convergence by finding an upper bound for the set of partial sums of the series. To this

end, let N ∈ N = {1, 2, . . . }. We aim to describe an upper bound for the partial

Let
WN = {x̄ ∈ {1, . . . , N }r | xi = 1 for some i}

denote the set of integral points on the boundary of the domain of integration
[1, ∞)r whose coordinates are bounded by N . The proof proceeds as the one for
the usual integral test for series of one variable, except that one has to consider the
sum over WN separately.
We have a map WN → {2, . . . , N }r given by sending x̄ to x̄♯ = (x♯1 , . . . , x♯r ),
where
(
x♯i = xi if xi > 1,
x♯i = 2 if xi = 1.
For every monomial term axn1 1 · · · xnr r in f and each i, we have

axn1 1 · · · 2ni · · · xnr r ≤ 2κ · axn1 1 · · · 1ni · · · xnr r ,

where κ is the total degree of f and x1 , . . . , xr ∈ [1, ∞). Therefore, for any x̄ ∈ WN ,
we have
f (x̄♯ ) ≤ 2κr f (x̄).

Thus, we obtain the estimate

Theorem 2.3. Suppose s ∈ R, s > α. Then the series ζ(P ; s) converges.

summands are positive, we need not worry about the order of summation.
We start by dividing the index space {1, . . . , N }r into regions according to the
relative magnitudes of the coordinates. For a permutation σ ∈ Sym(r) of 1, . . . , r,
let
Lσ = {x̄ ∈ {1, . . . , N }r | N ≥ xσ(1) ≥ xσ(2) ≥ · · · ≥ xσ(r) ≥ 1}.
The sets Lσ may overlap at their boundaries, but together they cover the set

We shall fix an arbitrary permutation σ ∈ Sym(r) and bound the corresponding
inner sum over Lσ appearing on the right hand side of the previous inequality by
a constant. As the number of different permutations is finite, this will be enough
to show the convergence of the whole sum.
Furthermore, we replace P in the inner sum by a single monomial Pσ , chosen with
respect to σ in a way explained below. As the coefficients of P are non-negative,
and s > 0, we then have

where LR
σ = {x̄ ∈ [1, N ] | xσ(1) ≥ · · · ≥ xσ(r) }. We proceed to explain how to
choose Pσ , and then to find a constant bound for the integral (2).
Consider σ ∈ Sym(r) fixed. To choose a monomial Pσ appearing in P , we must
choose a single term from each linear factor Pi of P . We start by choosing xσ(1)
from as many factors as it appears in (with a non-zero coefficient). Let e1 be the
1
. Let
number of these factors, so that the monomial we are building contains xeσ(1)
then Q1 = P [σ(2), . . . , σ(r)]. For the degree, we have κ(Q1 ) = κ − e1 . As before,
pick xσ(2) from as many factors of Q1 as it appears in, and let e2 be the number of
2
1
. Define
xeσ(2)
these factors. The monomial we are building will then contain xeσ(1)
Q2 = P [σ(3), . . . , σ(r)], so that κ(Q2 ) = κ − e1 − e2 , and continue in the same
manner. Finally, we obtain the monomial

By construction, this monomial appears in a term of P , possibly multiplied by a
positive constant which we may safely ignore. (Note that the monomial can also be
obtained as the first monomial in the lexicographic ordering based on the ordering
xσ(1) , . . . , xσ(r) of the variables.)
Let us make some notes about the exponents ei . First of all, any of them may
be 0. Secondly, for all i ∈ {1, . . . , r}, we know that ei is the number of factors
containing xσ(i) in the subpolynomial Qi . Since at each step we pick the variable
xσ(i) from all those linear factors it appears in, we always have ei = κ(Qi−1 )−κ(Qi ).
Pr
It follows that κ(Qj ) = i=j+1 ei for all j.
To simplify notation, we make a change of variables and rewrite xσ(i) 7→ xi for
all i. We also write x0 = N , so that

For the extreme case, set I0 (xr ) = 0.
Note that integrating a power expression produces another power expression
(unless the exponent happens to be −1, which we will avoid). Our strategy is to
estimate the iterated integral above by keeping track of the constants appearing
in the resulting power expressions at each step. We simplify the work by finding
upper bounds on the integrands at each step, and the bound on the final iteration
will then provide a bound for the whole integral.
For all i ∈ {0, . . . , r}, we define a non-zero rational number Ci and non-negative
integers ai and bi recursively as follows. Let C0 = 1 and a0 = b0 = 0. Assume then
that Ci , ai and bi have been chosen for some i ∈ {0, . . . , r − 1}, and define
Ci+1 =

|Ci |
.
ai + 1 − (bi + er−i )s

If necessary, we can change s here to a smaller value to make all the finitely many
denominators non-zero. As long as we have s > α for the new value of s, it will
make no difference to the statement of the theorem. Now, if Ci+1 < 0, we define
ai+1 = bi+1 = 0, and if Ci+1 > 0, we use
ai+1 = ai + 1 and bi+1 = bi + er−i .
Next, we show by induction that for all i ∈ {0, . . . , r}, we have
i −bi s

Note that if Ci < 0, this means that Ii (xr−i ) < |Ci |. Clearly, the condition holds

It now suffices to prove that Cr is negative, for then we have, by the above, that

Let k be the last index before r for which Ck was negative. If such k does not exist,
set k = 0. Using the recursive construction of the constants ai , bi and Ci , we see
that ak = bk = 0, so that

Now, since we have assumed that s > α, and we have α ≥ κ−κ(Q)
for any subpolynomial Q, the denominator in the last expression is negative. This completes the
proof.


Based on the two previous results, we can formulate a condition for the abscissa
to be smallest possible.
Corollary 2.4. The abscissa of convergence of ζ(P ; s) equals r/κ if and only if the
inequality r(Q)/κ(Q) ≥ r/κ holds for every (non-empty) subpolynomial Q of P .
Proof. Since the abscissa of convergence is known to be at least r/κ (this holds in
general, see argument on page 6), we only need to find out when it is strictly greater.
By Theorems 2.1 and 2.3, we know that this happens if and only if α > r/κ, that is,
there is some non-empty subpolynomial Q with (r − r(Q))/(κ − κ(Q)) > r/κ. The
last inequality is equivalent to having r(Q)/κ(Q) < r/κ. The claim follows.

Remark 2.5. The integral test for convergence of multiple series is well-known but
not easy to locate in the literature. In fact, we have only found two sources containing this (in the two-variable case), but both of them misstate the result. Indeed, [7,
Section 32 (2)] and [14, Proposition 7.57] state that given a non-negative
decreasP∞
ing function f (x, y) : [1, ∞) × [1, ∞) → R, the double series (m,n)=(1,1) f (m, n)
R
converges if and only if [1,∞)×[1,∞) f (x, y) d(x, y) converges (these sources do not
make the lower bound on m and n explicit, but their conventions make it understood). As is easily seen, the function f defined by f (1, y) = 1, for y ∈ [1, ∞) and
f (x, y) = 0 for x 6= 1 is a counterexample. The correct general statement of the
integral test should have the sum starting from (2, 2). The fact that Lemma 2.2
nevertheless holds with the sum starting from (1, . . . , 1) has to do with a special
property of polynomial functions exploited in the proof.
Remark 2.6. Taking the coefficient of every variable in every linear factor of P to
be positive (non-zero) and assuming that each factor of P has a non-zero constant
term, one obtains the Shintani zeta functions, whose abscissae are known to always
be r/κ (see [29] or [27, (9.7)]). The constant terms do not affect the abscissa, and
the only proper subpolynomial of such a polynomial is the empty subpolynomial,
so our results give a new proof of this fact.
Note that every positive rational number a/b can be obtained as the abscissa of
convergence of a Shintani zeta function by taking P = (x1 + · · · + xa + 1)b .
2.2. Connection with Lie groups. Suppose G is a simple simply-connected Lie
group over C with root system Φ. Let r and κ denote the numbers of fundamental
(or simple) and positive roots of Φ, respectively. We explain how a Witten zeta
function can be written as a Mellin zeta function corresponding to a polynomial
with linear factors and non-negative real coefficients.
It is well known that the irreducible representations of G are parametrised by
dominant weights (also called dominant integral weights). Let dim(µ) denote the
dimension of an irreducible representation corresponding to a dominant weight µ.
This dimension is given by the Weyl dimension formula
(3)

dim(µ) =

Y hα, µ + ρi
.
hα, ρi
+

α∈Φ
+

Here h·, ·i is the Killing form, Φ a choice of positive roots and ρ the sum of
fundamental weights (which is also equal to half the sum of the positive roots).
To see what the dimension formula looks like in practice, fix a dominant weight µ.
Let α be a positive root, and write α and µ as linear combinations of fundamental
weights and fundamental roots, respectively:
α=

r
X
j=1

bj αj

and µ =

r
X

mj ω j .

j=1

Assume also that the length of each αj is zj (when the length of the shortest root
is normalised to 1). Then the inner products in the numerator and denominator
of (3) equal
r
r

X
zj bj .
zj bj (mj + 1) and
j=1

REPRESENTATION GROWTH OF COMPACT LINEAR GROUPS

13

Hence, the denominator in the dimension formula is a constant with respect to µ,
and the numerator becomes a product of κ linear polynomials in the variables mj ,
with non-negative coefficients depending on α.
Up to a constant, namely, the denominator in (3), the series defining the zeta
function ζG (s) is thus

zj bj (mj + 1)

As we are only interested in the convergence properties of the series defining ζG (s),
we focus our attention on this series. Writing xj for mj + 1, and aij for zj bj
corresponding to the i-th positive root α in some fixed ordering, we are left with
the following series:
∞
X
(4)
(a11 x1 + · · · + a1r xr )−s · · · (aκ1 x1 + · · · + aκr xr )−s .
x1 ,...,xr =1

This is a series of the form ζ(P ; s) corresponding to the polynomial

(5)

P (x1 , . . . , xr ) = (a11 x1 + · · · + a1r xr ) · · · (aκ1 x1 + · · · + aκr xr ),

and as P is a product of linear factors with non-negative coefficients, we can apply
the results from the previous subsection.
In the series ζ(P ; s), the number of variables is the rank r of the root system,
and the degree is the number of positive roots κ. Consider any subpolynomial
Q = P [j1 , . . . , jl ]. A Levi subsystem of Φ is a root subsystem spanned by a subset
of the fundamental roots of Φ. Letting Ψ denote the Levi subsystem spanned by
αj1 , . . . , αjl and using the Weyl formula for this subsystem, we get another series
with the polynomial P replaced by Q. Therefore, the subpolynomials of P and
Levi subsystems of Φ are in one-to-one correspondence. Note also that r(Q) is the
rank of the Levi subsystem and κ(Q) is the number of its positive roots, so we may
write r(Ψ) and κ(Ψ) instead of r(Q) and κ(Q) to reflect this connection.
By Corollary 2.4, to recover the Larsen–Lubotzky theorem [21, Theorem 5.1], we
need to show that the ratio r(Ψ)/κ(Ψ) is greater than r(Φ)/κ(Φ) for any subsystem
Ψ of Φ. This fact can easily be proved by inspecting all irreducible root systems, as
is done in [21] and [22]. We give a proof of this which does not use the classification
of irreducible root systems, in the hope that this will give better understanding of
the structural properties of roots systems responsible for the value r/κ. In the proof
of the following lemma, the idea to use the relation between the Coxeter number
and the maximal height is due to Stefan Patrikis. We thank him for allowing us to
include that argument here.
Lemma 2.7. For any proper Levi subsystem Ψ of Φ, we have r/κ < r(Ψ)/κ(Ψ).
Proof. Note that since G is assumed to be simple, we know that Φ is irreducible.
If Ψ is a reducible root system and Ψ = Ψ1 ⊕ Ψ2 , we have
r(Ψ1 ) + r(Ψ2 )
r(Ψ)
=

κ(Ψ)
κ(Ψ1 ) + κ(Ψ2 )

This means that the ratio for a reducible Levi subsystem cannot be greater than
the ratio for one of its irreducible components, so we may restrict our attention to
the irreducible subsystems.
Assume now that Ψ is a proper irreducible Levi subsystem of Φ. Let us first
observe that the Dynkin diagram of an irreducible root system cannot contain a
cycle. Indeed, assuming that the nodes α1 , . . . , αl form a cycle (with no other edges
αi
, and the
between these nodes), consider the corresponding unit vectors ui = |α
i|
P
vector sum u = i ui . It follows from basic properties of root systems that the
smallest possible angle between two fundamental roots not orthogonal to each other
is 2π/3. Therefore, we have hui , uj i ≤ −1/2 for any αi , αj connected by an edge
in the Dynkin diagram. Therefore, we get
hu, ui =

l
X
i=1

hui , ui i + 2

l−1
X
i=1

hui , ui+1 i + 2hul , u1 i ≤ l − l = 0.

It follows that u is the zero vector, which is impossible, since the fundamental roots
α1 , . . . , αl are linearly independent.
Knowing that the Dynkin diagram of an irreducible root system is a tree, one
can show that for such a root system, the ratio of the number of roots over the
rank is equal to the Coxeter number of the system. This is proved for example
in [8, Theorem 10.5.3] and [34]. In [34, Theorem 1.4], the author proves also that
the Coxeter number equals η + 1, where η is the height of the highest root of the
system, without using the classification. It then suffices to show that η(Ψ) < η(Φ),
where η(Ψ) and η(Φ) are the heights of the highest roots in the root systems Ψ and
Φ, respectively.
Let α1 , . . . , αn be all the fundamental roots of Φ, and write β for the highest
root in Ψ. Relabeling the fundamental roots if necessary, we may assume that
Pk
β = i=1 bi αi , where each bi is positive and k < n. Since the Dynkin diagram of
Φ is connected, one of the fundamental roots αk+1 , . . . , αn must be connected to
one of α1 , . . . , αk . Assume without loss of generality, that α1 is connected to αn .
Consider the simple reflection σn corresponding to αn . We have
σn (β) = β −

2hαn , βi
αn .
hαn , αn i

Note that hαi , αn i ≤ 0 for all i < n (the angles between fundamental roots are
obtuse), and hα1 , αn i < 0 (α1 is connected to αn ). It follows that
hαn , βi =

k
X
i=1

bi hαi , αn i < 0,

so that σn (β) = β + cαn for some c > 0. This shows that the height of σn (β) is
strictly greater than the height of β, which implies that η(Ψ) < η(Φ).

The theorem of Larsen and Lubotzky [21, Theorem 5.1] that the abscissa of
convergence of ζG (s) is r/κ now follows from Corollary 2.4 and Lemma 2.7.
2.3. Regular and irregular representations. We continue to let G denote a
simple simply-connected complex Lie group. In this subsection, we briefly consider
the effect on the abscissa of convergence of ζG of different types of representations.
Let h stand for a Cartan subalgebra of the Lie algebra of G. An element s ∈ h
is called regular if α(s) 6= 0 for all positive roots α. Suppose now that µ ∈ h∗ is

REPRESENTATION GROWTH OF COMPACT LINEAR GROUPS

15

a dominant weight corresponding to a regular element s ∈ h via the Killing form.
That is, assume that αi (s) = hαi , µi for all fundamental roots αi . We call such a
dominant weight regular. Note that µ is regular if and only if hαi , µi > 0 for all
fundamental roots α. A non-regular dominant weight will be called irregular.
Call a representation ρ ∈ Irr(G) regular if it corresponds to a regular dominant
weight. Define the zeta function of regular representations of G by
X
reg
ζG
(s) =
dim(ρ)−s .
ρ∈Irr(G)
regular

A dominant weight is irregular if and only if it is orthogonal to a fundamental
root. Let Sj stand for the set of dominant weights that are orthogonal to the
fundamental root αj . For a dominant weight µ, let ρ(µ) denote the corresponding
irreducible representation of G. We may then define the representation zeta function
corresponding to the weights in Sj by
X
(j)
dim(ρ(µ))−s .
ζG (s) =
µ∈Sj

With the above notation, we may write
reg
ζG = ζG
+

X

(j)

ζG .

j

We show now that the irregular weights do not contribute to the abscissa of ζG .
The simplest system A1 has no irregular weights, so in the following we shall only
consider simple groups G of other types.
P (j)
Proposition 2.8. The abscissa of convergence of j ζG is strictly smaller than
r/κ. It follows that the representation growth rate of G equals its regular representation growth rate.
(j)

Proof. It suffices to consider ζG for an arbitrary j, and by changing the labeling
of the fundamental roots if necessary, we may assume that j = 1. We restrict the
numerator of the Weyl dimension formula to those µ for which hα1 , µi = 0. This
results in the series
∞
X
P (1, x2 , . . . , xr )−s ,
x2 ,...,xr =1

where P is the polynomial defined in (5). Write P1 for P (1, x2 , . . . , xr ) and r1 = r−1
for the number of variables in P1 . Write similarly κ1 for the degree of P1 , which is
the number of linear factors remaining in P1 after the substitution x1 = 1. As there
is exactly one factor in P that contains only the variable x1 (any fundamental root
appears exactly once as a positive root in any root system), we have κ1 = κ − 1.
Let Q = P1 [xj1 , . . . , xjl ] be any proper subpolynomial of P1 , and consider the
subpolynomial Q̄ = P [x1 , xj1 , . . . , xjl ] of P . As above, we see that r(Q) = r(Q̄) − 1
and κ(Q) = κ(Q̄) − 1. Hence, using Lemma 2.7, we get
r − r(Q̄)
r1 − r(Q)
r

It now follows from Theorem 2.3 that the abscissa of convergence for ζG is strictly
smaller than r/κ, which proves the claims.

Remark 2.9. There is an analogy between representation growth of Lie groups and
finite groups of Lie type. In [22], Martin Liebeck and Aner Shalev have considered a
type of representation zeta function for finite simple groups G(q) of a fixed Lie type,
parametrised by the field of definition Fq . Examining these finitely supported zeta
functions ζG(q) (s), they show that there is a bound on convergence independent of
q, and that this bound is found at s = r/κ. We note that the result of Liebeck
and Shalev depends on the same structural property of the irreducible root systems
(Lemma 2.7) which is, by our Corollary 2.4, ultimately responsible for the abscissa
in the case of compact Lie groups. We hope that this might shed some light on a
remark of Klopsch [20, Section 4], looking for a conceptual explanation of the fact
that the abscissa of convergence is the same for Lie groups as for the finite groups
of the same Lie type.
3. Twist representation growth of GLn (O)
Let O be a complete discrete valuation ring with finite residue field Fq and
maximal ideal p. For r ≥ 1 an integer, we will write Or for the finite ring O/pr .
In this section and the next, we will consider the growth of equivalence classes
of representations of GLn (O) under one-dimensional twists. Since GLn (O) has
infinitely many one-dimensional representations, it does not have a representation
zeta function. Nevertheless, we will prove that it does have a twist zeta function.
Our main motivation for this is that it turns out that the abscissa of the twist zeta
function is equal to the abscissa of the zeta function of SLn (O), except in the case
where the characteristic of O divides n.
We say that two representations ρ, σ of a group G are twist equivalent if there
exists a one-dimensional representation χ of G such that ρ ∼
= σ ⊗ χ. The corresponding equivalence classes of representations are called twist isoclasses. All the
representations in a twist isoclass obviously have the same dimension and we define
the dimension of the twist isoclass to be the dimension of any of its representations.
For a group G, let r̃i (G) denote the number of twist isoclasses (possibly infinite)
of irreducible complex representations of G of dimension i. If G is a topological
group, we demand that the function r̃i (G) only counts continuous representations.
Moreover, in case r̃i (G) is finite for all i ≥ 1 we define
R̃N (G) =

N
X

r̃i (G),

i=1

for any integer N ≥ 1. Suppose that r̃i (G) is finite for all i ≥ 1. Then the (twist)
representation zeta function of G is defined to be
ζ̃G (s) =

∞
X

r̃i (G)i−s ,

i=1

where s is a complex variable.
A representation of GLn (Or ) (or SLn (Or )) is called primitive if it does not factor
through GLn (Or−1 ) (or SLn (Or−1 )). A representation which is not primitive will
be called imprimitive.
It is well known that ri (SLn (O)) is finite for all i ≥ 1 (see [18]). The analogous statement for GLn (O) is false since the latter group has infinitely many
one-dimensional representations. However, we have:

REPRESENTATION GROWTH OF COMPACT LINEAR GROUPS

17

Lemma 3.1. For any d ∈ N, the number of twist isoclasses of GLn (O) of dimension
d is finite.
Proof. Let C be a twist isoclass of dimension d. Let r ∈ N be the smallest natural number such that there exists a representation ρ ∈ C which factors through
GLn (Or ). Since there are only finitely many representations of GLn (Fq ), we may
without loss of generality assume that r ≥ 2. We will use Clifford theory for
GLn (Or ) (see for example [30]) to find a lower bound on d. Let l = ⌈ r2 ⌉ and
l′ = ⌊ 2r ⌋ and let K l be the maximal abelian congruence kernel of GLn (Or ). By
Clifford’s theorem, the restriction of ρ to K l decomposes as
M
g
χ,
ρ |K l = e
χ∈Ω(ρ)

where e ∈ N and Ω(ρ) is an orbit of representations of K l under the conjugation
action of GLn (Or ). Thus we can estimate dim ρ from below by the size of the
orbit Ω(ρ). The trace form induces a GLn (Or )-equivariant bijection between the
irreducible representations of K l and Mn (Ol′ ), so the size of Ω(ρ) equals the size of
an orbit in Mn (Ol′ ). By assumption, no twist of ρ factors through GLn (Or ), and
this means that the orbit in Mn (Ol′ ) corresponding to Ω(ρ) is non-scalar. It is easy
to see that Mn−1 (Ol′ ) ⊕ Ol′ is a centraliser in Mn (Ol′ ) of maximal order. Thus the
minimal order of an orbit in Mn (Ol′ ) is
| Mn (Ol′ )|/| Mn−1 (Ol′ ) ⊕ Ol′ | = q (2n−2)l ≥ q r−1 .
′

We conclude that dim ρ ≥ q r−1 , and thus we have shown that C contains a representation which is a pull-back of a primitive representation of GLn (Or ), where
r ≤ 1 + logq (d). Since there are only finitely many of the latter, there are only
finitely many possibilities for C.

We will now show that (at least when p does not divide n) there is a close
relationship between the representation growth of SLn (O) and the twist representation growth of GLn (O), that is, between the growth rates of the two sequences
Ri (SLn (O)) and R̃i (GLn (O)). For any group G and any i ∈ N, we let Irri (G)
denote the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible complex representations of G
of dimension i. Similarly,
f i (G)
Irr

denotes the set of twist isoclasses of continuous irreducible complex representations
of G of dimension i.
In the following two lemmas, F denotes the field of fractions of O.

Lemma 3.2. The group O×n of n-th powers has finite index in O× if and only if
char F does not divide n.
Proof. The group O× /O×n embeds into F × /F ×n . By [11, I (5.9)], the group
F × /F ×n is finite if char F does not divide n. For the “only if” direction, note that
it indeed follows from the proof in loc. cit.

Lemma 3.3. Let µn be the group of n-th roots of unity of F . Then
Irr(O× )/ Irr(O× )n ∼
= Irr(µn ).
In particular, the order of Irr(O× )/ Irr(O× )n is |µn |.

18

Proof. Applying the contravariant functor Hom( · , C× ) to the exact sequence
[n]

1 −→ µn −→ O× −−→ O×n −→ 1,

where [n] is the nth power map, we obtain the exact sequence
Hom([n],C× )

Irr(O×n ) −−−−−−−−→ Irr(O× ) −→ Irr(µn ) −→ 1,

where the first map Hom([n], C× ) is given by f 7→ f ◦ [n]. If f ∈ Irr(O×n ) is such
that f ◦ [n] = 1, then f (xn ) = 1 for all x ∈ O× , that is, f = 1. Hence, Hom([n], C× )
is an injection, and its image coincides with Irr(O× )n , since f ◦ [n] = f n in Irr(O× ).
Since µn is a finite abelian group, |µn | = | Irr(µn )|, so we are done.

Proposition 3.4. Suppose that the characteristic of O does not divide n. Then
the abscissa of convergence of ζ̃GLn (O) exists and is equal to that of ζSLn (O) .
Proof. Let Z be the centre of GLn (O), that is, the subgroup of scalar matrices. For
ease of notation, set G = GLn (O) and S = SLn (O). Composing the determinant
det : G → O× with the quotient map O× → O× /O×n gives rise to the exact
sequence
1 −→ ZS −→ G −→ O× /O×n −→ 1.
Note that the kernel is exactly ZS since for any g ∈ G, such that det(g) = λn for
some λ ∈ O× , we have λ−1 g ∈ S, and hence g ∈ ZS. By Lemma 3.2, the index
a := [G : ZS] is finite.
The proof is in two steps: First we will show that RN (S) has the same rate
of polynomial growth as R̃N (ZS), and then that the latter has the same rate of
polynomial growth as R̃N (G), which will prove the equality of the abscissae.
First, we claim that, for all N ,
(6)

RN (S) ≤ R̃N (ZS) ≤ |µn | · RN (S),

where µn is the group of n-th roots of unity of F . We now prove this claim.
Every one-dimensional representation of G is of the form χ ◦ det for some homomorphism χ : O× → C× , and since the commutator subgroup of ZS is S, every
one-dimensional representation of ZS is also of the form χ ◦ det. Any τ ∈ Irr(S)
can be extended to a representation ρτ of ZS, where ρ is an extension to Z of the
central character of τ , and (ρτ )(zs) = ρ(z)τ (s), for z ∈ Z, s ∈ S. Thus, we clearly
have
RN (S) ≤ R̃N (ZS).
Conversely, every π ∈ Irr(ZS) is an extension of an irreducible representation of
S, because π factors through some finite quotient Zr Sr , where Zr is the centre of
GLn (Or ) and Sr = SLn (Or ), and it is well known that every π ∈ Irr(Zr Sr ) is an
extension of an irreducible representation of Sr .
Let ρ1 and ρ2 be two extensions to Z of the central character of τ ∈ Irr(S).
Identify ρ1 and ρ2 with their corresponding homomorphisms O× → C× . For λI ∈
Z, λ ∈ O× , we have (ρ1 ⊗ χ ◦ det)(λI) = ρ1 (λ)χ(λ)n , for all homomorphisms
χ : O× → C× , so if ρ1 and ρ2 have the same image in Irr(Z)/ Irr(Z)n , then ρ1 τ is
in the same twist isoclass as ρ2 τ . Thus, by Lemma 3.3, there exist no more than
| Irr(Z)/ Irr(Z)n | = | Irr(O× )/ Irr(O× )n | = |µn |

twist isoclasses of extensions of τ to the group ZS, that is,
R̃N (ZS) ≤ |µn | · RN (S).

The goal in the remaining part of the proof is to show that
(7)

R̃N (ZS) ≤ aR̃aN (G)

and R̃N (G) ≤ aR̃N (ZS).

The proof of this proceeds in a way similar to [23, Lemma 2.2], but with twists
taken into account. For any representation π of ZS or G, let [π] denote its twist

isoclass. For each [τ ] ∈ m=1 Irr
m (ZS), choose an irreducible component ψ(τ ) of

Let now [τ ] ∈ m=1 Irr
m (ZS) be an element such that dim[τ ] = dim τ is minimal among the dimensions of the elements of the fibre ψ −1 ([ψ(τ )]). Frobenius
reciprocity implies that for any [τ ′ ] ∈ ψ −1 ([ψ(τ )]), the representation τ ′ is an
irreducible component of ψ(τ )|ZS . Hence dim ψ(τ ) ≥ |ψ −1 ([ψ(τ )])| dim τ . But
dim ψ(τ ) ≤ a dim τ , which implies that
|ψ −1 ([ψ(τ )])| ≤ a.
whence R̃N (ZS) ≤ aR̃aN (G).
Next, define a function

which proves that R̃N (G) ≤ aR̃N (ZS).
Now, the abscissa of convergence of ζSLn (O) exists (see [23]), so by (6) and the
second inequality in (7), the abscissa of convergence of ζ̃GLn (O) exists. Moreover,
since the abscissae of convergence are the rates of polynomial growth of RN (S) and
R̃N (G), respectively, (6) and (7), imply that they are equal.

We do not know whether the above proposition holds when char O divides n.
Corollary 3.5. Suppose that the characteristic of O does not divide n. Then the
abscissa of convergence of ζ̃GLn (O) is at least 2/n.
Proof. By Proposition 3.4, the abscissa of ζ̃GLn (O) is equal to the abscissa of ζSLn (O) ,
and by [21, Proposition 6.6], the latter is at least r/κ = 2/n.

4. Counting the twist isoclasses of GL2 (O)
We continue to let O be a complete discrete valuation ring with finite residue
field Fq and maximal ideal p. Let p be the characteristic of Fq .
In this section we set up our general approach to counting twist isoclasses of
representations of GL2 (O) using a Clifford theoretic description of the representations. Our goal is to compute the twist zeta function of GL2 (O) exactly when p
is odd, and to approximate it well enough to compute its abscissa of convergence
when p is even.
For r ≥ 1, let Gr = GL2 (Or ). We will describe the twist isoclasses of representations of each group Gr . We start with the case r = 1, which is rather different
from the case r ≥ 2.
4.1. The twist isoclasses of GL2 (Fq ). Counting the number of twist isoclasses
in this case is made possible thanks to the following result, which is an analogue
G
of the formula IndG
H (θχ|H ) = (IndH θ)χ for Deligne–Lusztig induction in the case,
where χ is 1-dimensional.
Lemma 4.1. Let G be a connected reductive group defined over a finite field Fq
with corresponding Frobenius endomorphism F . Let T be an F -stable maximal
torus in G, let θ : T F → C× be an irreducible character, and let RTG (θ) denote
the corresponding Deligne–Lusztig character of GF . Then, for any 1-dimensional
character χ of GF , we have
RTG (θχ|T F ) = RTG (θ)χ.
Proof. Let g ∈ GF have Jordan decomposition g = su, where s is semisimple and
u unipotent. By the character formula for Deligne–Lusztig characters [8, Theorem 7.2.8], we have
X
1
C (s)◦
θ(x−1 sx)RxTGx−1 (1)(u).
RTG (θ)(g) =
◦F
|CG (s) |

x−1 sx∈T F

Thus,
RTG (θχ|T )(g) =

= RTG (θ)(g)χ(s).
It now remains to observe that any 1-dimensional representation χ of GF is trivial
on unipotent elements, so that χ(s) = χ(g). Indeed, by [16, Proposition 17.2]
the derived group [G, G] is closed and connected. Since F ([x, y]) = [F (x), F (y)]
the subgroup [G, G] is also F -stable. Thus by [9, Corollary 3.13] (G/[G, G])F ∼
=
GF /[G, G]F . On the other hand, we have G = [G, G]Z, where Z is a central torus
of G. Thus G/[G, G] injects into Z, so (G/[G, G])F , and hence GF /[G, G]F , has
no non-trivial unipotent elements. Thus χ is trivial on any unipotent element of
GF .

Lemma 4.2. The twist zeta function of GL2 (Fq ) is
(
1 + q −s + 21 (q − 1)(q + 1)−s + 21 (q + 1)(q − 1)−s
ζ̃GL2 (Fq ) (s) =
1 + q −s + 12 (q − 2)(q + 1)−s + 21 q(q − 1)−s

21

if p 6= 2,
if p = 2.

Proof. Let Fq be an algebraic closure of Fq and denote G = GL2 (Fq ) with its
standard Fq -rational structure given by the Frobenius endomorphism F . It is well
known (see e.g. [19, Section 28]) that there is only one twist isoclass of each of 1and q-dimensional representations of GF = GL2 (Fq ), respectively; that is,
r̃1 (GF ) = r̃q (GF ) = 1.
It is also well known (see e.g. [9, 15.9]) that all the remaining irreducible representations are obtained as the Deligne–Lusztig representations ±RTG (θ), where T is one
of the two Fq -rational maximal tori of G and θ ∈ Irr(T F ) is in general position, that
is, w θ 6= θ, where w is the non-trivial element in the Weyl group W with respect to
T (note that we have W = W F in the present situation). More precisely, let T be
an Fq -rational maximal torus of G and define
XT = {θW ∈ Irr(T F )/W | w θ 6= θ}

to be the set of orbits of characters of T F in general position, modulo the action of
the group W . Then there is a bijection between XT and the irreducible representations of the form ±RTG (θ). Moreover, when T is split, RTG (θ) has dimension q + 1
and when T is non-split the dimension of −RTG (θ) is q − 1.
We now show the following:
Claim. Restriction defines an injective homomorphism Irr1 (GF ) → Irr(T F ) from
one-dimensional representations of GF to irreducible representations of T F . The
image of this homomorphism consists of representations in Irr(T F ) which are not
in general position.
We first show injectivity. If χ is a one-dimensional representation of GF , then χ
factors through the determinant det : GF → F×
q . The restriction of the determinant
to T F is surjective, as is easily seen directly for the split torus and follows from the
×
surjectivity of the norm map F×
q2 → Fq for the non-split torus. Thus χ|T F is trivial
if and only if χ is trivial.
Next, if θ = χ|T F for χ ∈ Irr1 (GF ), then for any t ∈ T F we have
w

θ(t) = θ(wtw−1 ) = χ(wtw−1 ) = χ(t) = θ(t).

This proves the claim.
Let Γ be the image of the homomorphism in the above claim, that is, Γ is the
group of representations of the form χ|T F , for χ ∈ Irr1 (GF ). By the above claim, Γ
has q − 1 elements and acts on X by multiplication (this gives a well defined action
since every element in Γ is fixed by the action of W , by the claim).
Lemma 4.1 together with the above claim implies that there is a bijection between
twist isoclasses of irreducible representations of the form ±RTG (θ) and orbits XT /Γ.
To count the number of twist isoclasses, we will now compute the number of orbits
XT /Γ.
Let θ ∈ Irr(T F ) and γ ∈ Γ. Then θγ = θ if and only if γ = 1 (the trivial
character). On the other hand, assume that θγ = w θ. Then
γ −1 = (w θθ−1 )−1 = θ(w θ−1 ) = w (w θθ−1 ) = w γ = γ,

22

JOKKE HÄSÄ AND ALEXANDER STASINSKI

so γ 2 = 1. Thus an element θW ∈ XT is fixed by γ ∈ Γ only if γ = ±1, where −1
denotes the non-trivial character of T F whose square is 1. Note that when p = 2,
we have 1 = −1.
Assume now that p 6= 2 and γ = −1. We determine the number of fixed points
of −1 in XT in this case. The map θ 7→ w θ · θ−1 is a group homomorphism and its
kernel {θ ∈ Irr(T F ) | w θ = θ} has order
|T F | − 2|XT |.

Since the set {θ ∈ Irr(T F ) | w θ = (−1)θ} is a coset of the kernel, it has the same
size as the kernel. It follows that the number of fixed points XTγ , where γ = −1,
that is, the number of W -orbits of characters in general position fixed by γ = −1,
is equal to 21 |T F | − |XT |. The Frobenius–Burnside formula now implies that for
any T , the number of orbits in XT under the action of Γ is
 F
 |T |
if p 6= 2,
2(q−1)
(8)
|XT /Γ| =
 |XT |
if p = 2.
q−1

It is well known (see e.g. [9, 15.9]) that, if T is the split torus, then |XT | =
(q−1)(q−2)
, and if T is the non-split torus, then |XT | = q(q−1)
. Thus, by (8), we

have
(

(q − 1)/2 if p 6= 2,

F
r̃q+1 (G ) =

This gives the twist zeta function of GF , as asserted.



4.2. The representations of Gr with r ≥ 2. Assume from now on that r ≥ 2.
To describe the representations of Gr = GL2 (Or ) we use the construction of regular
representations in [32]. Knowing the regular representations is enough because for
Gr any irreducible representation is either regular or factors through Gr−1 , up to
twisting.
Let l = ⌈ r2 ⌉ and l′ = ⌊ 2r ⌋, so that r = l + l′ . To any π ∈ Irr(Gr ), we associate
its Gl′ -conjugacy orbit in M2 (Ol′ ); see for example [30]. First note that if the orbit
of π is scalar mod p, it means that the twist isoclass of π contains an imprimitive
representation. We therefore have two cases: either the twist isoclass contains an
imprimitive representation, or its orbit is non-scalar mod p, in which case it is
primitive. Without loss of generality, we focus on the latter case. The orbits in this
case are of three different types, represented by the following matrices in M2 (Ol′ ):

mod p.



(3)
, where x2 + τ x + ∆ ≡ (x − a)2 mod p, for some a ∈ Ol′ .
−∆ τ
We will say that a matrix of one of the above forms is of type 1,2 or 3, respectively.
For β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ), we denote its orbit (i.e, the Gl′ -conjugacy class of β) by [β].
For 1 ≤ i ≤ r, let K i be the kernel of the map Gr → Gi . Each matrix in M2 (Ol′ )
defines a unique one-dimensional character ψβ of K l ; see [30]. In the following, if

REPRESENTATION GROWTH OF COMPACT LINEAR GROUPS

23

G is any finite group, we write Irr(G) for the set of irreducible characters of G. Let
H ⊆ Gr be a subgroup containing K l . For any β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ), we denote
Irr(H | β) = {π ∈ Irr(H) | hπ|K l , ψβ i =
6 0}.
We will usually fix a β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) and a lift β̂ ∈ M2 (Or ). In this situation, we
define the centralisers
C = CGr (β̂),

Ci = CGi (βi ),

where 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 1 and βi denotes the image of β̂ in M2 (Oi ). Similarly, we set
C i = C ∩ K i.

We summarise the construction of regular characters of GL2 (Or ) for r ≥ 2 in the
following lemma. This is a slight reformulation of [32, Theorem 4.10].
Lemma 4.3. Let β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) be of one of the three types above, and take any lift
β̂ ∈ M2 (Or ) of β. For any π ∈ Irr(Gr | β) there exists an extension θ of ψβ to

C 1 K l , a unique irreducible character ηθ of C 1 K l containing θ, and an extension

η̂θ of ηθ to CK l such that

Moreover, this establishes a bijection (depending on the choice of θ and η̂θ ):

4.3. Generalities on twist isoclasses of Gr . We will now consider twist isoclasses of representations of Gr . The additive group Ol′ acts on the set of orbits of
β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) via
(x, [β]) 7−→ [xI + β],
where x ∈ Ol′ and I is the identity matrix. We denote the orbit of [β] under this
action by [[β]], and will refer to this as the twist orbit of β. It is clear that this
action preserves each of the three types of matrices above. A regular class [β] (i.e.
one which is non-scalar mod p) is fixed by an element x ∈ Ol′ if and only if x fixes
the trace and determinant of β, that is, if the following equations hold:
(
2x = 0
(11)
x(x + τ ) = 0.
Let e denote the ramification index of 2 in O, that is, we have 2O = pe . In
particular, if char O = 2, we set e = ∞. If char O = 0 and l′ ≥ 1, we have
char Ol′ = 2m , where m is the smallest integer such that em ≥ l′ , that is, m =
⌈l′ /e⌉. Note in particular that char Ol′ = 2 whenever l′ ≤ e, so that if char Ol′ = 2m
with m ≥ 2, we necessarily have l′ > e.
From now on, let
Bi = #{[[β]] | β of type i},
so Bi denotes the number of twist orbits of type i for each i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. We will
need to compute the numbers Bi and consider different cases depending on whether
the level l′ is below or above the ramification index e.

If p is odd and x ∈ Ol′ fixes the orbit [β], the first equation in (11) implies that

x = 0. Thus, #[[β]] = |Ol′ | = q l for all β, so when p 6= 2, we have

(see (10) in the proof of Lemma 4.4 for the number of orbits of type i).
When p = 2, it is more difficult to compute the numbers Bi , especially when
i = 3.
Lemma 4.5. Suppose that p = 2, and recall that e = ∞ if char O = 2. Then
(a) If l′ ≤ e, we have
(

(e(q − 1) + 1)q l −1

for i ∈ {1, 2},
for i = 3.

Proof. First we deduce some facts about τ = tr(β) ∈ Ol′ . In type 1, as the
residue characteristic is 2, the condition a 6≡ d mod p implies that a + d 6≡ 0 mod p.
Therefore τ is a unit. In type 2, the characteristic polynomial x2 + τ x + ∆ is
irreducible modulo p. Because the residue characteristic is 2, this implies that
modulo p, we must have τ 6≡ 0. Therefore τ is again a unit. In type 3, it is clear
that τ ≡ 0 mod p, so τ is not a unit.
(a) Assume that l′ ≤ e, so that char Ol′ = 2. We intend to use the Frobenius–
Burnside orbit counting formula, so we need to find the number of orbits fixed by
any given scalar. Suppose therefore that x ∈ Ol′ fixes [β] for some β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) of
type 1 or 2. By the equations in (11), we have 2x = 0 and x(x + τ ) = 0. Here, the
first equation 2x = 0 is trivially satisfied. If x is a unit, it follows from the second
equation that x = τ . On the other hand, if x ∈ p, then, as τ is a unit in types 1
and 2, we see that x + τ is a unit, and it follows that x = 0.
Now, the scalar x = 0 fixes all orbits. (The number of orbits was noted for each
type in (10) in the proof of Lemma 4.4.) If x 6= 0, we saw above that τ = x, so
the trace of β is determined. On the other hand, if a1 , a2 ∈ Ol′ are the roots of the
characteristic polynomial of β, and x = τ = a1 + a2 , then det β = a1 (x − a1 ), so
′
there are q l /2 choices for the determinant of β, and this is then also the number
of orbits fixed by x. Hence, the Frobenius–Burnside formula gives

For type 3, assume that x ∈ Ol′ fixes [β] of type 3. Write v for the valuation of
x and w ≥ 1 for the valuation of τ . The equation 2x = 0 is trivially satisfied, and
′
x(x + τ ) = 0 is equivalent to x + τ ∈ pl −v .
′
Suppose first that v < l′ − v. Then x + τ ∈ pl −v can only hold if we have
w = v, which also entails v ≥ 1. Write x = uπ w and τ = u′ π w for some units

Suppose then that v ≥ l′ − v, but x 6= 0. In particular, we have v ≥ ⌈l′ /2⌉ ≥ 1.

Then x2 = 0 in Ol′ , and the equation xτ = 0 holds if and only if τ ∈ pl −v . We

find that we get q possibilities for τ also in this case.
The scalar x = 0 fixes every orbit. If x 6= 0, we found above that v ≥ 1 and
the number of possibilities for the trace of β is q v , so the number of fixed orbits is
′
q v+l , as the determinant can be chosen freely from Ol′ . Finally, note that there
′
are (q − 1)q l −v−1 elements x 6= 0 with valuation v. With this information, the

(b) Assume that l′ > e, so that, in particular, char Ol′ = 2m for some m ≥ 2.
Suppose that x ∈ Ol′ fixes [β] of type 1 or 2. As char Ol′ 6= 2, the equation 2x = 0
in (11) implies that x is not a unit. As τ is a unit in types 1 and 2, it follows that
x + τ is a unit, so the equation x(x + τ ) = 0 yields x = 0. Thus the stabiliser of [β]
is trivial, and every orbit has the same size. Hence, for i ∈ {1, 2}, we get
Bi =

For type 3, we imitate the corresponding case in part (a). Assume that x ∈ Ol′
fixes [β] of type 3. Write v for the valuation of x and w ≥ 1 for the valuation of τ .
′
The equation x(x + τ ) = 0 is equivalent to x + τ ∈ pl −v , as before, so the only
additional restriction compared to the other case is that 2x = 0 is now equivalent
to v ≥ l′ − e. Noting that l′ − e ≥ 1, the argument goes through exactly as in the
other case, with the only difference that the final summation starts from v = l′ − e
instead of v = 1. This gives the result.

For i ∈ {1, 2}, let βi ∈ M2 (Ol′ ), and let ρi ∈ Irr(Gr | βi ). If ρ1 and ρ2 lie in the
same twist isoclass, then [[β1 ]] = [[β2 ]]. We can therefore speak of the twist orbit
associated to a twist isoclass of representations of Gr . For any β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) we
write
f r | β)
Irr(G
for the set of twist isoclasses of irreducible representations of Gr whose twist orbit
is [[β]], and
Irr(Gr | [[β]])

for the set of irreducible representations of Gr whose orbit is an element of [[β]].
The group Ôr× := Irr(Or× ) acts on Irr(Gr | [[β]]) via
(χ, ρ) 7−→ ρ ⊗ (χ ◦ det),
f r | β).
where χ ∈ Ôr× , and the orbits are exactly the elements of the set Irr(G

REPRESENTATION GROWTH OF COMPACT LINEAR GROUPS

For each twist orbit [[β]], we will compute or estimate the number of elements in
f r | β) by considering the stabilisers of representations under the above action.
Irr(G
It follows directly from the orbit-stabiliser theorem that

# Irr(G

where the minimum and maximum are taken over all ρ in Irr(Gr | [[β]]).
f r | β)
In the following, we shall use this inequality to estimate the size of Irr(G
for different orbits [[β]]. We start by computing the size of the set on which the
action takes place.
Lemma 4.6. Suppose that β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) is regular. Then
′

# Irr(Gr | [[β]]) = q −2r |CK l | · #[[β]].
′

Proof. We have # Irr(Gr | [[β]]) = # Irr(CK l | β) · #[[β]], so we need to determine
′
the size of the set Irr(CK l | β). This is equivalent to finding the number of distinct
l′

irreducible constituents of IndCK
ψβ .
Kl

Let λ ∈ Irr(CK l | β). Then hIndCK
ψβ , λi = hψβ , λ|K l i = dim λ, where the
Kl
′
last equality follows from Clifford’s theorem and the fact that CK l ⊆ StabGr (ψβ ).
′
By Lemma 4.4, we know that every λ ∈ Irr(CK l | β) has the same dimension.
Thus

l′

ψβ = # Irr(CK l | β) · (dim λ)2 .
[CK l : K l ] = dim IndCK

By (9) in the proof of Lemma 4.4, we have dim λ = q l−l , so

# Irr(CK l | β) = |CK l | · q −4l q −2(l−l ) = q −2r |CK l |.

Next, we establish certain conditions that will later help us estimate the order

Then ρ(χ ◦ det) = ρ holds for some χ ∈ Irr(Or× ), if and only if there exists an
a ∈ Ol′ , such that the following two properties hold for some g ∈ Gr :
′

(1) aI + β = ḡ −1 βḡ,
(2) η̂θ (χ ◦ det |CK l′ ) = g η̂θ .

Proof. Assume first that aI + β = ḡ −1 βḡ, for some a ∈ Ol′ and g ∈ Gr . Then
′
Cl′ = ḡCl′ ḡ −1 , so g normalises the group CK l . Now, if η̂θ (χ ◦ det |CK l′ ) = g η̂θ ,

so ρ|Kl contains ψβ ψaI = ψβ+aI . Thus ψβ+aI = g ψβ , for some g ∈ Gr , and so

aI + β = ḡ −1 βḡ. Hence, as above, g normalises CK l , so we have

We have (η̂θ (χ ◦ det |CK l′ ))|Kl = ψaI+β = ψḡ−1 βḡ = g η̂θ |Kl , and a basic result from

Thus η̂θ (χ ◦ det |CK l′ ) = g η̂θ .

g
η̂θ for some a ∈ Ol′ and g ∈ Gr . Let Z denote the subalgebra of M2 (Ol′ ) consisting
of scalar matrices. The group Gl′ acts on the quotient M2 (Ol′ )/Z by conjugation.
Then the condition ḡ −1 βḡ = aI + β is equivalent to g ∈ StabGl′ (β + Z). We will
estimate the number of possible distinct characters g η̂θ . We have an isomorphism
′

StabGl′ (β + Z)/Cl′ −→
f StabOl′ [β]

ḡCl′ 7−→ ḡ −1 βḡ − β.

(It is straightforward to verify that it is a well defined homomorphism, injective
′
and surjective.) If ḡ ∈ Cl′ , then g ∈ CK l , so g η̂θ = η̂θ ; thus there are at most
| StabGl′ (β + Z)/Cl′ | = | StabOl′ [β]|

distinct characters of the form g η̂θ , where g ∈ StabGl′ (β + Z).
Now, restricting both sides of the equality η̂θ (χ ◦ det |CK l′ ) = g η̂θ to C 1 K l we
get
mθ(χ ◦ det |C 1 K l ) = m′ θ′
for some positive integers m and m′ , and some linear character θ′ contained in g η̂θ .
Since η̂θ and g η̂θ have the same dimension, we have m = m′ , and hence,
χ ◦ det |C 1 K l = θ′ θ−1 .

Since we have shown that there are at most | StabOl′ [β]| distinct characters g η̂θ ,
there are also at most | StabOl′ [β]| distinct characters θ′ , and thus at most | StabOl′ [β]|
possibilities for χ ◦ det |C 1 K l . Each of the latter has exactly

4.4. The twist zeta function of GL2 (O) when p 6= 2. Assume in this subsection
that the characteristic p of the residue field of O is odd (apart from in Lemma 4.13),
and that β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) is fixed and regular, that is, of type 1, 2 or 3. We will explicitly
compute the twist zeta function ζ̃GL2 (O) (s). To this end, we start by computing
the orders of stabilisers under the action of Ôr× on representations of Gr .
In what follows, we will use 1 to denote the trivial character of a group.
Lemma 4.10. For any ρ ∈ Irr(Gr | [[β]]), we have
| StabÔr× (ρ)| =

|Or× |
.
| det(CK l′ )|

Proof. We first show that χ ∈ StabÔr× (ρ) if and only if χ ◦ det |CK l′ = 1. Write
r
ρ = IndG
η̂ for a suitable η̂θ , as in Lemma 4.3. If χ ◦ det |CK l′ = 1, then
CK l′ θ
r
ρ(χ ◦ det) = IndG
(η̂ (χ ◦ det |CK l′ )) = ρ.
CK l′ θ

Conversely, suppose that ρ(χ ◦ det) = ρ. The first condition in Lemma 4.7 tells
us that ḡ −1 βḡ = aI + β for some a ∈ Ol′ and g ∈ Gr . Thus tr(β) = 2a + tr(β),
′
and since p is odd, a = 0 and ḡ ∈ Cl′ . It follows that g ∈ CK l , and therefore
g
η̂θ = η̂θ . By the second condition in Lemma 4.7, we get η̂θ (χ ◦ det |CK l′ ) = η̂θ ,
and by restriction, we get
ηθ (χ ◦ det |C 1 K l′ ) = ηθ .

Since ηθ is the unique character of C 1 K l lying above θ, we obtain mθ(χ◦det |C 1 K l ) =
mθ, for some m ∈ N, and since θ is one-dimensional, this implies that
′

χ ◦ det |C 1 K l = 1.
We now show that in the current situation this implies that χ ◦ det |C 1 K l′ = 1 by
′
showing that det(C 1 K l ) ⊇ det(C 1 K l ). To prove the latter inclusion, we first prove
that
′

′

det(C l K l ) = 1 + pl .

(14)

′

For any x ∈ M2 (Or ) we see by direct calculation that det(1 + π l x) ∈ (1 +
′
π l tr(x))(1 + pl ). Thus, letting I ∈ M2 (Or ) denote the identity matrix, we have
′

′

′

det(C l K l ) = det(C l )(1 + pl ) ⊇ {det(1 + π l λI) | λ ∈ Or }(1 + pl )
′

⊇ {1 + π l 2λ | λ ∈ Or }(1 + pl )
′

′

⊇ (1 + pl )(1 + pl ) = 1 + pl .

where for the last inclusion we have used that 2 ∈ O× (since p 6= 2). Since
′
′
det(C l K l ) ⊆ 1 + pl , this proves (14). We can now conclude that
det(C 1 K l ) ⊇ det(C 1 C l K l ) ⊇ det(C 1 K l ),
′

′

and so
χ ◦ det |C 1 K l′ = χ ◦ det |C 1 K l = 1.

Now, identify the set of one-dimensional characters of Gr with Irr(Gr / SL2 (Or )).
Similarly, the set of characters of the form χ ◦ det |CK l′ can be identified with
′
′
Irr(CK l /(CK l ∩ SL2 (Or ))). The number of characters χ ∈ Irr(Or× ) such that
χ ◦ det |CK l′ = 1 is therefore
(15)

|Gr / SL2 (Or )|
|CK l′ /(CK l′ ∩ SL2 (Or ))|

| det(CK l′ )|

From now on, we will write SCl′ for the kernel of the determinant map det : Cl′ →
Ol×′ , that is, SCl′ = Cl′ ∩ SL2 (Ol′ ).
Lemma 4.11. We have

| det(CK l )| =

In order to rewrite this expression, we show that reduction modulo pl , denoted ρl′ ,
induces an isomorphism
′
CK l ∩ SL2 (Or ) ∼
= SCl′ .
K l′ ∩ SL2 (Or )
′

This follows if we can show that the reduction map induces a surjection CK l ∩
SL2 (Or ) → SCl′ . Let t ∈ SCl′ . Since ρl′ : C → Cl′ is surjective (because β is
assumed to be regular), there exists a lift t̂ ∈ C of t. Since det(t) = 1, we have
′
′
ρl′ (det(t̂)) = det(t) = 1, so det(t̂) ∈ 1 + pl . Thus K l contains an element k such
′
that det(k) = det(t̂)−1 , and so t̂k ∈ CK l ∩ SL2 (Or ) is an element that maps to t.
Now, we have

|K l ∩ SL2 (Or )| = q 3(r−l ) = q 3l ,

whence the claim follows.

We now combine the results from above to obtain the number of twist isoclasses
above a given β.
Lemma 4.12. We have
f r | β) = q l−l |SCl′ |.

Proof. From the two previous lemmas, we see that
| StabÔr× (ρ)| = q 3l

|Or× ||SCl′ |
|CK l′ |

for all ρ ∈ Irr(Gr | [[β]]). We combine this with Lemma 4.6 and substitute into (13).
Note that StabÔr× (ρ) has the same order for all ρ ∈ Irr(Gr | [[β]]), so (13) becomes

Since p is odd, the first equation in (11) implies that #[[β]] = |Ol′ | = q l , whence
the claim follows.

Before the final result, we still need the following information.
Lemma 4.13. For O of any residue characteristic, we have
(
′
(q − 1)q l −1 if β is of type 1,
′
|SCl | =
′
(q + 1)q l −1 if β is of type 2.
For O of odd residue characteristic and β of type 3, we have
′

|SCl′ | = 2q l .
Proof. We first prove the assertion for β of types 1 and 2, in any characteristic.
For type 1, SCl′ is the diagonal subgroup of Gl′ , so the determinant is surjective.
′
For type 2, SCl′ is equal to O[β̂]× /(1 + pl ), where β̂ ∈ M2 (O) is a lift of βl′ . Since
β has irreducible characteristic polynomial modulo p, the ring O[β] is unramified
over O. Now, the determinant map coincides with the norm map O[β]× → O× ,
and it is well-known that the latter is surjective for unramified extensions. Thus,
for β of type 1, we have

Assume now that β is of type 3 and that p6= 2. By adding

mod p,
{(x, y) ∈ (Ol′ )2 | f (x, y) = 0}. The gradient ∇f then satisfies ∇f ≡ 2x
0
and since x is a unit for any (x, y) ∈ (Ol′ )2 such that f (x, y) = 0, we have ∇f 6≡ 0
′
mod p. By Hensel’s lemma, we obtain the existence of q l −1 lifts to (Ol′ )2 of each

of the 2q solutions modulo p. Thus the total number of solutions in (Ol′ )2 is 2q l


and so |SCl′ | = 2q l .
Finally, we are in a position to compute the twist zeta function in odd characteristic.

In particular, the abscissa of convergence of ζ̃GL2 (O) is 1.

R→∞

we will compute ζ̃GL2 (OR ) (s) and take the limit. Assume that r ≥ 2, and recall that

Remark 4.15. The formula in the preceding theorem implies that ζ̃GL2 (O) (s) has a
zero at s = −1, when O has odd residue characteristic.
4.5. Estimating the twist zeta function when p = 2 and char O = 0. In this
subsection we assume that the residue characteristic p is two and the characteristic
of O is zero. Compared to the previous subsection, we shall content ourselves with
only estimating the twist zeta function.
Recall that e denotes the ramification index of O. Fix a prime element π ∈ O
such that 2 = π e .
Lemma 4.16. For any β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) and any lift β̂ ∈ M2 (Or ), we have
|Or× |
< 3(q − 1)q 2e .
| det(C 1 K l )|

Proof. We estimate the order of det(C 1 ). Note that C contains the scalar matrices
of Gr , so det(C 1 ) contains every element of Or× of the form
(1 + xπ)2 = 1 + 2xπ + x2 π 2

with x ∈ Or .

We proceed by bounding the number of squares. The kernel of the map f : 1 + p →
1 + p, 1 + xπ 7→ (1 + xπ)2 is defined by the equation 2xπ + x2 π 2 = 0. Recalling
that 2 = π e , this leads to
xπ 2 (x + π e−1 ) = 0.
Let v denote the valuation of x and assume that x 6= 0. We consider different
cases. First, if v < e − 1, the valuation of x + π e−1 is v, and the equation above
implies that 2 + 2v ≥ r. This is possible only if r < 2e. When this condition is
satisfied, the number of solutions to the equation is the number of x with ⌈r/2⌉−1 ≤
v < e − 1. This number is
q r−e−1 (q e−⌈r/2⌉ − 1) < q ⌊r/2⌋ < q e .

Assume then that v > e − 1. Then the valuation of x + π e−1 is e − 1, and we get
v + 2 + e − 1 ≥ r. The number of x with v ≥ r − e − 1 is q e+1 − 1.

34

JOKKE HÄSÄ AND ALEXANDER STASINSKI

Finally, assume that v = e − 1. Write x = uπ e−1 for some unit u, so that the
above equation becomes uπ 2e (u + 1) = 0. As u is a unit, this equation implies the
valuation of u + 1 is at least r − 2e. There are therefore q 2e − 1 possible solutions.
Adding together the possible numbers of solutions, together with x = 0, gives
an upper bound for the kernel order:
| Ker f | = |{(1 + xπ)2 = 1 | x ∈ Or }| < 3q 2e .

Now, we have

Lemma 4.17. For any regular β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) we have

|CK l | = |K l | · |Cl′ | < q 4l · q 2l = q 2r+2l .

We can now proceed to the main result of this subsection.
Theorem 4.18. Assume that the ring O has characteristic zero and residue characteristic two. For i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, we have
r̃dr (i) (Gr ) ≪ q r .

Moreover, the abscissa of convergence of the twist zeta function ζ̃GL2 (O) is 1.
Proof. The dimension of a twist isoclass only depends on the type of the corresponding twist orbit, and the dimensions were given as dr (i) in Lemma 4.4. Using
Lemma 4.17, we can estimate the number of twist isoclasses corresponding to a
given dimension as follows:
X
f r | β) ≪ q l Bi ,
r̃dr (i) (Gr ) =
#Irr(G
β of type i

where β runs through a set of representatives of the twist orbits of type i. By
′
Lemma 4.5, we have Bi ≪ q l , which leads to the bound in theorem.
It follows from the obtained upper bounds that for any real positive s there is a
positive constant A ∈ R such that for any R ≥ 2, we have

Clearly, if s > 1, the sum on the right hand side converges when R → ∞, so
the abscissa of convergence of ζ̃GL2 (O) = limR→∞ ζ̃GL2 (OR ) is at most 1. On the
other hand, Corollary 3.5 implies that the abscissa of ζ̃GL2 (O) is at least 1, so it is
exactly 1.

4.6. Estimating the twist zeta function when p = 2 and char O = 2. In
this subsection we assume that the characteristic of O is two. It follows that O is
isomorphic to a ring of power series over the residue field, and Oi = Fq [[t]]/(ti ),
where t is an indeterminate.
In order to estimate the multiplicity of the representation dimensions in type 3,
we need to subdivide the twist isoclasses of this type further, depending on two
invariants which we now define. For later purposes, the invariants are defined with
respect to a matrix α of type 3 in M2 (Oi ) for any i ≤ r, although they will mostly
be used with β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ).
Definition 4.19. Let α ∈ M2 (Oi ) be a matrix of type 3 and write τ = tr(α).
Write also ∆ = det(α) = ∆0 + ∆1 t + · · · + ∆i−1 ti−1 , with ∆k ∈ Fq for k < i.
(a) If τ 6= 0, let w(α) denote the valuation of τ . If τ = 0, we define w(α) = i.
Write w(α) = 2M + ε, where M = ⌊w(α)/2⌋ and ε ∈ {0, 1}.
(b) Let δ(α) denote the smallest 0 ≤ k < M , for which ∆2k+1 6= 0. If such k
does not exist, we define δ(α) = M . We call δ(α) the odd depth of ∆ (and
also of α).
Note that δ(α) ∈ {0, . . . , M }, and if δ(α) < M , then ∆2δ(α)+1 6= 0. Note also
that if i = 1 in the above definition, then τ = 0 (because α is of type 3), and thus
δ(α) = 0. Let us show that the parameters w(α) and δ(α) are invariants of the twist
orbit [[α]]. Indeed, as the characteristic of Oi is 2, adding any scalar to α does not
change tr(α) at all. On the other hand, let x ∈ Oi and consider ∆′ = det(x + α).
We have
∆′ = x2 + xτ + ∆.
As the valuation of τ is at least 2M , we see that ∆′2k+1 = ∆2k+1 for k ≤ M − 1.
Thus also δ(α) is an invariant of the twist orbit.
For the most part, we will consider w(β) and δ(β), with a fixed β ∈ M2 (Ol′ )
parametrising a one-dimensional character ψβ of K l , as before. In these cases, for
notational simplicity, we write
w = w(β)

and

δ = δ(β).

We will now count the number of twist orbits in M2 (Ol′ ) of type 3 with fixed
parameters w and δ. Given w, δ ∈ Ol′ , we write B(w, δ) for the number of twist
orbits of conjugacy classes [α], α ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) of type 3, such that w(α) = w and
δ(α) = δ.

Proof. Fix the parameters w and δ. Note that w ≥ 1, as τ is congruent to 0 modulo
p in type 3. We use the Frobenius–Burnside formula as in the proof of Lemma 4.5.
Assume that x ∈ Ol′ fixes a conjugacy class [α] with parameters w and δ, and write
v for the valuation of x. As before, we know from the second equation in (11) that
x(x + τ ) = 0. Note that D(δ) is equal to the number of determinants with odd
depth δ.
Case 1 ≤ w < l′ /2. Assume first that v ≥ l′ /2. Then the valuation of x + τ is
w, so the equation x(x + τ ) = 0 holds if and only if v ≥ l′ − w. The number of
fixed points for any such x is then simply the number of conjugacy classes, which is
the number of traces with valuation w times the number of determinants with odd
′
depth δ, and equals (q − 1)q l −w−1 D(δ). On the other hand, the number of x ∈ Ol′
with valuation at least l′ − w is q w .
Assume then that v < l′ /2. Since both x and τ have valuation less than l′ /2,
the equation x(x + τ ) = 0 can hold only if v = w. As in the proof of Lemma 4.5
for type 3, the trace can only be one of q w many possibilities. This gives q w D(δ)
many fixed points. Finally, noting that the number of elements x with valuation w
′
is (q − 1)q l −w−1 , the Frobenius–Burnside formula gives


B(w, δ) = l′ q w · (q − 1)q l −w−1 D(δ) + (q − 1)q l −w−1 · q w D(δ)
q
= 2(q − 1)q −1 D(δ).

Case l′ /2 ≤ w < l′ . For the equation x(x + τ ) = 0 to hold, we need v ≥ l′ /2 (we
include the case x = 0 as v = l′ ). In that case, every conjugacy class with the given
′
parameters is fixed by x. The number of x with valuation at least l′ /2 is q ⌊l /2⌋ , so
we get

B(w, δ) = l′ · q ⌊l /2⌋ · (q − 1)q l −w−1 D(δ) = (q − 1)q ⌊l /2⌋−w−1 D(δ).

Case w = l′ . Here we have τ = 0. Now, x(x + τ ) = x2 = 0 holds if and only
if v ≥ l′ /2 (including x = 0 as v = l′ ). For these x, all conjugacy classes with the
given parameters are fixed points, and their number is D(δ), as the value of τ is
already determined. Hence, the Frobenius–Burnside formula yields

Recall that in our notation, we have SCi = CGi (βi ) ∩ SL2 (Oi ), where βi = ρi (β̂),
and β̂ ∈ M2 (Or ) is some lift of β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ). The proof of the following key lemma is
rather long, is independent of the rest of this section, and can be found in Section 6.
Lemma 4.21. Let 1 ≤ i ≤ r, and assume β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) is of type 3. Then
|SCi | = cq i+δ(βi )

for some c ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
The following lemma can be used to estimate |SCl | with respect to |SCl′ | when
l 6= l′ . The proof works for any (i, i − 1), i ≥ 2, instead of (l, l′ ), but for simplicity
we only state it in the case where we will apply it.
Lemma 4.22. Suppose that r is odd so that l′ = l − 1 and let β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) be of
type 3. Then, for any lift βl ∈ M2 (Ol ) of β, we have 31 q ≤ |SCl |/|SCl′ | ≤ 3q 2 .

REPRESENTATION GROWTH OF COMPACT LINEAR GROUPS

Proof. By Lemma 4.21, we have |SCl′ | = c1 q l +δ(β) and |SCl | = c2 q l+δ(βl ) , with
c1 , c2 ∈ {1, 2, 3}, so

It remains to show that δ(βl ) − δ(β) ∈ {0, 1}. Let w be the valuation of tr(β) and
wl the valuation of tr(βl ). (We define the valuation of 0 ∈ Oi to be i.)
Assume first that wl = w. Then wl ≤ l′ , and according to Definition 4.19, the
cutoff parameter M = ⌊wl /2⌋ is the same for βl as for β. As M ≤ ⌊l′ /2⌋ ≤ l′ , the
coefficients of the p-adic expansion of det(βl ) are equal to those of det(β) up to the
cutoff, so δ(βl ) = δ(β).
Assume on the other hand that wl 6= w. Then we must have wl = l and w = l′ ,
so ⌊wl /2⌋ = ⌊w/2⌋ unless l′ is odd, in which case ⌊wl /2⌋ = ⌊w/2⌋ + 1. If ⌊wl /2⌋ =
⌊w/2⌋, we have δ(βl ) = δ(β), as before. On the other hand, if δ(βl ) < ⌊wl /2⌋,
there is a non-zero coefficient with odd index at most wl − 1 = w, so δ(βl ) = δ(β).
However, if l is odd and δ(βl ) = ⌊wl /2⌋, then δ(β) = ⌊w/2⌋ = δ(βl ) − 1. There are
no other possibilities, whence the result.

Recall that we write δ = δ(β) when considering a particular β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ).

is conjugate to Õr× , where Õ is the ring of integers in the unramified extension of
degree two of the field of fractions of O. Thus C 1 is conjugate to 1 + pÕr and the
determinant on C 1 corresponds to the norm map on 1 + pÕr . Since Õ is unramified
over O, the image of 1 + pÕr under the norm map is 1 + p. Therefore, for β of type

We now prove the main result of this subsection. Recall that we write f (r) ≍ g(r)
when f (r) ≪ g(r) and g(r) ≪ f (r) (see the Introduction).
Theorem 4.25. Assume that the characteristic of O is two. Then the abscissa of

Proof. Letting r ≥ 2, we start by considering

r̃dr (i) (Gr ) ≤ Bi · q l+1 = (q − 1)q l −1 · q l+1 < q r+1 .

From the upper bounds for r̃dr (i) (Gr ) derived above and the fact that dr (i) ≍ q r
for each i ∈ {1, 2, 3} (Lemma 4.4), it follows that for any real positive s there exists
a positive real constant A such that for any integer R ≥ 2 we have



5. Estimating the zeta function of SL2 (Fq [[t]]), p = 2
Given the results in the previous sections, we know that for all O, such that
char O 6= 2 (including Z2 and its extensions), the abscissa of convergence of SL2 (O)
is 1. In this section, we assume that char O = 2, that is, O = Fq [[t]] where q is
a power of p = 2. We will explicitly describe the representations of SL2 (Fq [[t]]),
up to the orders of certain groups V (β, θ), and find estimates for the abscissa of
convergence of its representation zeta function.
We continue to consider a fixed but arbitrary r ≥ 2, and preserve all the notation
from the previous sections; in particular, Gi = GL2 (Oi ). In addition, we set Si =
i
SL2 (Oi ) and write KSL
for the kernel of the reduction map ρi : Sr → Si .
We start with a general summary of the representation theory of Sr in terms
of Clifford theory and orbits. This was first described in [31, Section 3.1], where
further details can be found.
In connection with the representations of Gr , we have already seen that every
irreducible character of K l is of the form ψβ , for some β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ). Restricting
l
characters in Irr(K l ) to KSL
gives rise to a surjective homomorphism
l
Irr(K l ) −→ Irr(KSL
),

ψβ 7−→ ψβ |K l .
SL

40

JOKKE HÄSÄ AND ALEXANDER STASINSKI

The kernel of this homomorphism consists of those ψβ where β is a scalar matrix.
That is, if we let Z = {[ a0 a0 ] | a ∈ Ol′ }, we get the following commutative diagram
M2 (Ol′ )
∼
=

Irr(K l )

M2 (Ol′ )/Z
∼
=

l
Hence the elements in Irr(KSL
) are of the form ψβ+Z , for β + Z ∈ M2 (Ol′ )/Z, and
l
ψβ+Z is given by the same formula as ψβ (being the restriction of ψβ to KSL
). The
conjugation action of Gl′ on M2 (Ol′ ) induces an action of Gl′ (and thus of Sl′ ) on
M2 (Ol′ )/Z.
In analogy with what we did for the groups Gr , we will also write Irr(H | β + Z)
l
for Irr(H | ψβ+Z ), where H is a subgroup of Sr containing KSL
. By a well known
result in Clifford theory (see [17, 6.11]), we have a bijection

(17)

f Irr(Sr | β + Z)
Irr(StabSr (ψβ+Z ) | β + Z) −→

To compute the representation zeta function of Sr , we thus need:
(1) a description and enumeration of the orbits of Sl′ acting on M2 (Ol′ )/Z
(2) a description of the groups StabSr (ψβ+Z ) and an enumeration of the elements in Irr(StabSr (ψβ+Z ) | β + Z) together with their dimensions.

We will give a complete solution to the first of these points and a partial solution
to the second. This will allow us to give estimates of the representation growth of
SL2 (O). We begin by describing the orbits.
The Gl′ -orbits in M2 (Ol′ )/Z are nothing but the twist orbits considered in earlier
sections. In the present section, we will consider Sl′ -orbits in M2 (Ol′ )/Z. Excluding
orbits which are zero mod p (these correspond to representations of Sr which factor
through Sr−1 ), there are three
types of Sl′ -orbits in M2 (Ol′ )/Z, represented by

0 λ
matrices of the form
, satisfying one of the following three conditions:
∆ τ
(1) x2 + τ x + ∆ has two distinct roots mod p and λ ∈
/ p.
(2) x2 + τ x + ∆ is irreducible mod p and λ ∈
/ p.
(3) ∆, τ ∈ p and λ ∈
/ p.

We will refer to these orbits as being of type 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and these are
precisely the regular orbits. These orbits are derived from the regular twist orbits
for Gl′ and the unit λ accounts for the Sl′ -splittings of orbits. Note that the above
representatives do not all represent distinct Sl′ -orbits (two different values of λ may
result in the same orbit), but two
 orbits
 of different type are never Sl′ -conjugate.
0 λ
Fix β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ), where β =
is of any of the three types above. We also
∆ τ
fix a lift β̂ ∈ M2 (Or ) of β and use the notation
C = CGr (β̂),
for r ≥ i ≥ 1.

Ci = CGi (ρi (β̂)),

SCi = Ci ∩ Si ,

Lemma 5.1. For any β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ), the Gl′ -orbit [β] is the union of precisely


 Ol×′ 


 det(Cl′ ) 

Sl′ -orbits. In particular, if β is of type 1 or 2, then [β] is one Sl′ -orbit, and if β is
of type 3, then [β] is the union of
cq 1+δ
Sl′ -orbits, for some c ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
Proof. Let γ ∈ [β] and g ∈ Gl′ . We claim that the elements γ and gγg −1 are
conjugate under Sl′ if and only if
det(g) ∈ det(Cl′ ).
The forward implication is obvious, and for the reverse, note that det(g) ∈ det(Cl′ )
implies g ∈ Cl′ Sl′ , which implies that γ and gγg −1 are Sl′ -conjugate. Thus γ and
gγg −1 are Sl′ -conjugate if and only if the image of det(g) is trivial in Ol×′ / det(Cl′ ).
It follows that
hγh−1 7−→ det(h) det(Cl′ )

induces a bijection between the set of Sl′ -orbits in the Gl′ -orbit [β] of β and the
group Ol×′ / det(Cl′ ).
Now, when β is of type 1 or 2, we have det(Cl′ ) = Ol×′ (type 1 being obvious,
while type 2 follows from the surjectivity of the norm, as in previous sections).
Thus, if β is of type 1 or 2, the Gl′ -orbit [β] equals the Sl′ -orbit of β. Moreover,
we have


 Ol×′  (q − 1)q r−1 |SCl′ |
(q − 1)q r−1 |SCl′ |


,
=
 det(Cl′ )  =
|Cl′ |
(q − 1)q 2(l′ −1)+1
so when β is of type 3, Lemma 4.21 implies the last assertion.

Lemma 5.2. Assume that β is regular and let x ∈ Ol′ . Then xI +β is Sl′ -conjugate
to β if and only if xI + β is Gl′ -conjugate to β.
Proof. Every regular Sl′ -orbit in M2 (Ol′ ) has a representative of the form

where we have used x + x = 0, since char O = 2. This shows that if x(x + τ ) = 0,
then xI + β is Sl′ -conjugate to β. Conversely, if xI + β is Sl′ -conjugate to β, then
by comparing determinants, we see that we must have x(x + τ ) = 0. On the other
hand, by (11), we know that xI + β is Gl′ -conjugate to β if and only if x(x + τ ) = 0,
which proves the lemma.

Recall that we use B(w, δ) to denote the number of twist orbits of type 3 in
M2 (Ol′ ) whose trace has valuation w and whose odd depth is δ. An immediate
consequence of the two preceding lemmas is the following:

42

JOKKE HÄSÄ AND ALEXANDER STASINSKI

Lemma 5.3. Let BSL (w, δ) denote the number of Sl′ -twist orbits of type 3 in
M2 (Ol′ ) whose trace has valuation w and whose odd depth is δ. Then
B(w, δ)q 1+δ ≤ BSL (w, δ) ≤ 3 · B(w, δ)q 1+δ ,
so in particular
BSL (w, δ) ≍ B(w, δ)q δ .
Proof. Let β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) be of type 3 with trace w and odd depth δ. By Lemma 5.1
the Gl′ -orbit [β] splits into cq 1+δ Sl′ -orbits, where 1 ≤ c ≤ 3. By Lemma 5.2,
passing to twist-orbits does not produce any further Sl′ -splitting. This proves the
inequalities and hence the asymptotic estimate.

We now turn to the second goal mentioned in the beginning of the section, that
is, a description of StabSr (ψβ+Z ) and the corresponding representations.
From the definition of ψβ+Z , it is easy to see that
StabSr (ψβ+Z ) = ρ−1
l′ (CSl′ (β + Z)), .

Note that Gr normalises KSL

StabGr (ψβ+Z ) ⊇ StabGr (ψβ ) = CK l

as well as

StabSr (ψβ+Z ) ⊇ StabSr (ψβ ) = ρ−1
l′ (SCl′ ).

In order to get a handle on StabSr (ψβ+Z ), we will now determine the structure
of CSl′ (β + Z). Let τ̂ = tr(β̂), and for r ≥ i ≥ 1, write τi for the image of τ̂ in Oi ;
in particular, τr = τ̂ and τl′ = tr(β) = τ . Define the group

Note that this is indeed a group since char O = 2. Let σi : O1i 01 → O1r 01 be the
injective group homomorphism induced by the additive inclusion Oi ֒→ Or (note
that such an injection

 if char O 6= 2). Then σi is a section of the
reduction map ρi : O1r 01 → O1i 01 , and from now on we identify U (τi ) with its
image under σi and simply write U (τi ) for σi (U (τi )).
Lemma 5.4. For any i, such that 1 ≤ i ≤ r, the group U (τi ) normalises SCi and
U (τi ) ∩ SCi = {1}. Thus, we have a semidirect product
CSl′ (β + Z) = U (τ )SCl′
and
StabSr (ψβ+Z ) = U (τ ) StabSr (ψβ ).

so, since SCi = Oi [β] ∩ Si , we have

We will now determine the structure of the group U (τi ). In the following, we
will only need U (τl ) and U (τ ) = U (τl′ ), but it is not harder to prove the general
case.
Lemma 5.5. For any i, such that 1 ≤ i ≤ r, let βi = ρi (β̂) and τi = tr(βi ), as
above. If β is of type 1 or 2, we have

Proof. Assume that β is of type 1 or 2. Then τ ∈
/ p, because if τ ∈ p, then β1 has
precisely one eigenvalue in Fq , and this is impossible for β of type 1 or 2. Thus τ
is a unit, hence τi is a unit, so if x ∈ U (τi ) so that x(x + τi ) = 0, then either x = 0
(if x ∈ p), or x = τi (if x 6∈ p).
Now suppose that β is of type 3; then τ , hence τi , is not a unit. Assume that
i−w
w < ⌈i/2⌉. Then i − w > i − ⌈i/2⌉ = ⌊i/2⌋, so i − w ≥

If a < w, then a = v(x + τi ) ≥ i − a, so w > a ≥ ⌈i/2⌉. This is a contradiction,
so

Lemma 5.6. For β of any type, we have
|U (τl )|
∈ {1, 2, q}.
|U (τ )|

Proof. When r is even, we have l = l′ , hence U (τl ) = U (τ ), so there is nothing to
prove. Assume now that r is odd, so that l′ = l − 1. We use the formula for |U (τi )|
from Lemma 5.5 in the cases where i is l and l′ . If β is of type 1 or 2, the assertion
is clear, so assume now that β is of type 3.
Assume first that τ = 0. Then v(τ ) = l′ and l′ ≥ ⌈l′ /2⌉ for all l′ ≥ 1, so
′
|U (τ )| = q ⌊l /2⌋ , by Lemma 5.5. Meanwhile, v(τl ) ∈ {l, l′}, and since l′ = l − 1 ≥ 1,
we have l > l′ ≥ ⌈l/2⌉, so |U (τl )| = q ⌊l/2⌋ . Thus |U (τl )|/|U (τ )| ∈ {1, q} when τ = 0.
Assume now that τ 6= 0; then w = v(τl ) = v(τ ). If w < ⌈l′ /2⌉, then also
w < ⌈l/2⌉, and in this case |U (τl )| = 2q w = |U (τ )|. If w ≥ ⌈l′ /2⌉ and w ≥ ⌈l/2⌉,

then |U (τl )| = q ⌊l/2⌋ and |U (τ )| = q ⌊(l−1)/2⌋ , so |U(τ

We now give an approximate description of the representations in Irr(Sr | β +Z),
for β of type 1, 2 or 3. Since C is abelian, we know that ψβ ∈ Irr(K l ) has an
l
extension to CK l . It follows by restriction of this extension that ψβ+Z ∈ Irr(KSL
)
has an extension to CK l ∩ Sr . Now, as in the proof of Lemma 4.11, it is easy to
see that ρl : CK l ∩ Sr → SCl is surjective: for t ∈ SCl , any lift t̂ ∈ C (which exists
since C → Cl is surjective) satisfies det(t̂) ∈ 1 + pl , so there exists a k ∈ K l such
that t̂k ∈ CK l ∩ Sr , and ρl (t̂k) = t; thus
(19)

CK l ∩ Sr = ρ−1
l (SCl ).

By Lemma 5.4, U (τl ) normalises SCl , so U (τl ) (considered as a subgroup of Sr )
−1
normalises ρ−1
l (SCl ). For an extension θ ∈ Irr(ρl (SCl ) | β + Z) of ψβ+Z , let
V (β, θ) = StabU(τl ) (θ).

Note that we regard V (β, θ) as a subgroup of Sr . Then, since V (β, θ) is abelian,
the character θ extends to V (β, θ)ρ−1
l (SCl ), and by standard Clifford theory [17,
6.11], since
StabU(τl )ρ−1 (SCl ) (θ) = V (β, θ)ρ−1
l (SCl ),
l

any extension of θ to V (β, θ)ρ−1
l (SCl ) induces irreducibly to U (τl )ρl (SCl ).
Consider the following diagrams of groups and representations of the corresponding groups. The lines between the groups indicate containment of groups, and the

The group U (τl ) acts on Irr(ρl−1 (SCl )) by conjugation, and for each orbit we
can choose a representative θ. Then all the extensions θ̂ of θ induce to distinct

representations of U (τl )ρ−1
l (SCl ). Note that if we choose another representative θ ,
−1
then we end up with the same set of representations of U (τl )ρl (SCl ).
Definition 5.7. Let ur (β, θ) ∈ R be such that
q ur (β,θ) = |V (β, θ)|.
Note that if q is a prime, ur (β, θ) is an integer, since V (β, θ) is a p-group. We do
not know whether ur (β, θ) is always an integer, and in fact we have not been able
to determine the function ur (β, θ). Nevertheless, we can express the asymptotic
number of representations of Sr and their dimensions in terms of ur (β, θ), and this
will be sufficient to establish non-trivial bounds on the abscissa of convergence of
SL2 (O).
Lemma 5.8. Let θ ∈ Irr(StabSr (ψβ ) | β + Z). Then, for any ρ ∈ Irr(Sr | θ), we
have

The lower bound 1 for the abscissa in the following theorem follows from [21,
Proposition 6.6]. We give an independent proof of this lower bound to illustrate
our method.
Theorem 5.9. Assume that char O = 2. Then the abscissa of convergence of
ζSL2 (O) (s) lies in the interval [1, 5/2].
Proof. For the abscissa it is enough to consider ζSL2 (O) (s) for s ∈ R, and since
we know that the Dirichlet series defining the zeta function diverges for s = 0, we
henceforth assume that s ∈ R satisfies s > 0 (this assumption will be used later in
the proof). We have

ζS1r (s) + ζS2r (s) + ζS3r (s) ,
ζSL2 (O) (s) = ζSL2 (Fq ) (s) +

ζSi r (s)

as formal Dirichlet series, where
is defined to be the Dirichlet series counting
only primitive representations of Sr of type i.
We first deal with the easier parts ζS1r (s) and ζS2r (s), so assume that r ≥ 2 and
β ∈ M2 (Ol′ ) is of type 1 or 2. Then, for any ρ ∈ Irr(Sr | β + Z), Lemma 5.8
implies that dim ρ ≍ q r . Moreover, the number of extensions of ψβ+Z to ρ−1
l (SCl )
is

|ρ−1
(SCl )|
l
,
l |
|KSL

which equals |SCl | by (19). Hence, by Lemmas 5.8 and 4.13, we have
# Irr(Sr | β + Z) ≍ |SCl | ≍ q l .

By Lemma 4.5, we have Bi ≍ q l for i ∈ {1, 2}, and by Lemma 5.1, there is no
Sl′ -splitting of a Gl′ -twist orbit of type 1 or 2, so we conclude that
ζSi r (s) ≍ q 2l q −sr = q r(1−s) ,

for i ∈ 1, 2.

Assume now that β is of type 3. By Lemma 5.8, every ρ ∈ Irr(Sr | β + Z)
satisfies
dim ρ ≍ q r−δ−ur (β,θ).

48

Moreover, since the orbit of any θ ∈ Irr(ρ−1
l (SCl ) | β + Z) under the action of U (τl )
has size |U (τl )/V (β, θ)|, we have
# Irr(Sr | β + Z) =

so by Lemma 5.5, we have
1 ≤ q ur (β,θ) ≤ 2q ⌈l/2⌉ ≍ q l/2 .

In the last step, we have substituted r/2 for l. Assume that s > 1, so that the
coefficient −1 + (1 + s)/2 of w above is positive. We then have
⌈r/2⌉

w=⌈r/4⌉

q w(−1+(1+s)/2)+3r(2−s)/4 ≍ q r/2(−1+(1+s)/2)+3r(2−s)/4 = q r(5−2s)/4 ,

and thus, by the above upper bound,
ζS3r (s) ≪ q r(5−2s)/4 .
We have already shown that ζSi r (s) ≪ q r(1−s) for i ∈ {1, 2}, so we conclude that for
any s > 1, there exists a positive real constant A such that for all R ≥ 2, we have
ζSL2 (OR ) (s) ≤ A

This upper bound converges for s > 5/2, as R → ∞. Thus, since ζSL2 (O) (s) =
limR→∞ ζSL2 (OR ) (s), the abscissa of convergence of ζSL2 (O) (s) is at most 5/2.
We now estimate ζS3r (s) from below. By Lemma 5.5 we have |U (τ )| ≤ q l/2 and
trivially, 0 ≤ ur (β, θ), so (using that 2 + s > 0 by our assumption that s > 0)

Remark 5.10. Most of the implicit constants in Lemma 5.8 can be explicitly determined, and given the results in the present paper, the only gap in our understanding
of the representations of Sr , r even, is the function ur (β, θ), together with the various constants c ∈ {1, 2, 3} coming from Lemma 4.21. For r odd, there is in addition

for the various extensions θ̂.
In any case, our results show that the only remaining thing needed in order to
compute the exact abscissa of convergence for SL2 (Fq [[t]]), q even, is the function
ur (β, θ). Very recently, M and Singla [24] have obtained strong bounds on ur (β, θ)
which imply that the abscissa is 1.
Remark 5.11. Until recently, there was no proof in the literature that SL2 (Fq [[t]]),
q even, has polynomial representation growth, as this group was excluded in [23].
This of course follows from our results in the present section, but was also proved
in a general context by Jaikin (see [13, Theorem 3.2 and Lemma 3.2.6]), around
the same time as [23] appeared.
6. Proof of Lemma 4.21
We operate in M2 (Oi ) throughout the proof, so for notational simplicity, we
write w = w(βi ) and δ = δ(βi ). Note first that conjugating βi by an element in Gi
changes Ci = CGi (βi ) into a conjugate group, so it does not affect the values of the

determinant map. We can therefore choose βi = ∆
τ , so that the centraliser has
the form

×


x
y
 x, y ∈ Oi
Ci =
.
∆y x + τ y 

Hence, the problem of computing |SCi | is reduced to finding the number of solutions
in Oi to the quadratic equation x2 + τ xy + ∆y 2 = 1. Secondly, adding a scalar to
βi does not change Ci , so we are free to replace βi by any element in its twist orbit.
We make some simplifying modifications to the equation. Writing τ = ηtw , with
η a unit and w ≥ 1, as well as writing u = ∆η −2 , we can make a change of variables
y 7→ ηy to rewrite the quadratic equation as
x2 + tw xy + uy 2 = 1.

(21)

Next, we use the fact that we may without loss of generality change βi by adding
any scalar λ ∈ Oi to it. The addition of λ changes the determinant by adding
λ2 + λτ to it. It follows that u gains an addition of (η −1 λ)2 + η −1 λtw . Therefore,
by choosing
√
λ = η u0 + 1
we can make sure that u0 = 1 after the addition. Notice that the odd numbered
coefficients of u below w are left unchanged, so we still have u2k+1 = 0 for all k < δ
and u2δ+1 6= 0 if δ < M .
By writing x = x0 + x1 t + · · · + xi−1 ti−1 and y = y0 + y1 t + · · · + yi−1 ti−1 ,
substituting these into (21) and collecting coefficients, we arrive at the following
system of equations:

where A(n) = j+k=n xj yk and B(n) = j+2k=n uj yk2 . The first three equations
correspond to even powers of t, and the last two to odd ones.
Our strategy is to find an “echelon form” for the equations in order to find the
order of degeneracy in the system. In other words, we shall describe an ordering
(z1 , . . . , z2i ) of the variables xn and yn , as well as a list of equations equivalent to
(22)–(26), in which some of the equations are identically zero, and the rest have
the form zk = ϕk (z1 , . . . , zk−1 ), a new variable zk being solved from each equation.
i) Equation (22). The first equation is
x20 + u0 y02 = 1.
We solve for x0 to obtain x0 =

u0 y0 + 1.

There are no identically zero equations. In the previous part, we have already solved
xm for m ≤ M in terms of yk for some k, and we continue here from m = M + 1.
Note that in the equation corresponding to m, the second-degree term on the left
hand side is x2m , and the first-degree term with the largest index for x is x2m−w .
Since m < w, we know that m > 2m − w. Hence, when solving for xm in the
m-th equation, we can assume that all of xj in the same equation are already
known except for the second-degree term. Working recursively, we conclude that
√
xm = u0 ym + fm (y0 , . . . , ym−1 ) for m ∈ {M + 1, . . . , w − 1}.

Recall that by the definition of the odd depth δ, we have u2i+1 = 0 for all i < δ.
Therefore, the rank of the above matrix is M − δ. There are δ equations that are
identically zero, and from the rest, we can solve y0 = y1 = · · · = yM−δ−1 = 0.
v) Equations (26) for m < w − δ. These equations read

= u1 yw−δ−2
+ · · · + u2w−2δ−3 y02 .

They correspond to m ∈ {M + 1, . . . , w − δ − 1}. Note that if δ = M , there are no
such m, and therefore we may assume for these equations that δ < M . Then, in
particular, we have u2δ+1 6= 0.
We shall show that there are no identically zero equations, and moreover, from
the equation corresponding to m, we can solve ym−δ−1 = 0. Note that these
variables have not been solved for in the previous part, as m − δ − 1 ≥ M − δ. The
proof proceeds by induction on m.
Let m ∈ {M + 1, . . . , w − δ − 1}, and assume that yk = 0 when M − δ ≤ k <
m − δ − 1. We consider the equation corresponding to m:
x0 y2m−1−w + · · · + x2m−1−w y0

2
2
2
= u1 ym−1
+ · · · + u2δ+1 ym−δ−1
+ u2δ+3 ym−δ−2
+ · · · + u2m−1 y02 .

Since m ≤ w − δ − 1, we have
2m − 1 − w ≤ m + (w − δ − 1) − 1 − w = m − δ − 2.
Hence, by the induction hypothesis, and recalling from the previous part that yk = 0
for k < M − δ, the left hand side of the equation becomes identically zero. By the
definition of the odd depth, we know that all the variables u1 , . . . , u2δ−1 for odd
indices are zero. It follows that most of the right hand side vanishes, too, and we
are left with
2
0 = u2δ+1 ym−δ−1
.
As u2δ+1 6= 0, we may conclude that ym−δ−1 = 0, and the induction is complete.
vi) Equation (26) for m = w − δ. The equation reads

2
x0 yw−2δ−1 + x1 yw−2δ−2 + · · · + xw−2δ−1 y0 = u1 yw−δ−1
+ · · · + u2w−2δ−1 y02 .

It does not exist if δ = M and ε = 0, as 2m > w holds for equations of type (26).
We have shown in parts iv) and v) that yk = 0 for k < w − 2δ − 1, so considering
that the variables u1 , . . . , u2δ−1 for odd indices are zero, the equation becomes
2
x0 yw−2δ−1 = u2δ+1 yw−2δ−1
.

Assume first that δ < M , so that u2δ+1 6= 0. As y0 = 0 by part iv), we get from
part i) that x0 = 1. Hence, we get exactly two solutions: either yw−2δ−1 = 0 or
yw−2δ−1 = 1/u2δ+1 .
On the other hand, if δ = M , we must have ε = 1, so that w = 2M + 1. The
equation then becomes
x0 y0 = uw y02 .

54

JOKKE HÄSÄ AND ALEXANDER STASINSKI

Substituting x0 =

√
u0 y0 + 1 from part i) and collecting coefficients gives
√
( u0 + uw )y02 + y0 = 0.

√
Now, if u0 + uw = 0, we have y0 = 0. Otherwise, we get two distinct solutions:
√
either y0 = 0 or y0 = 1/( u0 + uw ).
vii) Equations (26) for w − δ < m ≤ w. These equations have the general form

2
2
x0 y2m−w−1 + x1 y2m−w−2 + · · · + x2m−w−1 y0 = u1 ym−1
+ u3 ym−2
+ · · · + u2m−1 y02 .

As in the previous cases, since uj = 0 for odd indices j up to j = 2δ − 1, the
2
first non-zero term on the right hand side is u2δ+1 ym−δ−1
. As m > w − δ, we
see that 2m − w − 1 > m − δ − 1, so we can try solving for y2m−w−1 from the
left hand side. Indeed, noting that 2m − w − 1 ≤ w − 1, we can substitute xj =
√
u0 yj +fj (y0 , . . . , yj−1 ) from parts i)–iii) up to j = 2m−w−1. Collecting all terms
containing yj with j < 2m − w − 1 to the right hand side, the equation becomes
√
(x0 + u0 y0 )y2m−w−1 = gm (y0 , . . . , y2m−w−2 )
for some function gm . Using part i) gives y2m−w−1 = gm (y0 , . . . , y2m−w−2 ). This
holds for all m ∈ {w − δ + 1, . . . , w}.
viii) Equation (24) for m = w. This is

2
2
x2w + x0 yw + x1 yw−1 + · · · + xw y0 = u0 yw
+ u2 yw−1
+ · · · + u2w y02 .

There are different cases. If δ < M , we know from part iv) that y0 = 0, and we
√
can solve xw = u0 yw + fw (y0 , . . . , yw−1 ), as in part iii). On the other hand, if
√
δ = M , it follows from part vi) that either y0 = 0 or y0 = 1/( u0 + uw ). In the
latter case, the equation becomes a non-trivial second-degree equation for xw . For
each combination of values for y1 , . . . , yw , the equation may therefore not have a
solution, but if it does, there are two possibilities for xw .
ix) Equations (24) and (26) for m > w. For each m > w, we have the equations
( 2
2
xm + x0 y2m−w + x1 y2m−w−1 + · · · + x2m−w y0 = u0 ym
+ · · · + u2m y02
x0 y2m−w−1 + x1 y2m−w−2 + · · · + x2m−w−1 y0

2
= u1 ym−1
+ · · · + u2m−1 y02 .

The first one corresponds to type (24) and the second to type (26). Since m > w,
we have 2m − w > m and 2m − w − 1 > m − 1, so we can solve each equation from
the left hand side. There are two cases.
Suppose first that x0 6= 0. For each m > w, we can solve from the equation of
type (24)
y2m−w = h2m−w (y0 , . . . , y2m−w−1 , xw , . . . , x2m−w )
for some function h2m−w , using the fact that xj were solved in terms of y0 , . . . , yj
up to j = w − 1 in parts i)–iii) above. Similarly, from equations of type (26), we
solve
y2m−w−1 = h2m−w−1 (y0 , . . . , y2m−w−2 , xw , . . . , x2m−w−1 ).
Note that these solved variables are never the same for any choices of m because
their indices differ in parity. Therefore, we have solved a new variable from each
type of equation for every m > w.
On the other hand, if x0 = 0, then it follows from part i) that y0 6= 0, and
we can write x2m−w = h2m−w (y0 , . . . , y2m−w , xw , . . . , x2m−w−1 ) for type (24) and
x2m−w−1 = h2m−w−1 (y0 , . . . , y2m−w−1 , xw , . . . , x2m−w−2 ) for type (26). All the
variables are again distinct.

Conclusion. There are altogether 2i variables and i equations. By part iv),
there are δ equations that are identically zero, and we have shown that all the
other equations can be solved for one new variable. This leaves i + δ many free
variables.
Furthermore, if δ < M , it follows from part vi) that the variable yw−2δ−1 can be
solved in two distinct ways, but all the other solved variables have unique solutions.
Suppose then that δ = M . Then the variable yw−2δ−1 = y0 has in some cases two
distinct solutions, one of them being always y0 = 0. Now, if y0 = 0, all other
variables have unique solutions. On the other hand, if y0 6= 0, part viii) shows that
in some cases the variable xw may have two distinct solutions.
Finally, the total number of solutions reaches its maximum when δ = M . Then
there are q i+δ solutions where y0 = 0, and potentially 2q i+δ solutions where y0 6= 0.
This gives altogether at most 3q i+δ solutions, which proves the claim.
