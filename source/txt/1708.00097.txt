Abstract. We present a new method to solve certain ∂-equations
for logarithmic differential forms by using harmonic integral theory for currents on
¯
Kähler manifolds. The result can be considered as a ∂ ∂-lemma
for logarithmic
forms. As applications, we generalize the result of Deligne about closedness

E1 -level, as well as certain injectivity theorem on compact Kähler manifolds.
Furthermore, for a family of logarithmic deformations of complex structures on Kähler manifolds, we construct the extension for any logarithmic

Calabi-Yau structure by extending an iteration method to the logarithmic

Calabi-Yau pair and a pair on a Calabi-Yau manifold by differential geometric
method.

Introduction
The basic theory on sheaf of logarithmic differential forms and of sheaves
with logarithmic integrable connections over smooth projective manifolds were
developed by P. Deligne in [7]. H. Esnault and E. Viehweg investigated in
[12, 13] the relations between logarithmic de Rham complexes and vanishing
theorems on complex algebraic manifolds, and showed that many vanishing
theorems follow from Deligne’s degeneracy of logarithmic Hodge to de Rham
spectral sequences at E1 -level. In [20], C. Huang, X. Yang, the first and third
authors developed an effective analytic method to prove vanishing theorems for
sheaves of logarithmic differential forms on compact Kähler manifolds. In this
paper, the authors will present an effective differential geometric approach to
the geometry of logarithmic differential forms which is used to study degeneracy
of spectral sequences [8], injectivity theorems [1, 15] in algebraic geometry and
logarithmic deformations of complex structures [23, 21].
Throughout this paper, let X be an n-dimensional compact Kähler manifold
and D a simple normal crossing divisor on X. For any logarithmic (p, q)-form
α ∈ A0,q (X, ΩpX (log D)),

¯ = 0, we will present a method to solve the
as described in Section 1, with ∂∂α
¯
∂-equation
(0.1)

¯ = ∂α
∂x

such that x ∈ A0,q−1 (X, Ωp+1
X (log D)). For the case D = ∅, the equation (0.1)
¯
is easily solved by the ∂ ∂-lemma from standard Hodge theory on forms, as
discussed in [18, p. 84]. For the case D 6= ∅, the equation (0.1) is defined on
the open manifold X − D, and the naive possible approach is to use the L2 Hodge theory with respect to some complete Kähler metric as in [20]. However,
a logarithmic form is not necessarily L2 -integrable and so one needs some new
methods to solve this equation (0.1). Inspired by the work [33] of J. Noguchi,
one may consider a logarithmic form as a current on X, where the harmonic
integral theory [11, 26] by G. de Rham and K. Kodaira is available.
Roughly speaking, the current T∂α associated to ∂α can be decomposed into
two terms, one term of residue and the other one in the image of ∂¯ as shown
in (2.20). An iteration trick shows that the residue term also lies in the image of ∂¯ when acting on a smooth differential form vanishing on D as shown
in Lemma 2.3 and so does T∂α . Notice that the sheaf of logarithmic differential forms is locally free and thus the logarithmic form ∂α can also be viewed
as a bundle-valued smooth differential form. By these and the bundle-valued
Hodge decomposition theorem, we prove our first main theorem which can be
¯
considered as a ∂ ∂-lemma
for logarithmic forms.
Theorem 0.1 (=Theorem 2.5). Let X be a compact Kähler manifold and D
a simple normal crossing divisor on X. For any α ∈ A0,q (X, ΩpX (log D)) with
¯ = 0, there exists a solution

x ∈ A0,q−1 (X, Ωp+1
X (log D))

¯
for the ∂-equation
(0.1).
Similar to Theorem 0.1, one is able to obtain the second main theorem:
Theorem 0.2 (=Theorem 2.6). With the same notations as in Theorem 0.1, if
α ∈ An,n−q (X, TXp (− log D)) ⊂ An−p,n−q (X)

¯ = 0, then there is a solution x ∈ An,n−q−1 (X, T p−1(− log D)) such that

¯ = ∂α.

Here one identifies an element of An,n−q (X, TXp (− log D)) with an (n−p, n−q)form by contraction of the (n, n−q)-form with the TXp (− log D)-valued coefficient
as given explicitly in (2.6).
Then we present three kinds of applications of Theorems 0.1 and 0.2 to algebraic geometry. As the first application of Theorem 0.1, we generalize one
result of Deligne on d-closedness of logarithmic forms on a smooth complex
quasi-projective variety.
Corollary 0.3 (=Corollary 3.1). With the same notations as in Theorem 0.1,
¯ = 0, then ∂α = 0.
if α ∈ A0,0 (X, ΩpX (log D)) with ∂∂α
It is well-known that Deligne’s degeneracy of logarithmic Hodge to de Rham
spectral sequences at E1 -level [8] is a fundamental result and has great impact
in algebraic geometry, such as vanishing and injectivity theorems. P. Deligne
and L. Illusie [9] also proved this degeneracy by using a purely algebraic positive
characteristic method. For compact Kähler manifolds, as the second application of Theorem 0.1, we can give a geometric and simpler proof of Deligne’s
degeneracy theorem.
Theorem 0.4 (=Theorem 3.2). With the same notations as in Theorem 0.1,
the logarithmic Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence associated with the Hodge
filtration
E1p,q = H q (X, ΩpX (log D)) ⇒ Hp+q (X, Ω∗X (log D))
degenerates at the E1 -level.

As a direct corollary of the above theorem,
X
dimC H k (X − D, C) =
dimC H q (X, ΩpX (log D)).
p+q=k

Similar to Theorem 0.4, Theorem 0.2 gives rise to a dual version of Theorem
0.4. This duality appears in [16, Remark 2.11].
Corollary 0.5 (=Corollary 3.4). With the same notations as in Theorem 0.1,
the spectral sequence associated with the Hodge filtration
E1p,q = H q (X, ΩpX (log D) ⊗ OX (−D)) ⇒ Hp+q (X, Ω∗X (log D) ⊗ OX (−D))
degenerates at E1 -level.
The third result of Theorem 0.1 is an injectivity theorem for compact Kähler
manifolds, whose algebraic version was first proved by F. Ambro [1, Theorem
2.1] and the equivalence in the statement was proposed in [1, Remark 2.6 and
Corollary 2.7].

Corollary 0.6 (=Corollary 3.6). With the same notations as in Theorem 0.1,
the restriction homomorphism
i

H q (X, ΩnX (log D)) −
→ H q (U, KU )
is injective, where U = X − D. Equivalently, if ∆ is an effective divisor with
Supp(∆) ⊂ Supp(D), then the natural homomorphism induced by the inclusion
OX ⊂ OX (∆)
i′

H q (X, ΩnX (log D)) −
→ H q (X, ΩnX (log D) ⊗ OX (∆))
is injective.
Note that Ambro’s algebraic version was generalized by O. Fujino [15, Theorem 1.1] on a simple normal crossing algebraic variety.
Finally, we describe another three applications of Theorems 0.1 and 0.2 to
logarithmic deformations of complex structures [23, 21]. The local stability of
certain geometric structure under deformation is an interesting topic in deformation theory of complex structures, in which the power series method, initiated
by Kodaira-Nirenberg-Spencer and Kuranishi [32, 27], plays a prominent role
there. In [34], Q. Zhao, the second and third authors presented a power series
proof for the classical Kodaira-Spencer’s local stabilities of Kähler structures.
From [29], one can construct a smooth d-closed extension for any holomorphic
(n, 0)-form on the central fiber. Inspired by these results, we can consider the
problems of d-closed extension of logarithmic forms under logarithmic deformations. The logarithmic deformation of a pair (X, D) is a special deformation of
X such that ∪t∈S Dt is a closed analytic subset in ∪t∈S Xt as in Definition 4.1,
which is defined and developed in [24, 25], while the log Hodge structure theory
is also developed in [22].
¯
Let ∂¯t denote the ∂-operator
on Xt . As the first application of Theorem 0.1
to deformation theory, we have
Theorem 0.7 (=Theorem 4.5). With the same notations as in Theorem 0.1, for
any logarithmic deformations (Xt , Dt ), t ∈ S of the pair (X, D) with X0 = X,
induced by the Beltrami differential ϕ := ϕ(t) ∈ A0,1 (X, TX (− log D)), and any
¯
∂-closed
logarithmic (n, q)-form Ω on the central fiber X, there exists a small
neighborhood ∆ ⊂ S of 0 and a smooth family Ω(t) of logarithmic (n, q)-form
on the central fiber X, such that
eiϕ (Ω(t)) ∈ A0,q (Xt , ΩnXt (log Dt ))

which is ∂¯t -closed on Xt for any t ∈ ∆ and satisfies (eiϕ (Ω(t)))(0) = Ω.
By definition, a log Calabi-Yau pair is a pair (X, D) such that D is a simple
normal crossing divisor on an n-dimensional Kähler manifold X and the logarithmic canonical line bundle ΩnX (log D) ∼
= OX (KX + D) is trivial. As a direct
corollary of Theorem 0.7, one obtains the local stabilities of log Calabi-Yau
structures under deformations.
Now we discuss other two applications to logarithmic deformations. On projective manifolds, L. Katzarkov, M. Kontsevich, and T. Pantev [23] proved the

unobstructedness of logarithmic deformations of a log Calabi-Yau pair and a pair
on a Calabi-Yau manifold. More precisely, they used Dolbeault type complexes
to construct a differential Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra such that the associated
differential graded Lie algebra (DGLA) controls the deformation problem. If the
differential Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra has a degeneracy property then the associated DGLA is homotopy abelian. Using the notion of the Cartan homotopy,
D. Iacono [21] obtained an alternative proof of the unobstructedness theorems.
Both of their proofs rely on the degeneracy of spectral sequences in Theorem
0.4 and Corollary 0.5. Here we present a differential geometric proof which has
potential applications to extension problems.
Combining the methods originally from [39, 40, 30] and developed in [29, 43,
44, 35, 34], we use Theorem 0.1 to prove:
Theorem 0.8 (=Theorem 4.12). Let (X, D) be a log Calabi-Yau pair and [ϕ1 ] ∈
0,1
H 0,1 (X, TX (− log D)). Then on a small disk of 0 in CdimC H (X,TX (− log D)) , there
exists a holomorphic family
ϕ(t) ∈ A0,1 (X, TX (− log D)),
such that

Recall that a compact n-dimensional Kähler manifold X is called a CalabiYau manifold if it admits a nowhere vanishing holomorphic (n, 0)-form. Similar
to Theorem 0.8, by use of Theorem 0.2, one obtains another unobstructedness
theorem for logarithmic deformation.
Theorem 0.9 (=Theorem 4.13). Let X be a Calabi-Yau manifold and D a
simple normal crossing divisor on X. Then the pair (X, D) has unobstructed
logarithmic deformations.
This article is organized as follows. In Section 1, we introduce the definitions and basic properties of sheaves of logarithmic differential forms, Poincaré
residues and currents, and describe Kodaira and de Rham’s Hodge Theorem in
the sense of currents. In Section 2, we will prove main Theorems 0.1 and 0.2.
We present the applications of two main theorems mentioned above to algebraic
geometry and logarithmic deformation unobstructedness theorems in Sections
3 and 4, respectively.

1. Logarithmic forms and currents
In this section, we introduce some basic facts and notations on the sheaf of
logarithmic forms, Poincaré residue and currents, to be used throughout this
paper. For more details, one may refer to [10, 13, 18, 24, 26, 33].
Let (X, ω) be a compact Kähler manifold of dimension n, and let D be a
P
simple normal crossing divisor on it, i.e., D = ri=1 Di , where the Di are distinct
smooth hypersurfaces intersecting transversely in X.
Denote by τ : Y = X − D → X the natural inclusion and
ΩpX (∗D) = lim
ΩpX (ν · D) = τ∗ ΩpY .
→
ν

Then

(Ω•X (∗D), d)

is a complex. The sheaf of logarithmic forms
ΩpX (log D)

(introduced by Deligne in [6]) is defined as the subsheaf of ΩpX (∗D) with logarithmic poles along D, i.e., for any open subset V ⊂ X,
Γ(V, ΩpX (log D)) = {α ∈ Γ(V, ΩpX (∗D)) : α and dα have simple poles along D}.

From ([7, II, 3.1-3.7] or [13, Properties 2.2]), the log complex (Ω•X (log D), d) is
a subcomplex of (Ω•X (∗D), d) and ΩpX (log D) is locally free,
ΩpX (log D) = ∧p Ω1X (log D).
For any z ∈ X, which k of these Di pass, we may choose local holomorphic
coordinates {z 1 , · · · , z n } in a small neighborhood U of z = (0, · · · , 0) such that
D ∩ U = {z 1 · · · z k = 0}
is the union of coordinates hyperplanes. Such a pair
(1.1)

(U, {z 1 , · · · , z n })

is called a logarithmic coordinate system [24, Definition 1]. Then ΩpX (log D) is
generated by the holomorphic forms and logarithmic differentials dz i /z i (i =
1, . . . , k), i.e.,

the space of smooth (0, q)-forms on X with values in ΩpX (log D), and call an
element of A0,q (X, ΩpX (log D)) a logarithmic (p, q)-form.
For any α ∈ A0,q (X, ΩpX (log D)), we can write

the natural inclusion, without loss of generality, we may assume that

From [33, (2.3)], one has

for any smooth (n − p, n − q − 1)-form β on X.
Recall that a current of bidegree (p, q) on a compact Kähler or generally
complex manifold X is a differential (p, q)-form with distribution coefficients.
We refer the readers to [10, Chapter I.2 and Chapter III] for a comprehensive
introduction to current theory. The space of currents of bidegree (p, q) over X
will be denoted by D′p,q (X) and it is topologically dual to the space An−p,n−q (X)
of smooth differential forms of bidegree (n − p, n − q). There are two classical
examples concerning currents, which are very useful later.
Example 1.1.
(1) Let S ⊂ X be a closed p-dimensional complex submanifold with the canonical orientation. Then the integral over S gives a
(p, p)-bidimensional current, denoted by TS , as
Z
TS (α) =
α, α ∈ Ap,p (X)
S

since each (r, s)-form of total degree r + s = 2p has zero restriction to Z
unless (r, s) = (p, p).

(2) For any complex differential (p, q)-form α with L1loc coefficients on X,
there is a current Tα associated with α, such that for any continuous
(n − p, n − q)-form β on X
Z
Tα (β) =
α ∧ β.

By Example 1.1, we denote by TResDi (α) the current on Di associated with
ResDi (α), and then rewrite (1.5) as
r
X
(1.6)
Res(α)(β) =
TResDi (α) (ι∗Di (β)).
i=1

For any (p, q)-current T , the exterior derivative dT and the adjoint ∗T are
defined by (cf. [26])
(dT )(α) = (−1)p+q+1 T (dα),

(∗T )(α) = (−1)p+q T (∗α),

where the star operator ∗ is defined by

ωn
n!
for any smooth (p, q)-forms α, β, and the inner h·, ·i is induced by ω on the space
Ap,q (X) of (p, q)-forms.
Set d∗ = − ∗ d∗, ∆ = dd∗ + d∗ d. Then:
α ∧ ∗β = hα, βi

Theorem 1.2 ([11]). There exists one (and only one) linear operator G mapping
any (p, q)-current T into a (p, q)-current GT which has the following properties:
∆GT = G∆T = T − HT,

HGT = GHT = 0,

where H is the harmonic projection, defined by

From the definitions of ∆ and H, one obtains
(1.7)

(∆T )(α) = T (∆α),

(HT )(α) = T (Hα)

for any α ∈ An−p,n−q (X). By Theorem 1.2, we have

(GT )(α) = (GT )(∆Gα + Hα) = (∆GT )(Gα) = T (Gα).

(1.9)

(∂ ∗ T )(α) = (−1)p+q T (∂ ∗ α),

(∂¯∗ T )(α) = (−1)p+q T (∂¯∗ α)

for any smooth α. Setting ∆′ = ∂ ∗ ∂ + ∂∂ ∗ and ∆′′ = ∂¯∗ ∂¯ + ∂¯∂¯∗ , one deduces
from (1.8) and (1.9) that
(1.10)

(∆′ T )(α) = T (∆′ α),

(∆′′ T )(α) = T (∆′′ α).

Under the logarithmic coordinate system (1.1), one may assume that Di =

where the last equality holds since the degree of ResDi (α) ∧ ι∗Di (β) is (n − 2, n),

These calculations are inspired by [33, Formula (2.2)].
Let
Ep
be the holomorphic vector bundle on X associated with the locally free sheaf
ΩpX (log D). Then there exists an isomorphism I between the spaces of logarithmic (p, q)-forms and E p -valued (0, q)-forms,
I : A0,q (X, ΩpX (log D)) → A0,q (X, E p ),

(2.4)
and its dual map
(2.5)

I∗ : An,n−q (X, (E p )∗ ) → An,n−q (X, TXp (− log D)) ⊂ An−p,n−q (X),

where TXp (− log D) is the logarithmic tangent sheaf which is the dual sheaf of
ΩpX (log D) (cf. [36]). And we will identify an element of An,n−q (X, TXp (− log D))
with an (n − p, n − q)-form by contraction of the (n, n − q)-form with the
TXp (− log D)-valued coefficient, see (2.6) for precise definition.
By the construction (2.5) of I∗ , we have
Lemma 2.1. For any β ∈ An,n−p (X, (E p )∗ ), one has
ι∗Di I∗ (β) = 0, i = 1, · · · , r.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that Di ∩ U = {z i = 0} for
some small open set U ⊂ X. By the definition of I∗ , I∗ (β) contains either z i or
dz i . Since ι∗Di z i = 0 and ι∗Di (dz i ) = d(ι∗Di z i ) = 0, ι∗Di I∗ (β) = 0.

The two mappings I and I∗ in (2.4) and (2.5) are related by:
Lemma 2.2. For any α ∈ A0,q (X, ΩpX (log D)) and β ∈ An,n−q (X, (E p )∗ ), one
has
Z
Tα (I∗ (β)) =

I(α)(β),

X

where I(α)(β) is an (n, n)-form, obtained by pairing the values of I(α) with β.

3. Applications to algebraic geometry
In this section, we will give three kinds of applications of Theorems 2.5 and
2.6 to algebraic geometry. Throughout this section, let D be a simple normal
crossing divisor on a compact Kähler manifold X.
3.1. Closedness of logarithmic forms. Theory of logarithmic forms has been
playing very important roles in various aspects of analytic-algebraic geometry,
in which the understanding of closedness of logarithmic forms is fundamental.
In 1971, Deligne [8, (3.2.14)] proved the d-closedness of logarithmic forms on
a smooth complex quasi-projective variety by showing the degeneracy of logarithmic Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence, which is also to be studied in
the next subsection. In fact, his proof works for a Zariski open subspace of a
compact Kähler manifold. In 1995, by using classical harmonic integral theory
[11, 26] by de Rham and Kodaira, Noguchi [33] gave a short proof to this result.
As the first application of Theorem 2.5, we generalize Deligne’s result on the
closeness of logarithmic forms [8], compared with the one in [33].
¯ = 0, ∂α = 0.
Corollary 3.1. For any α ∈ A0,0 (X, ΩpX (log D)) with ∂∂α
Proof. By Theorem 2.5, there exists a solution
x ∈ A0,−1 (X, ΩpX (log D)) = {0}

¯ = ∂α and then
such that ∂x

¯ =0
∂α = ∂x
since x = 0.



3.2. Degeneracy of spectral sequences. As the second application of Theorems 2.5 and 2.6, we reprove Deligne’s degeneracy of the logarithmic Hodge
to de Rham spectral sequence at E1 [8] and also its dual version on a compact
Kähler manifold, respectively.
Two nice references for spectral sequences should be [18, 42]. Let (X, D) be
as above and U = X − D. One can show
(3.1)

H k (U, C) = Hk (X, Ω∗X (log D))

as [42, Corollary 8.19] or [18, p. 453]. The complex Ω∗X (log D) is equipped with
the ”naive” filtration, which induces a filtration on H k (U, C), called the Hodge
filtration of H k (U, C):
k
∗
F p H k (U, C) = Im(Hk (X, Ω≥p
X (log D)) → H (X, ΩX (log D))).

As for the holomorphic de Rham complex, the spectral sequence associated to
the Hodge filtration on Ω∗X (log D) has first term equal to
E1p,q = H q (X, ΩpX (log D)),
where the differential is induced by ∂.
Theorem 3.2. The spectral sequence associated with the Hodge filtration
E1p,q = H q (X, ΩpX (log D)) ⇒ Hp+q (X, Ω∗X (log D))
degenerates at the E1 -level.

the terms in the Frölicher spectral sequence as in [5, Theorems 1 and 3]. By

From the Theorem 3.2 and (3.1), one has a non-canonical logarithmic Hodge
decomposition.

crossing divisor on X. Then

Similar to Theorem 3.2, one can use Theorem 2.6 to prove a dual version of
Theorem 3.2 on compact Kähler manifolds.
Corollary 3.4. The spectral sequence associated with the Hodge filtration
E1p,q = H q (X, ΩpX (log D) ⊗ OX (−D)) ⇒ Hp+q (X, Ω∗X (log D) ⊗ OX (−D))
degenerates at E1 -level.

degenerates at E1 -level.

Remark 3.5. If X is a proper smooth algebraic variety over C, a proof of the
above result was given by O. Fujino in [14, Section 2.29]. The duality between
Theorem 3.2 and Corollary 3.4 was pointed out in [16, Remark 2.11].
3.3. Injectivity theorem. The third result of Theorem 0.1 is an injectivity
theorem for compact Kähler manifolds, whose algebraic version was first proved
by F. Ambro [1, Theorem 2.1].
Corollary 3.6. Let X be a compact Kähler manifold and D a simple normal
crossing divisor. Then the restriction homomorphism
i

Supp(∆) ⊂ Supp(D), then the natural homomorphism induced by the inclusion
OX ⊂ OX (∆)
i′

→ H q (X, ΩnX (log D) ⊗ OX (∆))
H q (X, ΩnX (log D)) −
is injective.

For any element [α] ∈ H q (X, ΩnX (log D)),
j1 ([α]) = [α]d ∈ H q+n (X, Ω•X (log D)).

If j1 ([α]) = 0, i.e., [α]d = 0, there exists a logarithmic form β ∈ Aq+n−1 (X, Ω•X (log D))

4. Applications to logarithmic deformations
We will present three applications of Theorems 2.5 and 2.6 to logarithmic
deformations in this section. Throughout this section, we assume that X is a
compact Kähler manifold and D is a simple normal crossing divisor on X.
Firstly, we recall basic notions and properties of logarithmic deformations in
[24].
Definition 4.1 ([24]). A family of logarithmic deformations of a pair (X, D) is
a 7-tuple F = (X , X¯ , D̄, π̄, S, s0 , ψ̄) satisfying the following conditions:
(1) π̄ : X¯ → S is a proper smooth morphism of complex space X¯ and S.
(2) D̄ is a closed analytic subset of X¯ and X = X¯ − D̄.
(3) ψ̄ : X → π̄ −1 (s0 ) is an isomorphism such that ψ̄(X − D) = π̄ −1 (s0 ) ∩ X .
(4) π̄ is locally a projection of a product space as well as the restriction
of it to D̄, that is, for each p ∈ X¯ there exist an open neighborhood
U of p and an isomorphism µ : U → V × W , where V = π̄(U) and
W = U ∩ π̄ −1 (π̄(p)), such that the following diagram

commutes and µ(U ∩ D̄) = V × (W ∩ D̄).

22

Kefeng Liu, Sheng Rao, and Xueyuan Wan

Moreover, a family F = (X , X¯ , D̄, π̄, S, s0 , ψ̄) of pair (X, D) is called semiuniversal (cf. [24, Definition 5]) if for any family F ′ = (X ′ , X¯ ′ , D̄ ′ , π̄ ′ , S ′, s′0 , ψ̄ ′ )
of logarithmic deformations of (X, D) there exist an open neighborhood S ′′ of
s′0 in S ′ and a morphism α : S ′′ → S such that
1) The restriction F ′ |S ′′ of F ′ over S ′′ is isomorphic to the induced family
α∗ F ,
2) For any S0′′ and α0 satisfying the same condition as in 1), the induced
tangential maps Tα and Tα0 from TS ′ ,s′0 to TS,s0 coincide.

In [24, Theorem 1], Y. Kawamata proved the following Kuranishi type theorem, whose proof also plays an important role in constructing extension of
logarithmic forms.
Theorem 4.2 ([24]). There exists a semi-universal family F of logarithmic
deformations of the pair (X, D).
Let TX (− log D) be the dual sheaf of Ω1X (log D). Then the set of infinitesimal
logarithmic deformations is H 1 (X, TX (− log D)) (cf. [19]). Moreover, as shown
on [24, p. 251], the semi-universal family F in Theorem 4.2 can be obtained
from a subspace of
Γreal analytic (X, TX (− log D) ⊗ Λ0,1 T ∗ X),
which, usually called Beltrami differentials, satisfies the integrability condition:
¯ = 1 [ϕ, ϕ].
(4.1)

4.1. Extension of logarithmic forms. In this subsection, we consider the ex¯
tension problem of ∂-closed
logarithmic (n, q)-form under the logarithmic deformations on a Kähler manifold and obtain the local stabilities of log Calabi-Yau
structures. For the case of smooth (n, q)-form, a good reference is [41].
Let F = (Xt , Dt ), t ∈ S be a family of logarithmic deformations of pair
¯
(X, D). For any ∂-closed
(n, q)-logarithmic form Ω ∈ A0,q (X, ΩnX (log D)), we
want to extend this form Ω to ∪t∈∆ Xt smoothly for some small neighborhood
¯
∆ ⊂ S of the reference point s0 ∈ S, and thus get a ∂-closed
logarithmic
(n, q)-form when restricted to each Xt , t ∈ ∆.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that F = (Xt , Dt ), t ∈ S is a semiuniversal family. In fact, if we assume Ωt , t ∈ ∆ ⊂ S is a smooth extension of
Ω on the semi-universal family F |∆ = (Xt , Dt ), t ∈ ∆, and assume that F ′ =
(Xt′ , Dt′ ), t ∈ S ′ is another family of logarithmic deformation of pair (X, D). By
the definition of semi-universal family, there exist an open neighborhood ∆′ of
¯
s′0 and a morphism α : ∆′ → S, and thus α∗ Ωt gives a ∂-closed
extension of Ω
′

−1
on the family F |α−1 (∆∩α(∆′ )) = (Xt , Dt ), t ∈ α (∆ ∩ α(∆′ )). Similar reduction
to this can be found in [35, Subsection 2.3] and the beginning of [34, Section 2].
Let
ϕ := ϕ(t) ∈ Γreal analytic (X, TX (− log D) ⊗ Λ0,1 T ∗ X) ⊂ A0,1 (X, TX (− log D))
be the Beltrami differential, which satisfies the integrability condition (4.1) and
gives the semi-universal family F = (Xt , Dt ), t ∈ S.

By a direct calculation, the contraction map
ϕy := iϕ : A0,q (X, ΩpX (log D)) → A0,q+1 (X, Ωp−1
X (log D))
is well-defined. As in [29, 35], one may define the operator
iϕ

e

1 k
i ,
:=
k! ϕ
k=0

where ikϕ = iϕ ◦ · · · ◦ iϕ . Notice that the above summation should be finite due
| {z }
k

to the dimension assumption.

Proposition 4.3. With the above setting, the operator
eiϕ : A0,q (X, ΩnX (log D)) → A0,q (Xt , ΩnXt (log Dt ))
is a linear isomorphism as |t − s0 | is small.
Proof. Since eiϕ : An,q (X) → An,q (Xt ) is a linear isomorphism as |t − s0 | is
small, it suffices to prove that eiϕ (α) has logarithmic poles along Dt for any
α ∈ A0,q (X, ΩnX (log D)).
Let X and D be the (union of) the underlying real analytic manifolds of
X and D. Choose any point p in X. Set ζ = ζ(z, t) as a local holomorphic
coordinate system of Xt around p induced by the family and
Rt (ζ(z, t)), t ∈ S
as a local defining function of Dt around p. By (the proof of) [24, Lemma 1],
since ϕ is logarithmic along D and thus D × S is analytic with respect to the
complex structure given by ϕ, there exists a real analytic function
ǫt (z)
around p parameterized by S such that ǫs0 (z) 6= 0 and
Rs0 (ζ(z, s0 ))ǫt (z)
is a local holomorphic function with respect to the complex structure given by ϕ
on Xt . As Rs0 (ζ(z, s0 ))ǫt (z) vanishes on the union D of underlying real analytic
manifolds, there exists some local holomorphic function h(ζ, t) on Xt such that
(4.2)

Rs0 (ζ(z, s0 ))ǫt (z) = h(ζ, t)Rt (ζ(z, t)).

Since h(ζ, s0) = ǫs0 (z) 6= 0 on a (possibly smaller) neighborhood of p by [10,
Theorem 6.6 of Chapter II], h(ζ, t) has no zero points around p as |t − s0 | is
small. From (4.2), one has
(4.3)

ǫt (z)
Rt (ζ(z, t))
=
,
Rs0 (ζ(z, s0 ))
h(ζ, t)

which is smooth and has no zero points around p and s0 .
Now any α ∈ A0,q (X, ΩnX (log D)) is locally written as
α1
α=
Rs0 (ζ(z, s0 ))

lies in A0,q (Xt , ΩnXt (log Dt )) by (4.3) and that eiϕ (α1 ) is a local smooth (n, q)form on Xt .

Without loss of generality, we may assume that S = ∆ is a small disc and
¯
s0 = 0. Let Ω ∈ A0,q (X, Ωn (log D)) be a ∂-closed
logarithmic (n, q)-form on X.
¯
In order to find a smooth ∂-closed extension of Ω, we only need to find a real
analytic Ω(t) ∈ A0,q (X, Ωn (log D)) such that
(4.4)

∂¯t (eiϕ (Ω(t))) = 0,

Ω(0) = Ω,

¯
where ∂¯t denotes the ∂-operator
with respect to the complex structure of Xt .
iϕ
By Proposition 4.3, e (Ω(t)) ∈ A0,q (Xt , Ωnt (log Dt )) is a smooth extension of Ω
¯
with (eiϕ (Ω(t)))(0) = Ω and thus the difficulty here lies in ∂-closedness
of (4.4).
From [29, Proposition 5.1] or [34, (2.14)], (4.4) is equivalent to
(4.5)

¯
∂Ω(t)
+ ∂(ϕyΩ(t)) = 0,

Ω(0) = 0.

We shall solve the equation (4.5) by an iteration method originally from [30]
and developed in [29, 43, 44, 35, 34]. To study the equation (4.5), we need a
logarithmic analogue of the Tian-Todorov lemma [39, 40].
Lemma 4.4. For any ϕ, ψ ∈ A0,1 (X, TX (− log D)) and Ω ∈ A0,q (X, ΩnX (log D)),
we have
[ϕ, ψ]yΩ = −∂(ψy(ϕyΩ)) + ψy∂(ϕyΩ) + ϕy∂(ψyΩ).
Proof. Comparing this formula with [28, Proposition 3.2], one just needs to
notice that this is a local formula from direct local computations, and for each

= −∂iϕ Ω(t) − ∂¯∗ G∂iϕ (∂¯ + ∂iϕ )Ω(t).

Therefore,
(I + ∂¯∗ G∂iϕ )(∂¯ + ∂iϕ )Ω(t) = 0.
By the invertibility of the operator I + ∂¯∗ G∂iϕ , one has
(∂¯ + ∂iϕ )Ω(t) = 0.
A pair (X, D) is called a log Calabi-Yau pair if the logarithmic canonical line
bundle ΩnX (log D) ∼
= OX (KX + D) is trivial. By Theorem 4.5, one has
Corollary 4.7. The log Calabi-Yau structure is locally stable, i.e., if the reference pair (X, D) is a log Calabi-Yau pair, then there exists a small neighborhood
∆ ⊂ S of the reference point such that (Xt , Dt ), t ∈ ∆ is also a log Calabi-Yau
pair for any family of logarithmic deformations F = (Xt , Dt ), t ∈ S.
Proof. By the definition of log Calabi-Yau structure, let I(Ω) be the trivial
section of KX ⊗ [D], i.e., there are no zero points for the holomorphic section
I(Ω) ∈ H 0 (X, KX ⊗ [D]). By Theorem 4.5, the section
I(eiϕ (Ω(t))) ∈ H 0 (Xt , KXt ⊗ [Dt ])
also has no zero points for small t. Thus, (Xt , Dt ) is a log Calabi-Yau pair. 
Denoting the logarithmic Hodge numbers by hp,q (X, D) := dimC H q (X, ΩpX (log D)),
we have the invariance of logarithmic Hodge numbers under small logarithmic
deformations.
Corollary 4.8. The logarithmic Hodge numbers hp,q (Xt , Dt ) are invariant under small logarithmic deformations.

In the next two subsections, we will use Theorems 2.5 and 2.6 to prove two
logarithmic deformation unobstructedness theorems by Katzarkov-KontsevichPantev [23] and Iacono [21] on Kähler manifolds. Our differential geometric
proofs are quite different from theirs and have interesting applications to extension problems.
4.2. Deformations of log Calabi-Yau pairs. In this subsection, we will
prove that the logarithmic deformation of a log Calabi-Yau pair is unobstructed
by a purely differential geometric method. Recall that (X, D) is a log CalabiYau pair if X is a compact Kähler manifold and D is a simple normal crossing
divisor with trivial ΩnX (log D) = KX ⊗[D]. For any [ϕ1 ] ∈ H 0,1 (X, TX (− log D))
0,1
and any t in a small ǫ-disk Dǫ of 0 in CdimC H (X,TX (− log D)) , we try to construct
a holomorphic family
ϕ := ϕ(t) ∈ A0,1 (X, TX (− log D))
satisfying the following integrability and initial conditions:
¯ = 1 [ϕ, ϕ], ∂ϕ (0) = ϕ1 .

To solve the above equation, we need:

Lemma 4.9. Let Ω′ ∈ A0,0 (X, ΩnX (log D)) be a logarithmic (n, 0)-form without
zero points. Then

is an isomorphism, whose inverse, defined by (4.18), is

Proof. Locally, we may assume that D = {z 1 · · · z k = 0} and write Ω′ as
dz 1 ∧ · · · ∧ dz n

z1 · · · zk
where u is a smooth function on X and admits no zero points. Any element ϕ

Since ΩnX (log D) is trivial, one may take a holomorphic logarithmic (n, 0)-form
Ω without zero points.
Proposition 4.10. If there are two smooth families
ϕ(t) ∈ A0,1 (X, TX (− log D))
and
Ω(t) ∈ A0,0 (X, ΩnX (log D))

satisfying the system of equations

then ϕ(t) satisfies (4.15) for sufficiently small t.

Since Ω(t) is smooth and Ω(0) = Ω0 = Ω, Ω(t) ∈ A0,0 (X, ΩnX (log D)) also has
no zero points for small t. One has from Lemma 4.9


To study the system of equations (4.19), we need a logarithmic analogue of
[29, Lemma 4.2].
Lemma 4.11. Assume that for ϕν ∈ A0,1 (X, TX (− log D)), ν = 2, . . . , K,
X

Proof. The local calculation is exactly the same as that in the proof of [29,
Lemma 4.2] since one can regard TX (− log D) as a subbundle of TX .

Now we will solve the system of equations (4.19) by mixing the methods
originally from [39, 40, 30] and developed in [29, 43, 44, 35, 34].
Firstly, we denote (4.19)k by the system of equations of the first equation in
(4.19) with the (k + 1)-th degree equal to 0 and the second equation in (4.19)
with the k-th degree equal to 0.
For k = 1, the equation (4.19)k=1 is
(

∂(i

Thus, one can take

Ω1 = I−1 ∂¯E∗ G′′E I(−∂ ◦ iϕ1 Ω0 ) ∈ A0,0 (X, ΩnX (log D))

and from Lemma 4.9, one can find ϕ2 ∈ A0,1 (X, TX (− log D)) satisfying

By induction, we may assume that the equation (4.19) is solved for k ≤ l and
we have constructed Ωi , 0 ≤ i ≤ l and ϕi , 1 ≤ i ≤ l + 1. So from (4.20), we have

In one word, we have constructed Ωi ∈ A0,0 (X, ΩnX (log D)), 0 ≤ i ≤ l + 1 and
ϕi ∈ A0,1 (X, TX (− log D)), 1 ≤ i ≤ l + 2, which satisfying (4.19)l+1 . So we can
solve (4.19) inductively for small t.
Now we prove the convergence of ϕ(t) and Ω(t) under C k,α -norm. As in [32,
p. 50], we may consider the power series

which satisfies

Fix an integer k ≥ 2 and a real constant α ∈ (0, 1). Suppose that they are
chosen so that kϕi kk,α ≤ ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ l + 1, and kΩi kk,α ≤ (c/b)1/2 ai for
1 ≤ i ≤ l. From (4.23), it follows that

Finally we come to the regularity argument of ϕ := ϕ(t), which is a little
more difficult than that in [34, Subsection 3.2] since one has to consider the

(4.23), one has

Since ϕ and Ω(t) are convergent under C k,α norm,

For the second equation of (4.28), one has
(4.30)

∂¯E∗ I(iϕ Ω(t)) = ∂¯E∗ I(iϕ1 Ω0 ).

Noticing that [∂¯E∗ , I∂I−1 ] is an operator of first order and (4.30), we have
k∂¯E∗ I∂iϕ Ω(t)kk−1,α = k[∂¯E∗ , I∂I−1 ]I(iϕ Ω(t)) − I∂I−1 ∂¯E∗ I(iϕ Ω(t))kk−1,α

By the first equation of (4.28), one gets kI(Ω(t))kk+1,α < C. By the expression

as a linear operator of second order in terms of I(iϕ Ω(t)) with C k−1,α -coefficients.
By (4.32) and ϕ(0) = 0, the second equation of (4.28) can be viewed as a linear
elliptic equation with C k−1,α-coefficients when t is small enough. From [17,
Theorem 6.17], it follows that
(4.33)

kI(iϕ Ω(t))kk+1,α < C.

By repeating the processes from (4.29) to (4.33), one gets the smoothness of
I(Ω(t)), I(iϕ Ω(t)) and thus those of Ω(t) and iϕ Ω(t). So
ϕ(t) = Ω(t)∗ y(iϕ Ω(t))
is smooth on X × {|t| < ǫ} for some 0 < ǫ < c inductively.
In conclusions, we get

4.3. Logarithmic deformations on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Let X be a
Calabi-Yau manifold, i.e., an n-dimensional Kähler manifold admitting a nowhere
vanishing holomorphic (n, 0)-form, and D a simple normal crossing divisor on
it. It is well-known that the deformations of a Calabi-Yau manifold are unobstructed, by the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem, due to F. Bogomolov [4],
G. Tian [39] and A. Todorov [40]. In this subsection, we prove that the logarithmic deformation of a pair on a Calabi-Yau manifold is unobstructed by
an analogous method to Theorem 4.12 by constructing a family of integrable
logarithmic Beltrami differentials on a small disk.
Theorem 4.13. With the above setting, the pair (X, D) has unobstructed logarithmic deformations.
Proof. Since there is a holomorphic (n, 0)-form Ω without zero points on X, any
(n, 0)-form Ω(t) of X smoothly depending on t with Ω(0) = Ω still admits no
zero points for small t. As reasoned in Lemma 4.9, there holds the isomorphism
•yΩ(t) : A0,1 (X, TX (− log D)) → An,1 (X, TX (− log D)) ⊂ An−1,1 (X)
with its inverse
Ω(t)∗ y : An,1 (X, TX (− log D)) → A0,1 (X, TX (− log D)).
By the same argument as in Proposition 4.10, one only needs to solve the system
of equations
(
(∂¯ + 21 ∂ ◦ iϕ )(iϕ Ω(t)) = 0,
(∂¯ + ∂ ◦ iϕ )Ω(t) = 0.

By the same argument as the log Calabi-Yau pair and Theorem 2.6, for any
[ϕ1 ] ∈ H 0,1 (X, TX (− log D)),
we can construct a holomorphic family
ϕ(t) ∈ A0,1 (X, TX (− log D))
0,1

on a small ǫ-disk of 0 in CdimC H (X,TX (− log D)) , satisfying the integrability and
initial conditions:
