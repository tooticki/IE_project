TRIMMING A GORENSTEIN IDEAL
LARS WINTHER CHRISTENSEN, OANA VELICHE, AND JERZY WEYMAN
Abstract. Let Q be a regular local ring of dimension 3. We show how to trim
a Gorenstein ideal in Q to obtain an ideal that defines a quotient ring that is
close to Gorenstein in the sense that its Koszul homology algebra is a Poincaré
duality algebra P padded with a non-zero graded vector space on which P≥1
acts trivially. We explicitly construct an infinite family of such rings.

1. Introduction
Let Q be a regular local ring with maximal ideal n. Quotient rings of Q that
have projective dimension at most 3 as Q-modules have been classified based on
the multiplicative structure of their Koszul homology algebras. To be precise, let
a ⊆ n2 be an ideal such that the minimal free resolution of R = Q/a over Q has
length at most 3. By a result of Buchsbaum and Eisenbud [4], the resolution carries
a structure of an associative differential graded commutative algebra, and based
on that structure Avramov, Kustin, and Miller [3] and Weyman [9] established a
classification in terms of the induced multiplicative structure on TorQ
∗ (R, k), where k
is the residue field of Q. Finally, as graded k-algebras, the Koszul homology algebra
of R and TorQ
∗ (R, k) are isomorphic; see Avramov [1] for an in-depth treatment.
An ideal a ⊂ Q is called Gorenstein if the quotient R = Q/a is a Gorenstein ring.
By a classic result of Avramov and Golod [2], a Gorenstein ring is characterized by
the fact that its Koszul homology algebra A = H(K R ) has Poincaré duality. In the
classification mentioned above, a Gorenstein ring that is not complete intersection
belongs to a parametrized family G(r), where r is the rank of the canonical map
δ : A2 −→ Homk (A1 , A3 ) ;
see [1, 1.4.2]. It was conjectured in [1] that all rings of class G(r) are Gorenstein,
but Christensen and Veliche [5] gave sporadic examples of rings of class G(r) that
are not Gorenstein. In this paper we present a systematic construction and achieve:
(1.1) Theorem. Let Q be the power series algebra in three variables over a field.
For every r ≥ 3 there is quotient ring of Q that is of class G(r) and not Gorenstein.
The quotient rings in Theorem (1.1) are obtained as follows: Let n be the maximal ideal of Q and start with a graded Gorenstein ideal g ⊆ n2 generated by 2m + 1

elements. Trim g by replacing one minimal generator g by ng; this removes a 1dimensional subspace from g. The quotient of Q by the resulting ideal is a ring
of type 2; in particular, it is not Gorenstein, and for m ≥ 3 it is of class G(r).
Theorem (1.1) is consequence of Proposition (3.5), which builds on a more general
but slightly less precise statement about local rings, Theorem (2.4).
2. Local rings
Let Q be a d-dimensional regular local ring with maximal ideal n and residue field
k. For an ideal a in Q, we denote by µ(a) the minimal number of generators of a.
Let a ⊆ n2 be an ideal and set R = Q/a. We denote by K R the Koszul complex on a
minimal set of generators for the maximal ideal n/a of R; one has K R = R ⊗Q K Q .
The Koszul complex is an exterior algebra, and the homology algebra A = H(K R )
is a graded-commutative k-algebra. Denote by c the projective dimension of R as
a Q-module; by the Auslander–Buchsbaum Formula and depth sensitivity of the
Koszul complex one has c = max{i | Ai 6= 0}. The number rankk (Ac ) is called the
type of R. If the ideal a is n-primary, then one has c = d and the type of R is the
socle rank, i.e. type(R) = rankk (0 :R n/a).
(2.1) Classification. Let Q be as above, and let a ⊆ n2 be an ideal such that
R = Q/a has projective dimension 3 as a Q-module. The possible multiplicative
structures on the graded-commutative k-algebra A = H(K R ) ∼
= TorQ
∗ (R, k) were
identified in [3]. By assumption one has A≥4 = 0, and the possible structures are
described by the invariants
δ

p = rankk (A1 · A1 ) , q = rankk (A1 · A2 ) , and r = rankk (A2 −→ Homk (A1 , A3 )) .
From [1, thm. 3.1] one extracts the following description of all the possible classes
of rings that are not Gorenstein.

In [3] the multiplication tables for the different structures are given. In particular,
if R = Q/a is a ring of class G(r), then with m = µ(a) and t = type(R) there exist
bases for A1 , A2 , and A3 :
e1 , . . . , em ,

f1 , . . . , fm+t−1 ,

and g1 , . . . , gt

such that the only non-zero products are ei fi = g1 = −fi ei for 1 ≤ i ≤ r. That is,
the subalgebra P of A spanned by 1, e1 , . . . , er , f1 , . . . , fr , and g1 is a pure Poincaré
duality algebra, in the sense that the only non-trivial products are those from the
perfect pairing. Moreover, P≥1 acts trivially on the rest of A.
The next result is proved in [6]; the argument is based on linkage theory and
cannot be reproduced here without significant overhead.
(2.2) Proposition. Let (Q, n) be a regular local ring and let a ⊆ n2 be a perfect
ideal of grade 3 that is minimally generated by 5 elements and not Gorenstein. If,
with the notation above, the ring Q/a has p = 0, then it has r ≤ 1.

(2.3) Lemma. Let (Q, n) be a regular local ring and consider an n-primary ideal
g ⊆ n2 , minimally generated by elements g0 , . . . , gk . Let s1 , . . . , st be elements of Q
whose classes in Q/g form a basis for the socle. The ideal a = ng0 + (g1 , . . . , gk ) is
n-primary, and if nsi ⊆ a holds for all i = 1, . . . , t, then the classes of g0 , s1 , . . . , st
in Q/a form a basis for the socle; in particular one has type(Q/a) = type(Q/g) + 1.
Proof. As g is n-primary, it follows from the containment ng ⊆ a that a is nprimary. Consider the rings R = Q/a and S = Q/g; there is an exact sequence
0 −→ g/a −→ R −→ S −→ 0 ,
and an isomorphism of Q-modules g/a ∼
= k, where k is the residue field of Q.
Tensoring with the Koszul complex K Q one gets an exact sequence of Q-complexes,

Let d be the dimension of Q. From the sequence in homology associated to (∗) one
gets the following exact sequence
Hd (α)

Hd (β)

0 −→ k −−−−−→ Hd (K R ) −−−−→ Hd (K S ) .
The rings R and S are artinian, and a rank count yields
type(R) = rankk (Hd (K R )) ≤ rankk (Hd (K S )) + 1 = type(S) + 1 .
It is clear that the residue classes [g0 ] and [s1 ], . . . , [st ] in R are non-zero socle elements. Moreover, they are k-linearly independent: Indeed, the elements
[s1 ], . . . , [st ] are k-linearly independent, because of the inclusion a ⊂ g. Further,
Pt
suppose one has [g0 ] = i=1 [ui ][si ] where the elements ui are units in Q. It follows
Pt
Pt
that g0 − i=1 ui si is in a ⊆ g, and as g0 ∈ g one gets i=1 ui si ∈ g, a contradiction.
Thus, there are t + 1 k-linearly independent elements in the socle of R.

For the next result, recall from work of J. Watanabe [8] that a grade 3 Gorenstein
ideal in a regular ring is minimally generated by an odd number of elements.
(2.4) Theorem. Let (Q, n) be a regular local ring of dimension 3 and let g ⊆ n2 be
an n-primary Gorenstein ideal minimally generated by elements g0 , . . . , g2m . The
ideal a = ng0 + (g1 , . . . , g2m ) is n-primary, one has type(Q/a) = 2 and:
(a) If m = 1, then µ(a) = 5 and Q/a is of class B.
(b) If m = 2, then one of the following holds:
• µ(a) = 4 and Q/a is of class H(3, 2).
• µ(a) = 5 and Q/a is of class B.
• µ(a) ∈ {6, 7} and Q/a is of class G(r) with µ(a) − 2 ≥ r ≥ µ(a) − 3.
(c) If m ≥ 3, then Q/a is of class G(r) with µ(a) − 2 ≥ r ≥ µ(a) − 3.
Proof. As g defines a Gorenstein ring, one has g : (g : b) = b for every ideal b in
Q that contains g. Let s ∈ Q be a representative of the socle of Q/g; in Q one has
g ⊆ (a : n) ⊆ (g : n) = g + (s) .
Forming colon ideals one gets g : (a : n) ⊇ g : (g : n) = n and hence g : (a : n) = n.
Forming colon ideals a second time now yields (a : n) = (g : n) = g + (s); in
particular, one has ns ⊆ a, so it follows from Lemma (2.3) that a is n-primary and
R = Q/a has type 2; in particular, R is not Gorenstein.

The rank of δA is at least the rank of ε = Homk (A1 , H3 (β)) ◦ δA . The rank of ε
is at least (µ(a) − 2) − 1 as δG is an isomorphism, see [1, 1.4.2], and the kernel of
Homk (H1 (β), G3 ) has rank 1. Thus, one has r = rank(δA ) ≥ µ(a) − 3.
In case µ(a) ≥ 6, one has r ≥ 3, and since the type of R is 2, this implies that
R is of class G(r); see (2.1.1). This proves part (c) and the last case of part (b).
For m = 2 one has 4 ≤ µ(a) ≤ 7. If µ(a) = 5 it follows from Proposition (2.2) and
(2.1.1) that R is of class B. If µ(a) = 4, then R is of class H(3, 2) by [1, 3.4.2.(a)].
Finally, part (a) is a result of Faucett [7].

3. A family of graded local rings of class G(r)
A grade 3 Gorenstein ideal of a local ring is by a result of Buchsbaum and Eisenbud
[4, thm. 2.1] minimally generated by the sub-maximal Pfaffians of a (2m + 1) ×
(2m + 1) skew-symmetric matrix. Thus, skew-symmetric matrices are a source of
Gorenstein rings and, via Theorem (2.4), also a source of rings of class G(r) that
are not Gorenstein. In this section, we construct an infinite family of such rings.
(3.1) Let k be a field and set Q = k[[x, y, z]]; let m be a positive integer.
Denote by Um the m × m matrix over Q whose ith row has entries
ui,m−i = x ,

ui,m−i+1 = z , and

ui,m−i+2 = y

and 0 elsewhere; set
d−1 = 0 ,

d0 = 1 ,

and dm = det(Um ) .

The sub-maximal Pfaffians of Vm are determined (up to a sign) by minors,

gm = (pf 1 (Vm ), . . . , pf 2m+1 (Vm )) .

(3.2) Lemma. In the notation from (3.1) the next equalities hold for every m ≥ 1.

Proof. Per (3.1.1) with i = 2, expansion of the determinant of Um along the first
row yields
dm = (−1)m x det((Um )1,m−1 ) + (−1)m+1 z det(Um−1 ) .
From (3.1.1) with i = 3 it follows that expansion along the last column yields
det((Um )1,m−1 ) = (−1)m y det(Um−2 ) .
Combining these two expressions, one gets the first equality. The second equality
now follows by induction.

Evidently, the ideal gm from (3.1.4) is contained in nm ; in fact, one has g1 = n.
One can check that, though the generating matrices are different, the family of
ideals {gm }m≥2 is the same as that provided by [4, prop. 6.2]. To understand what
happens when one trims these ideals, we provide a more detailed description.
(3.3) Proposition. Adopt the notation from (3.1) and let n denote the maximal
ideal of Q. For every m ≥ 2 the ideal gm ⊆ n2 is an n-primary Gorenstein ideal
minimally generated by the elements
xm−i di and y m−i di for 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 and dm .
The ring Q/gm has socle generated by the class of xm−1 y m−1 and Hilbert series

Proof. Per (3.1.3) the Pfaffians of V1 are, up to signs,
pf 1 (V1 ) = y = yd0 ,

pf 2 (V1 ) = z = d1 ,

and

pf 3 (V1 ) = x = xd0 .

For m ≥ 2 we argue that, up to signs, one has
pf i (Vm ) = y m−i+1 di−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m ,
pf m+1 (Vm ) = dm , and
pf 2m+2−i (Vm ) = xm−i+1 di−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m .
First notice that the equality pf m+1 (Vm ) = dm is immediate from (3.1.2). Further,
note that by symmetry in x and y it is sufficient to prove that pf i (Vm ) = y m−i+1 di−1
holds for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. To compute pf 1 (Vm ) notice that the matrix (Vm )11 is a
2m × 2m-matrix with ±y on the anti-diagonal and zeros below it. Thus, one has
pf 1 (Vm ) = y m = y m d0 . Now, for i in the range 2, . . . , m consider the matrix (Vm )ii
as 2 × 2 block matrix with blocks of size m × m,

Next, notice that Wi is obtained from Um by removing row i and adding a row y O
at the bottom. Thus, per (3.1.1) it has the form
"
#
Ox Ui−1
Wi =

Y
O

where Y is the matrix obtained from Um−i+1 by removing the first row and adding
a row y O at the bottom. In particular, it is a (m − i + 1) × (m − i + 1)-matrix
with ±y on the anti-diagonal and zeros below it. Thus, computing the determinant
of Wi by successive expansion on the last m − i + 1 rows one gets, up to a sign,
pf i (Vm ) = y m−i+1 di−1 . It follows that gm is generated by the listed elements.
The elements xm , y m , dm form a Q-regular sequence in gm , so it follows from [4,
thm. 2.1] that gm is a Gorenstein ideal minimally generated by the listed elements.
In particular, gm is n-primary. In fact, in this case it is elementary to see that the
generating set is minimal: Notice from Lemma (3.2) that di is a linear combination
of monomials of the form xj y j z i−2j . Hence, each generator xm−i di is a linear
combination of monomials of the form xm−i+j y j z i−2j while the generators y m−i di
are linear combinations of monomials xj y m−i+j z i−2j . Thus the generators are linear
combinations of disjoint sets of degree m monomials and hence linearly
i
P∞ independent.
The Hilbert series of the power series ring Q is HilbQ (t) = i=0 i+2
2 t . Since
gm is Gorenstein and minimally generated by 2m + 1 elements of degree m, the
Hilbert series of the ring Sm = Q/gm is symmetric and given by

In particular, the socle degree of Sm is 2m − 2. Evidently, one has (xm−1 y m−1 )n ⊆
gm , so it is sufficient to show that the element xm−1 y m−1 is not in gm , i.e. that
it yields a non-zero socle element in Sm . If it were in gm , then one would have
x(xm−2 y m−1 ) in gm along with xm−2 (y m d0 ) = y(xm−2 y m−1 ) and xm−2 (y m−1 d1 ) =
z(xm−2 y m−1 ). Thus, xm−2 y m−1 would yield a socle element in Sm of degree 2m −
3, whence it must be 0; i.e. one would have xm−2 y m−1 ∈ gm . Reiterating this
argument, one arrives at the conclusion that y m−1 is in gm , which is absurd as the
generators of gm have degree m.

Finally, we apply the trimming procedure from Theorem (2.4) to the ideals gm .

(3.4) Adopt the notation from (3.1). By Proposition (3.3) one has
g2 = (x2 , xz, xy − z 2 , yz, y 2 ) .
Trimming the generators xz and yz one gets the following ideals of Q,
(x, y, z)xz + (x2 , xy − z 2 , yz, y 2 ) = (x2 , xy − z 2 , yz, y 2 ) and
(x, y, z)yz + (x2 , xz, xy − z 2 , y 2 ) = (x2 , xz, xy − z 2 , y 2 ) .

8

L. W. CHRISTENSEN, O. VELICHE, AND J. WEYMAN

They are both minimally generated by 4 elements, so they define quotient rings of
class H(3, 2); see Theorem (2.4)(b). Moreover, one has
(x, y, z)x2 + (xz, xy − z 2 , yz, y 2) = (x3 , xz, xy − z 2 , yz, y 2) ,
(x, y, z)y 2 + (x2 , xz, xy − z 2 , yz) = (x2 , xz, xy − z 2 , yz, y 3) ,

and

(x, y, z)(xy − z 2 ) + (x2 , xz, yz, y 2) = (x2 , xz, z 3 , yz, y 2 ) ,
so by Theorem (2.4)(b) these ideals define rings of class B.
From the next result one immediately gets the statement of Theorem (1.1) about
existence of infinite families of rings of class G(r) that are not Gorenstein.
(3.5) Proposition. Adopt the notation from (3.1) and let n denote the maximal
ideal of Q. Let g be one of the generators of gm listed in (3.3), let b be the ideal
generated by the remaining 2m generators of gm , and set a = ng + b. For m ≥ 3
the ring R = Q/a has the following properties.
(a) R is an artinian local ring of type 2 with socle generated by the classes of the
elements g and xm−1 y m−1 .
(b) If g is xm−i di or y m−i di for some i ∈ {1, . . . , m − 1}, then a is minimally
generated by 2m elements and R is of class G(2m − 3).
(c) If g is xm , y m , or dm , then a is minimally generated by 2m + 1 elements and
R is of class G(2m − 2).
Proof. Fix m ≥ 3; for brevity the class in R or S = Q/gm of an element u in Q is
also written u.
Part (a) is immediate from Lemma (2.3). We prove parts (b) and (c) together.
First we describe the generators of a using the recurrence formula from Lemma (3.2).
For 1 ≤ i ≤ m one has
(1)

x(xm−i di ) = xm−(i−1) ((−1)i−1 zdi−1 + xydi−2 )
= (−1)i−1 z(xm−(i−1) di−1 ) + y(xm−(i−2) di−2 ) .

For 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 2 one has
y(xm−i di ) = xm−(i+1) (xydi )
(2)

= xm−(i+1) (di+2 − (−1)i+1 zdi+1 )
= x(xm−(i+2) di+2 ) + (−1)i z(xm−(i+1) di+1 ) and moreover
y(xdm−1 ) = x(ydm−1 ) .

For 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 one has
(3)

z(xm−i di ) = xm−i (−1)i (di+1 − xydi−1 )
= (−1)i x(xm−(i+1) di+1 ) − (−1)i y(xm−(i−1) di−1 ) .

For g = xm−i di with 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 it follows immediately from (1)–(3) that ng
is contained in b , so a = b is minimally generated by 2m elements. By symmetry
the same is true for g = y m−i di with 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1.
For g = xm one has yg ∈ b and zg ∈ b by (2) and (3), so a is generated by the
2m generators of b and xm+1 . To see that this is a minimal set of generators, note
that the generators of b have degree m and none of them includes the term xm .
The statement for g = y m follows by symmetry.

For g = dm one has xg ∈ b by (1) and yg ∈ b by symmetry. Thus a is generated
by the 2m generators of b and zdm . To see that this is a minimal set of generators,
note from Lemma (3.2) that zdm has a z m+1 term, while the generators of b have
degree m and none of them has a z m term.
To determine the multiplicative structure on A = H(K R ) we first describe a
basis for A1 . The Koszul complex K R is the exterior algebra of the free R-module
with basis {εx , εy , εz } endowed with the differential given by ∂(εx ) = x, ∂(εy ) = y,
and ∂(εz ) = z. We suppress the wedge in products on K R and adopt the following
shorthands
εxy = εx εy ,

εxz = εx εz ,

εyz = εy εz ,

and

εxyz = εx εy εz .

Because of the symmetry in x and y we only consider g = xm−i di . Given the
minimal generating set of a described above, one gets:
If g = xm then the following cycles in K1R yield a basis for A1
xm εx

and xm−j−1 dj εx for 1 ≤ j ≤ m − 1,
y m−j−1 dj εy for 0 ≤ j ≤ m − 1,

m−1 m−1

(−1)

z

and

dm−1 εz + xdm−2 εy .

If g = xm−i di for some i in the range 1, . . . , m − 1, then the following cycles in K1R
yield a basis for A1
xm−j−1 dj εx for 0 ≤ j ≤ m − 1, j 6= i
y m−j−1 dj εy for 0 ≤ j ≤ m − 1,
m−1 m−1

(−1)

z

and

dm−1 εz + xdm−2 εy .

If g = dm then the following cycles in K1R yield a basis for A1
xm−j−1 dj εx for 0 ≤ j ≤ m − 1,
y m−j−1 dj εy for 0 ≤ j ≤ m − 1,

and

dm εz .
From Theorem (2.4) it is known that R is of class G(r) with µ(a) − 3 ≤ r. To prove
that equality holds, which is the claim in (b) and (c), it suffices to show that the
kernel of δ has rank at least (µ(a) + 1) − (µ(a) − 3) = 4; see (2.1). To this end we
first notice that the cycles gεxy , gεxz , and gεyz yield linearly independent elements
of A2 . Assume towards a contradiction that they are not, then there exists an
element hεxyz in K3Q and elements q1 , q2 , and q3 in Q and not all in n with
∂(hεxyz ) − (q1 gεxy + q2 gεxz + q3 gεyz ) ∈ aK2Q .
That is, one has zh − q1 g ∈ a, yh + q2 g ∈ a, and xh − q3 g ∈ a, and hence h 6∈ nm
as g 6∈ a + nm+1 . Furthermore, the class of h is a socle element in S as one has
nh ⊆ a + Qg = gm . Thus, h ∈ gm or h = qxm−1 y m−1 for some q ∈ Q \ n. In either
case one has h ∈ nm , which is a contradiction. Thus gεxy , gεxz , and gεyz yield
linearly independent elements in A2 that clearly belong to the kernel of δ.
Finally we produce a fourth element in the kernel. For g = xn the element
f = y m−1 εyz
is clearly a cycle in K2R , and it is not a boundary. Indeed, if one had f =
∂(hεxyz ) = hxεyz − hyεxz + hzεxy for some homogeneous element h ∈ R, then

it would have degree m − 2 and one would have hy = 0 = hz in R, which is impossible as a has generators of degree at least m. The products (y m−j−1 dj εy ) · f and
((−1)m−1 z m−1 εz + xdm−2 εy ) · f in K R vanish by graded commutativity. Moreover,
one has
(xm εx ) · f = x(xm−1 y m−1 )εxyz = 0
m−j−1

(x

m−j−1 j−1

dj εx ) · f = x

y

(y

and

dj )εxyz = 0 .

Thus the homology class of f annihilates A1 .
For g = xm−i di and 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 the element
f = y m−i di−1 εxy + (−1)i−1 y m−i−1 di εyz
is a cycle in K2R ; indeed one has
∂(f ) = xy m−i di−1 εy − y m−(i−1) di−1 εx + (−1)i−1 y m−i di εz + (−1)i y m−i−1 zdi εy
= y m−i−1 ((−1)i zdi + xydi−1 )εy
= y m−(i+1) di+1
=0,
where the third equality follows from Lemma (3.2). An argument similar to the
one above shows that f is not a boundary. The products (y m−j−1 dj εy ) · f in K R
vanish by graded commutativity. Moreover, one has
(xm−j−1 dj εx ) · f = (−1)i−1 xm−j−1 dj y m−i−1 di εxyz .
If i > j holds, then the element xm−j−1 dj y m−i−1 di is 0 in R because it is divisible by g, which is a socle element in R. If one has i < j, then the element
xm−j−1 dj y m−i−1 di is zero in R because it is divisible in Q by the generator y m−j dj
of a. Finally, one has
((−1)m−1 z m−1 dm−1 εz + xdm−2 εy ) · f = (−1)m−1 y m−i di−1 z m−1 dm−1 εxyz
= (−1)m−1 y m−i−1 di−1 z m−1 (ydm−1 )εxyz
=0
in K R , so the homology class of f annihilates A1 .
For g = dm the element
f = dm−1 εxy
is evidently a cycle in K2R , and as above it is not a boundary. The products
(xm−j−1 dj εx ) · f and (y m−j−1 dj εy ) · f in K R vanish by graded commutativity.
Finally one has,
(dm εz ) · f = dm−1 dm εxyz = 0 ,
as g = dm is a socle element of R.
