Abstract
We present a strong version of Abouzaid’s No-Escape Lemma, which allows
varying contact forms on the boundary and which can be used instead of the
Maximum Principle. Moreover, we give a clarified proof of Cieliebak’s Invariance
Theorem for Symplectic homology under subcritical handle attachment. Finally,
we introduce the notion of asymptotically finitely generated contact structures,
which states essentially that the Symplectic homology in a certain degree of any
filling of such contact manifolds is uniformly generated by only finitely many Reeb
orbits. This property is then used to show that a large class of manifolds carries
infinitely many exactly fillable contact structures.

1. Introduction
This paper deals with symplectic manifolds (V, ω), which are 2n-dimensional manifolds
together with a 2-form ω such that ω n is a volume form. Moreover, we also consider
the odd dimensional counterparts called contact manifolds (Σ, ξ), where ξ is a totally
non-integrable hyperplane distribution on Σ. Both concepts are closely related, namely
if V is compact with boundary, then its a natural condition to impose that ω induces on
∂V = Σ a contact structure. Depending on the focus, one calls Σ a contact boundary
of (V, ω) or (V, ω) a symplectic filling of (Σ, ξ).
The study of the relations between (V, ω) and (Σ, ξ) is a vast and fruitful field in Symplectic and Contact geometry. It deals with questions as: What topological or symplectic
invariants of (V, ω) are determined by (Σ, ξ)? Does (Σ, ξ) posses a symplectic filling and
if so, how many? In as far does (V, ω) provide contact invariants for (Σ, ξ)? Can fillings
be used to distinguish different contact structures on Σ? Many of these questions are
still open in general though interesting partial results are known.
In this paper, we focus solely on exact symplectic manifolds (V, λ), where λ is a primitive for ω, i.e. dλ = ω. Contact manifolds (Σ, ξ) which posses exact symplectic fillings
(V, λ) such that ∂V = Σ and ξ = ker λ|T Σ , are called exactly fillable. For an exact symplectic manifold (V, λ) with contact boundary (Σ, ξ) one can construct its Symplectic
(co)homology SH∗ (V ) resp. SH ∗ (V ), which are symplectic invariants of (V, λ). This
(co)homology is closely related to the contact structure on ∂V = Σ, as its generators
are either critical points of a Morse function on V or closed Reeb orbits on Σ (see 2.1,
2.3 and 2.7 for details). This connection enabled the author in [12] to use Symplectic
homology1 to prove for the first time rigorously the result by I. Ustilovsky, [29], that the
standard spheres S 4m+1 carry infinitely many different exactly fillable cotact structures
1

More precisely Rabinowitz-Floer homology, which can be thought of as a relative version of SH.

not distiguished by algebraic topology. Later, this fact was also shown by Kwon and van
Koert, [18], and Gutt, [17], using a variant of SH, namely S 1 -equivariant Symplectic
homology. These so called exotic contact structures on S 4m+1 are all explicitely given
as the famous Brieskorn manifolds (see sectio 4).
One way to construct new exactly fillable contact manifolds from given ones is by attaching a symplectic handle to the filling (V, λ) along the boundary Σ = ∂V (see section
3). The effect of this procedure on (Σ, ξ) is that of contact surgery which includes in
particular contact connected sums. Particular interesting is the connected sum of any
exactly fillable contact manifold with a standard sphere carrying an exotic contact structure. In general, it is unknown if this gives always new contact structures on the original
manifold. However, we will show in this paper that it holds true on a big subclass of
exactly fillable contact manifolds.
Here is a brief sketch of the definition of this subclass: A contact form α for ξ is a
1-form such that ξ = ker α. The Reeb vector field R of α is the unique vector field on
Σ such that α(R) = 1 and dα(R, ·) = 0 (see section 2.1). To closed Reeb orbits γ we
can associate a Morse-Bott index µ which is determined by the Conley-Zehnder index
of γ and a Morse index (see 2.4). We call a contact structure asymptotically finitely
generated in degree k with bound bk (ξ) (abreviated a.f.g.) if there exists fl : Σ → R
with fl+1 ≤ fl ≤ 0 and (al ) ⊂ R with al+1 ≥ al and liml→∞ al = ∞ such that for each
contact form αl = efl ·α with Reeb vector field Rl holds that all contractible Reeb orbits
of length less than al are transversely non-degenerate and that of these orbits at most
bk (ξ) have index k.
We show in the appendix that a contact structure which admits a totally periodic
Reeb flow is asymptotically finitely generated in almost all degrees k. This includes
all Brieskorn manifolds, the unit cotangent bundle of a sphere and the odd dimensional
spheres with their usual contact structures. Moreover, we show in Proposition 20 that
a.f.g. in degree k is invariant under subcritical contact surgery. Starting from the standard sphere S 2n−1 with the unit ball as exact filling, we hence find that the boundaries
of all subcritical Weinstein domains are a.f.g. in almost all degrees. Moreover any connected sums of finitely many contact manifolds which are a.f.g in degree k is again a.f.g
in degree k. The notion of a.f.g. in degree k allows us to state the following general
Theorem.
Theorem 1. Suppose that (Σ, ξ) has an exact filling (V, λ) such that for the inclusion
i : Σ → V holds i∗ : π1 (Σ) → π1 (V ) is injective and the integral Ic1 : π2 (V ) → Z
of the first Chern class c1 (T V ) vanishes on spheres. Moreover, assume that (Σ, ξ) is
asymptotically finitely generated in a degree k ≥ 21 dim V + 2.
Then Σ carries infinitely many non-contactomorphic exactly fillable contact structures.
Remarks.
• The conditions on π1 (Σ) and c1 (T V ) ensure that the Conley-Zehnder index is welldefined on Σ. Moreover, both conditions are invariant under attaching a symplectic
k-handle, at least if k 6= 2 (see [13], Lemma 66 and 67).

• Note that Theorem 1 does not require index positivity or dynamical convexity –
assumtions that are usually assumed for results of this form (cf. Espina, [11], or
Kwon and van Kort, [18]).
The crucial ingredient for the proof of Theorem 1 is again the Symplectic homology of
fillings and how it behaves under symplectic handle attachement. The founding, and to
this date, only paper where this behaviour is explored is [5] by K. Cieliebak. There, the
following fundamenal result is given:
Theorem 2 (Invariance of SH under subcritical handle attachement).
Let W and V be compact 2n-dimensional symplectic manifolds with positive contact
boundaries and assume that the Conley-Zehnder index is well-defined on W . If V is
obtained from W by attaching to ∂W a subcritical symplectic handle H, k < n, then it
holds that
SH∗ (V ) ∼
and
SH ∗ (V ) ∼
∀ ∗ ∈ Z.
= SH∗ (W )
= SH ∗ (W )
This theorem is widely used in the literature. Its applications apart from distinguishing
exotic contact structures include the vanishing of Symplectic homology of subcritical
Stein manifolds and the proof of certain cases of the Cord conjecture (see [5]). Unfortunately, Cieliebaks original proof of this theorem has two flaws:
a) His version of the Maximum Principle is not strong enough for his proof.
b) The construction of the special Hamiltonians on the handle is too vague (see Discussion 16).
In this paper, we also deal with both of these issues. First, we present a generalization
of Abouzaid’s No-Escape Lemma (see 2.2), which allows for varying contact forms on
the boundary Σ. The advantage of this is not only that it allows to prove Cieliebaks
Invariance Theorem, but it also makes the definition of Symplectic homology more flexible, allowing a more general class of Hamiltonians. In particular, we can define for an
a.f.g. contact structure (with varying contact forms αl ) a sequence of Hamiltonians Hl
(each adapted to αl respectively) which defines directly the Symplectic homology.
Secondly, we carefully construct the special Hamiltonians, needed in symplectic handle
attachement, and we study their dynamics (see section 3). This then leads to the proof
of Theorem 2 together with Viterbo’s transfer maps presented in 2.8.
Finally, we turn to Brieskorn manifolds, where we show that taking iteratively connected
sums of Ustilovsky’s spheres produces new contact structures on S 4m+1 that are also all
non-contactomorphic. This is interesting in its own, since this produces examples which
are not distinguished by the Mean Euler characteristic.

2. Symplectic homology and cohomology
2.1. Setup
Let (V, ω) be an 2n-dimensional compact symplectic manifold with boundary ∂V = Σ
such that ω = dλ is exact. The 1-fom λ defines the Liouville vector field Y by ω(Y, ·) = λ.

4

The boundary Σ is called a positive/negative contact boundary if Y points out of / into
V along Σ. If Σ is a positive contact boundary, then (V, λ) is called a Liouville domain.
Note that any hypersurface Σ in V transverse to Y is a contact manifold, as the 1-form
α := λ|T Σ is a contact form since α∧(dα)n−1 6= 0 pointwise. We write ξ := ker α for the
contact structure and R for the Reeb vector field defined by dα(R, ·) = 0 and α(R) = 1.
Note that α defines via α ∧ (dα)n−1 an orientation of Σ. The spectrum spec(Σ, α) of a
contact form α on Σ is then defined by
spec(Σ, α) = {η ∈ R | ∃ closed orbit of R with period η}.
We say that α is transversely non-degenerate if it satisfies the Morse-Bott assumption:
The set N η ⊂ Σ formed by the η-periodic Reeb orbits is a submanifold
for all η ∈ R and Tp N η = ker (Dp φη − 1) holds for all p ∈ N η .

(MB)

A closed Reeb orbit x is called transversely non-degenerate if (MB) holds locally.
A symplectization of a contact manifold Σ with contact form α is a manifold N = I × Σ,
where I ⊂ R is an interval, together with the symplectic form ω := d(er α), r ∈ I.
For I = R, I = [0, ∞) or I = (−∞, 0], we call (N, ω) the whole/positive/negative
symplectization of Σ. If β is a different contact form on Σ defining the same contact
structure, i.e. ker β = ξ = ker α, and the same orientation then we find a function
f : Σ → R such that βp = ef (p) ·αp ∀p ∈ Σ. To such a β, we associate the following
hypersurface in the whole symplectization of Σ:


	
Σβ := (f (p), p)  p ∈ Σ .
Note that (er ·α)|T Σβ = β and that Σ and Σβ are naturally diffeomorphic.
The flow ϕY of the Liouville vector field Y on a Liouville domain (V, λ) with contact
boundary (Σ = ∂V, α = λ|T Σ ) allows us to identify
a collar neighborhood of Σ with the

r
negative symplectization (−∞, 0]×Σ, d(e α) . This holds true as Y points out of V
along Σ and V is compact, so that ϕtY is well-defined for all t ≤ 0. Moreover, we have
LY ω = ιY dω + d(ιY ω) = 0 + dλ = ω
LY λ = ιY dλ + d(ιY λ) = ιY ω + dω(Y, Y ) = λ,
so that ϕY expands ω|T Σ and α = λ|T Σ exponentially over time. This identification
b of (V, λ) by
allows us to define the completion (Vb , λ)
(

b := λ
Vb := V ∪ϕY (−δ, ∞]×Σ

e α on R×Σ.
For the moment write V = Vα . As mentioned above, a different contact form β for
the same contact structure ξ = ker α defines a contact manifold Σβ in R×Σ. As
(R×Σ, d(er α)) embedds symplectically into (Vb , ω
b ), we can think of Σβ as being an
embedded contact hypersurface in Vb . Note that Σβ bounds a compact region Vβ ⊂ Vb

b V ) is a Liouville domain with contact boundary (Σβ , β). We remark
and that (Vβ , λ|
β
that the completions Vbβ and Vbα = Vb are naturally identified.
More generally, given two Liouville domains (V1 , λ1 ) and (V2 , λ2 ), a diffeomorphism
b2 = λ
b1 + dg for a compactly supϕ : Vb1 → Vb2 is called a Liouville isomorphism if ϕ∗ λ
ported function g. It is shown in [27], page 3, that for any Liouville isomorphism ϕ
there exist R ∈ R, f ∈ C ∞ (∂V1 ) and a contactomorphism ψ : ∂V1 → ∂V2 satisfying
ψ ∗ λ2 |∂V2 = ef ·λ1 |∂V1 , such that on [R, ∞)×∂V1 ⊂ Vb1 the map ϕ has the form
ϕ(r, p) = (r − f (p), ψ(p)).
It follows that any Liouville isomorphism preserves the contact structure of the boundary,
as ker ef ·λ1 |∂V1 = ker λ1 |∂V1 . The corresponding contact forms on the other hand may
b Vα ) and (Vβ , λ|
b V ) as above in
change arbitrarily. For example, if we consider (Vα , λ|
β
b and if we identify Vbα = Vb = Vbβ , then ϕ = Id : Vbα → Vbβ provides a Liouville
(Vb , λ)
b Vα ) and (Vβ , λ|
b V ) as essentially the same filling
isomorphism. As we may think of (Vα , λ|
β
for (Σ, ξ), depending only on the contact form but not on the contact structure, we are
hence led to the following definition:
Definition 3. Let (Σ, ξ) be a contact manifold. If there exists a Liouville domain (V, λ)
such that ∂V = Σ and ξ = ker λ|Σ , then we call the equivalence class of (V, λ) under
Liouville isomorphisms an exact (contact) filling of (Σ, ξ).
It will turn out that Symplectic homology is in fact invariant under Liouville isomorphisms (see section 2.3) thus providing an invariant for contact structures (with a filling).
A Hamiltonian on Vb is a smooth S 1 -family of functions Ht : Vb → R with Hamiltonian

The critical points of the functional AH are exactly the closed 1-periodic orbits of XH

We denote the set of these solutions by P(H). Let Jt denote an S -family of ω-compatible
almost complex structures. As usual, ω-compatible means that ω(·, Jt ·) defines a Riemannian metric on V for every t. The L2 -gradient of AH with respect to this metric is
then given by
t
∇AH (x) = −J(∂t x − XH
).

An AH -gradient trajectory u : R × S 1 → Vb is hence a solution of the following partial
differential equation:

∂s u − ∇AH = ∂s u + J(∂t u − XH

For the second equation, recall that the differential Du of u can be viewed as a 1-form
on R×S 1 with values in T V and that the antiholomorphic part of such differential forms

6

β is given by β 0,1 := 21 (β + Jβj), where j is the standard almost complex structure on
R × S 1 , defined by j∂s = ∂t . In the course of this article, we will also be interested in
homotopies Hs of Hamiltonians. In this case, we call AHs -gradient trajectories solutions
t
of (1) with XH
and J depending on s.

2.2. The No-Escape Lemma
For the construction of symplectic (co)homology we look at solutions u of (1) satisfying
lim u(s, t) = x± (t) ∈ P(H). In general, these solutions might not stay in a compact
s→±∞

subset of Vb , even for x± fixed. So it could be that the moduli space of these solutions is
neither compact nor has a suitable compactification. However, the No-Escape Lemma
(see below) shows that for certain pairs (H, J) all such u stay in a compact set.
In order to state the lemma in full generality, let (W, dλ) be an exact symplectic manifold with compact negative contact boundary and such that the flow ϕtY of the Liouville vector field Y exists for all t ≥ 0. Then ϕY provides a symplectic embedding of
[0, ∞)×∂W, d(er α) into W . For example, consider [−δ, ∞)×Σ, d(er α) inside (Vb , ω
b ).
Let fs : ∂W → R be a smooth family of functions, such that for some s0 ≥ 0 holds
fs ≡ f±s0 for |s| ≥ s0 . They define on [0, ∞) × ∂W an s-dependent coordinate change
by rs := r − fs and a compact s-depending family of contact hypersurfaces Σs by


	
Σs := {rs ≡ R0 } = (R0 + fs (p), p)  p ∈ ∂W
for a constant R0 ≥ − min fs (p).
s,p

Let Js be an s-dependent family of almost complex structures. We assume that Js is of
contact type along Σs , meaning that Js∗ λ = d(ers ) holds for fixed s at all points p ∈ Σs .
Let Hs : W → R be a homotopy of Hamiltonians such that

•
Hs (r, p) = hs er−fs (p) = hs (ers )
near Σs ,


•
∂s Hs − hs (eR0 ) + eR0 · h0s (eR0 ) ≤ 0
everywhere on W . (2)
Finally, let S ⊂ R × S 1 be a compact Riemann surface with smooth boundary.
Lemma 4 (No-Escape Lemma).
Let W, S, J, rs , R0 and Hs be as above. Assume that for a solution u : S → W of (1)
rs
holds that u(s, t) ∈ Σs for (s, t) ∈ ∂S and
t) ≥ eR0 for all (s, t). 	
Se ◦ u(s, 
Then it holds for all (s, t) that u(s, t) ∈ s∈R Σs = p ∈ W ∃ s ∈ R : p ∈ Σs .
Remarks.
• If hs and fs are independent of s, then condition (2) is empty, i.e. the No-Escape
Lemma holds for all (H, J) that are cylindrical along a fixed Σ.
• If H is linear in ers along Σs , i.e. Hs = as ers +bs , then (2) reads as ∂s Hs −bs ) ≤ 0.
• If W = [0, ∞)×∂W and Hs is linear everywhere, then (2) reads as ∂s (as er−fs ) ≤ 0,
which is equivalent to ∂s (log as − fs ) ≤ 0.

• If W = [0, ∞) × ∂W and fs = 0, then (2) can be replaced by ∂s h0 ≤ 0, as

• The No-Escape Lemma and Sard’s theorem imply the following corollary.
Corollary 5. Let V0 ⊂ Vb be a relatively compact open set with contact boundary ∂V0 ,
let H : Vb → R be a Hamiltonian satisfying (2) on W := Vb \ V0 and let J be an almost
complex structure which is cylindrical along a collar neighborhood of ∂V0 . Then any
solution u : R × S 1 → Vb to (1) with asymptotes in V0 stays inside V0 for all time.
Proof of the No-Escape Lemma:
At first, we calculate λ applied to the Hamiltonian vector field on Σs :
λ(XHs ) = dλ(Y, XHs ) = dHs (Y ) = ∂r Hs (r, y) = h0s (er−fs (p) )·er−fs (p) = h0s (eR0 )·eR0 , (∗)
where the last equality holds only on Σ
R s , as there r − fs (p) = rs = R0 . We define the
energy ES (u) of u over S as ES (u) := S ||∂s u||2 ds ∧ dt. Clearly, ES (u) is non-negative.
Using a trick of M. Abouzaid,
we will show that ES (u) ≤ 0 and hence ES (u) S
= 0, so
S
that ∂s u ≡ 0. As u|∂S ⊂ s∈R Σs and S ⊂ R × S 1 , this implies that u(s, t) ∈ s∈R Σs
for all (s, t) ∈ S. To prove ES (u) ≤ 0, we calculate:

Here, we used that orbits of XHs stay inside level sets of ers , so that ders (XHs ) = 0.
To calculate the last integral, let n be the outward normal direction along ∂S ⊂ S. Then
(n, jn) is an oriented frame and hence ∂S is oriented by jn. So along ∂S holds
−ders (Du)j(jn) = −d(ers ◦ u)(−n) ≤ 0,
as in the inward direction −n, ers ◦ u can only increase since ers ◦ u attains its minimum
eR0 along ∂S. So ES (u) ≤ 0 and hence ES (u) = 0.

for all y ∈ P(H) near x. Note that N is always closed and consists of finitely many
points if all orbits are non-degenerate.
In view of the No-Escape Lemma (Lemma 4) we make the following definitions:
• A Hamiltonian H is admissible, writing H ∈ Ad(V ), if all 1-periodic orbits of XH
are (transversely) non-degenerate and if H is (weakly) linear at infinity, that is if
there exist a, b, R ∈ R and f ∈ C ∞ (Σ) such that a 6∈ spec(Σ, ef (p) ·α) and H is on
[R, ∞)×Σ ⊂ Vb of the form
H(r, p) = a · er−f (p) + b.
• A homotopy Hs between admissible Hamiltonians H± is admissible if there exist
S, R ≥ 0 such that Hs = H± for ±s ≥ S and Hs has on [R, ∞) × Σ the form

Hs = as · er−fs (p) + bs
with
∂s as · er−fs (p) ≤ 0.

λ ◦ Js = d er−fs
holds for s fixed and all (r, p) ∈ (−ε, ε)×Σs .

2.3. Symplectic homology
For an admissible Hamiltonian H with all 1-periodic orbits non-degenerate, we define
the Floer homology F H∗ (H) as follows: The chain group F C∗ (H) is the Z2 -vector space
generated by P(H). Note that due to a 6∈ spec(Σ, ef (p) · α) and the non-degeneracy of
the 1-periodic orbits, we find that P(H) is in fact a finite set and hence F C∗ (H) has the
c − , x+ ) denote the space of solutions u
finite dimension |P(H)|. For x± ∈ P(H) let M(x
of (1) with lim u = x± . There is an R-action on this space given by time shift. The
s→±∞

quotient under this action is called the moduli space of AH -gradient trajectories between
c − , x+ )/R.
x− and x+ and denoted by M(x− , x+ ) := M(x
For a generic J, the space M(x− , x+ ) is a manifold. Its zero-dimensional component
M0 (x− , x+ ) is compact and hence a finite set. Let #2 M0 (x− , x+ ) denote its cardinality
modulo 2. We define the operator ∂ : F C∗ (H) → F C∗ (H) as the linear extension of
X
∂x :=
#2 M0 (y, x) · y.
y∈P(H)

A standard argument in Floer theory, involving the compactification of M1 (y, x),shows
that ∂ 2 = 0, so that ∂ is a boundary operator. We set as usual F H∗ (H) := ker ∂ im ∂.

9

To an admissible homotopy Hs between admissible Hamiltonians H± we consider for
x± ∈ P(H± ) the moduli space of s-dependent AHs -gradient trajectories Ms (x− , x+ ).
Note that we have no time shift, as equation (1) now depends on s. On chain level, we
define a map σ] (H− , H+ ) : F C∗ (H+ ) → F C∗ (H− ) as the linear extension of
X
σ] (H− , H+ )x+ =
#2 M0s (x− , x+ ) · x− .
x− ∈P(H− )

By considering the compactification of M1s (x− , x+ ), we obtain from Floer theory that
∂ ◦σ] = σ] ◦∂, so that σ] (H− , H+ ) is a chain map, which descends to a map σ∗ (H− , H+ ) :
F H∗ (H+ ) → F H∗ (H− ), called continuation map. Considering homotopies of homotopies, one can show that σ∗ (H− , H+ ) is independent of the chosen homotopy. For three
admissible Hamiltonians H1 , H2 and H3 , the continuation maps obey the composition
rule
σ∗ (H1 , H3 ) = σ∗ (H1 , H2 ) ◦ σ∗ (H2 , H3 ).
We introduce a partial ordering ≺ on Ad(V ) by saying H+ ≺ H− if and only if for some
R holds on [R, ∞)×Σ that H+ −H− is constant or H+ ≤ H− . Observe that admissibility
of a homotopy Hs between H− and H+ implies that H+ ≺ H− . It follows from the above
that the groups F H∗ (H) together with the maps σ∗ (H− , H+ ) for H+ ≺ H− define a direct
system over the directed set (Ad(V ), ≺). The Symplectic homology groups SH∗ (V ) are
then defined to be the direct limit of this system:
SH∗ (V ) :=

lim
−→

F H∗ (H).

H∈Ad(V )

As we want to use Symplectic homology to distinguish contact structures, we will sometimes also write SH∗ (V, ∂V ) for SH∗ (V ) to emphasize the connection with the contact
boundary (∂V, λ|T ∂V ).
A cofinal sequence (Hn ) ⊂ Ad(V ) is a sequence of Hamiltonians such that Hn ≺ Hn+1
and for any H ∈ Ad(V ) there exists n ∈ N such that H ≺ Hn . Recall that a direct limit
can be computed from any cofinal sequence, i.e. that SH∗ (V ) = lim F H∗ (Hn ).
−→
n→∞
More general, a set F ⊂ Ad(V ) is cofinal if for any H ∈ Ad(V ) there exists F ∈ F such
that H ≺ F . For F cofinal holds again SH∗ (V ) = lim F H∗ (F ).
−→
F ∈F

When calculating SH∗ (V ), it is usefull to consider autonomous (i.e. time-independent)
Hamiltonians H. However, the 1-periodic orbits of such H come in families, unless they
are constant. Typically, this situation arises if on a symplectization R × Σ the Hamiltonian is of the form H(r, p) = h(er ), where the 1-periodic orbits on level er ≡ c correspond
to closed Reeb orbits of period h0 (c). These orbits are transversely non-degenerate if
(Σ, α) satisfies (MB). In this situation, we define F H∗ (H) as follows: Choose a Morsefunction f on the manifold N of the closed 1-priodic orbits of H. Then
e
• either perturb H time-depending using f to a time-dependent Hamiltonian H
having exactly one non-degenerate 1-periodic orbit for each critical point of f (see
[23] or [6]) or

10

• let P(H, f ) consist of the critical points of f , let F C∗ (H) be the Z2 -vector space
generated by P(H, f ) and let M(x− , x+ ) consist of unparametrized flow lines
with cascades between x± ∈ P(H, f ). Here, a flow line with cascades is a tuple (u1 , u2 , ..., um ) whose components are solutions of (1) and satisfy
– lim u1 (s, 0) lies in the unstable manifold of x− and lim um (s, 0) lies in the
s→−∞

s→+∞

stable manifold of x+ , both with respect to the gradient flow of f on N ,
– for i = 1, ..., m−1, the limit orbits lim ui and lim ui+1 lie in the same
s→+∞

s→−∞

component of N and are connected by a positive gradient flow line of f with
finite (possibly zero) length.
X
For x ∈ P(H, f ), we define ∂x by
∂x :=
#2 M0 (y, x) · y.
y∈P(H,f )

One can show that this ∂ is well-defined and satisfies ∂ 2 = 0. The resulting
homology is still denoted by F H∗ (H) and forms a directed system in exactly the
same way as in the non-autonomous case. Its direct limit is again the Symplectic
homology SH∗ (V ).
In the case where N consists of isolated circles, this approach was carried out in
detail by Bourgeois and Oancea in [3]. Though not stated explicitly, their methods
are general enough to work also if N is of higher dimension (see also [14], App. A
and [13] for Morse-Bott constructions using flow lines with cascades).

2.4. The Conley-Zehnder index
We can Z-grade Symplectic homology by the Conley-Zehnder index µCZ . We restrict
ourselves to contractible 1-periodic orbits of XH , which is no restriction if the manifold
V is simply connected. Otherwise, note that any solution u of (1) with lims→±∞ = x±
provides a homotopy between x− and x+ , so that the contractible 1-periodic orbits of
XH form a subcomplex of F C∗ (H).
R
Moreover, we assume for the first Chern class c1 (T V ) that S 2 s∗ c1 (T V ) = 0 for every
continuous map s : S 2 → V . If the map i∗ : π1 (∂V ) → π1 (V ) induced by the inclusion
is injective, then the grading is even independent from V .
To compute µCZ (v) for a closed contractible 1-periodic Hamiltonian orbit v choose a
map u from the unit disc D ⊂ C to V such that u(e2πit ) = v(t). Then choose a
symplectic trivialization Φ : D×R2n → u∗ T V of the pullback bundle (u∗ T V, u∗ ω). Such
trivializations exist and are homotopically unique as D is contractible. The linearization
of the Hamiltonian flow ϕtXH along v with respect to Φ defines a path Ψ in the group
Sp(2n) starting at 1 via
Ψ(t) := Φ(v(t))−1 ◦ DϕtXH (v(0)) ◦ Φ(v(0)).
The Conley-Zehnder index of this path is µCZ (v). Its definition is independent of u due to
the assumption on c1 (T V ). In [24] and [25], Robbin and Salamon defined µCZ for paths
in Sp(2n) as a Maslov type index as follows. Every smooth path Φ : [a, b] → Sp(2n) can

11

be uniquely expressed as a solution of an ODE of the form
d
Φ(t) = J0 S(t)Φ(t),
Φ(a) ∈ Sp(2n),
dt
where t 7→ S(t) = S(t)T is a smooth path of symmetric matrices. A time t is called
a crossing if det(Φ(t)−1) = 0. The index µCZ is the sum over all crossings t of the
signatures of S(t) restricted to ker(Φ(t)−1). If the end points a and b are crossings,
then only half the signature is added. The resulting index has in particular the following
properties (see [24] and [16]):



(naturality) µCZ (ΨΦΨ−1 ) = µCZ (Φ), if Ψ : [a, b] → Sp(2n) is a contractible loop.
(zero) If dim ker(Φ(t)−1) = k is constant on [a, b], then µCZ (Φ) = 0.
(homotopy) µCZ (Φ0 ) = µCZ (Φ1 ), if Φs , s ∈ [0, 1], is a homotopy with fixed endpoints.
(catenation) µCZ (Φ|[a,b] ) = µCZ (Φ|[a,c] ) + µCZ (Φ|[c,b] ) for any a < c < b.
In the autonomous case, a transversely non-degenerate orbit v ∈ P(H, f ) is not graded
by the Conley-Zehnder index alone, but by the Morse-Bott index (see [3] or [7])

µ(v) = µCZ (v) + µM orse (v) − 21 dimv N + 12 sign h00 (er ) ,
(3)
where µM orse (v) is the Morse index of v, dimv N is the dimension of the connected
component of N that contains v and sign h00 (er ) is the sign of h00 on the level er , where
v lives. If h is convex, then this sign is +1, a situation encountered in most cases.
Note that in the autonomous case µCZ (v) is constant on connected components of N .
Indeed, if v0 , v1 are two 1-periodic orbits of XH in the same connected component of N
and if u0 : D → C is such that u0 (e2πit ) = v0 (t), then we may construct u1 : D → C
such that u1 (e2πit ) = v1 (t), u0 (z) = u1 ( 21 z) ∀ z∈D and u1 ( 21 (s+1)e2πit ) = vs (t) for
s ∈ [0, 1] defines a path of 1-periodic XH -orbits between v0 and v1 . Choosing a symplectic
trivialization Φ0 of (u∗0 T V, u∗0 ω), we may extend this to a trivialization Φ1 of (u∗1 T V, u∗1 ω).
t
Then, we find that Ψ1 = Φ−1
1 (v1 ) ◦ DϕXH (v1 ) ◦ Φ1 (v1 ) is homotopic with fixed endpoints
to the catenation Λ1 ∗ Ψ0 ∗ Λ0 , where
t
Ψ0 (t) = Φ−1
0 (v0 (t)) ◦ DϕXH (v0 (0)) ◦ Φ0 (v0 (0)),
0
Λ0 (s) = Φ−1
1−s (v1−s (0)) ◦ DϕXH (v1−s (0)) ◦ Φ1−s (v1−s (0)),
1
Λ1 (s) = Φ−1
s (vs (1)) ◦ DϕXH (vs (0)) ◦ Φs (vs (0)).

Here, Λ0 = 1 is constantly the identity while dim ker(Λ1 (s)−1) = dimv N . Using the
zero, homotopy and catenation property of µCZ , we conclude µCZ (Ψ1 ) = µCZ (Λ1 ) +
µCZ (Ψ0 ) + µCZ (Λ0 ) = µCZ (Ψ0 ).

12

We remark that the Conley-Zehnder index is also defined for Reeb orbits (just use the
Reeb flow instead of the Hamiltonia flow). Moreover, if v is a closed XH -orbit that is a
reparametrization of a closed Reeb orbit, then these two indices coincide.
Finally let v be a transversely non-degenerate Reeb orbit and let k·v denote its k-fold
iteration. Then we have for µCZ (k·v) by [26], Lemma 13.4, or [13], Lemma 55, the
following formula
(iterations formula)

µCZ (k·v) = k∆(v) + R(k, v).

(4)

Here, ∆(v) is the mean index of v and R(k, v) is an error term that is bounded by
|R(k, v)| ≤ 2 dim(ξ) = 2(n−1).

2.5. Asymptotically finitely generated contact structures
In the literature, the following type of autonomous Hamiltonians H on Vb is often used: H
is a C 2 -small Morse function g inside V that becomes cylindrical near ∂V = Σ and is on
[−ε, ∞)×Σ of the form H(r, p) = h(er ) for h : R → R with h00 ≥ 0 and h(er ) = aer +b on
[0, ∞)×Σ with a 6∈ spec(Σ, α). As for H(r, p) = h(er ) holds that XH (r, p) = h0 (er )·R(p),
we find that Hamiltonians of this form have two types of 1-periodic orbits:
• constant orbits inside V corresponding to critical points,
• non-constant orbits near Σ corresponding to Reeb orbits of length h0 (er ).
If we assume that α satisfies (MB) then we know that the non-constant orbits of XH
form a manifold N which agrees with the manifold formed by the closed Reeb orbits. If
we choose a Morse function f on N , then we saw that F C(H, f ) is generated by critical
points of f and g.
Let critk (g) denote the critical points of g with Morse-Bott index k. We find that
F Ck (H, f ) is generated by at most #critk (f ) + #critk (g) many critical points for any
Hamiltonian H of the above form and hence that
rk F Hk (H, g) ≤ #critk (f ) + #critk (g)

⇒

rk SHk (V ) ≤ #critk (f ) + #critk (g).

Unfortunately, we cannot always assume that there are globally only finitely many closed
Reeb orbits with Morse-Bott index k. In particular, performing surgery may create
infinitely many new orbits. However, we may assume that we have only finitely many
up to a certain length which motivates the following definition.
Definition 6.
Let (Σ, α) be a compact contact manifold. We say that ξ = ker α is an asymptotically
finitely generated contact structure in degree k with bound bk (ξ), if there exists
• a non-increasing sequence of smooth functions fl : Σ → R with
fl+1 (p) ≤ fl (p) ≤ 0 ∀p ∈ Σ,
• an increasing sequence al ∈ R with al+1 ≥ al and liml→∞ al = ∞,

13

such that for each contact form αl := efl ·α with Reeb vector field Rl holds that
al 6∈ spec(Σ, αl ), all contractible closed Rl -orbits of length at most al are transversely
non-degenerate and of these orbits at most bk (ξ) have Morse-Bott index k.
Remarks.
• We do not require that the αl are distinct. In particular α = αl ∀ l is possible, if
for α itself all closed Reeb orbits are transversely non-degenerate and only finitely
many have Morse-Bott index k. In this situation, bk (ξ) can be chosen to equal the
number of closed Reeb orbits of α having Morse-Bott index k.
• It is shown in the appendix that all contact structures which admit a contact
form α with totally periodic Reeb flow are asymptotically finitely generated for
|k| > 3(n−1). In particular all Brieskorn manifolds are asymptotically finitely
generated for all k with |k| > 3(n−1). Moreover, it is shown that for such contact
structures one can chose contact forms αl as in the definition such that the Reeb
flow for no αl is totally periodic.
• Recently, definitions similar to ours have been introduced in the literature. For
example in [18] the notion of convenient dynamics and in [20] the notion of asymptotically dynamically convex. Though all three definitions work with sequences of
contact forms with “nice” closed Reeb orbits below a certain length here are the
main differences to our definition: We do not require any form of index positivity
or negativity, but we require that there are only finitely many closed orbits with
index k.
Proposition 7. Let (V, λ) be a Liouville domain with compact contact boundary (Σ, α).
If ξ = ker α is asymptotically finitely generated in degree k with bound bk (ξ), then
orse
2
rk SHk (V ) ≤ bk (ξ) + #critM
n−k (g) ,
orse
where g is any Morse function on V and critM
n−k (g) denotes the set of critical points
of g having Morse index n−k.

Proof: Let αl = efl ·α and (al ) ⊂ R be the sequences that show that ξ is asymptotically
finitely generated. Let Σl = {(fl (p), p) | p ∈ Σ} be the contact hypersurfaces in Vb
associated to αl and let Vl be the associated Liouville domains (see section 2.1). Now
let Hl be a Hamiltonian on Vb as above that is a C 2 -small Morse function g inside Vl
and is on [−ε, ∞)×Σl of the form Hl (r, p) = hl (er ) with h00l ≥ 0 and hl (er ) = al er + bl
on [0, ∞)×Σl .
Note that Hl is expressed in different coordinates on the cylindrical end of Vb for each l.
If written in the fixed coordinates [0, ∞)×Σ, it takes for r sufficiently large the form
Hl (r, p) = al er−fl (p) + bl .
2

In fact #critn−k (g) can be replaced by rk Hn−k (V, ∂V ) with the help of the canonical map
Hn−k (V, ∂V ) → SHk (V ).

14

Apparently each Hl is an admissible Hamiltonian. As (al ) and (−fl ) are non-decreasing
with lim al = ∞, it holds that (Hl ) is cofinal in Ad(V ). Hence we have that
lim F H∗ (Hl ) = SH∗ (V ).

l→∞

Note that the Conley-Zehnder index of a critical point x of a Morse function is related
to the Morse index of x by µCZ (x) = n − µM orse (x). As there are for each l at most
bk (ξ) closed Reeb orbits of αl with Morse-Bott index k, we find that
orse
rk F Hk (Hl ) ≤ rk F Ck (Hl ) ≤ bk (ξ) + #critM
n−k (g)

and applying the direct limit yields

orse
rk SHk (V ) ≤ bk (ξ) + #critM
n−k (g).

2.6. Action filtration
The action functional AH provides filtrations of SH∗ (V ) as follows: For a fixed admissible
Hamiltonian H and b ∈ R consider the subchain groups
F C∗<b (H) ⊂ F C∗ (H),
which are generated by whose x ∈ P(H) with AH (x) < b. For a < b, we set
.
<b
F C∗[a,b) (H) := F C∗ (H) F C∗<a (H) .
[a,b)

We call F C∗ (H) truncated chain groups in the action window [a, b). By setting
[−∞,b)
a = −∞, they include the cases F C∗
(H) = F C∗<b (H). Analogously one defines
.
F C∗≤b (H), F C∗>b (H) := F C∗ (H) F C∗≤b (H), F C∗≥b (H),
F C∗(a,b] (H), F C∗(a,b) (H) and F C∗[a,b] (H).
[a,b)

(a,b)

Note that F C∗ (H) = F C∗ (H) if a 6∈ AH (P(H)). In the following, we restrict
(a,b)
ourselves for simplicity to F C∗ (H). However, most of the subsequent results hold for
all versions of action windows.
Lemma 8 below shows that the boundary operator ∂ reduces the action. It induces
(a,b)
therefore a boundary operator ∂ = ∂ (a,b) on F C∗ (H) and for this we define
ker ∂ (a,b)
.
im ∂ (a,b)
Lemma 8. If H is a Hamiltonian or a (everywhere) monotone decreasing homotopy
and u a solution of (1) with lim u = x± ∈ P(H), then AH (x+ ) ≥ AH (x− ).
F H∗(a,b) (H) :=

s→±∞

Proof:

Note that the second term is zero, if H does not depend on s, i.e. if H is a Hamiltonian.
This shows that the monotone decreasing condition is only needed for homotopies.

15

Let H− , H+ be two admissible Hamiltonians such that H− > H+ everywhere. Then we
may choose a monotone decreasing admissible homotopy Hs between them and it follows
from Lemma 8 that the associated continuation map σ] (H− , H+ ) also decreases action.
We obtain hence a well-defined map
σ∗ (H− , H+ ) : F H∗(a,b) (H+ ) → F H∗(a,b) (H− ).
The truncated Symplectic homology in the action window (a, b) is then defined as the
direct limit under these maps:
SH∗(a,b) (V ) := lim F H∗(a,b) (H).
−→
Attention: Without further restrictions, we have for all a > −∞ and any b:
SH∗(a,b) (V ) = 0

SH∗(−∞,b) (V ) = SH∗ (V ).

and

To see this, take any cofinal sequence of Hamiltonians (Hn ) and take an increasing
sequence (βn ) ⊂ R such that βn > max AHn (x). Define Kn := Hn + βn − a and
x∈P(Hn )

Ln := Hn + βn − b, which yield also cofinal sequences satisfying
max AKn (x) = max AHn (x) − βn + a < a

x∈P(Kn )

x∈P(Hn )

(a,b)

(a,b)

and

max ALn (x) < b.
x∈P(Ln )
(a,b)

It follows that F C∗ (Kn ) = F H∗ (Kn ) = 0 for all n and hence SH∗ (V ) = 0, while
(−∞,b)
(−∞,b)
F C∗
(Ln ) = F C∗ (Ln ) for all n and hence SH∗
(V ) = SH∗ (V ).
To obtain a meaningful action filtered version of SH, we have to restrict the set of admissible Hamiltonians. In this article, it will be usefull to require that all Hamiltonians
H are smaller then 0 inside a fixed Liouville subdomain W ⊂ Vb bounded by a contact
hypersurface ∂W 3 . In particular, one can take W = V . We write SH (a,b) (W ⊂V ) for the
direct limit of these Hamiltonians4 , as this filtration of SH∗ (V ) gives informations about
the embedded subdomain W . Note that different choices of W ⊂ V give different filtra[0,∞)
tions of SH∗ (V )! To ease notation, we write SH∗≥0 (W ⊂V ) instead of SH∗ (W ⊂V ).
(a,b)
For the definition of F H∗ (H) it suffices that only the 1-periodic orbits x of XH with
AH (x) ∈ (a, b) are non-degenerate, as the others are discarded. Therefore, we call a
(a,b)
Hamiltonian H admissible for SH∗ (W ⊂V ), writing H ∈ Ad(a,b) (W ⊂V ), if it satisfies
• H < 0 on W ,
• H(r, p) = a · er−f (p) + b on [R, ∞) × Σ for some R and f : Σ → R,
• all x ∈ P(H) with AH (x) ∈ (a, b) are (transversely) non-degenerate.
3

Other possibilities are H|∂V < 0 which leads to the V -shaped homology/Rabinowitz-Floer homology
or H|V \W < 0 which leads to the Symplectic homology of a cobordism. See [9] for more details.
4
These Hamiltonians coincide with whose defining SH∗ (W ) in the sense of [9]. However, SH∗ (W ) 6=
SH∗ (W ⊂V ) in general, but SH∗≥0 (W ⊂V ) = SH∗ (W ) as shown in Cor. 10.

16

The partial ordering on Ad(a,b) (W ⊂V ) is given by H ≺ K if H ≤ K everywhere.
(a,b)
Note that we may choose for the computation of SH∗ (W ⊂V ) cofinal sequences (Hn )
which are also admissible for the whole Symplectic homology, but we do not have to.
Then considering H ∈ Ad(W ⊂V ) := Ad(−∞,∞) (W ⊂V ) no orbits get discarded, so that
all orbits are non-degenerate. Thus Ad(W ⊂V ) ⊂ Ad(V ) and in fact it is a cofinal subset,
so that
SH∗(−∞,∞) (W ⊂V ) = SH∗ (W ⊂V ) = SH∗ (V ).
When taking a Hamiltonian H ∈ Ad(W ⊂V ), we find that the projection
.
π : F C∗ (H) → F C∗>b (H) = F C∗ (H) F C∗≤b (H)
and the short exact sequence
0 → F C∗(a,b) (H) → F C∗(a,c) (H) → F C∗(b,c) (H) → 0
induce in homology a map π : F H∗ (H) → F H∗≥b (H) and a long exact sequence
· · · → F H∗(a,b) (H) → F H∗(a,c) (H) → F H∗(b,c) (H) → . . .
Applying the direct limit then yields a map
π

SH∗ (V ) = SH∗ (W ⊂V ) −→ SH∗>b (W ⊂V )
and (as lim is an exact functor) a long exact sequence
−→
· · · → SH∗(a,b) (W ⊂V ) → SH∗(a,c) (W ⊂V ) → SH∗(b,c) (W ⊂V ) → . . .

2.7. Symplectic cohomology
By dualizing the constructions from 2.3, we obtain the Symplectic cohomology. Explicitly, we define for an admissible Hamiltonian H the cochain groups F C ∗ (H) as the dual
of F C∗ (H). As F C∗ (H) is Z2 -generated by the finite set P(H), we can view F C ∗ (H)
also as the Z2 -vector space generated by P(H). The coboundary operator δ, which is
the dual of ∂, is then given as the linear extension of
X
δx :=
#2 M0 (x, y) · y.
y∈P(H)

Note that the operator δ reverses the direction of maps. The analogue construction of
chain maps σ ] (H− , H+ ) associated to an admissible homotopy Hs between Hamiltonians
H− and H+ yields hence continuation maps in the opposite direction:
σ ∗ (H− , H+ ) : F H ∗ (H− ) → F H ∗ (H+ ),
where H− > H+ on [R, ∞) × Σ for R sufficiently large. It obeys the composition rule
σ ∗ (H1 , H3 ) = σ ∗ (H2 , H3 ) ◦ σ ∗ (H1 , H2 ).

17

By taking the same partial ordering on Ad(V ) as for homology, we obtain hence an
inverse system. The Symplectic cohomology SH ∗ (V ) is then defined to be the inverse
limit of this system
SH ∗ (V ) := lim F H ∗ (H).
←−
Again, it can be calculated using cofinal sequences (Hn ) of admissible Hamiltonians.
Note that δ decreases action, that for the truncated version of Symplectic cohomology
we now have to consider
∗
F C>a
(H) ⊂ F C ∗ (H)
generated by those 1-periodic orbits with action greater then a. Then, we define
.
∗
∗
∗
F C(a,b]
(H) := F C>a (H) F C>b
(H)
and all other truncated groups accordingly. As δ increases action, it is well-defined on the
∗
∗
(H) as cohomology
(H) and F H(a,b)
truncated chain groups and yields analogously F H>a
groups. When considering only (globally) monotone decreasing homotopies between
H ∈ Ad(a,b) (W ⊂V ), the continuation maps are also well-defined on truncated groups
and we obtain as inverse limits
∗

2.8. The transfer morphisms
Following Viterbo, [30], we construct in this section for a Liouville subdomain W ⊂ V
the so called transfer maps
π∗ (W, V ) : SH∗ (V ) → SH∗ (W )

and

π ∗ (W, V ) : SH ∗ (W ) → SH ∗ (V ).

∗
As shown above, we have maps SH∗ (V ) → SH∗≥0 (W ⊂V ) and SH≥0
(W ⊂V ) → SH ∗ (V ).
≥0
∗
By showing the identities SH∗ (W ⊂V ) = SH∗ (W ) and SH≥0 (W ⊂V ) = SH ∗ (W ) we
will see that these give us the transfer maps. This is done in Prop. 9 and Cor. 10 by
giving an explicit cofinal sequence (Hn ) ⊂ Ad(W ⊂V ).
The following proposition is based on ideas by Viterbo, [30], however the proof follows
McLean, [22]. We include it here for completeness and as the use of the No-Escape
Lemma provides simplifications.

Proposition 9 (McLean,[22]).
There exists an increasing cofinal sequence (Hn ) ⊂ Ad≥0 (W ⊂V ) and a sequence of
monotone decreasing admissible homotopies (Hn,n+1 ) between them such that
1. Hn |W , Hn,n+1 |W are increasing sequences of admissible Hamiltonians / decreasing
homotopies on (W, ω),
2. all 1-periodic orbits of XHn in W have positive action and all 1-periodic orbits of
XHn in Vb \ W have negative action,
3. all AH -gradient trajectories of Hn or Hn,n+1 connecting 1-periodic orbits in W are
entirely contained in W for all admissible J that are of contact type near ∂W .
Proof: It will be convenient to use z = er rather than r for the radial coordinate in
c, ω
c into Vb using the flow
the completions (W
b ) and (Vb , ω
b ). Note that we can embed W
of the Liouville vector field Y . The cylindrical end [1, ∞) × ∂W is then a subset of
Vb . The radial coordinate will be denoted zW on ∂W × (0, ∞) and zV on ∂V × (0, ∞).
Note that we can find a constant P such that {zW ≤1} ⊂ {zV ≤P } and that this implies
{zW ≤C} ⊂ {zV ≤C·P } for any C > 0. Let αW := λ|T ∂W , αV := λ|T ∂V and assume that
(∂W, αW ) and (∂V, αV ) satisfy (MB).
For the construction of Hn choose an increasing sequence (an ) ⊂ R+ with an → ∞ and


(an ) 6∈ spec(∂W, αW ) ∪ 4P ·spec(∂V, αV )
for all n.

Let

|an − a| > 0

and let (εn ) be a decreasing sequence with εn → 0 and ε1 sufficiently small.
Finally, choose an increasing sequence Zn such that:

and Zn > 2.

Next, we describe the Hamiltonian Hn (see figure 1 for a schematic illustration):


Inside W \ [1−ε, 1)×∂W let Hn be a C 2 -small Morse function with −2ε < Hn < ε. On
[1 − ε, Z]×∂W let it be of the form Hn (zW , p) = g(zW ) with g(1) = −ε, 0 ≤ g 0 (zW ) ≤ a
and g 0 (zW ) ≡ a for 1 ≤ zW ≤ Z−ε. On [Z, 2Z]×∂W let Hn ≡ B be constant with
B = Bn ≈ an ·(Zn −1).
On [1, ∞)×∂V keep Hn constant until we reach the hypersurface defined by zV = 2ZP −ε
(recall {zW ≤2Z} ⊂ {zV ≤2ZP }). Then let Hn be of the form Hn (zV , p) = f (zV ) for

Note that for H(z, p) = h(z) the action of an XH -orbit on a fixed z-level is h0 (z)·z −h(z).
Hence we distinguish five types of 1-periodic orbits of XH :
I : critical points inside W of action ≥ ε (as Hn ≤ −ε and C 2 -small inside W )
II : non-constant orbits near zW = 1 of action ≈ g 0 (z) > 0
III : non-constant orbits on zW = c for c near Z of action

In fact Hn < Hn+1 holds even globally. As 4P
an < 4P
an+1 , we have Hn < Hn+1 for zV
large enough. Yet, the most crucial area is around zV = 2Zn+1 P , where Hn+1 is still
constant while Hn has already regained its slope (see figure 2). However, there we have

= Bn+1 ≈ Hn+1 (2Zn+1 P ).
Thus Hn < Hn+1 everywhere and we can find an admissible decreasing homotopy Hn,n+1
connecting Hn+1 and Hn such that:

If we choose an admissible J which is of contact type near zW = 1, then it follows
from the No-Escape Lemma (Cor. 5) that all AH -gradient trajectories for Hn or Hn,n+1
connecting 1-periodic orbits inside W stay inside W for all time. Hence the third claim
is satisfied.

and

SH≥0

Proof: We only prove the corollary for homology, cohomology being completely analog.
Take the sequence of Hamiltonians (Hn ) constructed in Proposition 9. Clearly it is cofinal
and (Hn ) ⊂ Ad≥0 (W ⊂V ), as 1-periodic orbits with positive action are either isolated
critical points inside W (as H is Morse and C 2 -small there) or isolated Reeb-orbits near
zW = 1 – in both cases non-degenerate. Hence we have
SH∗≥0 (W ⊂V ) = lim F H∗≥0 (Hn ).

Let H̃n ∈ Ad(W ) be the linear extension of Hn |W to W
H

obviously F C∗ (Hn ) = F C∗ (H̃n ). As any A -gradient trajectory connecting 1-periodic

orbits in W stays in W , the two boundary operators ∂H
and ∂H̃n coincide and we have
n
≥0
H
F H∗ (Hn ) = F H∗ (H̃n ). As the A -gradient trajectories for the homotopies Hn,n+1 stay
inside W , the continuation maps σ(Hn+1 , Hn ) : F H∗≥0 (Hn ) → F H∗≥0 (Hn+1 ) coincide
with the continuation maps σ(H̃n+1 , H̃n ) : F H∗ (H̃n ) → F H∗ (H̃n+1 ). Hence we have
SH∗≥0 (W ⊂V ) = lim F H∗≥0 (Hn ) = lim F H∗ (H̃n ) = SH∗ (W ).

In the literature, there is a second description of the transfer maps which goes as follows.
Let (Hn ) be the Hamiltonians described in Proposition 9 and let (Kn ) be the following
sequence of Hamiltonians: Inside V we require that Kn is a C 2 -small Morse function
such that Kn |W ≤ Hn |W and on [1 − ε, ∞) × ∂V let it be of the form Kn (zV , p) = f (zV )
an
with 0 ≤ f 0 (zV ) ≤ 4P
, where an and P are as in Prop. 9. In particular, Kn is on
an

Hence, we can find an everywhere increasing homotopy between Kn and Hn , which
defines a continuation map σ∗ (Kn , Hn ) : F H∗ (Kn ) → F H∗ (Hn ) which respects action
filtration. The second version of the transfer map π̃∗ (W, V ) is the limit of these continuation maps:

Here, the identity (∗) is due to the fact that all 1-periodic orbits of Kn have positive
action. The advantage of this transfer map is precisely that it respects action filtration.
However, the advantage of the first definition of π∗ (W, V ) is that it fits into the following
exact triangle, where the third group has a geometric meaning:

Proposition 11. π∗ (W, V ) and π̃∗ (W, V ) are the same map: SH∗ (V ) → SH∗ (W ). The
same holds true for the corresponding maps on cohomology.
Proof: We can slightly modify the construction of the Hn , such that its 1-periodic
orbits are all transversely non-degenerate and Hn ∈ Ad(V ). We just have to require on
Z ≤ zW , zV ≤ 2ZP − ε that Hn − B is a C 2 -small Morse function instead of Hn ≡ B
being constant there. Then we have that F H∗ (Hn ) is well-defined.
Claim : F H∗ (Hn ) ∼
= F H∗ (Kn ).
Proof: Note that Kn and Hn differ on [R, ∞) × ∂V only by a constant for R large.
Hence we can find a homotopy Hs between them such that Hs and H−s are both admissible. This provides continuation maps σ∗ (Kn , Hn ) : F H∗ (Kn ) → F H∗ (Hn ) and

22

σ∗ (Hn , Kn ) : F H∗ (Hn ) → F H∗ (Kn ). They satisfy σ∗ (Hn , Kn ) ◦ σ∗ (Kn , Hn ) = idF H(Hn )
and σ∗ (Kn , Hn ) ◦ σ∗ (Hn , Kn ) = idF H(Kn ) , which implies that they are isomorphisms.
As the homotopy from Kn to Hn can be chosen everywhere increasing, we find that
σ∗ (Kn , Hn ) respects action filtration and we have the following commutative diagram

Hence, we find that π∗ (W, V ) and π̃∗ (W, V ) coincide on homology. The same line of
arguments works also for cohomology, since even though lim is not an exact functor it
←−
still takes isomorphisms to isomorphisms, as it is left exact.

3. Contact surgery and handle attaching
In this section, we first describe the general construction for contact surgery, which is
done by attaching a symplectic handle H to the symplectization of a contact manifold. Then, we describe explicitly symplectic handles as subsets of R2n given by the
intersection of two sublevel sets {ψ<−1} ∩ {φ>−1} for functions φ and ψ on R2n . Subsequently, we describe how to extend an admissible Hamiltonian over the handle to a
new admissible Hamiltonian with only few new 1-periodic Hamiltonian orbit. The proof
of the Invariance Theorem (Theorem 2) and the proof that being asymptotically finitely
generated is invariant under subcritical surgery (Prop. 20) conclude this section.

3.1. Surgery along isotropic spheres
Let us briefly recall the contact surgery construction due to Weinstein, [31]. Consider
an isotropic sphere S k−1 in a (2n − 1)-dimensional contact manifold (N, ξ). The 2-form
ω = dα for a contact form α (with ξ = ker α) defines a natural conformal symplectic
structure on ξ. Denote the ω-orthogonal on ξ by ⊥ω . Since S is isotropic, it holds that
T S ⊂ T S ⊥ω . So, the normal bundle of S in N is given by
T N/T S = T N/ξ ⊕ ξ/(T S)⊥ω ⊕ (T S)⊥ω /T S.

23

The Reeb field R trivializes T N/ξ. The bundle ξ/(T S)⊥ω is canonically isomorphic to
T ∗ S via v 7→ ιv ω. The conformal symplectic normal bundle CSN (S) := (T S)⊥ω /T S
carries a natural conformal symplectic structure induced by ω.
Since S is a sphere, the embedding S k−1 ⊂ Rk provides a natural trivialization of the
bundle RR ⊕ T ∗ S. This trivialization together with a conformally symplectic trivialization of CN S(S) specifies a standard framing for S in N . Note that we have to assume
that CN S(S) is trivializable. This holds certainly true for S = S 0 = {N, S} (two points)
or S = S n−1 . In the latter case we have (T S)⊥ω = T S and hence CN S(S) = (0). Therefore, taking connected sums and surgery along Legendrian spheres is always possible.
Following Weinstein, we define an isotropic setup as a quintuple (P, ω, Y, Σ, S), where
(P, ω) is a symplectic manifold, Y a Liouville vector field for ω, Σ a hypersurface transverse to Y (so Σ is contact) and S an isotropic submanifold of Σ. In [31], Weinstein
proves the following variant of his famous neighborhood theorem for isotropic manifolds:
Proposition 12 (Weinstein). Let (P0 , ω0 , Y0 , Σ0 , S0 ) and (P1 , ω1 , Y1 , Σ1 , S1 ) be two isotropic setups. Given a diffeomorphism from S0 to S1 covered by an isomorphism of
their symplectic subnormal bundles, there exist neighborhoods Uj of Sj in Pj and an
isomorphism of isotropic setups
φ : (U0 , ω0 , Y0 , Σ0 ∩ U, S0 ) → (U1 , ω1 , Y1 , Σ1 ∩ U1 , S1 )
which restricts to the given mappings on S0 .
We may now define contact surgery along an isotropic sphere as follows. Let H ≈
Dk ×D2n−k be a symplectic handle (see 3.2) and let S k−1 be an isotropic sphere in (N, ξ).
Then, Prop. 12 allows us to glue the (lower) boundary S k ×D2n−k of H to the symplectization N × [0, 1] along the boundary part U1 ∩ N ×[0, 1] of a tubular neighborhood U1
of S×{1} (see Figure 4). We obtain an exact symplectic manifold P := N ×[0, 1] ∪S H
with a Liouville vector field Y which is on N × [0, 1] simply ∂t , where t denotes the
coordinate on [0, 1]. Note that Y points inwards along ∂ − P := N ×{0} and outwards
along the other boundary component ∂ + P . Both manifolds are hence contact and ∂ + P
is obtained from N by surgery along S. Moreover, P is an exact symplectic cobordism
between ∂ − P and ∂ + P .

This allows us to write φ = x − y + z and Xφ = Xx − Xy + Xz .
We consider the level surface Σ− := {φ = −1} and note that Y is transverse to Σ− .
It follows that (Σ− , λ|Σ− ) is a contact manifold. The set S := {x=z=0, y=+1} is an
isotropic sphere in Σ− and the quintuple (R2n , ω, Y, Σ− , S) is the isotropic setup where
we glue a symplectic handle H to a contact manifold. In order to specify H, we choose
a different Weinstein function ψ on R2n , satisfying the following assumptions:
(ψ1) Xψ = Cx ·Xx − Cy ·Xy + Cz ·Xz , where Cx , Cy , Cz ∈ C ∞ (R2n ) with Cx , Cy , Cz > 0,
(ψ2) ψ = φ on {φ ≤ −1} except for a small neighborhood of S,
(ψ3) The closure {ψ<−1} ∩ {φ>−1} is diffeomorphic to Dk ×D2n−k .
The handle is then defined as H := {ψ<−1} ∩ {φ>−1} (see Fig. 5).
Remarks 13.
1. If ψ(0) 6= −1, it follows from (ψ1) that the level set Σ+ := {ψ=−1} is also a
contact hypersurface, as Y ·ψ > 0 away from 0. Due to (ψ2), we have Σ− = Σ+
away from a neighborhood of S. Condition (ψ3) on the other hand assures that
Σ+ is obtained from Σ− by surgery along S.

• For reference,
let 	us fix δ0 , ψδ0 , the associated handle Hδ0 and the hypersurface

Σ := ψδ0 = −1 . A different choice of δ and consequently a different function
ψδ defines a different handle Hδ (see Fig. 6). However, the symplectic geometric
result is the same, meaning that if we attach the handles to a symplectic manifold
\
W , then the completions W\
∪Hδ0 and W
∪Hδ agree.
Indeed, if δ ≤ δ0 then ψδ ≥ ψδ0 everywhere and as ψδ0 and ψδ both increase
along flow lines of Y , we find that each flow line of Y not inside {x=z=0} first
hits Σδ := {ψδ = −1} and then Σ+ := {ψδ0 = −1}. Hence Σδ can be identified
with a hypersurface in the symplectization of Σ+ given as a graph of a function
f : Σ+ → (−∞, 0], where f (p) is the unique time such that ϕ−f (p) (p) ∈ Σδ for the
flow ϕt of Y .

As ϕt satisfies z(ϕt (q, p)) = et ·z(q, p) for any (q, p) ∈ R2n , t ∈ R, we can for z ≤ δ
express ψδ in symplectization coordinates (r, p) on {x=y=0} in the form
ψδ (r, p) = aδ ·er − (1+ε).
As r = 0 corresponds to Σδ in {x=y=0} and as the z-value on Σδ ∩ {x=y=0} is
smaller then δ and ψδ (Σδ ) = −1, we have

aδ = ε.

This shows that ψδ has for any δ on Σδ ∩ {x=y=0} the slope ε in radial direction.

3.3. Linear extensions over the handle
For the proof of the Invariance Theorem, we need Hamiltonians H ∈ Ad(W ⊂V ), i.e H
is globally admissable with H|W < 0 and arbitrarily large away from W . Moreover, H
\
has to be linear on [R, ∞) × ∂(W ∪H) in W
∪H for R large. As we saw in the previous
secion, it is not difficult to extend a Hamiltonian H on W that is linear near ∂W to
\
W ∪H. However, it is the extension of H to the completion W
∪H which causes some
problems, in particular if we require that XH has outside W very few 1-periodic orbits
with negative action, possibly only one. Unfortunately, it is here where the fundamental
article on subcritical handle attachment, [5], is quite vague. In particular, it does not
address the following difficulties:

28

\
Discussion 16. Any Hamiltonian H on W
∪H has at least one critical point outside W
and we may assume that it lies at the center of H. If this should be the only 1-periodic
orbit with negative action outside W , we need that H is on the symplectic cocore of H
(the set {x = y = 0}) of the form
H = a+ ·er + b+
in cylindrical coordinates adapted to a hypersurface Σ+ = {r=0} above the handle. Note
that b+ is the value of H at the center of H and hence b+ > 0, as H > 0 outside of W .
In fact, b+ has to be thought of as arbitrarily large, as H is part of an increasing cofinal
sequence of Hamiltonians. As H is constructed by extending an admissible Hamiltonian
of W , we need near ∂W that H is of the form
−

H = a− ·er − a− ·er − ε.
Here we use the same cylindrical coordinates as above and ∂W = {r=r− }. The absolute
−
term −a− ·er − ε with a− , ε > 0 and ε small is due to H < 0 on W .
Finally, we may assume that H(r, p) = h(er ) is cylindrical away from the handle and its
symplectization, as otherwise we would loose all information on 1-periodic orbits of H.
Then, we may consider away from H the action function
g(r) = ∂r H − H = h0 (er ) · er − h(er ).
As H is linear at infinity, we can find an r+ ≥ 0 such that for all r ≥ r+ holds that
−
H(r, p) = a+ ·er + b+ . Hence, we find that g(r+ ) = −b+ , while g(r− ) = a− ·er + ε. This
implies that the slope h0 of H has to vary away from H, as g is constant if h0 is constant.
In fact, we even obtain with the mean value theorem that for some r ∈ (r− , r+ ) holds:
+

+

−

+

+

−

h0 (er ) · er ≤ h(er ) − h(er ) = (er − er ) · h0 (er )

⇒

+

h0 (er ) > h(er ).

−

In other words, independently from the choices of a− ·er , a+ and b+ , we always have to
decrease the slope h0 somewhere away from H. More generally, for fixed Σ+ , i.e. fixed
cylindrical coordinates, there exists a constant 0 < µ < ∞ such that for all a+ holds
dist.(a+ , spec(Σ+ )) ≤ µ.
Let r0 be the largest value, such that on {r=r0 } there exists a 1-periodic orbit of H
away from H, i.e. h0 (er0 ) ∈ spec(Σ+ ). Then |a+ − h0 (er )| ≤ µ for all r ≥ r0 and we have
the following estimate
+

+

H(r0 ) = h(er0 ) ≥ a+ ·er + b+ − (a+ +µ) · (er −er0 ) = b+ + (a+ +µ)er0 − µ·er
=⇒
g(r0 ) = h0 (er0 )·er0 − h(er0 )
+
+
≤ (a+ +µ)er0 − b+ + (a+ +µ)er0 − µ·er = µ·er − b+ .

+

This implies that if r+ is not large enough, then g(r0 ) < 0 and all 1-periodic orbits on
the level {r = r0 } have negative action. So in order to avoid orbits with negative action,

29

r+ has to become arbitrarily large, as µ is fixed and b+ is growing to +∞. As g(r− ) > 0,
the same estimate shows that r+ also grows to +∞, if |h0 (er )−a+ | < µ for all r, i.e. if
no 1-periodic orbits outside W and away from H exist.
This means for a cofinal sequence of Hamiltonians (Hn ) that the area where Hn is not
linear increases in n and fills in the limit the whole positive symplectzation of ∂(W ∪H).
Up to now, the author does not see how this can be accomplished without creating new
1-periodic orbits near H.
The solution to this dilemma is to vary the slope of H on {x=y=0}, the symplectic cocore
of H, first keeping it fixed coming from the center of H and increasing the slope sharply
near Σ+ . Using the Lyapunov function f , we can then show that this construction
creates 1-periodic XH -orbits only on {x=y=0}. These can be explicitly described and
one can show that they do not contribute to the Symplectic homology.
For the construction of such an H, we need the following two technical lemma:
Lemma 17. Consider R2n with the standard symplectic structure, the Liouville vector
field Y and the functions x, y, z with Hamiltonian vector fields Xx , Xy , Xz as given in
3.2. Let Σ ⊂ R2n be a smooth hypersurface transverse to Y (i.e. Σ contact) such that
its Reeb vector field R is of the form
R = cx ·Xx − cy ·Xy + cz ·Xz ,

cx , cy , cz ∈ C ∞ (Σ),

cx , cy , cz > 0.

Consider the function h̃Σ (y, r) = a·er + b on R × Σ and let hΣ := h̃Σ ◦ Φ−1 be its
pushforward onto R2n by the symplectic embedding Φ : R × Σ → R2n , (r, p) 7→ ϕr (p)
provided by the flow ϕt of Y . Then, the Hamiltonian vector field Xh of hΣ is of the form
Cx , Cy , Cz ∈ C ∞ (R2n ),

Xh = Cx ·Xx − Cy ·Xy + Cz ·Xz ,

Cx , Cy , Cz > 0.

Now, we construct H in two steps, first extending an admissible Hamiltonian H|W on
\
W via ψδ to W ∪Hδ , then constructing a linear extension to W
∪Hδ . For simplicity,
r
−
we assume that H|W is of the form H|W = 1·e − 2 near Σ = {r}×∂W . Then
Σ− = {H|W = −1} and H|W has slope 1 on Σ− . For the general case H|W = a·er + b,
we take H as constructed below and extend H|W with a·H + b + 2a. Explicitly, the two
steps are as follows:
• Step 1: Recall that the isotropic sphere S ⊂ Σ− = {φ = −1} is given by
S := {x=z=0, y = 1}.

For a small neighborhood U of S identify the isotropic
setup U, ω, Y, Σ− ∩ U, S

with an isotropic setup U, ω, Y, ({r}×∂W ) ∩ U, S in W (by abuse of notation,
we use the same letters for identified objections on W resp. R2n ). Consider the
following linear Hamiltonian

Σ = h̃Σ ◦ Φ , where Φ(r, p) = ϕ (p)
t
is the symplectic embedding provided by the flow ϕ of Y . Note that H|W coincides
with h−
Σ under the identification of isotropic setups.
As the Reeb vector field RΣ− of (Σ− , λ|T Σ− ) coincides with the Hamiltonian vector
field Xφ on S, we find Xh− = RΣ− = Xφ and hence dh−
Σ = dφ on S. As also
Σ
−
−
−
−
hΣ (Σ ) = φ(Σ ) = −1, we find that hΣ and φ coincide up to first order on S.
Therefore, given any neighborhood U δ of S, there exists a function φ̂ ∈ C ∞ (R2n )

δ

and a neighborhood Û δ ⊂ U δ , such that φ̂ ≡ h−
Σ on R \ U , φ̂ ≡ φ on Û and φ̂ is

arbitrarily C 1 -close to hΣ . As Xφ = Xx −Xy +Xz and Xh− = Cx− Xx −Cy− Xy +Cz− Xz
Σ
with Cx− , Cy− , Cz− > 0 by Lemma 17, we can additionally arrange that

Xφ̂ = Ĉx ·Xx − Ĉy ·Xy + Ĉz ·Xz

with

Ĉx , Ĉy , Ĉz > 0.

As the Xx - and Xz -part of Xφ and Xh− are both 0 on {x = z = 0}, we can make
Σ

U δ and Û δ arbitrarily thin in the x- and z-direction, while keeping a fixed size in
the y-direction. This allows us to choose in (5) for the definition of ψδ a fixed ε
for all handles.
Fix such an ε sufficiently small and choose δ depending on U δ so small such that
the lower boundary Hδ ∩Σ− = Σ− \ Σδ lies in Û δ . Then set

satisfy (ψ1) on U ∪ Hδ , so does Ĥ, i.e. there exist smooth Ĉx , Ĉy , Ĉz > 0 such that
XĤ = Ĉx ·Xx − Ĉy ·Xy + Ĉz ·Xz .



Hence XH is also of this form and satisfies (ψ1), as it is close to the interpolation
of XĤ and Xhδ . It follows from (ψ1) with the help of the Lyapunov function f
that 1-periodic orbits of XH are either 1-periodic orbits of XH |W inside W or the
constant orbit at the center of Hδ , non-constant orbits on the handle near Σδ ∩ Hδ
or Hamiltonian orbits that pass over the handle, go into W and come back. Note
that the last type of orbits is not 1-periodic if the handle is chosen sufficiently thin,
so that the only new orbits after attaching the handle are the constant one at the
center of Hδ and those on the outer boundary of Hδ .

3.4. New closed orbits and their Conley-Zehnder indices
We saw at the end of the last paragraph that all 1-periodic orbits of XH that are
not orbits of XH |W lie on the handle. Moreover, we saw that there exist functions
Cx , Cy , Cz > 0 such that near the handle XH = Cx ·Xx − Cy ·Xy + Cz ·Xz . Hence all new
1-periodic orbits are contained in {x=y=0}. There we have

For the proof of the Invariance Theorem, we need to determine the 1-periodic Hamiltonian orbits of a·H + b + 2a for a, b ∈ R. The resulting Hamiltonian vector field is simply
a·XH . Let ϕtH denote its flow. Then we calculate
d
z(ϕtH ) = dz(a·XH ) = aCz · dz(Xz ) = 0.

It follows that z is constant along flow lines of ϕtH and as Cz is a function of z on {x=y=0}
it follows that Cz is also constant along flow lines of ϕtH on {x=y=0}. Introducing the
complex coordinates zj = qj + i · pj , we find that

diffeomorphic to the standard sphere S 2(n−k)−1 , except for the constant orbit at z = 0.
Next, we calculate the Conley-Zehnder indices µCZ of these orbits. Let γ denote a 1periodic orbit of a·XH . In order to calculate µCZ (γ), we identify Tγ(t) R2n with R2n in the

3.5. Handle attachement and Symplectic homology
In this section, we like to discuss some applications of our construction of Hamiltonians
on subcritical k-handles H. The first is the proof of the Invariance Theorem namely
that SH∗ (W ∪H) = SH∗ (W ), if we attache H to a (2n)-dimensional Liouville domain,
k < n. Secondly, we prove that subcritical contact surgery on an a.f.g. contact structure
produces again an a.f.g. contact structure. Finally, we prove Theorem 1.
Proof of Theorem 2 (Invariance Theorem).
(If V = W ∪H, then SH∗ (W ) = SH∗ (V ) and SH ∗ (W ) = SH ∗ (V ).)
We will show that the asserted isomorphisms are given by the transfer maps
π∗ (W, V ) : SH∗ (V ) → SH∗ (W )

and

π ∗ (W, V ) : SH ∗ (W ) → SH ∗ (V ),

for exactly embedded subdomains W ⊂ W ∪H = V . They were given in 2.8, Cor. 10,
∗
as the truncation maps SH∗ (V ) → SH∗≥0 (W ⊂V ) and SH≥0
(W ⊂V ) → SH ∗ (V ) com∗
(W ⊂V ) ∼
posed with the isomorphisms SH∗≥0 (W ⊂V ) ∼
= SH ∗ (W ).
= SH∗ (W ) and SH≥0
Therefore, we only have to prove that the truncation maps are isomorphisms. The idea
is to construct a cofinal sequence of Hamiltonians (Hl ) ⊂ Ad(V ) ∩ Ad(W ⊂V ) for which
we can directly show
(1)

SH∗≥0 (W ⊂V ) = lim F H∗>0 (Hl ) ' lim F H∗ (Hl ) = SH∗ (V )

We assume that all closed Reeb orbits of the contact form α = λ|∂W on ∂W are transversely non-degenerate and that the attaching area does not intersect with any closed
Reeb orbit. This is generically satisfied (see [7], App. B). To start the construction fix
an increasing sequences of real numbers (al ), such that al 6∈ spec(∂W, α) for all l and
al → ∞. Moreover, fix a positive sequence ε(l) with ε(l) → 0. Then choose an increasing
sequence of non-degenerate Hamiltonians Hl on W that is on ∂W ×(−ε(l), 0] of the form

Hl |∂W ×(−ε(l),0] = al ·er − 1+ε(l)
and extend Hl over the handle by a function ψ with a = al and b = −(1+ε(l)) as described in 3.2 and 3.3. For each l choose the handle Hl so thin such that each trajectory
of XHl which leaves and reenters the handle has length greater than 1. This is possible
as the attaching sphere is strictly isotropic, dim S = k < n = 21 dim V , and can hence
be chosen to have no Reeb chords.

36

\
Note that W
∪Hl is the same symplectic manifold for all choices of Hl , as choosing different handles is to be understood as choosing different parametrizations on the cylindrical
part of the completion. Moreover, if Hl is thinner then Hl−1 , then ∂(W ∪Hl ) lies inside
W ∪Hl−1 (see Remarks 14). This guarantees that Hl ≥ Hl−1 everywhere, since inside W
this holds by assumption, on the handle this holds by construction and on the cylindrical
part of the symplectization the slope of Hl in coordinates adapted to ∂(W ∪Hl−1 ) is at
least al > al−1 , as ∂(W ∪Hl ) lies inside W ∪Hl−1 . Thus we obtain a cofinal admissible
sequence (Hl ), whose 1-periodic orbits having positive action are all contained in W .
Recall from 2.6 that we have the long exact sequences
≥0
· · · → F Hj+1
(Hl ) → F Hj<0 (Hl ) → F Hj (Hl ) → F Hj≥0 (Hl ) → . . .
j−1
j
j
· · · → F H<0
(Hl ) → F H≥0
(Hl ) → F H j (Hl ) → F H<0

and note that F Hj≥0 (Hl ) is generated by all 1-periodic orbits of Hl inside W , while
F Hj<0 (Hl ) is generated by all other orbits. The orbits of negative action all lie on the
handle and are explicitly given in (6). They are all
non-degenerate and
 transversely
 1
z

+
their Morse-Bott indices are given by (n−k) αC
.
It
follows
that the pos2(n−k)
π
sible values of µ(γ) increase to ∞ as the slope a = al tends to ∞ (see 3.4). Therefore,
<0
F Hj<0 (Hl ) becomes eventually zero as l increases and so does F Hj+1
(Hl ). This implies
≥0
that F Hj (Hl ) → F Hj (Hl ) is an isomorphism for l large enough. As the direct limit is
an exact functor, these maps converge to an isomorphism in the limit, proving (8(1)).
In the cohomology case, the line of arguments is the same. Even though taking inverse
j
(Hn ) → F H j (Hn ) to an isomorlimits is not exact, it still takes the isomorphism F H≥0
phism in the limit, as it is left exact (see [10], Thm. 5.4 or [1], §6, no.3, prop. 4). This
proves (8(2)), which implies the theorem.
In [9], Prop. 9.14, Cieliebak and Oancea show that SH∗ (W ∪H) → SH∗ (W ) being an
isomorphism implies the following corollary.
Corollary 19. If V = W ∪H is a Liouville domain that is obtained from W by attaching a subcritical handle, then the Rabinowitz-Floer homologies RF H(V, ∂V ) and
RF H(W, ∂W ) of V and W respectively are isomorphic.
Now, we show that the property of being asymptotically finitely generated is preserved
under subcritical contact surgery. Depending on the degree, the bound bk (ξ) stays
unchanged under this procedure or is increased by 1. Here, we will perform contact
surgery by attaching a symplectic handle H to the negative symplectization W of a
contact manifold (Σ, α). The result of the surgery is then the boundary ∂ W ∪H
together with its induced contact structure.
Proposition 20. Let (Σ, α) be a (2n−1)-dimensional compact contact manifold such
that ξ = ker α is an asymptotically finitely generated contact structure in degree j with
bound bj (ξ). Let fl : Σ → R and al be the sequences
that show that ξ is asymptotically

r
finitely generated. Let W = [−∞, 0]×Σ, e ·α denote the negative symplectization of
(Σ, α).

37

Assume that W ∪H is obtained from W by attaching a subcritical k-handle H, k < n,
such that along the attaching sphere S ⊂ Σ holds that fl |S is constant and if S intersects
a Reeb orbit of αl = efl ·α twice, then the length of this orbit between the two intersections
is longer than al .

Then the contact structure on ∂ W ∪H is also symptotically finitely generated in degree
j with bound bj (ξ), unless j = (n−k)N + { 01 for N > 0 odd, then the bound is bj (ξ) + 1.
Moreover, the contact forms (βl ) that prove this can be chosen to agree with (αl ) outside
an arbitrary small neighborhood of H.
Remarks. The conditions on the attaching sphere S are automatically satisfied if αl
does not depend on l near S and if S does not lie on any closed Reeb orbit.

 that f	l (p) ≤ fl−1 (p) ≤ 0 ∀ p, l implies Wl ⊂ Wl−1 ⊂ W and that
∂Wl = Σl = (f (p), p)  p ∈ Σ .
For every l choose the handle Hl attached to Wl so thin, such that each Reeb trajectory
that leaves the attaching area and reenters it later is longer then al . This is possible
as the attaching sphere S does not intersect twice with Reeb orbits shorter then al .
Moreover, choose Hl so thin that Wl ∪Hl lies inside Wl−1 ∪Hl−1 (consult Dis. 15 on how
\
\
\
to interpret Wl ∪Hl as a subset
of Wl−1
∪Hl−1 ). Note that W
l ∪Hl and W ∪H are easily

identified since ∂ Wl ∪Hl can be understood as a contact hypersurface inside the negative symplectization of ∂ W ∪H (see Rem. 14 and Dis. 15).
If we construct the handle Hl with the help of a function ψ as in 3.2 and 3.3, then there
are no closed Reeb orbits on the handle except on the cocore and closed Reeb orbits
that go over the handle into ∂Wl are longerthen al as Hl is sufficiently thin.
Let βl denote the contact form on ∂ Wl ∪Hl . We find that βl agrees with αl away from
Hl . Moreover, the closed Reeb orbits of βl shorter than al are the same as whose of
αl plus the ones on the cocore of the handle. Of the latter there exists by (7) at most
one, if the degree j equals (n−k)N + { 01 for N > 0 odd. This gives the bound bj (ξ) or
bj (ξ) + 1.
Finally, as Wl ∪Hl ⊂ Wl−1 ∪Hl−1 ⊂
if we express βl in coordinates
 W ∪H, we find that
gl

we have

gl (p) ≤ gl−1 (p) ≤ 0
∀ p ∈ W ∪H .

This shows that the contact structure on W ∪H is a.f.g..
Theorem 2 and Proposition 20 finally enable us to prove Theorem 1.
Proof of Theorem 1.
(If (Σ2n−1 , ξ) is exactly fillable and a.f.g. in degree k ≥ n+2, then Σ carries infinitely
many different exactly fillable contact structures.)
5

As for Liouville domains, one can define the completion for any exact symplectic manifold V with
positive contact boundary Σ by glueing the positive symplectization of Σ to V along the boundary
∂V = Σ.

• Step 1 : It was shown in the authors thesis, [13] Thm. 109, that for any n ≥ 3 and
k ≥ n+2 there is a Brieskorn manifold Σa diffeomorphic to S 2n−1 with an exact
contact filling Va such that
2
SHk (Va , Σa ) = Z2 .
(∗)
Actually, the result was shown for Rabinowitz-Floer homology RFH, but the same
arguments or the long exact sequence relating SH and RFH (see [8], (3)) can be
used to deduce the same result for Symplectic homology. Explicitly, Σa can be
chosen as

Σa = z∈Cn+1 z02 +z12 +z22 +z3a3 +...+znan = 0, ||z||2 =1 , min aj > k−n+3,

where the aj are sufficiently large positive odd integers satisfying gcd(ai , aj ) = 1
for i 6= j. This Brieskorn manifold carries a standard contact structure ξa with
contact form αa and an exact filling Va (see 4.1 for a general introduction in
Brieskorn manifolds). We claim that (Σa , ξa ) has a contact form αa0 which has no
totally periodic Reeb flow and is a.f.g. with bound
bk (ξa ) = 2

for

n < k < n−3 + min aj .

Note that for L < π· min aj , all L-periodic Ra0 -orbits are circles living either in the
first or second coordinate. Using the general formula (13) for the Conley-Zehnder
index on a Brieskorn manifold, one can then show that for n < k < n−3 + min aj
there are exactly two closed Ra0 -orbits having Morse-Bott index k.
• Step 2 : Now let (Σ, ξ) be any asymptotically finitely generated contact manifold in
degree k with bound bk (ξ) and with an exact filling (V, λ) with well-defined ConleyZehnder index (conditions on π1 (Σ) and c1 (T V )). Let us denote by Σ#Σa the
connected sum and by ξ#ξa the resulting contact structure. Taking the boundary
connected sum of (V, Σ) with N copies of (Va , Σa ) yields by the Invariance Theorem

bk (ξ) + 3Nl < (3·2l + 1)(bk (ξ) + 1) ≤ 2·2l+1 (bk (ξ) + 1) = 2Nl+1 ≤ 2Nm .

Thus ξ#(#N

• Bonus : All contact structures ξ#(#N
j=1 ξa ) for different values of N ∈ N∪{0} are
different. To show this, let us abbreviate ξ#(#N
j=1 ξa ) by ξ#N ·ξa . We argue by
contradiction. Assume that there exists M < N with ξ#M ·ξa contactomorphic to
ξ#N ·ξa , then we have
ξ#(N +K)ξa = ξ#N ·ξa #K·ξa ∼
= ξ#M ·ξa #K·ξa = ξ#(M +K)ξa

∀ K∈N.

In particular for K = N −M , we have
ξ#(M +2K)·ξa = ξ#(N +K)·ξa ∼
= ξ#N ·ξa ∼
= ξ#M ·ξa .
Repeatig this argument, we find that ξ#(M +lK)·ξa ∼
= ξ#ξa for all l ∈ N. However, for l sufficiently large, we know by Step 2 that these two contact structures
are different, thus providing a contradiction.

4. Brieskorn manifolds
4.1. General results
In this subsection, we recall the construction of Brieskorn manifolds and their contact structures and fillings. Moreover, we give their Symplectic homology and present
Ustilovsky’s infinitely many different contact structures on S 4m+1 . This is a shortened

40

version of a similar section in [12].
Let a = (a0 , a1 , ... , an ) be a vector of natural numbers with ai ≥ 2 and define a complex
polynomial f ∈ C ∞ (Cn+1 ) by
f (z) = z0a0 + z1a1 + ... + znan .
Its level sets Va (t) := f −1 (t) are smooth complex hypersurfaces except for Va (0), which
has a single singularity at zero. The link of this singularity Σa := Va (0) ∩ S 2n+1 is the
Brieskorn manifold Σa . In [21], Lutz and Meckert proved that the following 1-form λa
on Cn+1 restricts to a contact form αa := λa |Σ on Σa with Reeb vector field Ra :

In order to define a Symplectic homology associated with Σa , we need a Liouville domain
(V, λ) with contact boundary (Σa , αa ). Unfortunately, we cannot take Va (0) ∩ B1 (0), due
to the singularity at 0. We overcome this obstacle by constructing an interpolation
between Va (0) and Va (ε) for ε > 0 small. To do this, choose a smooth monotone
decreasing cut-off function β ∈ C ∞ (R) with β(x) = 1 for x ≤ 1/4 and β(x) = 0 for
x ≥ 3/4. Then define

n
o

Va := Vε ∩ B1 (0), where Vε := z ∈ Cn+1  z0a0 + z1a1 + ... + znan = ε · β ||z||2 .
For ε small enough, (Va , λa ) is a Liouville domain with boundary (Σa , αa ) and vanishing
first Chern class c1 (T V ) (see [12], Prop. 2.1.3 or [13], Prop. 99).
Let ξa := ker αa denote the contact structure on Σa defined by αa and consider on Cn+1
the symplectic form ωa = dλa with Liouville vector field Yλ , explicitly given by:

The flow ϕta of Ra is given by
ϕta (z) = e4it/a0 · z0 , . . . , e4it/an · zn .
We can obviously view Ra and ϕta as being defined on Cn+1 instead of Σa . This allows
us to calculate Conley-Zehnder indices directly on T Cn+1 instead of T Σa . The action of

41

Dϕta on T Cn+1 in terms of the standard trivialization is given by the path of diagonal
matrices:

Φt := Dϕta = diag e4it/a0 , . . . , e4it/an ∈ Sp(2n + 2).
Using the above trivialization of ξa⊥ by X1 , Y1 , X2 , Y2 , we find by some calculation that
the action of Dϕta on ξa⊥ is given by



Dϕta Y1 (z) = e4it · Y1 ϕta (z) ,



Dϕta Y2 (z) = Y2 ϕta (z) .
Dϕta X2 (z) = X2 ϕta (z) ,
The action of Dϕta on ξa⊥ in this trivialization is hence the path of diagonal matrices:
Φt2 := diag(e4it , 1) ∈ Sp(4).
Any trivialization of ξa over a disc u ⊂ Σa , with ∂u = v being a Reeb trajectory, provides
us with a linearization Φt1 ∈ Sp(2n−2) of ϕta on ξa . Using this trivialization of ξa together
with the above trivialization of ξa⊥ gives a trivialization of T Cn+1 , which is homotopic to
the standard one, as T Cn+1 is trivial. Therefore, we obtain that Φt = Ψt (Φt1 ⊕Φt2 )(Ψ0 )−1

Let us leave now the general picture and turn to the Brieskorn manifolds, where
a = (2, ..., 2, p) ∈ Nn+1 , p odd and n = 2m+1 odd.
For fixed p, we write Σp , ξp , αp , λp , Vp instead of Σa , ξa , αa , λa , Va . In [4], Brieskorn showed
that Σp is a 4m+1-dimensional homotopy sphere. Moreover, he showed that Σp is
diffeomorphic to S 4m+1 if and only if p ≡ ±1 mod 8 and diffeomorphic to the Kervaire
sphere otherwise.

On Σp , the Reeb flow ϕtp is of the form ϕtp (z) = e2it ·z0 , ... , e2it ·zn−1 , e4it/p ·zn .
If we set t = Lπ/2, we see that ϕtp has closed periodic orbits exactly for t ∈ πZ ⇔
L ∈ 2Z. Note that we do not have closed orbits of period t = k p2 π ⇔ L = kp, since any
point z in Σp has at least two non-zero components, so that (0, ..., 0, e4it/p ·zn ) 6∈ Σp . The
closed orbits associated to a period t = Lπ/2 form manifolds N L of two types:

• if p | L, then N L = Σp , which is for p ≡ ±1 mod 8 diffeomorphic to S 2n−1 .

On S ∗ S n−1 there exists a Morse function with exactly 4 critical points of Morse indices
0, n−2, n−1, 2n−3. On S 2n−1 there exists a Morse function having exactly 2 critical
points of Morse index 0 and 2n−1. Let us denote these critical points by

The ranks at the place of ? are not known, but are either 0 or 1.

Proof: In [12], it is shown that the Rabinowitz-Floer homology groups RF Hk (Vp , Σp )
are Z2 , ? or 0 depending on k in exactly the same way as in this theorem (but for all
k, not only k ≥ n). Note that in [12] a different index convention is used, so that all
indices there are shifted by (n−2) + 1 in comparison to our indices here.
The Rabinowitz-Floer homology is, apart from the constant orbits, also generated by the
Lγc . It was shown via an action estimate that the boundary operator vanishes for almost
all indices k (the only exceptions being whose where the ? appears). The same argument
can be used to show that this holds also true for Symplectic homology. Alternatively,
one can use the following long exact sequence from [8], (3), relating singular, symplectic
and Rabinowitz-Floer homology
H −k+n (Vp , Σp ) → SHk (Vp , Σp ) → RF Hk≥0 (Vp , Σp ) → H −k+n+1 (Vp , Σp )

(11)

Note that on Σp the Morse-Bott index µ is positive only if the period of the closed Reeb
orbit is non-negative. Hence we have for k > 0 that RF Hk≥0 (Vp , Σp ) = RF Hk (Vp , Σp ).
As furthermore both singular homology groups vanish for k ≥ n, we find that (11)
reduces to an isomorphism between SHk (Vp , Σp ) and RF Hk (Vp , Σp ) for k ≥ n. Hence,
the theorem is obtained from the similar result for Rabinowitz-Floer homology.
Theorem 24 (Ustilovsky, [29]).
The contact structures ξp on S 4m+1 are pairwise non-contactomorphic.
Proof: In [12] and [13], it is also shown that RF Hk (Vp , Σp ) is independent of the
filling. This result was then used to show that the contact structures ξp on S 4m+1 are
all different for m > 1. Here is a slightly different proof for this crucial fact: For p < q
consider the index
l m
−2 = fp (p+2) − 2
k = (p+1)(n−2) + 2 = (p+1)(n−2) + 2 p+2
p
l m
= fq (p+2).
= (p+1)(n−2) + 2 p+2
q
As k ≥ n, we know by Theorem 23 for the filling Vq of (Σq , αq ) that SHk (Vq , Σp ) = Z2 .
On the other hand, there is by Proposition 22 on (Σp , αp ) no closed Reeb orbit having
index k. Hence it follows for every filling V of Σp that SHk (V, Σp ) = 0, i.e. Vq is not a
filling of (Σp , ξp ). Therefore (Σp , ξp ) and (Σq , ξq ) cannot be contactomorphic.

4.2. Connected sums of Brieskorn spheres
We saw that the Reeb flow ϕtp of αp on Σp is totally periodic. Unfortunately, the contact
surgery construction needs at least one point that does not lie on a closed Reeb orbit.
For this purpose, we will perturb αp to a new contact form αp0 defining the same contact
structure ξp . We will use a perturbation due to Uebele, [28], which is similar to the
one used by Ustilovsky in [29]. Note that this is a different perturbation from the one
described in the appedix. The advantage of this perturbation here is that the resulting

44

bounds bk (ξp0 ) on the number of generators for symplectic homology are smaller. First,
we make the following change of coordinates

In these coordinates Σp = w ∈ C

Next we introduce the new contact form αp0 := K −1 ·αp , where

K(w) := ||w||2 + ε |w0 |2 − |w1 |2
and ε > 0 is a sufficiently small irrational number. As αp0 is obtained from αp by
multiplication with a positive function, they define the same contact structure. In fact,
αp0 should be though of as the restriction of λp to the hypersurface Σ0p ⊂ R×Σp inside

Σ0p := − log K(y), y  y ∈ Σp .

Note that the flow of Rp0 is no longer totally periodic. In particular points w ∈ Σp with
w0 , w1 , w2 all non-zero do not lie on any closed Reeb orbit.
For the computation of the Conley-Zehnder indices of the closed orbits, we can still use
the symplectic form ωp instead of d(K −1 λp ), as ωp |ξp = K·d(K −1 λp )|ξp . Hence, the same

From the above calculations, we can directly read off the number bk (ξp0 ) of closed Reeb
orbits of αp0 having Morse-Bott index as:

We see that non-zero entries for bk (ξp0 ) come in blocks indexed by fp (l), which we may

We remark that of course SHk (Vp , Σp ) = SHk (Vp , Σ0p ). However, a comparison with
Prop. 22 shows that after the perturbation of the contact form we find that bk (ξp0 ) is
bigger then bk (ξp0 ). This means in particular that the Floer-boundary operator ∂ after
perturbation is non-zero on more elements.
Now, let us for J ∈ N denote by #Jj=1 Σp the J-fold connected sum of the Brieskorn manifold Σp . As Σp is homeomorphic to S 2n−1 , it follows that #Jj=1 Σp is also homeomorphic
to S 2n−1 and for p ≡ ±1 mod 8 both homeomorphisms are even diffeomorphisms. Let
us denote by #Jj=1 ξp the corresponding contact structure on S 2n−1 .
Theorem 25. Let n ≥ 5 and I, J, p, q ∈ N be arbitrary with p, q ≥ 3 odd. If (J, p) 6=
(I, q), then it holds that #Jj=1 ξp and #Ii=1 ξq are non-contactomorphic contact structures
on S 2n−1 .

A. Pertubing totally periodic Reeb flows
The purpose of this appendix is to show that contact manifolds which admit a contact
form with totally periodic Reeb flow are asymptotically finitely generated in every degree,
in particular via contact forms what are not totally periodic. We need such contact forms
for the estimate of the symplectic homology of conntected sums with these manifolds
(see Prop. 20).

A.1. Setup
Let (Σ, α) be a compact (2n−1)-dimensional contact manifold with contact structure
ξ = ker α and Reeb vector field R such that the flow ϕt of R is totally periodic, i.e.
there exists a time T0 > 0 with ϕT0 = IdΣ . As R(p) 6= 0 for all p ∈ Σ, it follows that the
length of a closed Reeb orbit is bounded from below. Furthermore, any length T ≤ T0
of a closed Reeb orbit must satisfy T0 /T ∈ N. These two facts imply that there are only
finitely many 0 < T1 < ... < TN < T0 such that Tj is the length of a closed Reeb orbit.
The set of diffeomorphisms {ϕTj | 0 ≤ j ≤ N } clearly carries the structure of a finite
abelian group which acts on Σ. Let F ix(ϕTj ) = {p∈Σ | ϕTj (p)=p} denote the fixed
point set of ϕTj . For every finite group action on a manifold Σ one can always find an
invariant Riemannian metric g on Σ. Using the exponential map of such a g, we can
find an ϕTj -invariant neighborhood U around any p ∈ F ix(ϕTj ) such that the action
of ϕTj on U is conjugated to the action of Dp ϕTj on Tp Σ restricted to a sufficiently
small neighborhood B of the origin. We find that U ∩ F ix(ϕTj ) is conjugated to B ∩
F ix(Dp ϕTj ) = B ∩ ker(Dp ϕTj −1). This shows that F ix(ϕTj ) is a submanifold of Σ and
that Tp F ix(ϕTj ) = ker(Dp ϕTj −1).

50

As the F ix(ϕTj ) = N Tj = N Tj +k·T0 , k ∈ N, are exactly the sets formed by the periodic
orbits of R, we find that every contact manifold (Σ, α) with totally periodic Reeb flow
satisfies the Morse-Bott assumption (MB). Moreover, ξ is an asymptotically finitely
generated contact structure in almost all degrees. Indeed, if the mean index ∆(Σ) of the
principal orbit Σ = F ix(ϕT0 ) = N T0 is non-zero, then we find by the iterations formula
(4) that the Conley-Zehnder index of the orbits N Tj +k·T0 growths approximately linear
in k with slope ∆(Σ). Hence there are only finitely many closed Reeb orbits having any
given Morse-Bott index k. If however ∆(Σ) = 0, then the iterations formla implies that
the Morse-Bott index of any closed Reeb orbit stays in the inervall [−3(n−1, 3(n−1)],
so that no closed orbit has a Morse-Bott index k with |k| > 3(n−1).

A.2. An explicit perturbation
The following construction was first described in [2], section 2. We present it here for
readability and to add some details missing in the original argument.
In order to pertub
we first construct positive Morse functions f¯1 , ..., f¯N , f¯0 on the orbit
 α,
Tj
1
spaces F ix(ϕ ) S which we denote by Qj . Note that Qj is in general a symplectic
orbifold as the Reeb flow does not act freely on F ix(ϕTj ) if there exists an i < j such
that Ti |Tj . We construct the f¯j by the following inductive procedure:
1. Q1 is in fact a smooth manifold. Thus pick any positive Morse function f¯1 on Q1 .
S
2. For Qj , j > 1, the singular set of Qj is exactly Sj = Ti |Tj Qi . At first extend
for every i < j with Ti |Tj the functions f¯i to a function f˜j on a small tubular
neighborhood of Sj via the quadratic function v 7→ ||v||2g on the normal bundles to
Qi in Qj (here, g is a fixed invariant metric on Σ). Then extend f˜j to a positive
Morse function f¯j on Qj . If Qj has no singular set, pick any positive Morse
function.


3. Repeate this procedure for all j, in particular up to Q0 = F ix(ϕT0 ) S 1 = Σ S 1 .
Now lift f¯0 to Σ to obtain a function f which is invariant under the Reeb flow ϕt . As
R ∈ ker df for any ϕt -invariant function f and as ξ = ker α and α ∧ (dα)n−1 is nondegenerate, we can associate to any ϕt -invariant function a unique Hamiltonian vector
field Xf by the two conditions
Xf (p) ∈ ξ(p) ∀p ∈ Σ

and

dα(·, Xf ) = df.

Now set αλ := (1+λf )·α as the perturbed contact form. Then, we find that the Reeb
vector field Rλ of αλ is

that the flows of 1+λf R and (1+λf )2 Xf commute. This implies that the flow of Rλ is the
composition of these two flows. Closed orbits of Rλ are therefore compositions of closed

orbits of 1+λf
R and (1+λf
X , where both orbits have the same starting point and the
)2 f
same period.
In particular, we have closed orbits of Rλ through any critical point p of f . These
correspond exactly to critical points of f¯0 . As f¯0 is Morse, we find that the Hessian of
f in the normal direction to the closed R-orbit through p is positive definite and hence
that these closed orbits of Rλ are non-degenerate.
On the other hand we can choose for any given T > 0 the constant λ so small that the
−λ
X are the constant ones (see Prop. 26 below). This
only T -periodic orbits of (1+λf
)2 f
implies that for any given T and λ sufficiently small the only closed orbits of Rλ with
period less than T are those over critical points of f¯0 . As f¯0 is Morse on a compact set,
we find that there are only finitely many of them. In [2], Lem. 2.4, the Conley-Zehnder
index of these orbits through p ∈ F ix(ϕk·Tj ) was calculated as

Here, f¯k·Tj = f¯i for kTj ≡ Ti mod T0 . If the mean index ∆(Σ) of the principal orbit
is zero, then this implies that all Conley-Zehnder indices of closed orbits of Rλ shorter
then T stay in the interval [−3(n−1), 3(n−1)]. If ∆(Σ) is non-zero, then only finitely
many of these orbits have degree k for any given integer k.
Hence, we can choose sequences Tl → ∞ and λl → 0 such that (αλl ) shows that ξ = ker α
is asymptotically finitely generated in degree k, for any k if ∆(Σ) 6= 0 or for |k| > 3(n−1)
if ∆(Σ) = 0. Moreover, the Reeb flow for any αλl is not totally periodic.
To finish the argument, we only need (as mentioned) the following contact version of
the well-known fact that for any C 2 -small Hamiltonian the only 1-periodic orbits of XH
are the constant ones at critical points of H.
Proposition 26. Let (Σ, α) be a compact contact manifold with Reeb vector field R and
let H : Σ → R be a smooth function which is invariant under the flow of R. Then there
exists a constant T > 0 such that each closed orbit of the Hamiltonian vector field XH
(as defined above) with period less than T is a constant orbit at a critical point of H.
Proof: Assume that there exists a sequence of closed XH orbits (γl ) with periods
Tl , liml→∞ Tl = 0. As Σ is compact, we may assume by the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem
that (γl ) converges uniformly to a closed XH -orbit γ with period T = 0. Hence, γ is a
constant orbit at a critical point p of H, as dα(·, XH ) = dH.
Around p we can find by the contact version of Darboux’s Theorem (see [15], Thm. 2.5.1)
a neighborhood U and coordinates x1 , ..., xn−1 , y1 , ..., yn−1 , z such that p = (0, ..., 0) and
α|U = dz +

xj dyj .

Note that ∂z is the Reeb vector field in these coordinates. Without loss of generality
we may assume that U = (−ε, ε)2n−1 for some small ε > 0. The quotient Q of U under
the flow of the Reeb vector field ∂z is then easily identified with (−ε, ε)2n−2
P with the
coordinates xj , yj , j = 1, ..., n−1. On Q we have the symplectic form ω̄ = j dxj ∧dyj .
If π : U → Q denotes the quotient map, then it is easy to see that π ∗ ω̄ = dα. Moreover,
as H is invariant under the flow of ∂z , we find that it descends to a function H̄ on
Q with H̄ ◦ π = H. Consequently, we find that the Hamiltonian vector fields satisfy
dπ(XH ) = XH̄ . Thus, any closed XH -orbit γ in U yields a closed XH̄ -orbit γ̄ = π ◦ γ in
Q of the same period.
P
Now recall that on R2n−2 with the symplectic form j dxj ∧dyj it is a well-known fact
that there exists for a C 2 -bounded autonomous Hamiltonian H̄ a constant T such that
any closed XH̄ -orbit of period less then T is constant (see [19], Lemma 2.2). Thus almost
all of the γl are constant. Moreover, since Σ is compact, we can cover the critical set
of H by a finite number of Darboux charts and H is C 2 -bounded in all of them. Thus
we can find a global constant T such that every closed XH -orbit of period less than T
is constant.
