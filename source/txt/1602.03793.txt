Orderability and Dehn filling
Marc Culler and Nathan M. Dunfield

Abstract. Motivated by conjectures relating group orderability, Floer homology, and taut foliations, we discuss a systematic and broadly applicable technique for constructing left-orders on the fundamental groups of rational homology 3-spheres. Specifically, for a compact 3-manifold M with torus boundary, we
give several criteria which imply that whole intervals of Dehn fillings of M have
left-orderable fundamental groups. Our technique uses certain representations

from π1 (M ) into PSL
2 R, which we organize into an infinite graph in H (∂M ; R)
called the translation extension locus. We include many plots of such loci which
inform the proofs of our main results and suggest interesting avenues for future
research.

1 Introduction
A group is called left-orderable when it admits a total ordering that is invariant under left multiplication (see [CR] for an introduction to the role of orderable groups
in topology). We will say that a closed 3-manifold Y is orderable when π1 (Y ) is leftorderable. (Technical aside: by convention, the trivial group is not left-orderable,
and so S 3 is not orderable.) Our focus here is on the following question: given a
compact orientable 3-manifold M with torus boundary, which Dehn fillings of M
are orderable? We care about this question because of its relationship with the following conjecture.
1.1 Conjecture. For an irreducible Q-homology 3-sphere Y , the following are
equivalent:
(1) Y is orderable;
(2) Y is not an L-space;
(3) Y admits a co-orientable taut foliation.
Recall from [OS2] that an L-space is a Q-homology 3-sphere with minimal Heegaard
c ) = |H1 (Y ; Z)|. The equivalence of
Floer homology, specifically one where dim HF(Y
(1) and (2) was boldly postulated by Boyer, Gordon, and Watson in [BGW], which
includes a detailed discussion of this conjecture. The equivalence of (2) and (3) was
formulated as a question by Ozsváth and Szabó after they proved that (3) implies (2)
[OS1, KR, Bow]. On its face, Conjecture 1.1 is quite surprising given the disparate nature of these three conditions, but there are actually a number of interconnections
between them summarized in Figure 1. Despite much initial skepticism, substantial evidence has accumulated in favor of Conjecture 1.1. For example, it holds for
all graph manifolds [HRRW, BC], many branched covers of knots in the 3-sphere
([GL2] and references therein), as well as more than 100,000 small-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds [Dun2].
Here, we provide further evidence for Conjecture 1.1 by giving tools that order
whole families of Q-homology 3-spheres arising by Dehn filling a fixed manifold
with torus boundary. To formulate our first main result, we introduce a new concept: a knot exterior is called lean when the longitudinal Dehn filling M (0) is prime
and every closed essential surface in M (0) is a fiber in a fibration over S 1 . (See Section 2 for precise definitions of standard terminology and conventions used in this
introduction.)

Figure 1. Some results related to Conjecture 1.1, which asserts the equivalence of the
three circled conditions. Here Y is an irreducible Q-homology 3-sphere, all foliations
are co-orientable, and all actions are nontrivial, faithful, and orientation preserving;
the solid arrows are theorems and dotted ones conjectures. See [BGW] for a complete
discussion.

1.2 Theorem. Suppose M is the exterior of a knot in a Z-homology 3-sphere. If M
is lean and its Alexander polynomial ∆M has a simple root on the unit circle, then
there exists a > 0 such that for every rational r ∈ (−a, a) the Dehn filling M (r ) is
orderable.
In fact, with slightly more technical hypotheses, we extend this result to Q-homology 3-spheres in Theorem 7.1 below. The latter result also weakens the requirement that M is lean, replacing it by a condition involving PSL2 C-character varieties.
Combining Theorem 1.2 with Roberts’ construction of foliations on Dehn fillings of
fibered manifolds in [Rob] immediately gives:
1.3 Corollary. Suppose M is the exterior of a knot in a Z-homology 3-sphere.
Suppose that M is lean and fibers over the circle. If ∆M has a simple root on the
unit circle, then Conjecture 1.1 holds for all M (r ) with r ∈ (−a, a) for some a > 0.
In particular, these M (r ) are orderable and have a co-orientable taut foliation.
Our second main result is the following, and applies to branched covers as well
as Dehn fillings; see Section 8 for the definition of the trace field of a hyperbolic
3-manifold.

1.4 Theorem. Let K be a hyperbolic knot in a Z-homology 3-sphere Y . If the trace
field of the knot exterior M has a real embedding then:
(1) For all sufficiently large n, the n-fold cyclic cover of Y branched over K is
orderable.
(2) There is an interval I of the form (−∞, a) or (a, ∞) so that the Dehn filling
M (r ) is orderable for all rational r ∈ I .
(3) There exists b > 0 so that for every rational r ∈ (−b, 0)∪(0, b) the Dehn filling
M (r ) is orderable.
The reason the slope 0 is excluded from the conclusion in (3) is that M (0) might
have a lens space connect-summand and hence not be orderable. Part (1) of Theorem 1.4 was also proven independently by Steven Boyer (personal communication);
the lemma behind part (3) was pointed out to us by Ian Agol and David Futer.
1.5 Translation extension loci. We prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.4 by studying repâ
resentations of 3-manifold groups into the nonlinear Lie group Ge = PSL
2 R. Using
such representations to order 3-manifold groups goes back at least to [EHN], and
has been exploited repeatedly of late to provide evidence for Conjecture 1.1. Closest to our results here, representations to Ge were used to obtain ordering results
for Dehn surgeries on two-bridge knots in [HT, Tra2], as well as branched covers of
two-bridge knots in [Hu, Tra1]. Indeed, some of the results on branched covers in
[Hu, Tra1, Gor] can be viewed as special cases of both the statement and the proof
of Theorem 1.4(a).
Our main contribution here is to provide a framework for systematically studying representations to Ge in a way tailored for applications such as Theorems 1.2
and 1.4. Specifically, given the exterior M of a knot in a Q-homology sphere, we organize the representations of π(M ) → Ge that are elliptic on π1 (∂M ) into a graph in
H 1 (∂M ; R) called the translation extension locus and denoted ELGe (M ). Very roughly,
the locus ELGe (M ) is the image of the “character variety of Ge representations” of
π1 (M ) in the corresponding object for π1 (∂M ) under the map induced by ∂M ,→ M ;
as such, it parallels the A-polynomial story of [CCGLS]. This locus was first studied
by Khoi in his computations of Seifert volumes of certain hyperbolic 3-manifolds
[Khoi]. While the graph ELGe (M ) is infinite, it is actually compact modulo a discrete
group of symmetries, and so it is possible to draw a picture of it: see Figure 2 for
some examples, and Section 5 for many more.
To prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.4, we give a simple criteria (Lemma 4.4) which says
roughly that if the line in H 1 (∂M ; R) of slope −r meets ELGe (M ) away from the origin,
then the Dehn surgery M (r ) is orderable. (Lemma 4.5 is our analogous result for
branched covers.) In Section 5, we use Lemma 4.4 to order large intervals of Dehn

Figure 2. Some translation extension loci that are discussed in detail in Section 5.

fillings in some specific examples; indeed, the conclusions of Theorems 1.2 and 1.4
are much weaker than what we typically observe in practice.
Once we establish the basic properties of these loci in Theorem 4.3, our main
results are proved by using the given hypotheses to produce at least a small arc of
ELGe (M ) in a certain location in H 1 (∂M ; R), and then applying Lemma 4.4 at many
points along the arc. For Theorem 1.2, we build the arc by using [HP2] to deform
reducible representations corresponding to a root of ∆M on the unit circle to more
interesting representations in PSL2 R. In Theorem 1.4, we first use a combination of
hyperbolic geometry and algebraic geometry to produce an arc which contains (the
image of) the representation associated with the real embedding of the trace field.
The key issue of the arc’s location in H 1 (∂M ; R) hinges on the result of [Cal1, Corollary 2.4] that for a lift of the holonomy representation of the hyperbolic structure of
M to SL2 C the trace of the longitude is −2 rather than 2.
1.6 Applicability. While there are many cases where neither Theorem 1.2 or Theorem 1.4 applies, we next argue that some of their hypotheses are quite generic and
therefore our results should be interpreted as providing a profusion of orderable
3-manifolds.
For example, the Alexander polynomial hypothesis of Theorem 1.2 holds for the
vast majority of the simpler 3-manifolds that one can tabulate: specifically, it occurs

6

for 81.2% of the 1.7 million prime knots with at most 16 crossings [HTW] and 96.2%
of the 59,068 hyperbolic Q-homology solid tori that can be triangulated with at most
9 ideal tetrahedra [Bur]. We also looked at more complicated knots by taking braid
closures of random 10-strand braids with 100–1,000 crossings (conditioned on the
closure being a knot rather than a link); of the 100,000 such knots we examined,
some 99.87% had Alexander polynomial with a simple root on the unit circle. Finally, of particular interest in light of Conjecture 1.1 are the L-space knots in S 3 ,
that is, those with a non-trivial Dehn surgery producing an L-space. The Alexander polynomials of such knots have a very special form [OS2, Corollary 1.3], and it
follows from [KM] that L-space knots have ∆M with a root on the unit circle; experimentally, there is always a simple root, but we are unable to prove this.
Turning to Theorem 1.4, it is also very common for a hyperbolic 3-manifold to
have a trace field with a real embedding. For example, Goerner [Goe] has calculated
the trace fields of all 61,911 cusped manifolds that can be triangulated with at most
9 ideal tetrahedra [Bur]. Among these, some 95.5% had trace fields with a real embedding. Indeed, about 36.3% of the roots of the polynomials defining these fields
were real. We conjecture that, for any reasonable model of a random hyperbolic
3-manifold, the trace field has a real embedding with probability one.
In contrast, the leanness condition of Theorem 1.2, whose use in the proof is
more technical, is hardly ubiquitous. While it can easily be arranged by, for example,
taking the exterior of a knot in S 2 ×S 1 which generates H1 (S 2 ×S 1 ; Z), it seems that a
generic knot in S 3 is not lean: work of Gabai [Gab] implies that a lean knot must be
fibered, and the latter condition is experimentally probability 0 in the above models
of random knots (see also [DT]). That said, the strengthened version of Theorem 1.2,
namely Theorem 7.1, requires the weaker hypothesis that M is longitudinally rigid
(see Section 7). This condition might well be generic—we know of only a few cases
where it fails—but unfortunately it is hard to study in bulk.
1.7 Outline of the rest of the paper. Sections 2 and 3 review some definitions and
background results; Section 2 discusses topology, character varieties, and real algee Section 4 defines the
braic geometry, whereas Section 3 is focused on the group G.
translation extension locus and states its basic properties. Section 5 is the longest
and arguably the heart of the paper; it gives 12 examples of translation extension
loci and discusses their properties as they relate to our results here. Section 6 proves
the basic structure result for these loci (Theorem 4.3), as well as Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5.
Sections 7 and 8 then prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.4 respectively. Section 8 includes
Remark 8.7 which answers [LW, Question 6] by giving an example of a hyperbolic
Q-homology solid torus that is not fibered and where every non-longitudinal Dehn
filling is an L-space. Finally, Section 9 lists ten related open problems.

2 Background
2.1 Topological terminology and conventions. We first review some basic concepts that will be used throughout this paper, and in the process set some standing
conventions. First, all 3-manifolds will be assumed connected and orientable unless noted otherwise. A knot K in a 3-manifold Y is a smoothly embedded S 1 inside
of Y . The exterior of K is Y with an open tubular neighborhood about K removed;
this is a compact 3-manifold with boundary a torus. A Q-homology 3-sphere is a
closed 3-manifold whose rational homology is the same as that of S 3 ; a Z-homology
3-sphere is defined analogously. A Q-homology solid torus is a compact 3-manifold M with boundary a torus where H∗ (M ; Q) ∼
= H∗ (D 2 × S 1 ; Q); this is equivalent
to M being the exterior of a knot in some Q-homology 3-sphere. Analogously, a
Z-homology solid torus is a compact 3-manifold M with boundary a torus where
H∗ (M ; Z) ∼
= H∗ (D 2 ×S 1 ; Z); again, this is equivalent to M being the exterior of a knot
in a Z-homology 3-sphere.
We call a compact orientable surface F in a 3-manifold M essential when it is
properly embedded, incompressible, and not boundary parallel; here, incompressible means that π1 (F ) → π1 (M ) is injective and that F is not a 2-sphere bounding a
3-ball.
2.2 Framings and slopes. For a Q-homology solid torus M , we denote the inclusion
map of its boundary by ι : ∂M → M . We define a homologically natural framing to
be a generating set (µ, λ) for H1 (∂M ; Z) where ι∗ (λ) = 0 in the rational homology
H1 (M ; Q). While the homological longitude λ is defined up to sign, there are infinitely many choices for µ.
An isotopy class of unoriented essential simple closed curves in ∂M is called a
slope. A slope can be recorded by a primitive element in H1 (∂M ; Z) which is welldefined up to sign. Once we fix a framing (µ, λ) for ∂M , we shall identify slopes with
elements of Q ∪ {∞} via p/q ↔ ±(pµ + qλ).

8

2.3 Representation and character varieties. Throughout this paper, we will use G C
to denote the Lie group PSL2 C ∼
= PGL2 C. We now review some basic facts about representation and character varieties with target group G C ; for details, see e.g. [HP1].
For a compact manifold M , the representation space R(M ) = Hom(π1 (M ),G C ) is an
affine algebraic set in some Cn . However, we are usually only interested in representations up to conjugacy by elements of G C , so we consider the minimal Hausdorff
quotient X (M ) of R(M ) generated by the orbits of the conjugation action of G C .
Equivalently, X (M ) is the invariant theory quotient R(M )//G C ; hence X (M ) is again
an affine algebraic set, which is referred to as the G C -character variety of M . (These
algebraic sets are not always irreducible, but we still refer to them as “varieties” for
historical reasons.) For each group element γ ∈ π1 (M ), there is a regular function
¡ ¢
¡
¢2
tr2γ : X (M ) → C given by tr2γ [ρ] = tr ρ(γ) ; we must take the square here because
the trace of a matrix in G C is only defined up to sign. One can always choose a finite
set of elements in π1 (M ) so that the corresponding tr2 functions give a complete
system of coordinates for the affine algebraic set X (M ) [HP1, Corollary 2.3].
We will frequently regard G C as the group of orientation preserving isometries
of hyperbolic 3-space H3 . The group G C acts on P1 (C) by Möbius transformations,
2 ∼ 1
in a way that extends the action on H3 to the sphere at infinity ∂H3 = S ∞
= P (C).
A representation ρ ∈ R(M ) is called reducible when ρ(π1 (M )) fixes a point in P1 (C)
under the Möbius action of G C ; otherwise ρ is called irreducible. A character χ ∈
X (M ) is called reducible if any (equivalently all) representations ρ mapping to χ
are reducible, and analogously for irreducible. While non-conjugate representations can have the same character, this can only happen in the reducible case [HP1,
Lemma 3.15].
Now suppose M is a compact 3-manifold with torus boundary, and let ι : ∂M →
M be the inclusion map. By restricting representations, we get an induced regular map ι∗ : X (M ) → X (∂M ). We will need the following fact in the proof of Theorem 4.3.
2.4 Lemma. The image of ι∗ : X (M ) → X (∂M ) has complex dimension at most 1.
For SL2 C-character varieties, rather than the G C ones we work with here, the corresponding result is [CL, Corollary 10.1]. As not every representation π1 (M ) → G C
lifts to SL2 C by [HP1, Theorem 1.4], we must prove Lemma 2.4 directly. However,
the argument is essentially identical to the SL2 C case, and the proof may be safely
skipped at first reading.
Proof of Lemma 2.4. We identify π1 (∂M ) with Z⊕Z via a fixed framing (µ, λ). We will
view the character variety X (∂M ) as the minimal Hausdorff quotient of R(∂M ) =
Hom(Z ⊕ Z,G C ) by the conjugation action. It is shown in [HP2, Lemma 7.4] that

9

R(∂M ) has exactly two irreducible components. The first consists exactly of the conjugacy class of a representation onto a Klein 4-group whose non-trivial elements are
rotations about three mutually orthogonal lines in H3 . The other component consists of representations that either send both µ and λ to non-parabolic elements
with a common axis, or to parabolic elements with a common fixed point. By [HP2,
Lemma 7.4], this component is 4-dimensional and smooth away from the trivial
representation. We will denote its image in X (∂M ) by D. The conjugacy class of
a non-parabolic representation is closed and isomorphic to the coset space G C /S,
where S is the stabilizer of the axis in G C , and so the conjugacy class has dimension 2. The conjugacy class of a parabolic representation, on the other hand, is not
closed and contains the trivial representation in its closure. Thus the conjugacy
class of any parabolic representation maps to the same point in X (∂M ) as the trivial
representation. These two facts imply that the complex variety D is 2-dimensional.
Since D is the only irreducible component of X (∂M ) with dimension larger than
1, to prove the lemma it suffices to show that if Z is an irreducible component of
X (M ) such that ι∗ (Z ) ⊂ D then ι∗ (Z ) has dimension at most 1. For this it is convenient to pass to a 2-fold cover of X (M ).
Following [Dun3], we define the augmented representation variety Rb (M ) to be
the subalgebraic set of R(M ) × P1 consisting of all pairs (ρ, x) where x is a point
of P1 (C) that is fixed by the image of π1 (∂M ) under ρ ◦ ι. On a typical irreducible
component of R(M ) there are generically two points fixed by the group ρ(π1 (∂M )),
and so the projection (ρ, x) 7→ ρ gives a regular map of degree 2 onto an irreducible
component of R(M ). There is a natural diagonal action of G C on Rb (M ) which acts
by conjugation on the representation ρ and by the induced Möbius transformation
on P1 . The quotient Xb (M ) = Rb (M ) //G C is the augmented character variety of M .
The augmented representation and character varieties of the boundary torus,
b
R (∂M ) and Xb (∂M ), are defined analogously. These augmented varieties for ∂M
are in fact irreducible, since the pesky Klein 4-group representations have no fixed
points on P1 (C) and hence are missing from Rb (∂M ). Our choice of framing (µ, λ)
determines an identification of Xb (∂M ) with C× × C× as follows. If ρ is given by
µ

and ∞ denotes the point of P1 (C) with homogeneous coordinates [1 : 0], then the
G C -orbit of the pair (ρ, ∞) is identified with the point (z 2 , w 2 ), that is, with the pair
consisting of the holonomies of ρ(µ) and ρ(λ).
Since the conjugacy class of any parabolic representation of π1 (∂M ) has the
same image in X (∂M ) as the trivial representation, when Xb (∂M ) is identified with
C× × C× in this way, any pair (ρ, x) ∈ Rb (∂M ) where ρ is parabolic will be mapped to

10

(1, 1) by the quotient map Rb (∂M ) → Xb (∂M ). Also, the deck transformation for the
branched covering Xb (∂M ) → D is given by (z, w) 7→ (1/z, 1/w).
The augmented and unaugmented character varieties fit into the following commutative diagram
Xb (M )
X (M )

ι̂ ∗

ι∗

X (∂M )

in which the vertical maps are induced by the projection (ρ, x) 7→ ρ. Since the vertical maps are finite, it suffices to show that for each irreducible component Zb of
Xb (M ), its image ι̂ ∗ ( Zb) is at most 1-dimensional.
To prove this we apply the same argument used in [CL, Corollary 10.1] in the
case of SL2 C. Namely, we consider the real 1-form
ω = log |z| d arg w − log |w| d arg z
defined on C× × C× , viewed as a real manifold. The form ω is not closed since
d ω = d log |z| ∧ d arg w − d log |w| ∧ d arg z.
However, since d ω is the imaginary part of the complex 2-form d log z ∧ d log w, it
does restrict to a closed form on any complex curve in C× × C× . Moreover, it follows
from a result in Craig Hodgson’s thesis (see [CCGLS, §4.4]) that ω pulls back under
ι̂ ∗ to an exact 1-form on Zb. In fact, the pull-back of ω is equal to −2d vol where
vol is the real analytic function on Xb (M ) that assigns to ([ρ], z) the volume of the
representation ρ, as defined in [Dun1, §2.1]. (In particular, there is a mysterious
cohomology class which obstructs a given complex curve in C× ×C× from arising as
a component of the image of ι̂ ∗ .) To complete the argument, we just observe as in
[CL] that since ω is not exact on C× × C× , but pulls back to an exact 1-form on Zb, we
would obtain a contradiction if ι̂ ∗ ( Zb) were dense in C× × C× . Thus ι̂ ∗ ( Zb) must be at
most 1-dimensional, as required.
2.5 Real points. We will need a few basic facts from real algebraic geometry; for a
general reference, see [BPR]. If X is an affine algebraic set in Cn , we denote the real
points X ∩ Rn by X R . When X can be cut out by polynomials with real coefficients,
we say that X is defined over R; in this case, the set X is invariant under coordinatewise complex conjugation τ : Cn → Cn , and X R is precisely the set of fixed points of
τ. If X is a quasi-projective variety in Pn (C) that can be defined by real polynomials,
then the real points X R are again the fixed points of the involution τ on Pn (C) which
acts by complex conjugation of the projective coordinates; in any affine chart whose

11

hyperplane at infinity is defined by a real linear form, the points of X R are precisely
the points of X whose coordinates are real.
In real algebraic geometry, the projective space Pn (R) is isomorphic to an affine
algebraic variety, and hence any quasi-projective variety is isomorphic to an affine
one. When working with real algebraic varieties, it is often natural to consider the
larger collection of semialgebraic sets, that is, those defined by polynomial inequalities, and to consider properties such as irreducibility of a real algebraic set in that
enlarged category. The dimension of a real semialgebraic set is equal to its topological dimension. Here, we will need only the following three results.
2.6 Proposition [BPR, Theorem 5.43]. Suppose X is an affine real semialgebraic
set which is closed and bounded. If the dimension of X is at most 1, then X is
homeomorphic to a finite graph, where graphs are allowed to have isolated vertices.
2.7 Proposition [BPR, Theorem 5.48]. A real semialgebraic set is locally path
connected.
2.8 Proposition. Suppose X is a complex affine algebraic curve defined over R. If
x 0 is a smooth point of X that lies in X R , then x 0 has a classical neighborhood in
X R which is a smooth arc.
Proof. The curve X has finitely many singular points which are permuted by τ. Let
X 0 be the complementary set of smooth points. Now X 0 is a smooth surface and
the restriction of τ to X 0 is an orientation reversing involution. Using a Riemannian metric on X 0 which is invariant under τ, it is easy to see that X R0 is a smooth
1-manifold, proving the proposition.
2.9 Real representations. Throughout this paper, we will set G = PSL2 R and K =
PSU2 , where both groups are viewed as subgroups of G C = PSL2 C. We will also occasionally consider the subgroup PGL2 R in G C , which makes sense via the identification of PSL2 C with PGL2 C; geometrically, the subgroup PGL2 R is the full stabilizer in
G C of the copy of H2 fixed by G (in particular, PGL2 R includes orientation reversing
isometries of H2 ). We will view RG (M ) = Hom(π1 (M ),G) as a subset of R(M ), and we
will denote by XG (M ) the image of RG (M ) under the quotient map t : R(M ) → X (M ).
Thus XG (M ) ⊂ X R (M ). By [HP1, Lemma 10.1], in fact the set X R (M ) is the image of
R PGL2 R (M ) ∪ R K (M ) under t . Since XG (M ) is the image of a real algebraic set under
a polynomial map, it is a real semialgebraic subset of X R (M ). Note that XG (M ) is
not the quotient of RG (M ) under the action of G by conjugation, even neglecting
the issue of nonclosed orbits; rather, it is essentially the quotient of RG (M ) under
conjugation by the larger group PGL2 R. Geometrically, the point is that PGL2 R, not

12

G, is the full stabilizer in G C = Isom+ (H3 ) of the standard H2 in H3 . Since G can
be characterized as the subgroup of PGL2 R which preserves the orientation of H2 ,
considering representations into G up to conjugacy in G C amounts to forgetting the
orientation on H2 . We also use X K (M ) to denote the image of R K (M ) in X R (M ); in
this case, the set X K (M ) is the ordinary quotient R K (M )/K . Let S be the subgroup
PSO2 = G ∩ K ∼
= S 1 , which is the stabilizer of a point in H2 under the action of G.
As usual, we use X S (M ) to denote the image of R S (M ) in X R (M ); note here that any
representation in R S (M ) factors through H1 (M ; Z) since S itself is abelian. The next
two lemmas will be used in the proof of Theorem 1.4.
2.10 Lemma. The intersection X K (M ) ∩ XG (M ) is exactly X S (M ). In particular, if
[ρ] is in X K (M ) ∩ XG (M ) then [ρ] is reducible over G C .
Proof. Consider [ρ] ∈ X K (M ) ∩ XG (M ). If [ρ] is irreducible over G C , then any two
representatives of [ρ] are conjugate in G C , so we can assume that ρ ∈ RG (M ) and
that every ρ(γ) is elliptic or trivial as ρ is also conjugate into R K (M ). However, every subgroup of G consisting solely of elliptic elements has a global fixed point x 0
in H2 (see e.g. [Bea, Theorem 4.3.7]). The representation ρ then fixes pointwise the
geodesic in H3 that is perpendicular to H2 and contains x 0 ; in particular, it is reducible over G C , contradicting our initial assumption. So we have reduced to the
case where [ρ] is reducible over G C , and there we can choose the representative ρ to
be diagonal. As [ρ] is in X K (M ), we have tr2γ (ρ) in [0, 4] for all γ ∈ π1 (M ). A diagonal
matrix A in G C with tr2 (A) in [0, 4] has nonzero entries on the unit circle, and so ρ
comes from a homomorphism π1 (M ) → S 1 /{±1}. In particular, the representation ρ
is conjugate into R S (M ) as desired.
2.11 Lemma. The map t : R(M ) → X (M ) has the weak path lifting property, that
is, given a path c : I → X (M ) there is a ce: I → R(M ) with c = t ◦ ce. The same
is true for its restrictions R K (M ) → X K (M ), RG (M ) → XG (M ), and R PGL2 R (M ) →
X PGL2 R (M ). Moreover, if c(0) is an irreducible character, then we can require ce(0)
to be any specified representation in t −1 (c(0)).
Proof. With regards to the main claim, for the group K this is [Bre, Section II.6], for
the group G C this is [KPR, Corollary 3.3], and the other two cases follow from [BLR,
Lemma 2.1]. The fact that we can specify ce(0) when c(0) is irreducible is simply
because in this case everything in t −1 (c(0)) is actually conjugate.
The next lemma is a comforting fact, but it is not needed for any of the main
results in this paper; indeed, we use it only in Lemma 6.8, which is just a remark to
justify a claim about the examples in Section 5; you should therefore skip the proof
at first reading.

13

2.12 Lemma. The subsets X K (M ) and XG (M ) are closed in X (M ) in the classical
topology.
Proof. For ease of notation, we set G ? = PGL2 R and Γ = π1 (M ), and also surpress
the manifold M from our representation and character varieties. The subset X K is
compact since it is the image of the compact set R K under a continuous map, and
so we turn immediately to X G . Given χ ∈ X G , which must be in X R , we need to show
that χ is in X G . We give separate arguments depending on whether χ is reducible
over G C .
First, suppose χ is reducible over G C . Let ρ be a diagonal representation into G C
with character χ. The top-left entry of ρ gives a homomorphism ψ : Γ → C× /{±1}.
Since χ ∈ X G , we have that tr2γ (ρ) ∈ [0, ∞) for all γ ∈ Γ. Consequently, all ψ(γ) are in
S 1 ∪ R× . In fact, the image ψ(Γ) must be contained entirely in one of S 1 or R× , as
otherwise we can easily find a ψ(γ) that is not in S 1 ∪ R× . If ψ(Γ) is in S 1 , then ρ is
conjugate into S ≤ G, and if instead ψ(Γ) is in R× then ρ is already in RG . Thus, when
χ is reducible we have shown that χ ∈ X G as desired.
Suppose instead that χ is irreducible over G C . By [HP1, Lemma 10.1], we need to
consider two cases, depending on whether χ is in the image of R K or RG ? . To start,
suppose χ can be realized by a ρ ∈ R K ; in particular, ρ(Γ) fixes a point x 0 ∈ H3 . As
ρ is irreducible, there must be γ1 and γ2 in Γ where the ρ(γi ) are elliptic elements
with rotation axes L i and L 1 ∩ L 2 = {x 0 }. By Proposition 2.7 and Lemma 2.11, we can
approximate ρ by an irreducible ρ 0 in R whose character χ0 is in X G and where the
ρ 0 (γi ) are still elliptic with axes L 0i very close to the L i . As ρ 0 is conjugate into RG ,
there is a totally geodesic plane P 0 preserved by ρ 0 (Γ), and the axes L 0i must meet P 0
in right angles; in particular, the angle between L 01 and L 02 , as measured along their
perpendicular bisector (which is contained in P 0 ), is 0. For ρ 0 close enough to ρ, this
is impossible as L 1 ∩ L 2 = {x 0 }. So we cannot have χ in X K .
Thus our final case is when χ is irreducible and in X G ? . As X G ? is locally path
connected by Proposition 2.7 and χ is a limit point of X G ⊂ X G ? , we can find a path
χt from χ0 in X G to χ. Applying Lemma 2.11 to RG ? → X G ? , we lift χt to a path ρ t
starting at ρ 0 ∈ RG . As G is a connected component of G ? and each ρ 0 (γ) ∈ G, it
follows by continuity that ρ 1 (γ) is also in G. Thus ρ 1 is in RG and so χ is in X G as
desired, proving the lemma.

Concretely, we realize Ge as follows. We identify S 1 = P1 (R) with R/Z and view the
quotient map as the universal covering map R → P1 (R). The projective action of
G on P1 (R) is faithful, so we identify G with its image subgroup in Homeo+ (S 1 ).
Every homeomorphism of P1 (R) in G lifts to countably many homeomorphisms of
R. We define Ge to be the subgroup of Homeo+ (R) consisting of all lifts of elements

1
R → P (R), namely the group of integer translations. We let s be the element of the
center which acts by x 7→ x + 1, and write elements of the center multiplicatively
as s k . An element of Ge is called elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic when its image
in G is of that type. The disjoint partition of G into elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic,
and trivial elements means that Ge is similarly partitioned into elliptic, parabolic,
hyperbolic, and central elements.
3.1 Translation number. An important concept for us is the translation number of
e which is defined as
an element ge ∈ G,
gen (x) − x
trans(ge) = lim
n→∞
n

for some x ∈ R.

(3.2)

This is well-defined since the value of the limit is independent of the choice of x.
Here are some key properties of the translation number; see [Ghy, §5] or [Cal2,
§2.3.3] for extensive background and details. First, the map trans : Ge → R is cone Also, it is a homogenous quasitinuous and is constant on conjugacy classes in G.

for any ge in G.
Since they map to elements in G that have a fixed point in P1 (R), all parabolic
and hyperbolic elements of Ge have integral translation numbers. In contrast, any
real number arises as the translation number of an elliptic element. Moreover, if ge is
e then 2π trans(ge) is equal, modulo 2π, to the rotation angle
an elliptic element of G,
of p(ge) at its unique fixed point in H2 .
3.3 The
¡ ¢Euler class. Given a group Γ and a representation ρ : Γ → G, the Euler class
Euler ρ ∈ H 2 (Γ; Z) is a complete obstruction to lifting ρ to a representation ρe : Γ →
Ge such that p ◦ ρe = ρ. Here is a review of its definition; see e.g. [Ghy, §6.2] for details.
e that is, a function satisfying p ◦ ρe = ρ. Define
Choose an arbitrary section σ : Γ → G,
a function φσ : Γ × Γ → Z by
s φσ (γ1 ,γ2 ) = σ(γ1 )σ(γ2 )σ(γ1 γ2 )−1

where Z (G)

Associativity of group multiplication implies that φσ satisfies the 2-cocycle relation
φσ (γ2 , γ3 ) − φσ (γ1 γ2 , γ3 ) + φσ (γ1 , γ2 γ3 ) − φσ (γ1 , γ2 ) = 0.

15

¡ ¢
We define Euler ρ to be the class in H 2 (Γ; Z) represented by φσ . To see that this is
well-defined, note that if σ0 is another section, then φσ −φσ0 is the coboundary of the
1-cochain τ : Γ → Z determined by s τ(γ) = σ(γ)σ0 (γ)−1 . Now a section σ is actually a
lift of the representation ρ when the 2-cocycle φσ is identically zero; if φσ is merely
a coboundary, say φσ = δ(τ), then the section σ0 determined by σ0 (γ) = σ(γ)s −τ(γ)
0
has φσ
¡ =
¢ 0 on the nose. Thus a lift of ρ exists precisely when the cohomology class
Euler ρ vanishes.
Now suppose that ρ t is a continuous path of representations Γ → G. We may
choose a continuous family σt of sections, for example by choosing generators for Γ
and defining σt (γ) in terms of a fixed representation of γ as a word in the generators.
This gives a continuous 1-parameter family of cocycles. In the general setting, since
the coboundaries
are a closed subspace of the cocycles, this implies that the map
¡ ¢
ρ 7→ Euler ρ is continuous. In our setting, this means that for any 3-manifold M
the Euler class is constant on connected components of RG (M ).
e there are many lifts. Specifi3.4 Parameterizing lifts. When ρ : Γ → G lifts to G,
cally, when ρ lifts, the set of all lifts is a 1-dimensional affine space over H 1 (Γ; Z).
e = 〈s〉, we
Concretely, given some lift ρe : Γ → Ge and a φ ∈ H 1 (Γ; Z), then, taking Z (G)
φ(γ)
e
can construct another lift φ · ρe via γ 7→ ρ(γ)s
, where we are viewing φ ∈ H 1 (Γ; Z)
as a homomorphism Γ → Z. Conversely, if ρe1 and ρe2 are two lifts of ρ, then we claim
that they differ by some φ ∈ H 1 (Γ; Z). Since p ◦ ρe1 (γ) = p ◦ ρe2 (γ) for all γ ∈ Γ, we
have ρe1 (γ) = ρe2 (γ)s φ(γ) for some well-defined function φ : Γ → Z. To see that φ is a
homomorphism, note that
ρe1 (γ1 γ2 )s φ(γ1 γ2 ) = ρe2 (γ1 γ2 ) = ρe1 (γ1 )s φ(γ1 ) ρe1 (γ2 )s φ(γ2 ) = ρe1 (γ1 )ρe1 (γ2 )s φ(γ1 )+φ(γ2 )
which implies that φ(γ1 γ2 ) = φ(γ1 ) + φ(γ2 ).
3.5 Representations of Z2 . For Λ = Z2 , consider the set of representations RGe (Λ) =
e A representation ρe ∈ R e (Λ) is called elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic
Hom(Λ, G).
G
e
if the image group ρ(Λ)
contains an element of the corresponding type. Since Λ
e
is abelian, every non-trivial element of ρ(Λ)
must be of the same type. Thus these
categories are disjoint; the remaining representations which are not in any of these
e
categories are called central since ρ(Λ)
lies there. For a fixed ρe ∈ RGe (Λ), we get a
e : Λ → R. The map trans ◦ρe is actually a homomorphism; this is bemap (trans ◦ρ)
cause a homogenous quasimorphism is actually a homomorphism on any abelian
subgroup (see [Cal2, Prop. 2.65] or [Ghy, Theorem 6.16]).
Identifying Hom(Λ, R) with H 1 (Λ; R), we get a map
e
trans : RGe (Λ) → H 1 (Λ; R) defined by ρe 7→ trans ◦ρ.
This map is far from injective: any parabolic or hyperbolic element of Ge has an
integral translation number, and it follows easily that the preimage of any class in

H 1 (Λ; Z) contains many nonconjugate parabolic and hyperbolic representations.

this paper. Let M be an irreducible Q-homology

the inclusion map. Inside RGe (M ) = Hom π1 (M ), G , let PE Ge (M ) be the subset of
representations whose restriction to π1 (∂M ) is either elliptic, parabolic, or central
in the sense of Section 3.5. Consider the composition

The closure in H 1 (∂M ; R) (with respect to the vector space topology) of the image of PE Ge (M ) under trans ◦ι∗ is called the translation extension locus and denoted
ELGe (M ). We distinguish two special kinds of points of ELGe (M ). First, those which
are not in the image of PE Ge (M ), but only its closure, are called ideal points. Second,
those coming from elements of PE Ge (M ) which restrict to parabolic representations
in RGe (∂M ) are called parabolic; such points necessarily lie on the integer lattice
H 1 (∂M ; Z). The translation extension locus was first considered by Khoi [Khoi] in
his work on computing
Seifert
volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

Let T = ι H (M ; Z) ⊂ H (∂M ; R). Consider the group of affine isomorphisms
of H 1 (∂M ; R) generated by the map x 7→ −x together with all translations by elements of T . As T is isomorphic to Z, this affine group is isomorphic to an infinite
dihedral group whose action on H 1 (∂M ; R) preserves the line containing T ; we will
denote this dihedral group by D ∞ (M ).
4.1 Coordinates and lines. It will be helpful to have concrete coordinates for the
translation extension locus. To this end, fix a homologically natural framing (µ, λ)
for H1 (∂M ; Z) as discussed in Section 2.2. We now identify H 1 (∂M ; R) with R2 by using the basis (µ∗ , λ∗ ) that is algebraically dual to the basis (µ, λ) of H1 (∂M ; R), that is,
µ∗ (µ) = λ∗ (λ) = 1 and µ∗ (λ) = λ∗ (µ) = 0. Note that while λ is unique up to sign and
µ depends on our choice of framing, it is µ∗ that is unique (up to sign) and λ∗ that
depends on the framing; geometrically, the point is that µ∗ is the Poincaré dual of
±λ. Let k ∈ N be the
duality, the number k is

ordinates, the subgroup T = ι H (M ; Z) is the points (kn, 0) for n ∈ Z. Moreover,

17

the group D ∞ (M ) consists of horizontal translations by shifts in kZ and π-rotations
about every point of the form (kn/2, 0) for n ∈ Z.
To state our tool for constructing orders, we need the following concept. Given
a slope r on ∂M , which we can specify by a primitive element γ ∈ H1 (∂M ; Z), define
the line L r = L γ to be the subspace of H 1 (∂M ; R) consisting of linear functionals that
vanish on the 1-dimensional subspace of H1 (∂M ; R) determined by γ. Thus the line
L ∞ = L µ is the span of λ∗ , which is the vertical axis in our coordinates, and the line
L 0 = L λ is the span of µ∗ , which is the horizontal axis. In general, L r is a line through
the origin in R2 of slope −r .
4.2 Key results. Here is the basic structural result about ELGe (M ), which is roughly
that it is a family of immersed arcs invariant under D ∞ (M ), such that the quotient
is a finite graph.
4.3 Theorem. The extension locus ELGe (M ) is a locally finite union of analytic arcs
and isolated points. It is invariant under D ∞ (M ) with quotient homeomorphic
to a finite graph. The quotient contains finitely many points which are ideal or
parabolic in the sense defined above. The locus ELGe (M ) contains the horizontal
axis L λ , which comes from representations to Ge with abelian image.
Moreover, here are our key tools for constructing orders.
4.4 Lemma. Suppose M is a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold with ∂M
a torus, and assume the Dehn filling M (r ) is irreducible. If L r meets ELGe (M ) at a
nonzero point which is not parabolic or ideal, then M (r ) is orderable.
4.5 Lemma. Suppose K is a knot in a Z-homology 3-sphere Y whose exterior M
is irreducible. Let (µ, λ) be a homologically natural framing with M (µ) = Y . Assume also that the n-fold cyclic cover Ye of Y branched over K is irreducible. If
the vertical line µ∗ = 1/n meets ELGe (M ) at a point which is not ideal, then Ye is
orderable.
The proofs of Theorem 4.3, Lemma 4.4, and Lemma 4.5 occupy Section 6. Before
tackling them, we show pictures of various ELGe (M ) to get a feel for these objects.

5 A menagerie of translation extension loci
We now give 12 examples of translation extension loci which will motivate the various results in this paper. Indeed, for us these examples form the intellectual core
of this paper, directly inspiring all of the theorems here. The reader should peruse

and subsequent plots.

these examples carefully before continuing, as they illustrate both the ideas and the
potential pitfalls in the proofs of the main theorems. The first pictures of this type
appeared in Figure 8 of [Khoi].
The 12 examples come from hyperbolic 3-manifolds that have ideal triangulations with at most 9 tetrahedra, and the nomenclature follows [CHW, Bur, CDGW].
We selected them from a sample of about 600 translation extension loci of such
manifolds to illustrate a range of behaviors.
We start with M = m016, which is homeomorphic to the exterior of the (−2, 3, 7)–
pretzel knot in S 3 . Its translation extension locus is shown in Figure 3, and we discuss it in detail to explain how to read the plots here. We use a homological framing
(µ, λ) where M (µ) = S 3 and M (−18) and M (−19) are lens spaces. (In SnapPy’s default framing, µ = (1, 0) and λ = (18, 1).) The figure shows the intersection of ELGe (M )
with the strip 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 in our usual (µ∗ , λ∗ )-coordinates on H 1 (∂M ; R). This strip is a
fundamental domain for the action of T ≤ D ∞ (M ) which is generated by translation
by µ∗ . The symmetry of ELGe (M ) under the element of D ∞ (M ) which is π-rotation
about (1/2, 0) is visually clear.
There are 16 parabolic points of ELGe (M ) in this picture, which are marked by the
dark and light half disks on the vertical sides of the strip. (As mentioned, parabolic
points are necessarily integer lattice points.) When the sides of the strip are glued
by T , these 16 half disks are paired up to form 8 full discs; down in the full quotient
BLGe (M ) = ELGe (M ) /D ∞ (M ), there are only 4 parabolic points.

Figure 4. This extension locus follows the same basic pattern as Figure 3, but there
are some 72 diagonal arcs each joining a parabolic point to an Alexander point. The
manifold here is M = v0220, which is the exterior of the knot k76 = T (7, −17, 2, 1) in
S 3 found in [CKP]. The framing is such that M (µ) = S 3 and M (−117) is the lens space
L(117, 43); in SnapPy’s default framing µ = (1, 0) and λ = (−116, 1). The manifold M
fibers over the circle with fiber of genus 47. Here, we can use Lemma 4.4 to order
M (r ) for all r ∈ (−75, ∞); in contrast, the interval of non-L-space slopes is (−93, ∞).
It is remarkable how complicated ELGe (M ) is given that M has an ideal triangulation
with only seven tetrahedra!

The color of the half disks indicates when the corresponding representation to
G is Galois conjugate to the holonomy representation of the complete hyperbolic
structure on M (see Section 8.1 for the definition), with the light green being “geometric” in this limited sense and black indicating other “random” parabolic Grepresentations.
There are no ideal points in this ELGe (M ) or in any of our example translation
loci; all of the manifolds involved are small, and Lemma 6.8 below rules out any
ideal points in this situation. (The smallness of these manifolds was checked using
Regina [BBP+ ].)
The disks on the µ∗ -axis L λ correspond to the roots of the Alexander³polyno-´

mial that lie on the unit circle. Specifically, for each such root ξ, we plot 2π , 0

Figure 5. Like those in Figures 3 and 4, this locus consists of arcs that run between
parabolic and Alexander points, but a key difference is that the parabolic points lie
on the horizontal axis. The manifold M = o934801 here is the exterior of a genus 2
fibered knot in S 3 , and as usual M (µ) = S 3 . (In SnapPy’s default framing µ = (1, 0)
and λ = (−1, 1).) Using Lemma 4.4, we can order M (r ) for r ∈ [−0.36, 3.6), where
the endpoints of the interval are approximate. In contrast, the interval of non-Lspace slopes is (−∞, ∞) since the Alexander polynomial t 4 − 2t 3 + t 2 − 2t + 1 does not
satisfy the condition of [OS2, Corollary 1.3]. This example illustrates the difficulty
of strengthening the proof of Theorem 1.2 to give a lower bound on the size of the
interval (−a, a) in the conclusion.

ifold, are shown as light turquoise disks; in later examples, multiple roots will be
shown in dark blue. Notice that there is a nonhorizonal arc of ELGe (M ) leaving each
Alexander point. Such arcs are used to prove Theorem 1.2 and come from deforming an abelian representation to irreducible representations, which is only possible
at Alexander points (see Section 7 for a complete discussion).
Since the line L r has slope −r in our picture, and M has no reducible Dehn fillings, we see that Lemma 4.4 applies to show M (r ) is orderable for all r ∈ (−6, ∞). To
compare with Conjecture 1.1, the interval of non-L-space fillings for M is precisely
(−9, ∞) for the following reason. As M has two lens space fillings, it is Floer simple in
the sense of [RR], and hence the interval of L-space fillings is [−∞, −(2g − 1)] where
g is the Seifert genus; the latter is 5 as that is the genus of the fiber in the fibration
of M over the circle. In fact, both Theorems 1.2 and 1.4 apply to M , though we got
much better results by applying Lemma 4.4 directly.
A summary of the overall structure of this ELGe (M ) is that, besides the horizontal

and λ = (3, 1), and as usual M (µ) = S 3 .) Using Lemma 4.4, we claim that we can order
M (r ) for r in (−2, −1) ∪ (−1, 2) ∪ [a, ∞) where a ≈ 4.84. For example, the arc labeled
A in the figure gives orderings for r ∈ (−2, −1), and the arc labeled B shown gives
orderings for r ∈ [a, ∞). The translates of A by positive shifts contribute the intervals
(−2/k, −1/k) for k ≥ 1, as do all the translates of B by negative shifts; the union of
these inverals is (−2, −1) ∪ (−1, 0). The other translates of A and B contribute halfopen intervals that contain, but are slightly larger than, [1/k, 2/k) for k ≥ 1; the union
of these is (0, 2). The interval of non-L-space slopes is (−∞, ∞) since the Alexander
polynomial t 6 − 2t 5 + 3t 4 − 5t 3 + 3t 2 − 2t + 1 does not satisfy the condition of [OS2,
Corollary 1.3]. This example illustrates the difficulty of strengthening the proof of
Theorem 1.4(2) to give an interval (a, ∞) where a is bounded above.

Figure 7. This locus has a mix of the behaviors shown in the previous figures. The
manifold M = s841 is the exterior of a genus 7 fibered knot in S 3 , namely k638 from
[CKM]. (In SnapPy’s default framing µ = (1, 0) and λ = (22, 1), and as usual M (µ) = S 3 .)
Using Lemma 4.4, we can order M (r ) for r in (−7, ∞); the interval of non-L-space
slopes is (−∞, ∞) since the Alexander polynomial does not satisfy the condition of
[OS2, Corollary 1.3]. There are actually two distinct Galois conjugates of the holonomy representation that give rise to each of the points (0, ±7) and (1, ±7). This is why
there are two separate arcs of ELGe (M ) emerging from these parabolic points instead
of the one you might expect from the proof of Theorem 1.4.

line of abelian representations, it consists of diagonal arcs with a parabolic point
at one end and an Alexander point at the other. Moreover, none of the arcs overlap. This pattern was quite common in our sample, and a much more complicated
instance is shown in Figure 4. Overall, there are many different behaviors that are
relevant to us here; please see Figures 5–12 and their captions for details.
5.1 Numerical methods and caveats. To compute points in X R (M ) corresponding
to representations which send µ to an elliptic isometry, we worked with the gluing
variety G(T ), where T is an ideal triangulation of M . Each G(T ) is an affine algebraic set described in coordinates which are the shape parameters for the tetrahedra in T . There is one equation for each edge, specifying that the tetrahedra match
around that edge, and the variety determined by these has dimension 1 in our examples. The holonomy Hµ is the square of an eigenvalue of the image of µ, and
can be expressed in these coordinates to give a polynomial map Hµ : G(T ) → C.
We randomly chose a complex number z 0 near the unit circle and used homotopy

Figure 8. This locus has arcs between parabolics that are on opposite sides of the
strip. It is one of the few instances we found where Lemma 4.4 allows us to order
M (r ) for all r in (−∞, ∞). (Another such example is v1971 in Figure 10.) The manifold M = o904139 is the exterior of a genus 6 fibered knot in S 3 . As usual M (µ) = S 3 ;
in SnapPy’s default framing µ = (1, 0) and λ = (−1, 1). While the Alexander polynomial does statisfy [OS2, Corollary 1.3], it turns out that the set of non-L-space slopes
is (−∞, ∞); using the criterion of [Rob] and the program flipper [Bel], Mark Bell and
the second author were able to show that every nontrivial Dehn filling on M has a
co-orientable taut foliation. There are actually four distinct Galois conjugates of the
holonomy representation that give rise to each of the points (0, ±1) and (1, ±1), explaining the arcs that emerge from them.

continuation with a start system given by the mixed volume method to find the
0-dimensional algebraic set Hµ−1 (z 0 ). This computation was done with PHCpack
[Ver, V+ ]. Once the fiber over z 0 had been computed, we used the Newton-Raphson
method to do path-lifting to our branched cover of C by G(T ). With some care to
avoid singularities, this allowed us to compute the fiber over all N th roots of unity,
where N was typically 128 to start with, but sometimes needed to be increased.
Each point of one of these fibers determined a character in X (M ) corresponding
to a representation sending µ to an elliptic with rotation angle 2kπ/N for some k.
These representations were computed to standard floating point accuracy (53 bits)
and it was numerically decided which of them gave points of XG (M ).
Once we had constructed a representation ρ : π1 (M ) → G, we used the Newton-Raphson method to polish it to very high precision (typically 1,000 bits). The
e
Euler cocycle of Section 3.3 was then computed and used to lift ρ to ρe : π1 (M ) → G.

Figure 9. The manifold M = t 03632 is our first example that is not the exterior of
a knot in S 3 , with M (µ) being the small Seifert fibered space S 2 ((2, 1), (3, 1), (7, −6))
which is a Z-homology 3-sphere. (In SnapPy’s default framing µ = (1, 0) and λ =
(−8, 1).) One new phenomenon is that ELGe (M ) meets the sides of the strip at a
point which is not an integer lattice point, namely the intersections at approximately
(0, ±1/2) and (1, ±1/2). Such nonintegral points of ELGe (M ) come from representations to Ge which factor through M (µ), which is why they could not appear in the
earlier examples where M (µ) = S 3 . Another new phenomenon is that some arcs of
ELGe (M ) cross the horizontal axis away from the Alexander points; the crossing points
correspond to representations to Ge which factor through M (λ) and have nonabelian
image. Such crossings also happen for certain exteriors of knots in S 3 , for example
with o921236 , though not in any of the examples we show here.

The peripheral translations of ρe were computed and then normalized under the action of D ∞ (M ) to be plotted in the figure.
¡ ¢ (For the examples in Figures 11 and 12,
frequently there was no lift ρe as Euler ρ was nonzero in H 2 (M ; Z).) For each figure,
we sampled as many as 2,000 different holonomy values for µ in order to get the
smooth curves you see.
While we believe our plots of these loci are accurate, they were not rigorously
computed. Moreover, there are reasons beyond numerical accuracy that sometimes
cause computations using gluing varieties to produce incomplete results, with some
arcs missing from the diagram. (On the other hand, using gluing varieties rather
than character varieties hugely simplifies the computation, making it feasible to
handle larger examples.) The key issue is that the natural map G(T ) → X (M ) is
not always onto; while each irreducible component of G(T ) corresponds to some

Figure 10. These three loci show some possible behaviors when the Alexander polynomial has a multiple root (for such a root, the corresponding Alexander point is dark
blue rather than light blue). The top left example is the knot exterior v1971 = k774
from [CKP]. There, the arcs leaving the Alexander points are tangent to the horizontal axis, which is a common pattern for multiple roots. However, such tangencies are
not required as the top right example of the knot exterior t 12247 = k8279 = 12n574
from [CKM] shows. The last example of M = o930426 is perhaps the most interesting: there are no nonhorizontal arcs of ELGe (M ) leaving the two Alexander points at
all! In fact, the corresponding reducible representations to G C are deformable to irreducible representations, but only into PSU2 , not G. Here, M (µ) is the Seifert fibered
space S 2 ((2, 1), (3, 1), (11, −9)), which is a Z-homology 3-sphere, and there are three
separate Galois conjugates of the holonomy representation at the points (0, ±1) and
(1, ±1) in ELGe (M ). The bottom example shows why we need the hypothesis that ∆M
has a simple root in the proof of Theorem 1.2, since the picture near the Alexander
points does not match Figure 14.

Figure 11. The manifold M = v0170 is our first example of something that is not a
Z-homology solid torus. In particular, the homological longitude λ has order k =
3 in H1 (M ; Z), which is why the shown fundamental domain for the action of T ≤
D ∞ (M ) has width 3. The filling M (µ) is the lens space L(9, 2) with the core of the
added solid torus representing three times a generator of H1 (L(9, 2); Z) ∼
= Z/9Z. (In
SnapPy’s default framing µ = (1, 0) and λ = (−5, 1).) The manifold M fibers over the
circle with fiber a genus 4 surface with 3 boundary components. For a root ξ of ∆M ,
the corresponding Alexander point is plotted as 3 arg(ξ)/2π to account for the fact
that µ maps to three times a generator in H1 (M ; Z)free . The two Alexander points at
(1, 0) and (2, 0) demonstrate the necessity of the hypothesis that ξk 6= 1 for the proof
of Theorem 1.2, since the local picture there does not match Figure 14. The trace
field of M has 6 real embeddings, but above there is only one parabolic point modulo
e
D ∞ (M ); this is because most of the Galois conjugates into G do not lift to G.

Figure 12. The manifold M = v1108 is another example that is not a Z-homology
solid torus. In particular, the homological longitude λ has order k = 2 in H1 (M ; Z)
and the filling M (µ) is the lens space L(4, 1). (For once, the (µ, λ) framing is the same
as SnapPy’s default.) The manifold M fibers over the circle with fiber a genus 3 surface with 2 boundary components. The parabolic points (0, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0) are
all double, that is, come from two distinct Galois conjugates of the holonomy representation. In addition to being a parabolic point, the point (1,0) is also a simple
Alexander point. However, this Alexander point doesn’t contribute an arc to ELGe (M )
because it corresponds to the root ξ = −1 and ξk = 1.

irreducible component of X (M ), there can be components of X (M ) that are not
seen in G(T ) [Dun3, §10.3]. As G(T ) depends fundamentally on the triangulation
T , such “missing components” can sometimes be dealt with by changing the triangulation. In other cases, especially when there are components corresponding to
representations that factor through a proper quotient of π1 (M ), changing the triangulation did not help. (In [Seg] Segerman constructs an “extended” version of G(T )
and shows that there always exists a triangulation such that all components of the
character variety can be parametrized in terms of the associated extended gluing
variety. However, his technique has not been implemented in software.)
In some cases we were able to detect missing components from inconsistencies
in our picture of ELGe (M ). In the case of M = m389, we obtained a plot of ELGe (M )
with a simple Alexander point from which no arcs emerged, violating the proof of
Theorem 1.2. It turns out that for the Dehn filling Y = m389(µ + λ) there is a surjection from π1 (Y ) onto PSL2 Z ∼
= C 2 ∗ C 3 , giving a component of X (M ) that could not
be seen by our G(T ). Another fairly common situation that leads to missing compo-

28

nents is when a Dehn filling Y contains an essential torus: if X (Y ) is nonempty, then
dimC X (Y ) ≥ 1 because it is possible to “bend” representations using the structure
of π1 (Y ) as a free product with amalgamation along the Z2 -subgroup corresponding
to the essential torus. It seems to be common that components of X (M ) obtained
by bending do not appear in the image of G(T ).
Another issue with gluing varieties is that points at infinity of G(T ) can correspond to non-ideal points of the character variety X (M ). Geometrically, this means
that the shapes of some tetrahedra degenerate even though the associated characters converge. We call these Tillmann points after [Til]. These points cause numerical difficulties and complicate determining which points of ELGe (M ) are ideal.
Such Tillmann points occur reasonably frequently in our examples. Specifically, we
used Goerner’s database [Goe] of boundary parabolic representations to G C to identify which of the parabolic points correspond to Galois conjugates of the holonomy
representation of the hyperbolic structure, and as a check to our own computations. While Goerner used Ptolemy equations rather than gluing equations, his
method still depends on a choice of triangulation, and parabolic representations
can go missing for the same reason. In our examples, there were five cases where
our plot of ELGe (M ) indicated a parabolic or ideal point on the vertical sides of the
diagram that were not present in [Goe]. For example, this occurred with the point
(0, −2) in Figure 6. Using Lemma 6.8, we were able to conclude that these are all
Tillmann points missed by our preferred triangulation, rather than ideal points.

6 Proof of the structure theorem
This section is devoted to the proofs of Theorem 4.3, Lemma 4.4, and Lemma 4.5.
An impatient and trusting reader can skip ahead as the rest of the paper only relies
on the statements of these three results. We begin attacking Theorem 4.3 by proving
the following two lemmas.
6.1 Lemma. The extension locus ELGe (M ) is invariant under D ∞ (M ).
6.2 Lemma. The quotient space BLGe (M ) = ELGe (M ) /D ∞ (M ) has finitely many
connected components.
Proof of Lemma 6.1. Since invariance is preserved under taking closures, it suffices
to show that the image I of PE Ge (M ) under trans ◦ι∗ is invariant under D ∞ (M ). Consider any ρe ∈ PE Ge (M ) and let t = trans(ρe ◦ ι) be the corresponding point in I . If
φ ∈ H 1 (M ; Z), then, as described in Section 3.4, one has φ · ρe in PE Ge (M ) which is
e The image of φ · ρe in I differs from t via translation by ι∗ (φ) in
also a lift of p ◦ ρ.

Proof of Lemma 6.2. Consider the map P : RGe (M ) → RG (M ) induced by p : Ge → G.
Let PE G (M ) be the subset of RG (M ) consisting of representations whose restrictions
to π1 (∂M ) consist only of elliptic, parabolic, and trivial elements. Note that PE G (M )
lift
is a real semialgebraic set. Let PE G (M ) ⊂ PE G (M ) be the image of PE Ge (M ) under
lift

P . By continuity of the Euler class (see Section 3.3), the subset PE G (M ) is a union
of connected components of PE G (M ), and hence also a real semialgebraic set. As
described in Section 3.4, the cohomology H 1 (M ; Z) acts freely on PE Ge (M ) with quolift

lift

tient PE G (M ); consequently, P : PE Ge (M ) → PE G (M ) is a (regular) covering map.
Because the action of H 1 (M ; Z) on PE Ge (M ) induces the action of T ≤ D ∞ (M ) on
ELGe (M ), the map trans ◦ι∗ below factors through ψ as shown:

6.3 Milnor-Wood bounds. The remaining tool we need to prove Theorem 4.3 is:
6.4 Lemma. The space BLGe (M ) is compact.
The proof of Lemma 6.4 hinges on knowing that ELGe (M ) is contained in a horizontal
strip of bounded height; to show this, we use the following result, which is closely
related to the Milnor-Wood inequality.
6.5 Proposition. Suppose S is a compact orientable surface with one boundary

where δ is a generator of π1 (∂S).

Before discussing Proposition 6.5, let us derive Lemma 6.4 from it.
Proof of Lemma 6.4. Recall that M is a Q-homology solid torus and let k be the order
of the homological longitude λ ∈ π1 (∂M ) in H1 (M ; Z). There is a proper map of
an oriented surface f : S → M where S has one boundary component and where
f ∗ (δ) = λk in π1 (M ) for δ a generator of π1 (∂S). Because trans is a homomorphism

In particular, in our usual (µ∗ , λ∗ )-coordinates on H 1 (∂M ; R), the locus ELGe (M ) lies
in a horizontal strip whose height is bounded by something that only depends on
topological information about M . Thus, since D ∞ (M ) contains horizontal translations of R2 by shifts in kZ, the quotient BLGe (M ) is compact.
We now discuss Proposition 6.5 in detail. Recall that a real-valued function φ on
a group Γ is called a quasimorphism if there exists a number D such that
¯
¯
¯φ(x y) − φ(x) − φ(y)¯ ≤ D for all x, y ∈ Γ,
and that the infimum of all such D is called the defect of φ. The standard references
e the
[Ghy, §5] and [Cal2, §2.3.3] contain proofs that for any representation ρe : Γ → G,
function given by φ = trans ◦ρ is a quasimorphism. It is also well-known that this
quasimorphism has defect at most 1, although it is harder to extract this fact from
the literature. It is stated in [Thu2, Proposition 3.7], with a sketch of a proof that

31

uses a construction of a connection on a circle bundle over a surface in terms of a
harmonic measure on a foliation transverse to the fibers. It is also a consequence of
the “ab Theorem” of [CW, Theorem 3.9], which was conjectured and almost proved
by Jankins and Neumann [JN], the proof having been completed by Naimi [Nai].
The proof of Calegari and Walker is simpler and effective (see also [Man]). With
these facts in hand, we turn to the proof of the proposition.
Proof of Proposition 6.5. Let g be the genus of S. The case of g = 0 is immediate as
e
then ρe must be trivial and so trans(ρ(δ))
= 0; thus we will assume g > 0. Choose
standard generators α1 , β1 , . . . , αg , βg for π1 (S) where
δ = [α1 , β1 ] · · · [αg , βg ].
Because trans : Ge → R is a quasimorphism of defect at most 1, we have
e
| trans(x y)| ≤ | trans(x)| + | trans(y)| + 1 for all x, y ∈ G.
It follows by induction that
e
| trans(x 1 · · · x n )| ≤ | trans(x 1 )| + · · · + | trans(x n )| + (n − 1) for all x 1 , . . . , x n ∈ G.
As trans is constant on conjugacy classes and satisfies trans(x −1 ) = − trans(x), we
have

¡
¢
¡
¢¯
¡
¢¯ ¯
¯trans [x, y] ¯ = ¯trans [x, y] − trans x y x −1 − trans y −1 ¯ ≤ 1 for all x, y ∈ G.
e
Combining these properties, we have

¢¯
|trans (δ)| = ¯trans [ρ(α
e 1 ), ρ(β
e 1 )] · · · [ρ(α
e g ), ρ(β
e g )] ¯ ≤ g + (g − 1) = −χ(S)
as required.
Proof of Theorem 4.3. Define c : H 1 (∂M ; R) → XG (∂M ) by sending φ : π1 (∂M ) → R
to the character of the elliptic representation ρ given by
ρ(µ) = ±

We may use the dual basis to (µ, λ) and the trace-squared coordinates on XG (∂M )
to express the map c in coordinates as:
¡
¡
¢¢
c(x, y) = 4 cos2 (2πx), cos2 (2πy), cos2 2π(x + y)

32

For integers m and n we have c(x + m, y + n) = c(x, y), and also c(±x, ±y) = c(x, y).
Thus the map c is topologically an orbifold covering map from R2 onto a pillowcase,
i.e. a Euclidean orbifold with underlying manifold S 2 and four cone points of angle
π. Moreover, the following commutes:
PE Ge (M )

XG (∂M )

Note that c maps BLGe (M ) into ι∗ (XG (M )). Now by Lemma 2.4, the complex algebraic set ι∗ (X (M )) ⊂ X (∂M ) has complex dimension at most 1; hence the real semialgebraic set ι∗ (XG (M )) has real dimension at most 1. Moreover, the set ι∗ (XG (M ))
is compact since the subset of X (∂M ) corresponding to representations that are
parabolic, elliptic, or trivial is compact. Hence by Proposition 2.6, the set ι∗ (XG (M ))
is a finite graph. Thus, its preimage under c is a locally finite graph with analytic
edges that is invariant under D ∞ (M ) by Lemma 6.1. As BLGe (M ) is compact by
Lemma 6.4, we can conclude that it lives in some finite graph in H 1 (∂M ; R)/D ∞ (M )
with analytic edges. Now, since BLGe (M ) has finitely many connected components
by Lemma 6.2, it follows that it too must be a finite graph in H 1 (∂M ; R)/D ∞ (M ) with
analytic edges. This proves the hardest part of the theorem.
To see that there are only finitely many parabolic points, note that these only
occur at images of lattice points in H 1 (∂M ; Z), and there can only be finitely many
such points in the compact set BLGe (M ). Also, the space BLGe (M ) is the closure in a
finite graph of a set with finitely many components, and thus there are only finitely
e
many ideal points. Finally,
± consider the copy of R in G sitting above PSO2 ≤ G. As
∼
H1 (M ; Z)free = H1 (M ; Z) (torsion) = Z, we get a 1-parameter family of abelian representations π1 (M ) → Ge by sending the generator of H1 (M ; Z)free to any chosen element of R. Since λ is zero in H1 (M ; Z)free whereas µ is nonzero, we see that these
abelian representations give rise to the line L λ inside of ELGe (M ), finishing the proof
of the structure theorem.
6.6 Constructing orderings. We now turn to the proofs of the lemmas that we use
to construct orderings of 3-manifold groups.
Proof of Lemma 4.4. Let φ be such a point in L r ∩ ELGe (M ). As it is neither parabolic
nor ideal, there is a ρe ∈ RGe (M ) which maps to φ where the restriction of ρe to π1 (∂M )
is either elliptic or central. Let γ be an element of π1 (∂M ) realizing the slope r . By

we can show that t is neither ideal nor parabolic. The former is ruled out by the
hypothesis that the initial intersection of ELGe (M ) with µ∗ = 1/n was not an ideal
point. The latter is impossible since, when restricting a representation Z2 → Ge to a
finite index subgroup, the only possible change of type (as defined in Section 3.5)
is from elliptic to trivial, and the initial intersection of ELGe (M ) with µ∗ = 1/n is not
parabolic as it is not in the lattice H 1 (M ; Z). Thus we can apply Lemma 4.4 to order
Ye as required.
6.7 Ideal points. The following result was used in Section 5, but is not central to
this paper and the proof can be safely skipped.
6.8 Lemma. Suppose M is a Q-homology solid torus which is small, that is, contains no closed essential surfaces. Then ELGe (M ) has no ideal points.
Proof. Suppose t 0 is an ideal point of ELGe (M ). Pick a sequence ρei ∈ PE Ge (M ) whose
images in ELGe (M ) converge to t . Consider the representations ρ i = p ◦ ρei in RG (M )
and the corresponding characters [ρ i ] in XG (M ). Passing to a subsequence, we arrange that the [ρ i ] lie in a single irreducible component X 0 of X (M ). As M is small,
the variety X 0 must be a complex affine curve by [CCGLS, §2.4]. As XG (M ) is closed
in X (M ) by Lemma 2.12, we have that X G0 = X 0 ∩ XG (M ) is closed in X 0 . Passing to
a subsequence, either the [ρ i ] limit to a character in XG (M ) or the [ρ i©] march
ª off to

infinity in the noncompact curve X . In the latter case, since we have trγ ρ i ∈ [0, 4]
for all γ ∈ π1 (∂M ), the argument of [CCGLS, §2.4] produces a closed essential surface associated to a certain ideal point of X 0 , contradicting our hypothesis that M is
small.
Now consider the case when the [ρ i ] limit to χ in XG (M ). By Proposition 2.6, we
pass to a subsequence where there is an arc c in XG (M ) starting at [ρ 0 ], ending at χ
and containing all the [ρ i ]. Using Lemma 2.11, lift c to a path c in RG (M ) starting
at ρ 0 and ending at some ρ whose character is χ. In the notation of the proof of
Lemma 6.2, we have that the ρ i are in PE G (M ). Note that ρ is also in PE G (M ) as
it is in RG (M ) and tr2γ ρ must be in [0, 4] by continuity for all γ ∈ π1 (∂M ). As in the
lift

proof of Lemma 6.2, we have that c is in PE G (M ) and so we can lift c to a path
ce in PE Ge (M ) starting at ρe0 . After possibly changing ce by a deck transformation of
lift

PE Ge (M ) → PE G (M ), we can assume that the image of ce(1) in ELGe (M ) is exactly t 0 .
Thus t 0 is not actually an ideal point, proving the lemma.

7 Alexander polynomials and orderability
In this section we prove our first main result, Theorem 7.1, which implies Theorem 1.2 from the introduction. To state the more general result, we need a pair of
definitions. First, we say a compact 3-manifold Y has few characters if each positive dimensional component of X (Y ) consists entirely of characters of reducible
representations. An irreducible Q-homology solid torus M is called longitudinally
rigid when its Dehn filling along the homological longitude M (0) has few characters.
Here is the statement of Theorem 7.1, where the manifold M has a fixed homologically natural framing (µ, λ).
7.1 Theorem. Suppose that M is a longitudinally rigid irreducible Q-homology
solid torus and that the Alexander polynomial of M has a simple root ξ on the
unit circle. When M is not a Z-homology solid torus, further suppose that ξk 6= 1
where k > 0 is the order of the homological longitude λ in H1 (M ; Z). Then there
exists a > 0 such that for every rational r ∈ (−a, 0) ∪ (0, a) the Dehn filling M (r ) is
orderable.
Steven Boyer told us in a private communication that there is an analog of Theorem 1.2 when the simple root ξ is on the positive real axis. Here is the argument that
this implies Theorem 1.2.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Comparing the statements, there are two things to do: show
that M being lean implies that M is longitudinally rigid, and establish that M (0) is
orderable. The latter is immediate from Theorem 1.1 of [BRW] since H 1 (M (0); Z) ∼
=

Z and M (0) is either irreducible or S ×S . The former is an immediate consequence
of
7.2 Claim. Suppose Y is an irreducible closed 3-manifold. If the only essential
surfaces in Y are fibers in fibrations over the circle, then Y has few characters.
Here is the proof of the claim. Suppose instead that X (Y ) has a positive dimensional
component Z containing an irreducible character χ0 . Recall from Section 2.3 that
the functions tr2α for a finite set of α ∈ π1 (Y ) give coordinates on the complex affine
algebraic set X (Y ). Pick an irreducible curve X 0 ⊂ Z that contains χ0 , which we can
do by e.g. Corollary 1.9 of [CP]. As affine algebraic curves over C are noncompact,
there is at least one ideal point of X 0 in the sense of [BZ, §4]. This gives an action
of π1 (Y ) on a simplicial tree, which in turn has an essential dual surface. Let F be a
connected component of this dual surface. By hypothesis, the surface F must be a
fiber in a fibration of Y over the circle. In fact, since every essential surface in Y is a
fiber, it follows from [Thu1, Pages 113–115] that b 1 (Y ) = 1 and that F is the unique

36

connected essential surface in Y up to isotopy. Therefore, the surface associated to
any other ideal point of X 0 must also consist of parallel copies of F . Hence for every
γ ∈ π1 (F ), the function tr2γ takes a finite value at every ideal point of the curve X 0 ,
which forces the function tr2γ to actually be constant on X 0 . Thus every character in
X 0 has the same restriction to π1 (F ), which we denote by η ∈ X (F ). There are two
cases depending on whether or not η is reducible.
Suppose η is irreducible. As per Section 2.3, all representations π1 (F ) → G C with
character η are irreducible and conjugate, and let us fix one such representation ρ.
If f : F → F is the monodromy of the fibration, we have the usual presentation
¯
®
­
π1 (M ) = τ, π1 (F ) ¯ τγτ−1 = f ∗ (γ) for all γ ∈ π1 (F )
Thus, a representation ρb : π1 (M ) → G C that restricts to ρ on π1 (F ) is determined
b ∈ G C ; moreover, T must conjugate ρ to ρ ◦ f ∗ . As ρ is irby the element T = ρ(τ)
reducible, its stabilizer under conjugation is finite [HP1, Proposition 3.16(i)], and
hence there are only finitely many possibilities for T . But then X 0 is finite, a contradiction.
Suppose instead that η is reducible. Let ψ : π1 (M ) → G C be an irreducible representation with character in X 0 . Note that ψ|π1 (F ) is nontrivial as otherwise ψ factors
through π1 (M )/π1 (F ) ∼
= Z making ψ itself reducible. As ψ|π1 (F ) has character η, it is
reducible and has either exactly one or exactly two fixed points on P1 (C). If ψ|π1 (F )
had a unique fixed point p 0 ∈ P1 (C), then, since π1 (F ) is normal, it follows that ψ
itself fixes p 0 , making ψ reducible. So ψ|π1 (F ) has exactly two fixed points on P1 (C),
and we conjugate ψ so that these are 0 = [0 : 1] and ∞ = [1 : 0]. After this conjugation, the image of ψ|π1 (F ) consists of diagonal matrices and its non-trivial elements
are hyperbolic or elliptic with axis the geodesic L in H3 that joins 0 to ∞. Now consider how ψ(τ) acts on the points 0 and ∞ . It must not fix them individually, as
then ψ would be reducible. Hence ψ(τ) is an elliptic element of order two whose
axis is orthogonal to L. We can conjugate
ψ by a diagonal matrix, which does not
¡ 0 1¢
change ψ|π1 (F ) , so that ψ(τ) = ± −1
.
In
particular, up to conjugacy, ψ is com0
pletely determined by ψ|π1 (F ) . As a diagonal representation such as ψ|π1 (F ) is determined up to conjugacy by its character, we have shown that X 0 contains a unique
irreducible character. But this contradicts the fact that the irreducible characters in
X 0 are Zariski open [HP1, Corollary 3.6]. This completes the proof of Claim 7.2 and
shows that Theorem 1.2 follows from Theorem 7.1.
We now sketch the proof of Theorem 7.1, which we also illustrate in Figure 14.
Recall that to order the Dehn filling M (r ) by applying Lemma 4.4, we need an intersection of the translation locus ELGe (M ) with the line L r , which is the line through
the origin of slope −r . So to prove the theorem, we construct a cone C of lines
through the origin that contains the horizontal axis L 0 and where every line in C

Figure 14. Here is an outline of the proof of Theorem 7.1. From the simple root ξ
of ∆M , we use [HP2] to produce an arc A in ELGe (M ) leaving the horizontal axis at a
corresponding Alexander point. Using the action of D ∞ (M ), we can assume the arc
A lies in the strip 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 as shown. The element of D ∞ (M ) which is π-rotation
about (1/2, 0) means there will be a second arc B in this strip on the opposite side of
the horizontal axis from A. This allows us to find a cone C whose lines through the
origin meet ELGe (M ) in a point which is neither parabolic or ideal. The theorem will
then follow from Lemma 4.4.

meets ELGe (M ). To this end, we use a result of Heusener and Porti [HP2] to build an
arc A in ELGe (M ) which starts at a point in L 0 but is otherwise disjoint from it. The
symmetries of ELGe (M ) guarantee that if we have such an arc on one side L 0 then
we will have one on the other side as well, giving us a big enough chunk of ELGe (M )
to have the desired cone C; see Figure 14 for more. A key technical point is that we
must take care to ensure that the arc A is not completely contained in L 0 , and this
is where the hypothesis of longitudinally rigid comes in.
A key component of the proof is the following result derived from [HP2].
7.3 Lemma. Suppose M is an irreducible Q-homology solid torus. If ξ is a simple
root of the Alexander polynomial that lies on the unit circle, then there exists an
analytic path ρ t : [0, 1] → RG (M ) where:
(1) The representation ρ 0 acts by rotations about a±unique fixed point in H2 ,
and factors through H = H1 (M ; Z)free = H1 (M ; Z) (torsion) ∼
= Z. A generator
of H acts via rotation by angle arg(ξ).
(2) The representations ρ t are irreducible over G C for t > 0.
(3) The corresponding path [ρ t ] of characters in XG (M ) is also a nonconstant
analytic path.
¡ ¢
(4) There exists γ ∈ π1 (∂M ) where tr2γ ρ t is nonconstant in t .

38

Proof. Except for part (4), the lemma follows straightforwardly from the statement
of Proposition 10.3 of [HP2] and Lemma 2.11 of our paper. However, it is even easier
to derive claims (1–3) directly from the discussion in Section 10 of [HP2] and we
take that approach. Throughout, we will follow the notation of [HP2] closely. Fix
a generator h of H , and let α : π1 (M ) → C× be the homomorphism which factors
through the homomorphism H → C× that sends h to ξ. Consider the associated
diagonal representation ρ α : π1 (M ) → G C given by

where α1/2 (γ) is either square root of α(γ).

which is a conjugate of G in G C as it corresponds to the Möbius transformations that
stabilize the unit disc D in C ⊂ P1 (C).
The proof of Proposition 10.3 in [HP2] shows that the cocycle defined there
¡
¢
d + + d − ∈ H 1 π1 (M ); su(1, 1)ρ α
can be integrated to an analytic path ρ t : [0, 1] → R PSU(1,1) (M ) with ρ 0 = ρ α and ρ t
irreducible over G C for t > 0, which gives (2). Note that ρ α stabilizes the center of D
and acts on the tangent space there via α, which gives (1). Next, claim (3) that [ρ t ]
is nonconstant follows from (2), since, over G C , a reducible representation cannot
have the same character as an irreducible representation.
Finally, we tackle claim (4), whose proof is more involved; please note that claim
(4) is not actually used in this paper and so you can safely skip it. By Theorem 1.3
of [HP2], the character χα = [ρ α ] is contained in precisely two irreducible components of X (M ), both of which are (complex) curves: one consisting solely of characters of abelian representations and the other, which we will call X , whose characters
generically come from representations that are irreducible over G C . Of course, our
path [ρ t ] lies in X . To study X near χα , we move away from ρ α to the representation ρ + ∈ R(M ) constructed in [HP2, §5]. The representation ρ + is also reducible
with character χα but has nonabelian image. Proposition 7.6 of [HP2] gives that ρ +
is a smooth point of R(M ) of local dimension 4. Let sl2 (C)ρ + denote the Lie algebra of G C as a π1 (M )-module via the action Ad ◦ ρ + . The proof of Proposition 7.6
+
of [HP2] shows that the Zariski
tangent
¡
¢ space of R(M ) at ρ can be identified with
1
the space of cocycles Z M ; sl2 (C)ρ + . (Unlike [HP2], we are assuming that M is
irreducible and consequently aspherical, and so do not distinguish between cohomology of M and of π1 (M ).) As the tangent space to the orbit of ρ + is the space of

39

¡

B 1 M ;¢ sl2 (C)ρ + , we can identify the Zariski tangent space of X at χα
¡
with H 1 M ; sl2 (C)ρ + , which is C by Corollary 5.4 of [HP2]. As the restriction ρ + ◦ ι
in R(∂M ) is nontrivial, the proof of Lemma 7.4 of [HP2] gives that ρ + ◦ ι is a smooth
point of R(∂M ),¡ and so again¢we can identify the Zariski tangent space of X (∂M ) at
[ρ + ◦ ι] with H 1 ∂M ; sl2 (C)ρ + ∼

ι∗ : H 1 M ; sl2 (C)ρ + → H 1 ∂M ; sl2 (C)ρ +

(7.4)

is injective, since coordinates on X (∂M ) are precisely the functions tr2γ for γ ∈ π1 (M ).
To understand the map in (7.4), start by calculating that the 0-cohomologies, or

which forces ι∗ at left to be injective, as claimed. This establishes (4) and hence the
lemma.
Proof of Theorem 7.1. We will use the coordinate system described in Section 4.1 to
identify H 1 (∂M ; R) with R2 . We will show that there exists a cone C in R2 containing
the positive part of the horizontal axis in its interior such that every line contained
in C meets the subset ELGe (M ) in a point which is neither ideal nor parabolic. The
theorem then follows directly from Lemma 4.4 once we invoke [GL1, Theorem 1.2]
to know that all but at most three Dehn fillings on M are irreducible.
We claim it suffices to produce a path A in ELGe (M ) which begins at a point on
the horizontal axis, and not at the origin, such that the image of A is not completely
contained in the horizontal axis. If the image of A contains points of either the upper or lower open half-plane, then the symmetries imply that there also exists a path
whose image contains points of the other half-plane; compare Figure 14. Thus the
images of the two paths will meet every line in some cone C. By Theorem 4.3, after
shrinking these paths if necessary, we may assume that they contain no ideal points.
Since parabolic points occur only at integer lattice points, we may also assume that
these paths contain no parabolic points in their interior.
Let ξ be a simple root of ∆M that lies on the unit circle. Note that ξ is different
from 1 since, as M is a Q-homology solid torus, the value |∆M (1)| is the order of

40

the torsion subgroup in H1 (M ; Z) and hence positive. Let ρ t be the associated path
in RG (M ) given by Lemma 7.3. Now ρ 0 factors through the free abelianization H
e
of π1 (M ), which is just Z, and so it is trivial to lift
¢ ρe0 : π1 (M ) → G that still
¡ ρ 0 to
factors through H . As λ is 0 in H , we have trans ρe0 (λ) ­= 0. As
® ξ is not 1, we have
trans(ρe0 (µ)) 6= 0. As noted in Section 4.1, the index of ι∗ (µ) in H is the order k
of ι∗ (λ) in H1 (M ; Z). Thus, using Section 3.4, we adjust ρe0 so that trans(ρe0 (µ)) is in
(0, k]. In particular, ρe0 gives a point (x, 0) ∈ ELGe (M ) with x > 0 in our coordinates on
H 1 (∂M ; R).
As discussed in Section 3.3, the Euler class is the complete obstruction to lifting
a representation to Ge and is constant on connected components of RG (M ). Hence,
as ρ 0 lifts to ρe0 , we can extend this to a continuous path ρet : [0, 1] → RGe (M ) lifting
the original ρ t . Because ξk 6= 1, we have tr2µ (ρe0 ) = ξk + 2 + ξ−k < 4, so there exists
² > 0 such that tr2µ (ρ t ) < 4 for t ∈ [0, ²]. This means that the representation ρ t sends
µ to an elliptic element and, since λ commutes with µ, it must also send λ to an elliptic or trivial element. By replacing ρ t by its restriction to a subinterval of positive
length, we have that ρ t is a path in PE G (M ) and that ρet is a path in PE Ge (M ).
We now build our path A by composing ρet with trans ◦ι∗ : PE Ge (M ) → ELGe (M ).
By Lemma 7.3(3), we know [ρ t ] is a nonconstant path in X (M ) and hence ρet is
a nonconstant path in PE Ge (M ). However, we must still prove that A is not contained in the horizontal axis, i.e. that trans(ρet (λ)) is not the zero function in t . If
it were, then since ρ t (λ) is always elliptic or trivial, we would have that ρ t (λ) = 1
for all t ; in particular, all the ρ t factor through π1 (M (0)) and so the path [ρ t ] lies
in X (M (0)) ⊂ X (M ). Thus the [ρ t ] are in an irreducible component Z of X (M (0))
of complex dimension at least 1. By Lemma 7.3(2), the ρ t are irreducible for t > 0,
and thus Z is a component of X (M (0)) of positive dimension which contains an irreducible character. This contradicts our hypothesis that M is longitudinally rigid,
and completes the proof of the theorem.
7.5 Remark. For general Q-homology solid tori, there can be reducible representations that deform to irreducible representations but do not come from roots of the
Alexander polynomial; rather, they correspond to roots of certain twisted Alexander invariants as described in [HP2]. However, it would not help to consider such
representations in the context of Theorem 7.1: as we now explain, the additional
representations never lift to Ge and hence are of no interest to us here. Specifically,
consider a representation ρ : π1 (M ) → S ≤ G where S = PSO2 ∼
= S 1 ; in the proof of
Theorem 7.1, we considered such ρ that factor through H1 (M ; Z)free and deform to
irreducible representations in RG (M ). More generally, we could consider any deformable ρ : π1 (M ) → S ≤ G. However, the preimage of S in Ge is R, which is abelian
e the lift ρe must factor through
and torsion-free; thus if ρ lifts to ρe : π1 (M ) → G,
H1 (M ; Z)free , and so we are back in the case considered in Theorem 7.1.

8 Real embeddings of trace fields and orderability
This section gives the proof of Theorem 1.4, whose statement we recall below after
giving some needed background.
8.1 Trace fields and Galois conjugate representations. Let M be a compact orientable 3-manifold whose boundary is a torus. The trace field of a representation
ρ : π1 (M ) → G C is the subfield of C generated over Q by the traces of all ρ(γ) for
γ ∈ π1 (M ); this is well-defined even though the trace of each ρ(γ) only makes sense
up to sign. Of course, the trace field depends only on the conjugacy class of ρ. If
ρ hyp is a holonomy representation of a finite-volume hyperbolic structure on the
interior of M , by local rigidity its trace field F is a number field, that is, a finite extension of Q [MR, Theorem 3.1.2]. In particular, F is contained in the subfield Q ⊂ C
of all algebraic numbers.
As the hyperbolic structure has a cusp, we can conjugate ρ hyp so that its image
lies in PSL2 F [MR, Theorem 3.3.8]. Given an embedding σ : F → C, which must
have image contained in Q, we get a Galois conjugate representation ρ : π1 (M ) →
G C by composing ρ hyp with the induced map PSL2 F → PSL2 (σ(F )). As irreducible
representations into G C are determined by their characters, up to conjugacy in G C
this ρ depends only on σ and not on how we conjugated ρ hyp to lie in PSL2 F .
Here is the statement that this section is devoted to proving:
1.4 Theorem. Let K be a hyperbolic knot in a Z-homology 3-sphere Y . If the trace
field of the knot exterior M has a real embedding then:
(1) For all sufficiently large n, the n-fold cyclic cover of Y branched over K is
orderable.
(2) There is an interval I of the form (−∞, a) or (a, ∞) so that the Dehn filling
M (r ) is orderable for all rational r ∈ I .
(3) There exists b > 0 so that for every rational r ∈ (−b, 0)∪(0, b) the Dehn filling
M (r ) is orderable.
The proof relies on the following three lemmas, the third of which was suggested to
us by Ian Agol and David Futer.
8.2 Lemma. Suppose M is a hyperbolic Z-homology solid torus, with homological longitude λ ∈ π1 (∂M ). Suppose the trace field F of M has a real embedding
σ : F → R, and let ρ : π1 (M ) → G be the corresponding Galois conjugate
¡
¢of the
e
holonomy representation. If ρe : π1 (M ) → Ge is any lift of ρ, then trans ρ(λ)
is an
odd integer.

42

8.3 Lemma. Suppose M is an orientable 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold whose
trace field has a real embedding. Then there exists an arc c in RG (M ) and a representation ρ in its interior such that
(1) The representation ρ is a Galois conjugate of a holonomy representation of
the hyperbolic structure on M .
(2) For any slope γ ∈ π1 (∂M ), the arc c is parameterized near ρ by tr2γ .
8.4 Lemma (Agol and Futer). Suppose ELGe (M ) contains an arc A that is not horizontal, i.e. that has points with different vertical coordinates. Then there exists
an a > 0 so that the line L r meets ELGe (M ) for all r in (−a, a).
Proof of Lemma 8.2. Let ρ hyp : π1 (M ) → PSL2 F be a holonomy representation for
the hyperbolic structure on M . Let ρ 0hyp : π1 (M ) → SL2 F be any lifted representation,
¡ 0 which
¢ exists by [CS, Proposition 3.1.1]. By Corollary 2.4 of [Cal1], we know
tr ρ hyp (λ) = −2 since λ is the boundary of an orientable spanning surface. The Ga¡

lois conjugate ρ 0 = σ ◦ ρ 0hyp also has tr ρ 0 (λ) = −2, and note that ρ 0 is a lift of ρ to
SL2 R. Consider the successive quotients

The lemma will follow immediately from the fact that tr ρ 0 (λ) = −2 once we show:
8.5 Claim. Suppose ge is a parabolic or central element of Ge and g is its image in
SL2 R. Then the parity of trans(ge) is odd precisely when tr(g ) = −2 rather than +2.
e (Figure 1
To see this, consider the subset P of all parabolic or central elements of G.
of [Khoi] has a detailed picture of P as well as the subsets of elliptic and hyperbolic
elements; this picture informs our approach here but is not directly used.) Note that
every path component of P contains a central element; this is because downstairs
in G any parabolic element can be connected to the trivial element by a path all
of whose interior points are parabolic, and paths lift to covering spaces. The functions trans and tr ◦q are both continuous on Ge and are integer valued on P . Hence
they are constant on each path component of P , ©andª it suffices to prove the claim
for central elements. There, note that the center s k of Ge maps to the center {±I }
of SL2 R via the unique epimorphism Z → Z/2; hence the s k which map to −I are
exactly those with k odd. This proves the claim and hence the lemma.
Proof of Lemma 8.3. Let F be the trace field of M and ρ hyp : π1 (M ) → PSL2 F be a
holonomy representation. As F has a real embedding, choose σ ∈ Gal(Q/Q) such
that σ(F ) ⊂ R, and define ρ ∈ RG (M ) as σ ◦ ρ hyp .

Figure 15. When the slope of L r is small enough, it must meet a translate A 0 of A.

Now both R(M ) and X (M ) are defined over Q, that is, they can be cut out by polynomials with rational coefficients. Hence Gal(Q/Q) acts coordinate-wise on their
Q-points. Since [ρ hyp ] comes from the complete hyperbolic structure on M , it is
a smooth point of X (M ) where the local dimension is 1, see [Por, Corollaire 3.28];
in particular, the Zariski tangent space to X (M ) at [ρ hyp ] is 1-dimensional. Let X
be the unique Q-irreducible component X of X (M ) that contains [ρ hyp ]. (You can
construct X by taking the C-irreducible component X 0 of X (M ) containing [ρ hyp ],
which must be defined over some number field, and then taking the union of the
Gal(Q/Q)-orbit of X 0 .) Since X is invariant under the Gal(Q/Q)-action, it contains
[ρ] as well as [ρ hyp ]. Finally, the dimension of X (thought of as an algebraic set over
either Q or C) is 1.
Again by [Por, Corollaire 3.28], for any slope γ ∈ π1 (∂M ), the trace function tr2γ
is a local parameter for X on a small classical neighborhood of [ρ hyp ] (the reference
[Por] works with SL2 C rather than G C character varieties, but this makes no difference since near both 2 and −2 in C the map z 7→ z 2 is injective). Since σ acts on the
Q-points of X taking [ρ hyp ] to [ρ], it follow that [ρ] is also a smooth point of X where
again any tr2γ is a local parameter for the nearby C points; this is because whether
a regular function is a local parameter at a smooth point on the curve X can be
expressed purely algebraically and hence is Gal(Q/Q)-invariant.
Let τ denote the action of complex conjugation on X (M ) as in Section 2.5. As [ρ]
is a smooth point of a 1-dimensional irreducible component of X (M ), by Proposition 2.8 there is a smooth arc c of real points in X R (M ) containing [ρ] in its interior.
Since tr2γ gives a local parameter for X near ρ, the arc c must be locally defined
simply by the requirement that tr2γ is real. Thus c is parameterized near [ρ] by the
value of tr2γ in the interval [4 − ², 4 + ²]. Moreover, by restricting ² we can assume every character in c comes from a G C -irreducible representation; by Lemma 2.10, this
means C ⊂ XG (M ) since [ρ] ∈ XG (M ). By Lemma 2.11, we can lift c to an arc in c in
RG (M ). As the function tr2γ must also be a local parameter for c, we have proved the
lemma.

44

Proof of Lemma 8.4. By shortening the arc if necessary, we first arrange that A lies
to one side of the horizontal axis. As D ∞ (M ) preserves ELGe (M ) and contains πrotation about the origin, we may assume that A lies below this axis. We will show
that there exists an a 1 > 0 so that L r meets ELGe (M ) for all r in (0, a 1 ). Applying the
symmetric argument to the π-rotation of A about the origin will give an a 2 > 0 so
that L r meets ELGe (M ) for all r in (−a 2 , 0); taking a = min(a 1 , a 2 ) will then give the
promised interval, since the horizontal axis itself is always part of ELGe (M ).
As usual, let k be the order of ι∗ (λ) in H1 (M ; Z), so that D ∞ (M ) contains the
subgroup of horizontal translations by multiples of k. By shortening A if necessary,
we can label its endpoints as (x 0 , y 0 ) and (x 1 , y 1 ) where y 0 < y 1 < 0 and |x 1 − x 0 | < k.
We claim that L r meets ELGe (M ) for all r where
0<r <

y1 − y0
2k

(8.6)

To see this, let (x 2 , y 1 ) be the point where L r meets the horizontal line y = y 1 , and
let (x 3 , y 0 ) be the point where L r meets y = y 0 . Consider the largest integer n so that
x 0 +nk ≤ x 3 , and let A 0 ⊂ ELGe (M ) be A translated to the right by nk, so the endpoints
of A 0 are (x 0 + nk, y 0 ) and (x 1 + nk, y 1 ). Set x 00 = x 0 + nk and x 10 = x 1 + nk.
We now argue that L r meets A 0 , using Figure 15 as a guide. Since the slope of L r
is −r , and since (y 1 − y 0 )/r > 2k by (8.6), we have
x 3 − x 2 = (y 1 − y 0 )/r > 2k.
¯

Our choice of n guarantees that x 00 < x 3 and ¯x 3 − x 00 ¯ < k. We also have ¯x 10 − x 00 ¯ =
|x 1 − x 0 | < k. Thus

Combining, we conclude that x 2 < x 10 . We also have x 00 < x 3 , so we have shown that
the endpoints of A 0 lie on opposite sides of L r , as in Figure 15. This implies that L r
must meet A 0 , completing the proof of the lemma.
Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let c be the arc in RG (M ) given by Lemma 8.3, and ρ the Galois conjugate of the holonomy representation which is in c. As H 2 (M ; Z) = 0, the
Euler class of any representation in c vanishes, and hence we can lift c to an arc ce in
e
RGe (M ). We fix a particular lift by requiring that ρ lifts to ρe with trans(ρ(µ))
= 0. By
e
Lemma 8.2, we have that trans(ρ(λ))
= k is an odd integer, and so ρe gives rise to the
point (0, k) in ELGe (M ).
Since this is true downstairs for c, the function tr2µ is a local parameter for ce
where the parameter takes values in [4 − ², 4 + ²]. For the subinterval [4 − ², 4], the
representations on ce must lie in PE Ge (M ) since they each send µ to a parabolic or

Figure 16. The two possibilities for the arc A in the locus ELGe (M ) originating from
the image (0, k) of a Galois conjugate of the holonomy representation.

Thus we get an arc A in ELGe (M ) which starts from (0, k), where k is the aforementioned odd integer, and is locally parameterized by the µ∗ -coordinate on some
small interval [0, δ]. Moreover, by construction no point on A is an ideal point, and
the only parabolic point on A is (0, k) itself. Depending on the sign of k, we get one
of the two pictures in Figure 16.
To prove conclusion (1), consider an n-fold cyclic cover Ye of Y branched over K .
First, by the Hyperbolic Dehn Surgery Theorem, the manifold Ye is hyperbolic and
hence irreducible for all large n. Moreover, from Figure 16 it is clear that for all large
n the arc A meets the line µ∗ = 1/n, so we now get (a) directly from Lemma 4.5.
For (2), for concreteness let us focus on possibility (ii) in Figure 16. Since there
are at most three Dehn fillings on M that are reducible [GL1, Theorem 1.2], we can
construct an interval I = (a, ∞) where M (r ) is irreducible and L r meets A for all
r ∈ I . The claim now follows immediately from Lemma 4.4.
Finally, for part (3), by Lemma 8.3 the arc c in RG (M ) is parameterized near ρ by
2
trλ ; thus the corresponding arc A in ELGe (M ) is not horizontal. Hence by Lemma 8.4,
the line L r meets ELGe (M ) for all r in some open interval (−b, b). Shrinking b, we can
ensure that M (r ) is irreducible for all r in (−b, 0)∪(0, b). Again, claim (3) now follows
immediately from Lemma 4.4, completing the proof of the theorem.
8.7 Remark. The hypothesis that Y is a Z-homology 3-sphere is certainly necessary
for the proof of Theorem 1.4 to work, and it is likely that the conclusion of Theorem 1.4 does not hold in general if one drops this hypothesis. Specifically, consider
the 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold M = v2503 which has H1 (M ; Z) = Z + Z/10 and

46

H 2 (M ; Z) = Z/10. The trace field here is Q adjoin a root of

which has six real embeddings. However, none of the resulting representations

π1 (M ) → G lift to G,
This M is interesting from the point of view of Floer theory; specifically, Lidman and Watson recently gave infinitely many Q-homology solid tori which were
not fibered and where every non-longitudinal Dehn filling is an L-space [LW]. As
their examples all have essential annuli, they asked [LW, Question 6] whether there
are hyperbolic examples with these same properties; the manifold v2503 answers
that question affirmatively, as we now explain. We will use the homological framing
(µ, λ) which corresponds to (0, 1) and (−1, 0) in SnapPy’s default conventions. Then
M (µ) is the lens space L(50, 19) and M (λ) is S 2 × S 1 # R P3 . Using [RR], it is possible
to show that every non-longitudinal Dehn filling on M is an L-space, even though it
is not a fibered 3-manifold as ∆M = 2(t 4 + t 3 + t 2 + t + 1).
Of course, if Conjecture 1.1 is true, then every Dehn filling on M is not orderable (the filling M (λ) is not orderable as its fundamental group has torsion). We
checked the 16 examples where the Dehn filling coefficients are at most 3, and in
each case we were able to show that the corresponding Dehn filling was not orderable. It would be interesting to show that this is the case for all Dehn fillings.

9 Open questions
Our results in this paper and especially the examples in Section 5 suggest many
interesting questions and possible avenues for future research; here are some of
them:
(1) Find topological hypotheses on a Z-homology solid torus which imply that all
Dehn surgeries in (−1, 1) are orderable.
(2) Find topological hypotheses which give rise to the behavior shown in Figure 8
where one can use ELGe (M ) to order all but one Dehn filling on M .
(3) Do all Berge knots have ELGe (M ) of the simple form shown in Figure 3 and
Figure 4? What about twisted torus knots? In the latter case, perhaps one can
view ELGe (M ) as some kind of “perturbation” of the very simple ELGe (M ) of the
underlying torus knot.
(4) In Lemma 6.4 we show that ELGe (M ) lives in a horizontal strip whose size is
bounded. When M is a Z-homology solid torus, our proof shows that the maximum y coordinate of a point in ELGe (M ) is 2g −1, where g is the Seifert genus

47

of M . In our examples, this bound is never sharp. Is this always the case, and
regardless, is there some way to understand this gap?
(5) Does every polynomial satisfying the conclusion of [OS2, Corollary 1.3] have
a simple root on the unit circle? Note that by [KM] such a polynomial always
has a root on the unit circle. Experimental evidence says yes.
(6) Can the longitudinally rigid hypothesis in Theorem 7.1 be eliminated by placing additional conditions on ∆M ? In the known examples where longitudinal
rigidity comes into play, the “bad” roots of ∆M are all roots of unity.
(7) Also motived by Theorem 7.1, are there closed atoroidal 3-manifolds with
dim H1 (M ; Q) ≤ 1 which do not have few characters? What if one restricts to
0-surgery on a knot in S 3 ?
(8) There is a Chern-Simons invariant/Seifert volume/Godbillon-Vey invariant
associated to each representation in RG (M ), see [Khoi]. In our usual coordinates on ELGe (M ), the derivative is really simple, basically xdy − ydx. Can
this invariant be used to prove something interesting about ELGe (M )?
(9) How can one explore the space of actions of π1 (M ) on R so as to include some
which do not arise from Ge representations? It is natural to try to use some
analog of the character variety to do this. What is the appropriate setting for
this? Is it possible to draw pictures like those in Section 5 that are built from
+
ã
some larger class of maps to Homeo
(R)?
(10) Motivated by Remark 8.7, prove that every Dehn filling on v2503 is not orderable.
