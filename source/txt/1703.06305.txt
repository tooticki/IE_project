Hardness of almost embedding simplicial
complexes in Rd

Martin Tancer†

Abstract
A map f : K → Rd of a simplicial complex is an almost embedding if
f (σ) ∩ f (τ ) = ∅ whenever σ, τ are disjoint simplices of K.
Theorem. Fix integers d, k ≥ 2 such that d = 3k
2 + 1.
(a) Assume that P 6= N P . Then there exists a finite k-dimensional
complex K that does not admit an almost embedding in Rd but for which
e → S d−1 .
there exists an equivariant map K
(b) The algorithmic problem of recognition almost embeddability of finite
k-dimensional complexes in Rd is NP hard.
The proof is based on the technique from the Matoušek-Tancer-Wagner
paper (proving an analogous result for embeddings), and on singular versions of the higher-dimensional Borromean rings lemma. The new part of
our argument is a stronger ‘almost embeddings’ version of the generalized
van Kampen–Flores theorem.

Introduction

In this paper we study almost embeddings and equivariant maps of configuration
spaces. They appear in studies of embeddings [FKT94, Sko08] as well as in topological combinatorics (for Tverberg-type problems see [BZ16, BBZ16, Sko16]).
Almost embeddings also turned out to be a useful tool for studying Helly-type
results on convex sets, implicitly in [Mat97] and explicitly in [GPP+ 15]. See
definitions and more motivations below.
Throughout this paper, let K be a finite simplicial complex.
A map f : |K| → Rd is an almost embedding if f (σ) ∩ f (τ ) = ∅ whenever
σ, τ are disjoint simplices of K. (Existence of an almost embedding is obviously
a necessary condition for existence of an embedding.)
The (simplicial) deleted product of K is
e := ∪{σ × τ : σ, τ are simplices of K, σ ∩ τ = ∅};
K

e is the union of products σ × τ formed by disjoint simplices of K.
i.e., K
e →
Suppose that f : |K| → Rd is an almost embedding. Then the map fe : K
d−1
S
is well-defined by the Gauss formula
f (x) − f (y)
.
fe(x, y) =
|f (x) − f (y)|

We have fe(y, x) = −fe(x, y); i.e., this map is equivariant with respect to the
e and the antipodal involution
‘exchanging factors’ involution (x, y) → (y, x) on K
e → S d−1 is a necessary
on S d−1 . Thus the existence of an equivariant map K

condition for almost embeddability of |K| in R .

that does not admit an almost embedding in Rd but for which there exists

(b) The algorithmic problem of recognition almost embeddability of finite kdimensional complexes in Rd is NP hard.

The reader need not to know what NP hardness is: the essence of part (b) is
explained by Theorem 2 below.
For k = 2 part (a) is true even without P 6= NP assumption, by [AMSW16,
Theorem 1.5 and Proposition 1.7]. Part (a) follows by part (b) and the existence
of a polynomial algorithm for checking the existence of equivariant maps [ČKV13].
Indeed, for fixed d, k it is polynomial time decidable whether there exists an
e → S d−1 [ČKV13]. Given that almost embeddabilty implies
equivariant map K
the existence of an equivariant map, part (b) implies part (a).
We discuss the possibility of removing the assumption P 6= NP at the end of
the introduction.
Remark. The conclusions of Theorem 1 are in fact valid for each fixed integers
k, d such that 2 ≤ k ≤ d ≤ 3k
+ 1 and d ≡ 1 (mod 3). That is, we reflect only
2
the interesting extremal cases in the statement of Theorem 1.
Indeed, for such integers k, d let k ′ := 2(d−1)
. For a proof of part (a) with
3
′
(d, k) we take the complex K from part (a) with parameters (d, k ′ ), and define
the complex K to be the disjoint union of K ′ and a k-simplex. Similarly, for a
proof of part (b) with (d, k) we add an isolated k-simplex to every k ′ -complex. In
both cases it is easy to check that the conclusion of Theorem 1 remains valid as for
d ≥ k adding an isolated k-simplex does not affect neither almost embeddability
to Rd nor the existence of an equivariant map to S d−1 .
Motivation and background. A classical question in topology is to determine
whether a simplicial complex K embeds (topologically/piecewise linearly/linearly)
in Rd . It is easy to deduce that every k-dimensional simplicial complex embeds (even linearly) into R2k+1 . Pioneering result in this area, known as the
van Kampen–Flores theorem [vK33, Flo34, Sko14], states the existence of kdimensional complexes that to do not embed into R2k (for every integer k; even
topologically).
In general, it is often very hard to determine whether a given complex K
embeds into Rd . More precisely, this question subtly depends on the comparison
of k := dim K and d. For example, it is algorithmically undecidable to recognize
whether a given (d − 1)-complex embeds into Rd [MTW11], provided that d ≥ 5.
(This result follows from a celebrated theorem of Novikov on unrecognizability
of the d-sphere [VKF74].)
Matoušek, the second author and Wagner [MTW11] proved that for each pair
(k, d) such that 4 ≤ d ≤ 3n
+ 1 it is NP hard to decide whether a k-dimensional
2
simplicial complex PL embeds in Rd . Theorem 1(b) is a version of this result for
almost embeddability.
3

We describe the method from [MTW11] in detail (in order to prove our main
results), up to one step in proof that we take directly from [MTW11]. We explicitly state the initial step of the proof (Theorem 2 below). Next, we slightly
simplify the main construction (construction of K(Φ) in §2). We also present
a simple proof of Lemma 7 below generalizing the van Kampen-Flores theorem
(which is also one of the key tools for the result). For ℓ = k − 1 this lemma is
proved in [vK33], for ℓ < k − 1 a weaker version of this lemma (when f |S1 is a
PL embedding) is proved in [SS92, Lemma 1.4] using the Smith index. Thus this
paper can serve as an exposition of the proof of the above result of [MTW11].
Theorem 1(b) is interesting on its own because almost embeddability is different from embeddability. Consider the following three properties of a finite
simplicial complex K.
(E) K PL embeds into Rd .
(AE) K PL almost embeds in Rd .
e → S d−1 .
(EM) There exists an equivariant map K
The conditions (AE) and (EM) appeared as ‘combinatorial’ or ‘algebraic’
counterparts of (E), useful to study ‘geometric’ condition (E). Theorem 1 indicates that the condition (AE) is closer to (E) than to (EM), from algorithmic
point of view. More precisely, we have
E _g

2d≥3k+3 or d≤2

Here the straight arrows are clear and explained above, and the curved arrow is
a theorem of Weber [Web67]; see also [Sko08, §5]. For every pair (k, d) such that
‘2d ≥ 3k + 3 or d ≤ 2’ does not hold, i.e. such that 3 ≤ d ≤ 3k
+ 1, we have
2
(EM) 6⇒ (E) [SS92], [FKT94], [SSS98], [GS06]. Moreover, for every pair (k, d)
such that 4 ≤ d ≤ 3k
+ 1 we have (AE) 6⇒ (E) [SS92], [SSS98]. See [Sko08, §5,
2
§7] for a survey. By [AMSW16, Theorem 1.5 and Proposition 1.7] (EM) 6⇒ (AE)
for d = 2k = 4. Theorem 1(a) shows (modulo P 6= NP ) that for every pair (k, d)
such that 4 ≤ d = 3k
+ 1 (EM) 6⇒ (AE).
2
It might be also interesting to compare algorithmic complexity (of embeddability and almost embeddability) with the ‘geometric’ refinement complexity
introduced in [FK14]. Although it is not directly related to the results in this paper, let us also consider embeddability and almost embeddability of k-complexes
to R2k when k ≥ 3. Then there is a quite noticeable gap between the two complexities for embeddability, which is polynomial time solvable whereas the refinement
complexity grows exponentially [FK14]. V. Krushkal kindly informed us that this
4

gap is also present for almost embeddability by generalizations of Proposition 4.1
and ‘Proof of the bound (4.1) on refinement complexity’ from [FK14].1
Proof technique. We prove Theorem 1 by applying the technique of [MTW11]
(which builds on a construction2 in [SS92], [FKT94], [SSS98]; see [Sko08, §5, §7]
for a survey) and the Singular Borromean Rings Lemma 4 [AMSW16]. The
new part of our argument is the ‘almost embeddings’ version (Lemma 7) of the
generalized van Kampen–Flores theorem. That is, of [SS92, Lemma 1.4], [FKT94,
Lemma 6], [SSS98, Lemma 1.1], [Sko08, Lemma 7.2], and [MTW11, Lemmas 4.1
and 5.1(i)]. Our version is stronger because we do not assume that f |Sj is an
embedding. In spite of this, our proof (presented in Section 3) is simpler, cf.
[MTW11, Remark at the end of 5.1].
Let us emphasize that this passage from embeddability to almost embeddability, being not hard, is not entirely trivial. Although new proofs of ‘almost
embeddings’ analogues of main lemmas are simpler, they require certain change
of the viewpoint. The Borromean Rings Lemma 4 for almost embeddings is only
proved for k = 2l [AMSW16], not for k ≥ 2l as for embeddings. Also recall that
almost embeddability does not in general imply embeddability [SS92, SSS98], cf.
‘Motivation and background’.
Formally, Theorem 1 follows by NP-hardness of recognition of 3-SAT problem
and the following result.
A 3-CNF formula in variables x1 , . . . , xn is
Φ(x1 , . . . , xn ) =

2
3-CNF formula Φ there corresponds, by a polynomial algorithm (in the size of
the formula Φ), a finite k-dimensional complex K(Φ) such that K(Φ) is almost
embeddable in Rd if and only if Φ is satisfiable (i.e., if the Boolean function
Zn2 → Z2 corresponding to Φ is not identically zero).
1

However, it is not an aim of this paper to provide the details.
Let us emphasize that [SS92], [FKT94], [SSS98], and [MTW11] slightly differ in technical
details. In particular, the examples in [SS92] and [SSS98] were built with the aim to be almostembeddable, thus we could not use them immediately without a modification.

The analogue of Theorem 2 for embeddability is proved in [MTW11, §4, §5].
Our complex K(Φ) slightly differs from the complex constructed in [MTW11,
§4.2, §5.2], which we call K ′ (Φ).3 For the ‘if’ part of Theorem 2 we need the
following lemma.
Lemma 3 (proof is sketched in Section 2). The complex K(Φ) constructed in Section 2 is obtained from the complex K ′ (Φ) constructed in [MTW11, §4.2, §5.2] by
several contractions of edges and several compressions of S ℓ−1 × I. (Compression
of a subcomplex identified with S ℓ−1 × I is contracting to a point each segment
x × I, x ∈ S ℓ−1 .)
Proof of Theorem 2: the ‘if ’ part. Since the formula Φ is satisfiable, the complex
K ′ (Φ) PL embeds into Rd [MTW11, Section 5].4 Recall that the quotient of a
PL manifold by a map with collapsible point-inverses is PL homeomorphic to the
same manifold [Coh67]. Hence contracting an edge and compressing S ℓ−1 × I
keep PL embeddability.5 Thus by Lemma 3 K(Φ) also PL embeds into Rd .
Therefore it suffices to prove the converse: if K(Φ) almost-embeds in Rd , then
Φ is satisfiable. This is a strengthening of the analogous fact from [MTW11]. We
use the same idea as [MTW11] but need to replace two key lemmas [MTW11,
Lemmas 5.1(i) and 5.3(i)] by suitable analogues for almost embeddings. These
analogues are Lemma 5 and the Singular Borromean Rings Lemma 4 [AMSW16,
Lemma 1.9] below, respectively.
Let T := S ℓ × S ℓ be the 2ℓ-dimensional torus with meridian a := S ℓ × · and
parallel b := · × S ℓ . See well-known definition of ‘linked modulo 2’, e.g., in [ST80,
§77] or in [Sko, §2.2 ‘Linking modulo 2’].
Lemma 4 (Singular Borromean Rings). For each k = 2ℓ let Sak and Sbk be copies
of S k . Then there is no PL map f : T ⊔ Sak ⊔ Sbk → Rk+ℓ+1 such that
(a) the f -images of the components are pairwise disjoint;
(b) f (Sak ) is linked modulo 2 with f (a) and is not linked modulo 2 with f (b);
(c) f (Sbk ) is linked modulo 2 with f (b) and is not linked modulo 2 with f (a).
On the assumption P 6= NP . A reader could expect that analyzing the
algorithm in [ČKV13] and the proof of Theorem 1(b) would yield a direct construction of an example of Theorem 1(a), without the assumption P 6= NP . Here
we discuss the difficulties that appear in this analysis.
3

We make this minor change to simplify the construction of K(Φ) and proof of the ‘only if’
part, which, however, would work for K ′ (Φ) as well.
4
The converse is also true but is not used here.
5
The analogous claim is not true for ‘decontractions’.

+ 1. If Φ
Let us consider a 3-CNF formula Φ and let d and k be fixed, d = 3k
2
is satisfiable, then (AE) holds for K(Φ) by Theorem 2 and therefore (EM) holds
for K(Φ) as well.
If Φ is not satisfiable, then (AE) does not hold for K(Φ) by Theorem 2 but
we do not know whether (EM) holds for K(Φ). However, if (EM) did not hold
for every Φ which is not satisfiable, then we would deduce that it is NP-hard to
recognize whether a given simplicial complex K satisfies (EM). On the other
hand, this is a polynomial time solvable problem due to [ČKV13]. This would be
only possible if P = NP .
Thus, we have good reasons to expect that for any choice of k and d with
+ 1, there is a non-satisfiable formula Φ such that (EM) holds for K(Φ).
d = 3k
2
Actually, we conjecture that (EM) holds for K(Φ) for every Φ.
For a proof of Theorem 1(a), without the assumption P 6= NP , it would
be fully sufficient to exhibit a single non-satisfiable 3-CNF formula Φ such that
(EM) holds for K(Φ). In fact, the construction in Theorem 2 makes also sense for
the simplest non-satisfiable 1-CNF formula ΦNO = x1 ∧ ¬x1 (in the definition of
the clause gadget G in Section 2 only a single simplex is removed instead of three
simplices). Let KNO (k, d) := K(ΦNO ) for given parameters d and k (here we want
to emphasize the dependence on k and d). The complex KNO (2, 4) is essentially
the complex constructed by Freedman, Krushkal and Teichner [FKT94] (up to a
minor modification), and we know that (EM) holds in this case (as we discussed
below the statement of Theorem 1).
For few other values of k and d we could, in principle, run the algorithm
of [ČKV13] on KNO (k, d) (unfortunately, it is not implemented6 ). However, we
do not know how to verify (EM) for infinitely many values of k and d we are
interested in; the dependence of the algorithm from [ČKV13] on k and d is somewhat complicated. The algorithm in [ČKV13] is based on the obstruction theory.
As far as we know there are no other tools developed, besides the obstruction
theory, that would allow us to verify (EM) for our examples ‘by hand’.

First we define building blocks for the complex K(Φ) (most importantly, clause
gadgets) and prove their properties.

[AMSW16, Remark 2.3.b].
Proof of Theorem 2: construction of K(Φ). Recall the notation for 3-CNF fors1

mula Φ given before Theorem 2. The ‘multiple’ xnαs1
∨ xnαs2
∨ xnαs3
is the s-th
αsi
clause of Φ. The ‘summand’ xnsi is the i-th literal of the s-th clause. Without
loss of generality, we may assume that no clause (‘multiple’) contains both xm
and ¬xm for some m (otherwise such a clause would be redundant). Denote
P := {(q, r) ∈ ([t] × [3])2 : nq = nr , αq = 0 and αr = 1}.
This is the set of all pairs (q, r) = ((q1 , q2 ), (r1 , r2 )) such that for some m
7

This was called a complementary sphere in [MTW11].

8

• the q2 -th literal (‘summand’) of the q1 -th clause (‘multiple’) is xm , and
• the r2 -th literal (‘summand’) of the r1 -th clause (‘multiple’) is ¬xm .
(In other words, this is the set of all pairs of (pairs of) indices of literals in
conflict.)
Take copies G1 , . . . , Gt of (the clause gadget) G. Denote by σq = σ(q1 ,q2)
the simplex σq2 in the copy Gq1 . Take a triangulation of k-torus T extending
triangulations of its meridian and parallel a and b as boundaries of (ℓ + 1)simplices. For each (q, r) ∈ P take a copy Tqr ⊃ aqr , bqr of T ⊃ a, b. Set
[
K(Φ) := ∪ts=1 Gs
∪(q,r)∈P Tqr .
∂σq =aqr , ∂σr =bqr , (q,r)∈P

That is, this complex is obtained from the copies Gs and Tqr , by identifying the
ℓ-spheres ∂σq and aqr , and the ℓ-spheres ∂σr and bqr , for each (q, r) ∈ P .
Recall that k and ℓ are fixed. Then each of the complexes G and T can
be built by a constant-time algorithm. Hence K(Φ) is obtained from Φ by a
polynomial algorithm in n and t (i.e. in the size of the formula).
Sketch of a proof of Lemma 3. The construction of K ′ (Φ) [MTW11, §4.2, §5.2]
is different from the above construction of K(Φ) by the following details:
• the torus T is replaced by a polyhedron X containing ‘parallel’ and ‘meridian’ a and b, and an edge whose contraction yields T ;
• the simplices σi in the definitions of G and of K(Φ) are replaced by k-disks
ωi ⊂ Int σi .
Thus K(Φ) is obtained from K ′ (Φ) by contracting the edge in each copy of T ,
and by compressing σj − Int ωj ∼
= S ℓ−1 in each copy of G and for each j ∈ [3].
Proof of Theorem 2: the ‘only if ’ part. Assume that there is a PL almost embedding f : |K(Φ)| → Rk+ℓ+1. By Lemma 5 for every s ∈ [t] there is i(s) ∈ [3] such
that the f -images of the spheres Ssi(s) , ∂σsi(s) ⊂ |Gs | are linked modulo 2.
Let us assume, for contradiction, that Φ is not satisfiable; that is, Φ ≡ 0.
(The reader not so familiar with literals, clauses and conflicts, may wish to skip
the next paragraph and check rather the footnote in the following one.)
The function i selects one literal (‘summand’) in each clause (‘multiple’). Then
two selected literals (‘summands’) must be in conflict.
This means that there are q1 , r1 ∈ [t] and m ∈ [n] such that the i(q1 )-th
literal (‘summand’) of the q1 -th clause (‘multiple’) is xm and the i(r1 )-th lit-

9

eral (‘summand’) of the r1 -th clause (‘multiple’) is ¬xm .8 That is, (q, r) :=
((q1 , i(q1 )), (r1 , i(r1 ))) ∈ P .
Then ∂σq = aqr and ∂σr = bqr . Since f is an almost embedding, the f -images
of Sq , Sr and Tqr are pairwise disjoint. The ℓ-sphere bqr bounds the disk v ∗ bqr
outside Sq , where v is any vertex of Gr1 outside ∂σr1 i for each i ∈ [3]. Hence
f (Sq ) is unlinked modulo 2 with f (bqr ). Analogously f (Sr ) is unlinked modulo
2 with f (aqr ). Since k = 2ℓ, all this contradicts the Singular Borromean Rings
Lemma 4 applied to the restriction of f to Sq ⊔ Sr ⊔ Tqr .

The van Kampen number: proof of Lemma 5

For a general position PL map f : |K| → Rd of a finite k-complex define the van
Kampen number
v(f ) ∈ Z2
to be the parity of the number of points x ∈ Rd such that x ∈ f (σ) ∩ f (τ ) for
some disjoint simplices σ, τ ∈ K with dim σ + dim τ = d. (For an exposition and
another applications of the van Kampen number see [Sko17], [Sko, §1].)
Lemma 6. Let d be an integer and K a finite complex such that for every pair
σ, τ of disjoint s- and t-simplices in K with s + t = d − 1 the following two
numbers have the same parity:
• the number of (s + 1)-simplices ν containing σ and disjoint with τ ;
• the number of (t + 1)-simplices µ containing τ and disjoint with σ.
Then v(f ) is independent of a general position PL map f : |K| → Rd .
For d = 2 and K = K5 this corresponds to well-known proof of the nonplanarity of K5 [Sko, Lemma 3.4], [BE01, §5]. For the general case the proof is
analogous.
Proof of Lemma 6. Lemma 6 follows analogously to [Sha57, Lemma 3.5] (by interpreting v(f ) as an obstruction to the existence of certain equivariant map).
A direct proof is as follows. Take a general position PL homotopy H : |K| ×
I → Rd × I between general position PL maps H0 , H1 : |K| → Rd . Then
v(H) := ∪{H(σ × I) ∩ H(τ × I) : σ, τ ∈ K, σ ∩ τ = ∅, dim σ + dim τ = d}
8

Indeed, in the opposite case for each m ∈ [n] there is α(m) ∈ {0, 1} such that αsi(s) =
α(nsi(s) ) for each s ∈ [t]. So we can take xnsi(s) := α(nsi(s) ) for each s ∈ [t] and then extend
this to a satisfying assignment.

is a graph. For each i = 0, 1 the vertices of this graph in Rd × i are exactly the
points x from the definition of v(Hi ). So v(Hi ) equals to the number modulo 2
of vertices of this graph in Rd × i. This graph also has vertices in Rd × (0, 1)
corresponding to pairs (ν, τ ) and (σ, µ) from the bullet points of the lemma.
(There could be connected components of v(H) containing no such vertices; there
could be some other vertices of even degree, e.g. vertices of degree 2 coming from
double points of H or vertices of degree 4 coming from triple points of H.)
Analogously to [Hud69, Lemma 11.4] any vertex of this graph
• contained in Rd × i has odd degree.
• contained in Rd × (0, 1) has even degree (by the bullet points of the lemma).
Hence v(H0 ) = v(H1 ).
Lemma 7. For any ℓ < k and general position PL map f : |F | → Rk+ℓ+1 we
have v(f ) = 1 ∈ Z2 .
Proof. For some f Lemma 7 was proved in [SS92, Lemma 1.1]. Then Lemma 7
follows for any f by Lemma 6 after we verify the assumptions of the lemma.
Take any pair σ, τ of disjoint s- and t-simplices in F such that s + t = k + ℓ.
Without loss of generality we assume that s ≤ t. Since t ≤ k, we obtain s ≥ ℓ.
Among (k + 1) + (ℓ + 1) + 2 vertices of F there are exactly two which are not
contained in σ ∪ τ . We distinguish two cases.
• Case s = ℓ. In this case t = k. Since dim F = k, the simplex τ cannot be
extended to a simplex of F (disjoint with σ). Since F contains complete
(ℓ + 1)-skeleton, σ can be extended (to (s + 1)-simplex of F disjoint with
τ ) by both vertices of F not contained in σ ∪ τ . The numbers 0 and 2 have
the same parity as required.
• Case s > ℓ. In this case ℓ < t < k.
Subcase when neither σ nor τ contains p. Since p is contained only in
simplices of dimension at most ℓ + 1, neither σ not τ can be extended by p
to a simplex of F . On the other hand, since s, t < k, the remaining vertex
of F can serve for extension of both σ or τ . The numbers 1 and 1 have the
same parity as required.
Subcase when σ or τ contains p. Since t > ℓ and p can be only contained
in a simplex of dimension at most ℓ + 1, we can without loss of generality
assume that p ∈ σ and s = ℓ + 1. Since p does not belong to any (ℓ + 2)simplex, it follows that σ cannot be extended. On the other hand, τ can
be extended in two ways to both vertices of F not contained in σ ∪ τ . The
numbers 0 and 2 have the same parity as required.

the definition of v(g) there corresponds a unique unordered pair of simplices of
F , the sum of whose dimensions is d and the intersection of whose g-images
contains x. Since f is an almost-embedding, for every such point x there is
aPunique i ∈ [3] such that x ∈ g(σi ) ∩ g(Si ). This and Lemma 7 imply that
3
v(g) = 1 ∈ Z2 . Hence one of the three summands is odd
i=1 |g(σi ) ∩ g(Si )| ≡
2
as required.
