Abstract
Tucker and Ky Fan’s lemma are combinatorial analogs of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem (BUT). In 1996, Yu. A. Shashkin proved a version of Fan’s lemma, which is a
combinatorial analog of the odd mapping theorem (OMT). We consider generalizations
of these lemmas for BUT–manifolds, i.e. for manifolds that satisfy BUT. Proofs rely
on a generalization of the OMT and on a lemma about the doubling of manifolds with
boundaries that are BUT–manifolds.

Keywords: Tucker lemma, Ky Fan lemma, Shashkin lemma, Borsuk–Ulam theorem, degree

Tucker’s, Fan’s and Shashkin’s lemmas

Throughout this paper the symbol Rd denotes the Euclidean space of dimension d. We denote
by Bd the d-dimensional unit ball and by Sd the d-dimensional unit sphere. If we consider
Sd as the set of unit vectors x in Rd+1 , then points x and −x are called antipodal and the
symmetry given by the mapping x → −x is called the antipodality on Sd .

1.1

Tucker and Fan’s lemma

Let T be a triangulation of the d-dimensional ball Bd . We call T antipodally symmetric on
the boundary if the set of simplices of T contained in the boundary of Bd = Sd−1 is an
antipodally symmetric triangulation of Sd−1 ; that is if s ⊂ Sd−1 is a simplex of T , then −s
is also a simplex of T .
Tucker’s lemma [16] Let T be a triangulation of Bd that is antipodally symmetric on the
boundary. Let
L : V (T ) → {+1, −1, +2, −2, . . . , +d, −d}
be a labelling of the vertices of T that is antipodal (i. e. L(−v) = −L(v)) for every vertex
v on the boundary. Then there exists an edge in T that is complementary, i.e. its two
vertices are labelled by opposite numbers.

There is also a version of Tucker’s lemma for spheres:
Spherical Tucker’s lemma. Let T be a centrally symmetric triangulation of the sphere Sd .
Let
L : V (T ) → {+1, −1, +2, −2, . . . , +d, −d}
be an antipodal labelling. Then there exists a complementary edge.
Tucker’s lemma was extended by Ky Fan [3]:
Ky Fan’s lemma. Let T be a centrally symmetric triangulation of the sphere Sd . Suppose
that each vertex v of T is assigned a label L(v) from {±1, ±2, . . . , ±n} in such a way that
L(−v) = −L(v). Suppose this labelling does not have complementary edges. Then there are
an odd number of d-simplices of T whose labels are of the form {k0 , −k1 , k2 , . . . , (−1)d kd },
where 1 ≤ k0 < k1 < . . . < kd ≤ n. In particular, n ≥ d + 1.

1.2

Shashkin’s lemma

In the 1990’s, Yu. A. Shashkin published several works related to discrete versions of classic
fixed point theorems [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In [13] he proved the following theorem:
Shashkin’s lemma. Let T be a triangulation of a planar polygon that is antipodally symmetric on the boundary. Let
L : V (T ) → {+1, −1, +2, −2, +3, −3}
be a labelling of the vertices of T that satisfies L(−v) = −L(v) for every vertex v on the
boundary. Suppose that this labelling does not have complementary edges. Then for any numbers a, b, c, where |a| = 1, |b| = 2, |c| = 3, the total number of triangles in T with labels
(a, b, c) and (−a, −b, −c) is odd.

Figure 2: Illustration of Shashkin’s lemma.

Remark. In other words, Shashkin proved that if (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3), (1, −2, 3), (1, 2, −3)
and (1, −2, −3), then the number of triangles with labels (a, b, c) or (−a, −b, −c) is odd.
Denote this number by SN(a, b, c). Then in Fig. 2 we have
SN(1, 2, 3) = 3, SN(1, −2, 3) = 1, SN(1, 2, −3) = 3, SN(1, −2, −3) = 3.
Note that this result was published only in Russian and only for two–dimensional case.
Moreover, Shashkin attributes this theorem to Ky Fan [3].
Actually, Shashkin’s lemma can be derived from Ky Fan’s lemma for n = d + 1. However.
Shashkin’s proof is different and relies on the odd mapping theorem (OMT). In fact, this
lemma is a discrete version of the OMT. That is why we distinguish this result as Shashkin’s
lemma.
The following is a spherical version of Shashkin’s lemma.
Spherical Shashkin’s lemma. Let T be a centrally symmetric triangulation of Sd . Let
L : V (T ) → Πd+1 := {+1, −1, +2, −2, . . . , +(d + 1), −(d + 1)}
be an antipodal labelling of T . Suppose that this labelling does not have complementary edges.
Then for any set of labels Λ := {`1 , `2 , . . . , `d+1 } ⊂ Πd+1 with |`i | = i for all i, the number of
d–simplices in T that are labelled by Λ is odd.

Main results

In [7] we invented BUT (Borsuk–Ulam Type) – manifolds. Theorems 3.1–3.4 in this paper extend Tucker’s and Shashkin’s lemmas for BUT–manifolds. Namely, Theorem 3.1 and
Theorem 3.2 are extensions of the spherical Tucker and Shahskin lemmas, where Sd is substituted by a BUT–manifold. Theorems 3.3 and 3.4 are extensions of the original Tucker and
Shashkin lemmas, where Bd is substituted by a manifold M with boundary ∂M that is a
BUT–manifold.
3

Our proof of Theorem 3.2 is relies on a generalization of the odd mapping theorem for
BUT–manifolds:
Theorem 2.1. Let (M1 , A1 ) and (M2 , A2 ) be BUT–manifolds. Then any odd continuous
mapping f : M1 → M2 has odd degree.
Theorems 3.3 and 3.4 follow from Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 by using Lemma 3.1, which is
about the doubling of manifolds with boundaries that are BUT–manifolds.
In Section 4 we extend for BUT–manifolds Shaskin’s proof of two Tucker’s theorems
about covering families from [16]. Actually, these theorems are corollaries of Theorem 3.2.

The odd mapping theorem

We say that a mapping f : Sd → Sd is odd or antipodal if f (−x) = −f (x) for all x ∈ Sd . If f
is a continuous mapping, then deg f (the degree of f ) is well defined.
Let f : M1 → M2 be a continuous map between two closed manifolds M1 and M2 of
the same dimension. The degree is a number that represents the amount of times that the
domain manifold wraps around the range manifold under the mapping. Then deg2 (f ) (the
degree modulo 2) is 1 if this number is odd and 0 otherwise. It is well known that deg2 (f )
of a continuous map f is a homotopy invariant (see [6]).
The classical odd mapping theorem states that
Every continuous odd mapping f : Sd → Sd has odd degree.
Shashkin [13] (see also [5, Proposition 2.4.1]) gives a proof of this theorem for simplicial
mappings f : Sd → Sd . Conner and Floyd [2] considered Theorem 2.1 for a wide class of
spaces. Here we extend the odd mapping theorem for BUT–manifolds. In our paper [7], we
extended the Borsuk–Ulam theorem for manifolds.
Let M be a connected compact PL (piece-wise linear) d-dimensional manifold without boundary with a free simplicial involution A : M → M , i. e. A2 (x) = A(A(x)) = x and A(x) 6= x.
We say that a pair (M, A) is a BUT (Borsuk-Ulam Type) manifold if for any continuous
g : M → Rd there is a point x ∈ M such that g(A(x)) = g(x). Equivalently, if a continuous
map f : M → Rd is antipodal, i.e. f (A(x)) = −f (x), then the set of zeros Zf := f −1 (0) is
not empty.
In [7], we found several equivalent necessary and sufficient conditions for manifolds to be
BUT. In particular,
M is a d–dimensional BUT–manifold if and only if M admits an antipodal continuous
transversal to zeros mapping h : M → Rd with |Zh | = 2 (mod 4).
A continuous mapping h : M → Rd is called transversal to zero if there is an open set U in
Rd such that U contains 0, U is homeomorphic to the open d-ball and h−1 (U ) consists of a
finite number open sets in M that are homeomorphic to open d-balls.
The class of BUT–manifolds is sufficiently large. It is clear that (Sd , A) with A(x) =
−x is a BUT-manifold. Suppose that M can be represented as a connected sum N #N ,
4

where N is a closed PL manifold. Then M admits a free involution. Indeed, M can be
“centrally symmetrically” embedded to Rk , for some k, and the antipodal symmetry x → −x
in Rk implies a free involution A : M → M [7, Corollary 1]. For instance, orientable twodimensional manifolds Mg2 with even genus g and non-orientable manifolds Pm2 with even m,
where m is the number of Möbius bands, are BUT-manifolds.
Let Mi , i = 1, 2, be a manifold with a free involution Ai . We say that a mapping
f : M1 → M2 is antipodal (or odd, or equivariant) if f (A1 (x)) = A2 (f (x)) for all x ∈ M1 .
Theorem 2.1. Let (M1 , A1 ) and (M2 , A2 ) be d-dimensional BUT–manifolds. Then any odd
continuous mapping f : M1 → M2 has odd degree.
Proof. Since (M2 , A2 ) is BUT, there is a continuous antipodal transversal to zeros mapping
g : M2 → Rd with |Zg | = 4m2 + 2 [7, Theorem 2].
Let h := g ◦ f . Then h : M1 → Rd is continuous and antipodal. Since the degree of
a mapping is a homotopy invariant, without loss of generality we may assume that h is a
transversal to zero mapping (see [7, Lemma 3]). Therefore |Zh | = 4m1 + 2. On the other
hand,
X
|Zh | =
|f −1 (x)|.
x∈Zg

Then
2m1 + 1 = (2m2 + 1) deg2 f

(mod 2).

Thus, the degree of f is odd.

Tucker’s and Shashkin’s lemmas for BUT–manifolds

In our papers [7, 8, 9] are considered extensions of Tucker’s lemma. Here we consider generalizations of Tucker’s and Shashkin’s lemmas for manifolds with and without boundaries.
Let T be an antipodally symmetric (or antipodal) triangulation of a BUT–manifold (M, A).
This means that A : T → T sends simplices to simplices. Denote by Πn the set of labels
{+1, −1, +2, −2, . . . , +n, −n} and let L : V (T ) → Πn be a labeling of T . We say that
this labelling is antipodal if L(A(v)) = −L(v). An edge uv in T is called complementary if
L(u) = −L(v).
Theorem 3.1. ([8, Theorem 4.1]) Let (M, A) be a d-dimensional BUT–manifold. Let T
be an antipodal triangulation of M . Then for any antipodal labelling L : V (T ) → Πd there
exists a complementary edge.
Any antipodal labelling L : V (T ) → Πn of an antipodally symmetric triangulation T of
M defines a simplicial map fL : T → Rn . Let {e1 , −e1 , e2 , −e2 , . . . , en , −en } be the standard
orthonormal basis in Rn . For v ∈ V (T ), set fL (v) := ei if L(v) = i and fL (v) := −ei if
L(v) = −i. Since fL is defined on V (T ), it defines a simplicial mapping fL : T → Rn (See
details in [5, Sec. 2.3].)
The following theorem is a version of Shashkin’s lemma for manifolds without boundary.
5

Theorem 3.2. Let (M, A) be a d-dimensional BUT–manifold. Let T be an antipodally
symmetric triangulation of M . Let L : V (T ) → Πd+1 be an antipodal labelling of T .
Suppose that this labelling does not have complementary edges. Then for any set of labels
Λ := {`1 , `2 , . . . , `d+1 } ⊂ Πd+1 with |`i | = i for all i, the number of d–simplices in T that are
labelled by Λ is odd.
Proof. Since L has no complimentary edges, fL : T → Rd+1 is an antipodal mapping of M to the boundary of the crosspolytope C d+1 that is the convex hull
conv {e1 , −e1 , . . . , ed+1 , −ed+1 }. Note that ∂C d+1 is a simplicial sphere Sd , which is a BUTmanifold. Therefore, Theorem 2.2 implies that the number of preimages of the simplex in
∂C d+1 with indexes from Λ is odd. It completes the proof.
Remark. Theorem 3.1 can be proved using the same arguments. Indeed, suppose that L :
V (T ) → Πd has no complementary edges. Then fL sends M to ∂C d . Since dim ∂C d = d − 1,
deg fL = 0. This contradicts Theorem 2.1.
Now we extend Tucker’s and Shashkin’s lemmas for the case when M is a manifold with
boundary that is a BUT–manifold. But first, prove that there exists a “double” of M that
is a BUT-manifold.
Lemma 3.1. Let M be a compact PL manifold with boundary ∂M . Suppose (∂M, A) is a
BUT–manifold. Then there is a BUT–manifold (M̃ , Ã) and a submanifold N in M̃ such that
N ' M , Ã|∂N ' A, (N \ ∂N ) ∩ Ã(N \ ∂N ) = ∅ and
M̃ ' (N \ ∂N ) ∪ ∂N ∪ Ã(N \ ∂N ).
Proof. 1. First we prove the following statement:
Let X be a finite simplicial complex. Let Y be a subcomplex of X with a free involution
A : Y → Y . Then there is a simplicial embedding F of X into Rq+ := {(x1 , . . . , xq ) ∈ Rq :
x1 ≥ 0}, where q is sufficiently large, such that Y is centrally symmetrically embedded in Rq ,
i.e. F (A(y)) = −F (y) for all y ∈ Y , and X \ Y is mapped into the interior of Rq+ .
Indeed, let v1 , v−1 , . . . , vm , v−m denote vertices of Y such that A(vk ) = v−k . Let
{vm+1 , . . . , vn } be the set of vertices of X \ Y .
Denote by C n the n–dimensional crosspolytope that is the boundary of convex hull
conv {e1 , −e1 , . . . , en , −en }
of the vectors of the standard orthonormal basis and their negatives.
Now define an embedding F : X → C n . Let F (vk ) := ek , F (v−k ) := e−k , where 1 ≤ k ≤
m, F (vk ) := ek , and k = m + 1, . . . , n. Since F is defined for all of the vertices of X, it
uniquely defines a simplicial (piecewise linear) mapping F : X → C n ⊂ Rn . Then
F (Y ) ⊂ C m ⊂ Rm = {(x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Rn : xi = 0, i = m + 1, . . . , n},
F (A(y)) = −F (y) for all y ∈ Y and
F (X \ Y ) ⊂ Rn−1
:= {(x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Rn : xm+1 + . . . + xn > 0},
+
6

as required.
2. Let X = M and Y = ∂M . Then it follows from 1 that there is an embedding F : M → Rq+
with F (∂M ) ⊂ Rq and F (A(y)) = −F (y) for all y ∈ ∂M , where q = n − 1. Let
M̃ := F (M ) ∪ (−F (M )) ⊂ Rq+1 = Rq+ ∪ (−Rq+ ) and Ã(x) := −x for all x ∈ M̃ .
It is clear that M̃ ' (N \ ∂N ) ∪ ∂N ∪ Ã(N \ ∂N ), where N := F (M ).
3. Let us prove that (M̃ , Ã) is BUT. Indeed, since (∂M, A) is BUT, there is a continuous
antipodal transversal to zeros mapping g : ∂M ' ∂N → Rd−1 with |Zg | = 4m + 2, where
d := dim M. We extend this mapping to h : M̃ → Rd with h|∂N = g and |Zh | = |Zg | = 4m+2.
Let v = (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Rn be a vertex of M̃ . If v ∈ ∂N , then put
h(v) := (g(v), 0) ∈ Rd .
For v ∈ M̃ \ ∂N define
h(v) := (0, . . . , 0, xm+1 + . . . + xn ) ∈ Rd .
Then h : M̃ → Rd is an antipodal transversal to zeros mapping and h−1 (0) = g −1 (0).
Theorem 3.3. Let M be a d–dimensional compact PL manifold with boundary ∂M . Suppose
(∂M, A) is a BUT–manifold. Let T be a triangulation of M that antipodally symmetric on
∂M . Let L : V (T ) → Πd be a labelling of T that is antipodal on the boundary. Then there is
a complementary edge in T .
Theorem 3.4. Let M be a d–dimensional compact PL manifold with boundary ∂M . Suppose
(∂M, A) is a BUT–manifold. Let T be a triangulation of M that antipodally symmetric on
∂M . Let L : V (T ) → Πd+1 be a labelling of T that is antipodal on the boundary and has no
complementary edges. Then for any set of labels Λ := {`1 , `2 , . . . , `d+1 } ⊂ Πd+1 with |`i | = i
for all i, the number of d–simplices in T that are labelled by Λ or (−Λ) is odd.
Proof. By Lemma 3.1 there is a BUT–manifold (M̃ , Ã) that is the double of M . We can
extend T and L from M to an antipodal triangulation T̃ := T ∪ Ã(T ) of M̃ and an antipodal
labelling L̃ : V (T̃ ) → Πn , where n = d in Theorem 3.3 and n = d + 1 in Theorem 3.4, such
that L̃|T = L.
Thus, for the case n = d Theorem 3.3 follows from Theorem 3.1 and for n = d + 1
Theorem 3.2 yields Theorem 3.4.

Shashkin’s proof of Tucker’s theorems

In this section we consider two Tucker’s theorems about covering families. Note that Tucker
[16] obtained these theorem only for S2 . Bacon [1] proved that statements in Theorems 4.1
and 4.2 are equivalent to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem for normal topological spaces X with free
7

continuous involutions A : X → X. (See also Theorem 2.1 in our paper [9].) Actually, these
theorems can be proved from properties of Schwarz’s genus [15] or Yang’s cohomological
index [4, 9].
For the two–dimensional case in the book [14] Shashkin derives Tucker’s theorems from
his lemma. Here we extend his proof for BUT–manifolds of all dimensions.
Theorem 4.1. Let (M, A) be a d-dimensional BUT–manifold. Consider a family of closed
sets {Bi , B−i }, i = 1, . . . , d + 1, where B−i := A(Bi ), is such that Bi ∩ B−i = ∅ for all i. If
this family covers M , then for any set of indices {k1 , k2 , . . . , kd+1 } ⊂ Πd+1 with |ki | = i for
all i, the intersection of all Bki is not empty.
Proof. Note that any PL manifold admits a metric. For a triangulation T of M , the norm
of T , denoted by |T |, is the diameter of the largest simplex in T .
Let T1 , T2 , . . . be a sequence of antipodal triangulations of M such that |Ti | → 0. Now
for all i define an antipodal labelling Li : V (Ti ) → Πd+1 . For every v ∈ V (Ti ) ⊂ M set
Li (v) := `, where v ∈ B` and |`| = min {|k| : v ∈ Bk }.
Then Li satisfies the assumptions in Theorem 3.2 and Ti contains a simplex si with labels
{k1 , k2 , . . . , kd+1 } ⊂ Πd+1 .
Since M is compact and |si | → 0, the sequence {si } contains a converging subsequence
P with limit w ∈ M . Then for si ∈ P we have V (si ) → w.
By assumption, all Bk are closed sets. Therefore w ∈ Bkj for all j = 1, . . . , d + 1, and
thus w ∈ ∩j Bkj .
Theorem 4.2. Let (M, A) be a d-dimensional BUT–manifold. Suppose that M is covered by
a family F of d + 2 closed subsets C1 , . . . , Cd+2 . Suppose that all Ci have no antipodal pairs
(x, A(x)), in other words, Ci ∩ A(Ci ) = ∅. Let 0 < k < d + 2. Then any k subsets from F
intersect and there is a point x in this intersection such that A(x) belongs to the intersection
of the remaining (d + 2 − k) subsets in F.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that k ≥ (d + 2)/2 and that the k subsets
from F are C1 , . . . , Ck . Therefore, we have to prove that there is x ∈ M such that

On the other hand, Bi ⊂ Ci and B−i ⊂ C−i , hence Bi ∩ B−i = ∅. Therefore, the family of
subsets {Bi } satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 4.1. It follows that
Q := B1 ∩ . . . ∩ Bk ∩ B−(k+1) ∩ . . . ∩ B−(d+1) 6= ∅.
Let x ∈ Q. Then
x ∈ C1 ∩ . . . ∩ Ck and A(x) ∈ C−(k+1) ∩ . . . ∩ C−(d+1) .
Since k ≥ m + 1 and x ∈ B1 = C1 ∩ (C−2 ∪ . . . ∪ C−(m+1) ∪ C−(d+2) ), we have x ∈ C−(d+2) ,
i.e. A(x) ∈ Cd+2 .
Corollary 4.1. Let (M, A) be a d-dimensional BUT–manifold. Then M cannot be covered
by d + 1 closed sets, none containing a pair (x, A(x)) of antipodal points.
Note that the case M = Sd was first considered by Lusternik and Schnirelmann in 1930.
Proof. Suppose the converse, so M can be covered by closed subsets C1 , . . . , Cd+1 .
Let Cd+2 := C1 . Then this covering satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 4.2. So there is
x such that
d+1

a contradiction.
