Abstract. We obtain a generalization of the DeGiorgi Lemma to the infinitely degenerate regime and
apply it to obtain continuity of weak solutions to certain infinitely degenerate equations. This reproduces
the continuity result obtained in [KoRiSaSh1] via Moser iteration, but only for homogeneous equations.
However, the proofs are much less technical and more transparent.

1. Introduction
In [KoRiSaSh2], building on work from [KoRiSaSh1], local boundedness was established for weak subsolutions to certain infinitely degenerate elliptic divergence form equations, motivated by the pioneering work
of Fedii [Fe], Kusuoka and Strook [KuStr], Morimoto [Mor] and Christ [Chr]. The main theorem on local
boundedness in [KoRiSaSh2] included this.
Theorem 1 ([KoRiSaSh2]). Suppose that D ⊂ Rn is a domain in Rn with n ≥ 3 and that

Lu ≡ div A (x, u) ∇u,
x = (x1 , ..., xn ) ∈ D,


where A (x, z) ∼
, In−1 is the (n − 1) × (n − 1) identity matrix, A has bounded measurable

components, and the geometry F = − ln f satisfies the structure conditions in Definition 6 below.
(1) If F ≤ Dσ for some 0 < σ < 1, then every weak solution to Lu = φ with A-admissible φ is locally
bounded in D.
(2) Conversely, if n ≥ 3 and σ > 1, then there exists an unbounded weak solution u in a neighbourhood
of the origin in Rn to the equation Lu = 0 with geometry F = Dσ .

The purpose of this paper is to improve the local boundedness conclusion in part (1) of Theorem 1 to
include continuity. For the geometric continuity theorem we need to
consider
σ a less degenerate family of

(1) If F ≤ F3,σ for some 0 < σ < 1, then every weak solution to Lu = 0 is continuous in Ω.
(2) On the other hand, if n ≥ 3 and σ ≥ 1, then there exists a locally unbounded weak solution u in a
neighbourhood of the origin in Rn to the equation Lu = 0 with geometry F = F0,σ .

1.1. Preliminaries and definitions. We recall some of the terminology and definitions from [KoRiSaSh1]
and [KoRiSaSh2] that we use here. Let A (x) be a nonnegative semidefinite n × n matrix valued function
in a bounded domain Ω ⊂ Rn . We consider the second order special quasilinear equation (‘special’ because
only u, and not ∇u, appears nonlinearly),
Lu ≡ ∇tr A (x, u (x)) ∇u = φ,

x ∈ Ω,

and we assume the following quadratic form condition on the quasilinear matrix A(x, u(x)),
k ξ T A(x)ξ ≤ ξ T A(x, z)ξ ≤ K ξ T A(x)ξ ,

(1.1)

for a.e. x ∈ Ω and all z ∈ R, ξ ∈ Rn . Here k, K are positive constants and we assume that A(x) =
tr
B (x) B (x) where B (x) is a Lipschitz continuous n × n real-valued matrix defined for x ∈ Ω. We also
consider the linear equation
Lu ≡ ∇tr A (x) ∇u = φ,
x ∈ Ω,
and define the A-gradient by
(1.2)

∇A = B (x) ∇ .

Note that our quadratic form condition (1.1) implies that the integral on the left above is absolutely
convergent, and our assumption that φ ∈ L2loc (Ω) implies that the integral on the right above is absolutely
convergent. Weak sub and super solutions are defined by replacing = with ≥ and ≤ respectively in the

Definition 5. Let Ω be a bounded domain in Rn and let A (x) be a nonnegative semidefinite n × n matrix

Definition 6 (structure conditions). We refer to the following five conditions on F : (0, ∞) → R as structure
conditions:
(1) limx→0+ F (x) = +∞;
(2) F ′ (x) < 0 and F ′′ (x) > 0 for all x ∈ (0, R);
(3) C1 |F ′ (r)| ≤ |F ′ (x)| ≤ C |F ′ (r)| for 12 r < x < 2r < R;
(4) −xF1′ (x) is increasing in the interval (0, R) and satisfies −xF1′ (x) ≤ 1ε for x ∈ (0, R);

Remark 7. We make no smoothness assumption on f other than the existence of the second derivative f ′′
on the open interval (0, R). Note also that at one extreme, f can be of finite type, namely f (x) = xα for any
1
α > 0, and at the other extreme, f can be of strongly degenerate type, namely f (x) = e− xα for any α > 0.
Assumption (1) rules out the elliptic case f (0) > 0.
Notation 8. We refer to a function F satisfying the structure conditions in Definition 6 as a ‘geometry’

since F = − ln f then specifies the nonnegative semidefinite matrix MF =

Lu = div A (x) ∇u,

A (x) ∼ MF (x1 ) ,

is also specified along with the associated class of quasilinear operators
Lu = div A∇u,

A (x, z) ∼ MF (x1 ) .

1.2. Control balls. We now recall further notation from [KoRiSaSh1] and [KoRiSaSh2], beginning with
the case of n = 2 dimensions. Let d (x, y) be the control metric on an open subset Ω of the plane R2 that
is associated with the matrix A, and refer to the associated balls as control balls, subunit balls, or A-balls.
Now we recall the definition of “height” of an arbitrary A-ball. Let X = (x1 , 0) be a point on the positive
x-axis and let r be a positive real number. Let the upper half of the boundary of the ball B(X, r) be given as
the graph of the function ϕ (x), x1 − r < x < x1 + r. Denote by β X,P the geodesic that meets the boundary
of the ball B(X, r) at the point P = (x1 + r∗ , h) where β X,P has a vertical tangent at P , r∗ = r∗ (x1 , r) and
h = h (x1 , r) = ϕ (x1 + r∗ ). Here both r∗ and h are functions of the two independent variables x1 and r, but
we will often write r∗ = r∗ (x1 , r) and h = h (x1 , r) for convenience. We refer to h = h (x1 , r) as the height
of the ball B((x1 , 0), r). In [KoRiSaSh1] the authors proved the following estimates on the height.
Proposition 9. Let β X,P , r∗ and h be defined as above. Define λ (x) implicitly by
Z x

λ (x) − f (u)

Then

(2) If r ≥ |F ′ (x

h≈

then

and r − r∗ ≈ ′

|F ′ (x1 + r)|
|F (x1 + r)|
h ≈ rf (x1 ) and r − r∗ ≈ r.

Now consider a sequence of metric balls {B (x, rk )}k=1 centered at x ∈ Ω with radii rk ց 0 such that
r0 = r and
|B (x, rk ) \ B (x, rk+1 )| ≈ |B (x, rk+1 )| ,
k ≥ 1,

so that B (x, rk ) is divided into two parts having comparable area. We may in fact assume that

h∗ (x1 , t) =

f 2 (x1 + t) − f 2 (u)

so that h∗ (x1 , t) describes the ‘height’ above x2 at which the geodesic through x = (x1 , x2 ) curls back toward

the y-axis at the point (x1 + t, x2 + h∗ (x1 , t)). Then in the case rk ≥ |F ′ (x

h (x1 , rk ), k ≥ 0, where h (x1 , rk ) is the height of B (x, rk ). In the opposite case rk < |F ′ (x
1 )|
1
rk+1 = 2 rk instead, and we will estimate differently.
For k ≥ 0 define
(

{y : x1 + rk+1 ≤ y1 < x1 + rk , |y2 | < h∗ (x1 , y1 − x1 )}
if rk ≥ |F ′ (x

{y : x1 + rk+1 ≤ y1 < x1 + rk , |y2 | < h (x1 , rk ) = h (x1 , rk )} if rk < |F ′ (x1 )|
where we have written rk∗ = r∗ (x1 , rk ) for convenience. In [KoRiSaSh1] it was shown that


\


(1.5)
|E (x, rk )| ≈ E (x, rk ) B (x, rk ) ≈ |B (x, rk )| for all k ≥ 1,

and hence that

|E (x, rk ) ∩ B (x, rk )| ≥

crk f (x1 ) rk ≈ |B (x, rk )| ≥ |E (x, rk ) ∩ B (x, rk )| .

The following lemma was proved in [KoRiSaSh1].

RLemma 10. With notation as above, in particular with r0 = r and r1 given by (1.4), and assuming
E(x,r1 ) w = 0, we have the subrepresentation formula

Note that when f (r) = rN is finite type, then db(x, y) ≈ d (x, y). Now define

In the three dimensional case, the quantities hx,y and db(x, y) remain formally the same (see Chapter 10 of
[KoRiSaSh1]) and we can write a typical geodesic in the form

where B2D (a, s) denotes the 2-dimensional control ball centered at a in the plane parallel to the x1 , x3 plane with radius s that was associated with f above (see Corollaries 107 and 108 in [KoRiSaSh1] and the

3.3. Proof of Theorem 2. We can now prove Theorem 2 for weak solutions to a homogeneous degenerate
equation. In fact it is easily seen, using Corollary 15, that it suffices to prove the following local statement
with √1
= AN (3r), where AN (r) is the constant in the local boundedness inequality (3.1) defined in
2

δ(r)

(3.2).
Proposition 16. Let Br = B (x, r). Suppose that (2.9) holds, and also that for some δ (r) > 0, we have the
following local boundedness inequality,

to Lu = 0 in Br0 , we conclude that u is continuous at x.
We now reduce the proof of Proposition 16 to proving Proposition 18 below, which shows that if a solution
v is bounded by 1 in a ball B3r , and is nonpositive on a ‘sufficiently large’ subset of the smaller ball Br ,
then v is in fact bounded by a constant less than 1 in the smaller ball Br . This reduction is achieved in two
steps by way of the following lemma.
Lemma 17. Suppose that the local boundedness property in Proposition 16 holds, equivalently (3.4). Let u
be a weak solution of Lu = 0 in Br0 . Then with λ (r) ≡ 3+ 1C3 we have

which implies limℓ→∞ oscB r u = 0 since the infinite product above vanishes if the summability condition

(3.5) holds. Hence u is continuous at x, which proves Proposition 16.
Next we note that Lemma 17 is in turn an easy consequence of this proposition.
Proposition 18. Suppose that the local boundedness property (3.4) holds. With r sufficiently small, let

If instead we have |{v ≥ 0} ∩ Br | ≥ 12 |Br |, we obtain the same inequality by applying the above argument

Thus matters have been reduced to proving Proposition 18.
Proof of Proposition 18. Define

wk = 2k v − (1 − 2−k )

and let ϕ ∈ C0∞ (B3r ) be such that ϕ = 1 on B2r and ||∇A ϕ||L∞ (B3r ) ≤ r2 . Using Lwk = 0 in B3r0 and the
