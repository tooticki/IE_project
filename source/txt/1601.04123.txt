Relative Thom spectra via operadic Kan
extensions

May 9, 2017
Abstract
We show that a large number of Thom spectra, i.e. colimits of morphisms BG → BGL1 (S), can be obtained as iterated Thom spectra,
i.e. colimits of morphisms BG → BGL1 (M f ) for some Thom spectrum
M f . This leads to a number of new relative Thom isomorphisms, e.g.
M U[6, ∞) ∧M String M U [6, ∞) ≃ M U [6, ∞) ∧ S[B 3 Spin]. As an example
of interest to chromatic homotopy theorists, we also show that Ravenel’s
X(n) filtration of M U is a tower of intermediate Thom spectra determined
by a natural filtration of BU by sub-bialagebras.

Introduction

In this paper we prove several new results about Thom spectra which are En ring spectra. The most immediately accessible results are relative Thom isomorphisms like the following from Section 3
• M Spin ∧MString M Spin ≃ M Spin ∧ S[K(Z, 4)]
• M SO ∧MU M SO ≃ M SO ∧ S[Spin]
• M U ∧MSp M U ≃ M U ∧ S[SO/U ]
• M U[6, ∞) ∧MString M U [6, ∞) ≃ M U [6, ∞) ∧ S[B 3 Spin]
• HZ/2 ∧HZ HZ/2 ≃ HZ/2 ∧ S[S 1 ].
However, in consideration of the fact that there are now a number of different methods for defining such objects, we will take a moment to clarify precisely
which models we use for the remainder (though we do not expect that the choice
of model is relevant to the veracity of the statements). By the category of spectra, which we denote by S, we will always mean Lurie’s symmetric monoidal
quasicategory of spectra defined in Section 1.4.3 of [12]. In general, except
when we explicitly state otherwise, we will always be working with quasicategories and all of our constructions will be homotopy invariant. For example, all
of our tensor products are derived (as they must be when working internally to
1

a quasicategory), all of our limits and colimits are the quasicategorical analogs
of homotopy colimits and limits, and our functors are actually morphisms of
simplicial sets. We also make use of Lurie’s notion of ∞-operads, defined and
described in Chapter 2 of [12]. We will not review the theory of ∞-operads here
except to say that they are a natural generalization of the notion of multicategories and the categories of operators of [15]. We are especially interested in the
En ∞-operads of Chapter 5 of [12], and will refer to them frequently in this paper. These ∞-operads capture the same structure as Boardman and Vogt’s little
n-cubes operads, which use embeddings of n-dimensional cubes to parameterize
multiplicative structure (cf. Chapter 4 of [16]). It is non-trivial to show that
these quasicategorical constructions behave identically to their model category
theoretic analogs, and that results obtained thereby are compatible with results
obtained using model categories. The interested reader is invited to refer to [13]
and [12] for proofs that these conditions are met. We recognize, of course, that
these references are expansive in their own right, so will endeavor to give more
specific citations throughout the paper.
Thom spectra, the main objects of investigation here, are classically constructed by considering spaces associated to stable spherical bundles on topological spaces (see e.g. [22]). However, after work of May and Sigurdsson [17]
and later work of Ando, Blumberg, Gepner, Hopkins and Rezk [2], it became
clear that there was an alternative way to think of Thom spectra: as quotients
of ring spectra by group actions. In general, given an En -ring spectrum R, there
is an n-fold loop space of units, GL1 (R). Thus a morphism of n-fold loop spaces
X → GL1 (R) gives an action of X on R, and induces a morphism of (n − 1)-fold
loop spaces BX → BGL1 (R). By working quasicategorically, we can see that
there is in fact a functor (thinking of BX and BGL1 (R) as quasicategories)
BGL1 (R) ֒→ LM odR which is fully faithful. Thus we have a morphism of simplicial sets BX → LM odR (the quasicategory of left R-modules, where R is
considered as an E1 -ring spectrum) which is picking out an action of X on R by
R-module equivalences. This determines a diagram in LM odR whose colimit,
as the thing on which every point of X, including the identity, acts in the same
way, must be exactly R/X. When R = S, the sphere spectrum, BGL1 (S) is
precisely the classifying space of stable spherical fibrations, and taking the colimit of a morphism BX → BGL1 (S) ֒→ LM odS produces a spectrum which is
equivalent to the one produced classically by taking a sequence of Thom spaces
over BX (cf. Proposition 3.23 of [2]). Thus, for instance, M U is just S/U and
M O is just S/O, and so on and so forth.
Similarly, if we have an action of a Lie group G on a smooth manifold X,
we can take its homogeneous space X/G. If we happen to have an inclusion
of a normal subgroup H ֒→ G, then we obtain an action of H on X and can
also take the homogeneous space X/H. It is a classical fact then that X/H
admits an action of G/H and moreover that the iterated homogeneous space
(X/H)/(G/H) is diffeomorphic to X/G (cf. Section 1.6, Proposition 13 of [5]).
It stands to reason then that something similar should be true for actions of
n-fold loop spaces on a ring spectrum R, and that is one of the main theorems of
this document (cf. Theorem 1), if we allow ourselves to replace the condition “H
2

is a normal subgroup of G” with “there is a fiber sequence of n-fold loop spaces
H → G → G/H.” Specifically, if we have a G-action on an En -ring spectrum
R, then we obtain a G/H-action on R/H, and a sequence of ring spectra R →
R/H → (R/H)/(G/H) ≃ R/G. In other words, R/G can be produced as the
Thom spectrum associated to an action map G/H → BGL1 (R/H).
In Section 2 we show that a number of classical Thom spectra over S can in
fact be constructed as Thom spectra over other Thom spectra. This statement
is made rigorous by the following theorem, which is Theorem 1 in the body of
the paper:
i

q

Theorem. Suppose Y → X → B is a fiber sequence of reduced En -monoidal
Kan complexes for n > 1 with i and q both maps of En -algebras. Let f : X →
BGL1 (S) be a morphism of En -monoidal Kan complexes for n > 1. Then there
is a a morphism of En−1 -algebras B → BGL1 (M (f ◦ i)) whose associated Thom
spectrum is equivalent to M f .
By constructing M f as a Thom spectrum over an intermediate Thom spectrum, we get a relative Thom isomorphism:
Corollary. There is a morphism of En−1 -ring spectra R → M (f ◦i) → M f and
a relative Thom isomorphism M f ∧M(f ◦i) M f ≃ M f ∧R R[B] where R[B] =
R ∧S Σ∞
+ B.
The proof requires certain technical details and constructions from [12], so
we separate the relevant lemmas into their own subsection (2.1) and refer to
them as needed. In the final section we give a number of examples of constructions of intermediate Thom spectra which are En -rings. The last example we
present is a new construction of M U which bears some resemblance to Lazard’s
construction of the Lazard ring in [10]. This construction is unrelated to recent
work regarding M U and complex orientations by McKeown [18]. This paper
comprises work contained in the author’s doctoral thesis.
Let us fix some notation for the remainder of the paper: the quasicategory of
spectra will be denoted by S and the quasicategory of Kan complexes, sometimes
called spaces, will be denoted T ; the quasicategory of small quasicategories will
be denoted by qCat (to avoid set-theoretic issues we assume the existence of
inaccessible cardinals as necessary, as in 1.2.15 of [13]); O⊗ or O will always
refer to an ∞-operad; En will refer to the little n-cubes ∞-operad, but sometimes
when considering the E∞ -operad in its role as the terminal ∞-operad we will
denote it by F in∗ , to indicate that it is equivalent to the nerve of the category
of finite pointed sets; for an En -ring spectrum R, we denote the En−1 -monoidal
quasicategory of left R-modules over R as an E1 -ring spectrum by LM odR ;
BGL1 (R) will be the Kan complex defined in [2], i.e. the delooping of the Kan
complex of homotopy automorphisms of R in LM odR .

Intermediate Thom Spectra

The following theorem describes our general method for producing intermediate
Thom spectra:
i

q

Theorem 1. Suppose Y → X → B is a fiber sequence of reduced En -monoidal
Kan complexes for n > 1 with i and q both maps of En -algebras. Let f : X →
BGL1 (R) be a morphism of En -monoidal Kan complexes for n > 1. Then there
is a a morphism of En−1 -algebras B → BGL1 (M (f ◦ i)) whose associated Thom
spectrum is equivalent to M f .
The following two corollaries follow immediately from Theorem 1:
Corollary 2. Given the assumptions of Theorem 1, there is an equivalence of
En−1 -R-algebras M f ≃ M (f ◦ i) ∧R[ΩB] R where R is equipped with the trivial
R[ΩB]-module structure.
Proof. For a fiber sequence Y → X → B of En -spaces we have a fiber sequence
ΩB → Y → X such that X is equivalent to a bar construction Bar• (Y, ΩB, ∗).
Thus, since the Thom spectrum functor is symmetric monoidal and preserves
colimits (cf. Corollary 8.1 of [1], or Lewis’ slightly weaker result in [11]), the
Thom spectrum of X → BGL1 (R) is equivalent to the bar construction in En -Ralgebras, and such in general only admits the structure of an En−1 -algebra.
Remark 3. Constructing Thom spectra as bar constructions is not a new idea,
and should be compared to the bar construction definition of generalized Thom
spectra given in Sections 23.4 and 23.5 of [17].
Corollary 4. Given the assumptions of Theorem 1, there is a morphism of
En−1 -R-algebra spectra R → M (f ◦ i) → M f and a relative Thom isomorphism
M f ∧M(f ◦i) M f ≃ M f ∧R R[B] where R[B] = R ∧S Σ∞
+ B.
Proof. The fact that the equivalence exists and is an equivalence of En−1 -Ralgebras follows from Corollary 1.8 of [1]. In particular, we know that the
equivalence is given by a morphism M f ∧M(f ◦i) M f → M f ∧M(f ◦i) M f ∧R
R[B] → M f ∧R R[B], where the first map is the Thom diagonal and the second
map is the M (f ◦ i)-algebra structure map of M f .
We now give a proof of Theorem 1, though it relies on Lemmas which we
defer to Section 2.1. It also makes crucial use of the notion of an operadic left
Kan extension, as described in Section 3.1.2 of [12].
Proof. Note that M (f ◦ i) is an En -algebra, so BGL1 (M (f ◦ i)) is an (n − 1)fold loop space, so we cannot hope for the desired map to be more structured
f
than this. By Lemmas 5 and 6 the En−1 -monoidal left Kan extension of X →
BGL1 (S) ֒→ S along q : X → B exists and takes the unique 0-simplex of B
to the En -algebra M (f ◦ i). By Proposition 8, this Kan extension factors as a
morphism of En−1 -monoidal Kan complexes through BGL1 (M (f ◦ i)). Taking
the Thom spectrum of the induced morphism B → BGL1 (M (f ◦ i)) produces
4

M (f ◦ i)/(ΩB) as a Thom spectrum over M (f ◦ i). Moreover, taking the colimit
of the functor B → BGL1 (M (f ◦ i)) ֒→ LM odM(f ◦i) is equivalent to taking the
colimit of the underlying spectra, by Corollary 4.2.3.7 of [12]. However, taking
the colimit in spectra is equivalent to forming the left operadic Kan extension
of B → S along the map B → ∗. By Lemma 7 and Corollary 3.1.4.2 of [12]
we have that the left operadic Kan extension along X → B followed by the
left operadic Kan extension along B → ∗ is equivalent to the left operadic Kan
extension along X → ∗ (i.e. Kan extensions compose). In other words, the
En−1 -M (f ◦ i)-module M (f ◦ i)/(ΩB) has an underlying spectrum equivalent
to the colimit of X → BGL1 (S) which is of course M f . Thus the iterated Kan
extension which produces M (f ◦ i) = S/ΩY and then quotients it by the action
of ΩB is equivalent to the one-step Kan extension producing S/ΩX ≃ M f
with an “action” of the trivial En−1 -space. Hence M f is produced as a Thom
spectrum over M (f ◦ i).

2.1

The Lemmas

Lemma 5. Let X be a Kan complex and f : X → C an En -monoidal morphism
of quasicategories where C is a cocomplete quasicategory. Then for any morphism of En -monoidal Kan complexes p : X → B, the operadic Kan extension
of f along p exists.
Proof. Since X and B are Kan complexes, hence essentially small, and C is
cocomplete, the result follows from Corollary 3.1.3.5 of [12].
i

q

Lemma 6. Let Y → X → B be a fiber sequence of En -monoidal Kan complexes. The En -monoidal left Kan extension of an En -monoidal morphism
f : X → BGL1 (S) ֒→ S along q : X → B is computed by taking the colimit
of the composition
f ib(X → B) ≃ Y → X → BGL1 (S) ֒→ S.
Proof. Following the notation given in Definition 3.1.2.2 and the construction
in Remark 3.1.3.15 of [12], we have a correspondence of ∞-operads given by
a
M⊗ ≃ (X ⊗ × ∆1 )
B ⊗ → F in∗ × ∆1 .
X ⊗ ×{1}

In other words, there is a family of ∞-operads indexed by ∆1 which looks like
X ⊗ (the ∞-operad associated to X as an En -monoidal Kan complex) at one
end and B ⊗ at the other end. Formula (∗) of Definition 3.1.2.2 of [12] states
that the value of the desired Kan extension at a 0-simplex σ ∈ B is given by
the colimit diagram:
⊗
⊗ ⊲
⊗ ⊲
((M⊗
act )/σ ×M⊗ X ) → (M )/σ → M → T

where the morphism (M⊗ )⊲/σ → M⊗ takes the cone point to σ. In other words,
the value of the Kan extension at σ is computed by taking the colimit over
5

the diagram in M⊗ of objects (and active morphisms) living over σ. As the
simplicial set M⊗ is nothing more than the mapping cylinder of the morphism
of En -monoidal Kan complexes X ⊗ → B ⊗ , we have the result.
Lemma 7. There is a ∆2 -family of ∞-operads induced by the morphisms of
En−1 -monoidal Kan complexes X → B and B → ∗, denoted M⊗ → ∆2 × F in∗ ,
and the induced projection M⊗ → ∆2 is a flat categorical fibration.
Proof. The equivalence of morphisms (X → B → ∗) ≃ (X → ∗) is given by
a 2-simplex in the quasicategory of En−1 -monoidal quasicategories, hence by
2
a morphism of simplicial sets in Hom(∆2 , Hom(E⊗
n−1 , qCat)) ≃ Hom(∆ ×
⊗
En−1 , qCat). By the quasicategorical Grothendieck construction of [13], we obtain a coCartesian fibration of simplicial sets p : M⊗ → ∆2 × E⊗
n−1 such that
p−1 (0) ≃ X ⊗ , p−1 (1) ≃ B ⊗ and p−1 (2) ≃ ∗⊗ , where X ⊗ , B ⊗ and ∗⊗ are the
∞-operads witnessing the En−1 -monoidal structure on X, B and ∗. The projection map induces a family of ∞-operads M⊗ → ∆2 . This projection is a flat
fibration as it satisfies the requirements of Example B.3.4 of [12], i.e. there are
coCartesian lifts of every edge in ∆2 ≃ ∆2 × ∗ ⊂ ∆2 × F in∗ .
i

q

Proposition 8. Let Y → X → B be a fiber sequence of reduced, connected En monoidal Kan complexes. The left operadic Kan extension of an En -morphism
f : X → BGL1 (S) → S along the En -morphism q : X → B factors as a morphism of En−1 -monoidal Kan complexes through BGL1 (M (f ◦ i)).
Proof. Note that the left operadic Kan extension along q takes the unique zero
simplex of B to M (f ◦ i) by Lemma 6. Since B is an En -monoidal Kan complex
it is also an En -monoidal quasicategory with monoidal unit 1B corresponding
to the base point of B. Moreover all the morphisms of B are also 1B -module
isomorphisms. In other words, LM od1B ≃ BGL1 (1B ) ≃ B as En−1 -monoidal
quasicategories (also cf. Corollary 4.2.4.9 of [12]). Hence it must be that this Kan
extension, being an En -monoidal functor, induces an En−1 -monoidal functor
BGL1 (1B ) ≃ B → BGL1 (M (f ◦ i)).
Remark 9. We can think of the identification B ≃ BGL1 (1B ) as a construction
of the delooping of ΩB by taking the base point component of P ic(LM odΩB ).
In other words as a quasicategory B can be thought of as the maximal En−1 monoidal Kan complex on the object ΩB ∈ LM odΩB .

Examples

A large number of morphisms of En -monoidal Kan complexes fit into the framework described in the introduction and Theorem 1. In the following we repeatedly use the fact from 6.39 in [4] that there is a sequence of infinite loop maps
U → O → GL1 (S) (where they write F for GL1 (S)). The delooped (infinite
loop) map BO → BGL1 (S) is called the j-homomorphism, and the composition
BU → BO → BGL1 (S) is called the complex j-homomorphism. We also use the

6

fact that deloopings and connective covers (modeled by a bar construction and
based loops on a bar construction respectively) take En -spaces to En−1 -spaces
and En -spaces to En -spaces, respectively.
1. BSU → BU → CP ∞ is a fiber sequence of infinite loop spaces. The
complex j-homomorphism BU → BGL1 (S) is a morphism of infinite loop
spaces.
2. BString → BSpin → K(Z, 4) is a fiber sequence of infinite loop spaces.
Using the covering map BSpin → BO composed with the j-homomorphism,
we obtain a map of infinite loop spaces BSpin → BGL1 (S).
3. BU → BSO → Spin is a fiber sequence of infinite loop spaces as a result of
Table 2.1.1 of [9], and the map BSO → BGL1 (S) comes from the classical
j-homomorphism, as above.
4. That BSp → BU → SO/U is a fiber sequence of infinite loop spaces also
follows from [9].
5. BString → BU[6, ∞) → B 3 Spin is a fiber sequence of infinite loop spaces,
again from [9]. The map BU [6, ∞) → BGL1 (S) is the obvious one.
6. BSpin → BSO → B(SO/Spin) is clearly a fiber sequence of infinite loop
spaces, and the map BSO → BGL1 (S) is clear.
7. ΩSU(n) → ΩSU(n + 1) → ΩS 2n+1 is a fiber sequence of E2 -spaces, as
shown in diagram 9.1.2 of [20]. Since, by Bott periodicity, ΩSU ≃ BU ,
there is a morphism of E2 -spaces ΩSU (n + 1) → ΩSU ≃ BU → BGL1 (S).
8. BSO → BO → Z/2 is the usual fiber sequence of infinite loop spaces
giving the 1-connected cover.
9. Ω2 S 3 [3, ∞) → Ω2 S 3 → S 1 is a fiber sequence of E2 -spaces, after [14], and
the morphism Ω2 S 3 → BGL1 (S) is also the one given there.
Thus from Corollaries 2 and 4 we obtain the following equivalences (with
respect to the numbering given above):
1. M U ≃ M SU ∧S[S 1 ] S, and M U ∧MSU M U ≃ M U ∧ S[CP ∞ ].
2. M Spin ≃ M String ∧K(Z,3) S and M Spin ∧MString M Spin ≃ M Spin ∧
S[K(Z, 4)].
3. M SO ≃ M U ∧SO/U S and M SO ∧MU M SO ≃ M SO ∧ S[Spin].
4. M U ≃ M Sp ∧S[U/Sp] S and M U ∧MSp M U ≃ M U ∧ S[SO/U ].
5. M U[6, ∞) ≃ M String ∧BBSpin S and M U[6, ∞) ∧MString M U [6, ∞) ≃
M U [6, ∞) ∧ S[B 3 Spin].
6. M SO ≃ M Spin∧S[SO/Spin] S and M SO∧MSpin M SO ≃ M SO∧S[B(SO/Spin)].
7

7. X(n + 1) ≃ X(n) ∧Ω2 SU(n) S and X(n + 1) ∧X(n) X(n + 1) ≃ X(n + 1) ∧
S[ΩS 2n+1 ].
8. M O ≃ M SO ∧S[Z/2] S and M O ∧MSO M O ≃ M O ∧ S[RP ∞ ].
9. HZ/2 ≃ HZ ∧S[Z] S and HZ/2 ∧HZ HZ/2 ≃ HZ/2 ∧ S[S 1 ].
Remark 10. Some of the examples given above can be verified by computations
using the spectral sequence found in Theorem 6.4 of [8]:
E∗ (R)
T orp,q
(E∗ (M ), E∗ (N )) ⇒ Ep+q (M ∧R N ).

For instance, for E = HZ, we can relatively easily check that
H∗ (X(n + 1) ∧X(n) X(n + 1); Z) ∼
= H∗ (X(n + 1); Z) ⊗Z H∗ (ΩS 2n+1 ; Z).
Similar computations can be made for M U over M SU as well as for the fiber
sequences appearing in Bott periodicity. Much of the relevant algebra for the
latter has in fact already been determined in [6]. It is the author’s hope that the
above equivalences will be of use to homotopy theorists doing the much harder
computations related to various connective covers of BO.
Remark 11. We remark that the relative Thom isomorphisms described above
can be interpreted as torsor conditions for modules over spectral algebraic group
schemes. In particular, if X is a Kan complex (and thus a coalgebra by the
diagonal map) then we may think of an equivalence M f ∧M(f ◦i) M f ≃ M f ∧S[X]
as giving Spec(M f ) the structure of a Spec(S[X])-torsor over Spec(M (f ◦ i)).
Indeed, in terminology familiar to noncommutative geometers, many of the
above examples are Hopf-Galois extensions in the sense of Rognes [21]. We
delay an investigation of this structure to future work.

3.1

A New Construction of MU

The Lazard ring, which classifies formal group laws over discrete rings, is constructed iteratively by obstruction theory, one polynomial generator at a time
(cf. [10]). The spectrum M U, which classifies complex oriented ring spectra,
is given in [19] as the colimit of the sequence of spectra X(n) described in the
previous section. Moreover, the spectra X(n) are strongly related to rings used
to construct the Lazard ring. This naturally leads to the question of whether or
not the X(n) spectra, and thus M U, can also be constructed by some form of
obstruction or deformation theory. Theorem 1 and its corollaries indicate that
X(n + 1) is a “torsor” over X(n) for the coalgebra S[ΩS 2n+1 ]. The stable splitting of ΩS 2n+1 then further implies that X(n + 1) can be thought of a twisted
polynomial extension of X(n) (by a polynomial algebra with a single generator
in degree 2n).
What we show in this section is that even more is true. By invoking Theorem 4.10 of [3], we can deduce that X(n + 1) is in fact a so-called versal
E1 -X(n)-algebra of characteristic χn , where χn is a class in π2n−1 (X(n)). This
8

terminology, introduced in [23], indicates that X(n + 1) can be thought of as a
highly structured (E1 , to be specific) homotopy quotient of X(n) along χn . It
is never equivalent to the simpler process of “coning off” that class. What is
true, however, is that X(n + 1)-module structure on a spectrum (where we are
thinking of X(n + 1) as an E1 -algebra) is equivalent to an X(n)-module structure on that spectrum and a null-homotopy of multiplication by χn . Moreover,
it is a result of the Nilpotence Theorem of [7] that each χn is nilpotent for all n.
Recalling that π2n−1 is the first homotopy degree of X(n) which is not either
polynomial or empty, we see then that our construction of M U is given by iteratively attaching E1 -cells along nilpotent elements, which is exactly what one
might expect to do if one wished to construct the universal nilpotence detecting
ring spectrum (which M U is).
Definition 12. Given α ∈ πk (R) for R an En -ring spectrum, we define the
versal En−1 -R-algebra of characteristic α to be the following pushout in En−1 R-algebras:
F rEn−1 (Σk R)

adj(0)

adj(α)

/R
✤
✤
✤


R ❴ ❴ ❴ ❴ ❴/ R//α
where F rEn−1 is the free En−1 -algebra functor and the maps adj(α) and adj(0)
are the adjoints of the associated maps of R-modules α : Σk R → R and 0 : Σk R →
R.
Corollary 13. Let X(n) be the Thom spectrum associated to the morphism of
E2 -monoidal Kan complexes ΩSU(n) → BU → BGL1 (S). Then X(n + 1) is a
versal E1 -algebra over X(n) of characteristic χn where χn is a canonical class
in π2n−1 (X(n)).
Proof. Given the fiber sequence ΩSU(n) → ΩSU(n + 1) → ΩS 2n+1 , and an application of Theorem 1 above, we can identify X(n+1) as the E1 -monoidal Thom
spectrum given by the E1 -monoidal left Kan extension ΩS 2n+1 → BGL1 (X(n)).
By application of standard adjunctions, the map of E1 -monoidal Kan com˜n ∈ M apE1 (ΩS 2n+1 , BGL1 (X(n))) induces a map of Kan complexes
plexes χ̃
χ̃n ∈ M apT (S 2n−1 , GL1 (X(n))). Note that χ̃n must have image contained in
a connected component u ∈ π0 (GL1 (X(n)) ≃ Z/2 which induces a translation
τu : Ω∞ X(n) → Ω∞ X(n). The composition τu ◦ χ̃n : S 2n−1 → Ω∞ X(n) lifts to
a morphism of spectra χn : S2n−1 → X(n). An application of Theorem 4.10 of
[3] gives that X(n + 1) is the versal E1 -algebra of characteristic χn on X(n). In
other words, X(n + 1) in the following diagram is a pushout:
FE1 (Σ2n−1 X(n))

adj(0)

/ X(n)

adj(χn )


X(n)


/ X(n + 1)
9

Remark 14. The content of [3] allows us to consider X(n + 1) as the E1 spectrum obtained by attaching an E1 -X(n)-cell to X(n) along the map χn
described above. Note that χ1 , as a non-zero element of π1 (S) must be equivalent
to η, the Hopf element. The Hopf element is, of course, the first nilpotent
element in the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and so again, it stands to
reason that it would be the first element eliminated in an effort to construct the
maximal nilpotence detecting ring spectrum.
The following result is included since it follows immediately from [3].
Corollary 15. The E1 -cotangent complex of the E1 -algebra X(n + 1) in X(n)modules is equivalent to Σ2n FE1 (X(n)) ∧X(n) X(n + 1).
Proof. Cf. Proposition 5.4 of [3].
