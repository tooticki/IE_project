CORRIGENDUM TO ‚ÄúMAPS BETWEEN NON-COMMUTATIVE
SPACES‚Äù [TRANS. AMER. MATH. SOC., 356(7) (2004) 2927‚Äì2944]
S. PAUL SMITH
Abstract. The statement of Lemma 3.1 in the published paper is not correct.
Lemma 3.1 is needed for the proof of Theorem 3.2. Theorem 3.2 as originally
stated is true but its ‚Äúproof‚Äù is not correct. Here we change the statements
and proofs of Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 3.2. We also prove a new result.
Let k be a field, A a left and right noetherian N-graded k-algebra such that
dimk (An ) < ‚àû for all n, and J a graded two-sided ideal of A. If the noncommutative scheme Projnc (A) is isomorphic to a projective scheme X, then
there is a closed subscheme Z ‚äÜ X such that Projnc (A/J) is isomorphic to Z.
This result is a geometric translation of what we actually prove: if the category
QGr(A) is equivalent to Qcoh(X), then QGr(A/J) is equivalent to Qcoh(Z) for
some closed subscheme Z ‚äÜ X.

1. Replacements for [5, Lem. 3.1 and Thm. 3.2]
Lemma 3.1 and its proof in [5] should be replaced by Lemma 1.1 below.
Lemma 1.1 is inspired by a result of P. Gabriel [1, Cor. 2, p. 368] which says
that under suitable conditions, when the functor F in (1-1) is exact and F (S) ‚äÜ T,
then there is a unique functor G : A/S ‚Üí B/T that makes (1-1) commute.
We assume that all our categories have small Hom sets.
Lemma 1.1. Let A and B be Grothendieck categories with localizing subcategories
S ‚äÜ A and T ‚äÜ B. Let œÄ : A ‚Üí A/S and œÄ ‚Ä≤ : B ‚Üí B/T be the quotient functors,
and let œâ and œâ ‚Ä≤ be right adjoints to œÄ and œÄ ‚Ä≤ respectively. Consider the following
diagram of functors:

Suppose that F is right exact and F (S) ‚äÜ T. If L1 (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F ), the first left derived
functor of œÄ ‚Ä≤ F , exists, which it does when A has enough projectives, and vanishes
on S, then
(1) the natural transformation œÄ ‚Ä≤ F ‚Üí œÄ ‚Ä≤ F œâœÄ induced by the natural transformation Œ∑ : idA ‚Üí œâœÄ is an isomorphism;
(2) there is a unique functor G : A/S ‚Üí B/T such that œÄ ‚Ä≤ F = GœÄ; furthermore,

(5) if F has a right adjoint so does G: if F ‚ä£ H, then G ‚ä£ œÄHœâ ‚Ä≤ .
Proof. (1) Let a ‚àà A. Let Œì : A ‚Üí S be the functor that sends an object in A to
the sum of its subobjects that belong to S. The exact sequence
Œ∑a

0 ‚àí‚Üí Œìa ‚àí‚Üí a ‚àí‚Üí œâœÄa ‚àí‚Üí (R1 Œì)a ‚àí‚Üí 0

Œ≤

in which Œ≤Œ± = Œ∑a . Applying œÄ ‚Ä≤ F to these sequences gives exact sequences

Since œÄ ‚Ä≤ F and L1 (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F ) vanish on S, œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (Œìa) = L1 (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F ) (R1 Œì)a = œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (R1 Œì)a =
0. Hence (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F )Œ± and (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F )Œ≤ are isomorphisms. But (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F )Œ≤ ‚ó¶ (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F )Œ± = (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F )(Œ≤ ‚ó¶
Œ±) = (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F )Œ∑a , so (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F )Œ∑a is an isomorphism.
(2) We will now show there is a unique functor G : A/S ‚Üí B/T such that
œÄ ‚Ä≤ F = GœÄ. If œÄ ‚Ä≤ F were exact, the existence of a unique such G is proved by
Gabriel [1, Cor.2, p.368]. We can‚Äôt appeal to op. cit. because we only know that
œÄ ‚Ä≤ F is right exact (and L1 (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F ) vanishes on S). Nevertheless, the proof at loc. cit.
can be modified to establish the existence and uniqueness of G such that œÄ ‚Ä≤ F = GœÄ.
(Our notation differs from Gabriel‚Äôs. Our œÄ ‚Ä≤ F plays the role of his G and our G
plays the role of his H.)
Let m and n be objects in A. Let i : m‚Ä≤ ‚Üí m be a subobject and p : n ‚Üí n/n‚Ä≤
a quotient object such that m/m‚Ä≤ and n‚Ä≤ belong to S. The maps œï and œà defined
by œï(Œ±) := pŒ±i and œà(Œ≤) := œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (p) ‚ó¶ Œ≤ ‚ó¶ œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (i) fit into a commutative diagram

Because the arrows œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (n) ‚Üí œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (n/n‚Ä≤ ) and œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (m‚Ä≤ ) ‚Üí œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (m) are isomorphisms
there is a unique morphism Œ≤ : œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (m) ‚Üí œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (n) such that

In other words, œà(Œ≤) = Œ¥. Thus, œà is surjective. The uniqueness of Œ≤ implies that
œà is also injective, and therefore bijective.
As m and n run over all objects in A, the maps
œà ‚àí1 ‚ó¶ œÄ ‚Ä≤ F : HomA (m‚Ä≤ , n/n‚Ä≤ ) ‚àí‚Üí HomB/T (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F m, œÄ ‚Ä≤ F n),
as m‚Ä≤ and n‚Ä≤ take all possible values, determine maps
G : HomA/S (œÄm, œÄn) = lim HomA (m‚Ä≤ , n/n‚Ä≤ ) ‚àí‚Üí HomB/T (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F m, œÄ ‚Ä≤ F n)

for all objects œÄm and œÄn in A/S. If we define G(œÄm) = œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (m) for all objects
œÄm ‚àà A/S, then G becomes a functor A/S ‚Üí B/T. By definition, GœÄ = œÄ ‚Ä≤ F on
objects in A.
Suppose Œ± : m ‚Üí n is a morphism in A. Let m‚Ä≤ = m and n‚Ä≤ = 0. The maps i
and p are the identity morphisms on m and n so the map œà in (1-2) is the identity;
hence GœÄ(Œ±) = œà ‚àí1 œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (Œ±) = œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (Œ±). The functors GœÄ and œÄ ‚Ä≤ F are therefore
equal.
To prove the uniqueness of G, suppose that G‚Ä≤ : A/S ‚Üí B/T is ‚Äúanother‚Äù functor
such that G‚Ä≤ œÄ = œÄ ‚Ä≤ F . If x is an object in A/S, then x = œÄm for some object m in
A so G‚Ä≤ (x) = G‚Ä≤ œÄ(m) = œÄF (m) = GœÄ(m) = G(x). If Œ∏ is a morphism in A/S, then
Œ∏ = œÄ(Œ±) for some morphism Œ± in A so G‚Ä≤ (Œ∏) = G‚Ä≤ œÄ(Œ±) = œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (Œ±) = GœÄ(Œ±) = G(Œ∏).
Hence G‚Ä≤ = G.
Finally, since GœÄ = œÄ ‚Ä≤ F , œÄ ‚Ä≤ F œâ = GœÄœâ ‚àº
= G.

in which, by (1), the upper-most vertical arrows provide an isomorphism from the
top row to the middle row. The bottom row in the diagram is therefore exact. But
the bottom row is obtained by applying G to (1-3) so G is, as claimed, right exact.

Therefore G commutes with direct sums.
(5) Suppose F ‚ä£ H. Because F has a right adjoint it commutes with direct
sums. By (4), G also commutes with direct sums. Since A is a Grothendieck
category so is A/S. In particular, A/S is cocomplete, has a generator, and has
small Hom sets. Thus, by the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, the dual of [2,
Cor.V.8, p.130], G has a right adjoint, G‚Ä≤ say. Since œÄ ‚ä£ œâ and G ‚ä£ G‚Ä≤ , GœÄ ‚ä£ œâG‚Ä≤ .
But GœÄ = œÄ ‚Ä≤ F so œÄ ‚Ä≤ F ‚ä£ œâG‚Ä≤ ; but Hœâ ‚Ä≤ is also right adjoint to œÄ ‚Ä≤ F so œâG‚Ä≤ ‚àº

whence G = œÄœâG = œÄHœâ . Thus, G ‚ä£ œÄHœâ , as claimed.
Remark. With regard to Lemma 1.1(2), the hypothesis that L1 (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F ) vanishes
on S is not only sufficient to prove there is a G such that GœÄ = œÄ ‚Ä≤ F ; it is also
necessary. If there is a G such that GœÄ = œÄ ‚Ä≤ F , then œÄ ‚Ä≤ F (S) = 0 because œÄ(S) = 0
and, because œÄ is exact, L1 (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F ) = L1 (GœÄ) ‚àº
= (L1 G) ‚ó¶ œÄ which shows that L1 (œÄ ‚Ä≤ F )
vanishes on S.
From now on k denotes an arbitrary field.
In the next result A is a right and left noetherian N-graded k-algebra such that
dimk (An ) < ‚àû for all n and J is a graded ideal in A.
We write Gr(A) for the category of graded right A-modules, Fdim(A) for the
full subcategory of Gr(A) consisting of modules that are the sum of their finitedimensional submodules, and QGr(A) for the quotient category Gr(A)/Fdim(A).
The inclusion functor f‚àó : Gr(A/J) ‚Üí Gr(A) has a left adjoint f ‚àó and a right
adjoint f ! .
Theorem 3.2 and its proof in [5] should be replaced by the following result.
Theorem 1.2. Let J be a graded ideal in an N-graded k-algebra A and consider

Define i‚àó = œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ‚àó œâ and i! = œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ! œâ. Then
(1) there is a unique functor i‚àó : QGr(A/J) ‚Üí QGr(A) such that i‚àó œÄ ‚Ä≤ = œÄf‚àó ;
furthermore, i‚àó is exact;
(2) i‚àó ‚àº

(4) i‚àó is left adjoint and i! right adjoint to i‚àó ;
(5) the essential image of i‚àó is closed under quotients and submodules.
In the language of [5], Projnc (A/J) is a closed subspace of Projnc (A) and the homomorphism A ‚Üí A/J induces a closed immersion i : Projnc (A/J) ‚Üí Projnc (A).
Proof. (1) This is due to P. Gabriel [1, Cor. 2, p. 368] and [1, Cor. 3, p. 369]. In
particular, the diagram

(2) Let Œ∑ ‚Ä≤ : idGr(A/J) ‚Üí œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ and Œµ‚Ä≤ : œÄ ‚Ä≤ œâ ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí idQGr(A/J) be the unit and count
associated to the adjoint pair œÄ ‚Ä≤ ‚ä£ œâ ‚Ä≤ . Since Œµ‚Ä≤ is an isomorphism, by [1, Prop. 3(a),
p. 371], the natural transformation i‚àó ‚Üí i‚àó œÄ ‚Ä≤ œâ ‚Ä≤ it induces is also an isomorphism.
But i‚àó œÄ ‚Ä≤ œâ ‚Ä≤ = œÄf‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ so i‚àó ‚àº
= œÄf‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ .
(3) We need two preliminary results before completing the proof of (3).
(3a): If T ‚àà Fdim(A), then T ‚äóA J ‚àà Fdim(A).
Proof: Since A is left noetherian, J = Ax1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + Axs for some homogeneous
elements xi ‚àà J. There is an integer d such that deg(xi ) ‚â§ d for all i = 1, . . . , s.
Let t ‚àà T and x ‚àà Jm . There is an integer ‚Ñì such that tA‚â•‚Ñì = 0.
Let a ‚àà A‚â•‚Ñì+d‚àím . Then xa = a1 x1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + as xs for some elements ai ‚àà
Adeg(xa)‚àídeg(xi ) ‚äÜ A‚â•‚Ñì . Since ta1 = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = tas = 0, (t ‚äó x)a = ta1 ‚äó x1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + tas ‚äó
xs = 0. We have shown that (t ‚äó x)A‚â•‚Ñì+d‚àím = 0. It follows that every element in
T ‚äóA J generates a finite dimensional module, i.e., T ‚äóA J ‚àà Fdim(A). ‚ô¶
(3b): If M ‚àà Gr(A/J), then œâœÄf‚àó M ‚àº
= f‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ M .
Proof: Let M denote the image of M under the natural map M ‚Üí œâœÄM . By
definition, œâœÄM is ‚Äúthe‚Äù largest essential extension 0 ‚Üí M ‚Üí œâœÄM ‚Üí T ‚Üí 0 in
Gr(A) such that T ‚àà Fdim(A).
In the next diagram œà and œÜ are the multiplication maps. The top row in

is exact. Since M J = 0, there is a homomorphism Œ≥ : T ‚äóA J ‚Üí (œâœÄM )J such
that Œ≥Œ≤ = œÜ. Since œÜ is surjective so is Œ≥.
Since T ‚äóA J ‚àà Fdim(A) and Œ≥ is surjective, (œâœÄM )J ‚àà Fdim(A) also. This
implies that M ‚à© (œâœÄM )J ‚àà Fdim(A). But the only submodule of œâœÄM that
belongs to Fdim(A) is the zero submodule, so M ‚à© (œâœÄM )J = 0. But M is essential
in œâœÄM so (œâœÄM )J = 0, i.e., œâœÄM ‚àà Gr(A/J).
Thus, œâœÄM is ‚Äúthe‚Äù largest essential extension of M in Gr(A/J) such that
(œâœÄM )/M is in Fdim(A/J). Hence œâœÄM and œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ M are isomorphic as A/Jmodules. More precisely, œâœÄf‚àó M ‚àº
= f‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ M . This completes the proof. ‚ô¶
(3c): The functor i‚àó is fully faithful.

S. PAUL SMITH

Proof: Let Œ± be a non-zero morphism in QGr(A/J). Then œÄ ‚Ä≤ œâ ‚Ä≤ (Œ±) 6= 0. The
image of œâ ‚Ä≤ (Œ±) is therefore not in Fdim(A). Hence the image of f‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ (Œ±) is not in
Fdim(A). It follows that œÄf‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ (Œ±) 6= 0. But œÄf‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ = i‚àó so i‚àó is faithful.
To see that i‚àó is full, let M, N ‚àà QGr(A/J) and suppose that Œ± : i‚àó M ‚Üí i‚àó N
is a morphism.
There are A/J-modules M and N such that M = œÄ ‚Ä≤ M and N = œÄ ‚Ä≤ N . Fix
isomorphisms Œ∏M : f‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ M ‚Üí œâœÄf‚àó M and Œ∏N : f‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ N ‚Üí œâœÄf‚àó N .
Then œÄ(Œ∏N ) ‚ó¶ Œ± ‚ó¶ œÄ(Œ∏M )‚àí1 is in HomQGr(A) (œÄœâœÄf‚àó M, œÄœâœÄf‚àó N ). By [1, Lemme 1,
p.370], œÄ(Œ∏N )Œ±œÄ(Œ∏M )‚àí1 = œÄ(Œ≤) for some Œ≤ ‚àà HomGr(A) (œâœÄf‚àó M, œâœÄf‚àó N ). There‚àí1
‚àí1
fore Œ± = œÄ(Œ∏N
Œ≤Œ∏M ). Since f‚àó is full, the map Œ∏N
Œ≤Œ∏M : f‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ M ‚Üí f‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ N is
‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤
equal to f‚àó (Œ≥) for some Œ≥ ‚àà HomGr(A/J) (œâ œÄ M, œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ N ). Hence Œ± = œÄf‚àó (Œ≥). Since
œÄf‚àó = i‚àó œÄ ‚Ä≤ , Œ± = i‚àó œÄ ‚Ä≤ (Œ≥) which completes the proof that i‚àó is full. ‚ô¶
(4) We separate the proof into two parts.
(4a) In this part we show that i‚àó := œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ‚àó œâ is left adjoint to i‚àó .
If N is a finite dimensional graded right A-module, then N ‚äóA (A/J) is also finite
dimensional. Since f ‚àó = ‚àí ‚äóA (A/J) it commutes with direct limits and therefore
sends Fdim(A) to Fdim(A/J). Hence œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ‚àó vanishes on Fdim(A).
We wish to apply Lemma 1.1 with F = f ‚àó , A = Gr(A), and B = Gr(A/J). To see
that F = f ‚àó satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma 1.1 we first note that f ‚àó is right exact
and sends Fdim(A) to Fdim(A/J). The left derived functor L1 (œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ‚àó ) exists because
Gr(A) has enough projectives. We must show that L1 (œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ‚àó ) vanishes on Fdim(A).
Since œÄ ‚Ä≤ is exact, L1 (œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ‚àó ) ‚àº
= œÄ ‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶ TorA
= œÄ ‚Ä≤ ‚ó¶ L1 f ‚àó ‚àº
1 (‚àí, A/J) so it suffices to show
A
that Tor1 (T, A/J) is in Fdim(A/J) whenever T ‚àà Fdim(A). But TorA
1 (T, A/J) is
isomorphic to a submodule of T ‚äóA J which is, by (3a), in Fdim(A).
By Lemma 1.1(5), there is a unique functor G : QGr(A) ‚Üí QGr(A/J) such that
œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ‚àó = GœÄ. Furthermore G ‚àº
= œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ‚àó œâ. Since f ‚àó ‚ä£ f‚àó , Lemma 1.1(2) tells us that
‚Ä≤
G ‚ä£ œÄf‚àó œâ , i.e., i‚àó is right adjoint to i‚àó .
(4b) In this part we show that i! := œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ! œâ is right adjoint to i‚àó .
To do so we will apply Lemma 1.1 to the functor F = f‚àó with A = Gr(A/J)
and B = Gr(A). To see that F = f‚àó satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma 1.1 we first
note that f‚àó is right exact, in fact exact, and sends Fdim(A/J) to Fdim(A). Hence
œÄf‚àó is right exact, in fact exact, and vanishes on Fdim(A/J). Since œÄf‚àó is exact its
left derived functor L1 (œÄf‚àó ) certainly vanishes on Fdim(A/J). Lemma 1.1 therefore
applies. The functor G in part (2) of Lemma 1.1 is i‚àó . Since f‚àó ‚ä£ f ! , Lemma 1.1(5)
tells us that G ‚ä£ œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ! œâ, i.e., i‚àó ‚ä£ œÄ ‚Ä≤ f ! œâ.
(5) We will now show that i‚àó (QGr(A/J)) is closed under submodules and quotients in QGr(A).
Let M ‚àà QGr(A/J) and suppose that 0 ‚Üí L ‚Üí i‚àó M ‚Üí N ‚Üí 0 is an exact
sequence in QGr(A). Let N denote the image and T the cokernel of the map
œâ(i‚àó M ‚Üí N ). Because œÄœâ ‚àº
= idQGr(A) , the map œÄœâ(i‚àó M ‚Üí N ) is an epimorphism.
Hence œÄT = 0; i.e., T ‚àà Fdim(A).
Because œÄ is exact and T ‚àà Fdim(A), N ‚àº
= œÄN . Now M = œÄ ‚Ä≤ M for some M ‚àà
‚Ä≤
Gr(A/J), so œâi‚àó M = œâi‚àó œÄ M = œâœÄf‚àó M ‚àº
= f‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ M . Since J annihilates f‚àó œâ ‚Ä≤ œÄ ‚Ä≤ M
it annihilates œâi‚àó M. But œâ is left exact so œâL is isomorphic to a submodule of
œâi‚àó M and is therefore annihilated by J. Hence œâL = f‚àó L for some L ‚àà Gr(A/J).
Thus, L ‚àº
= œÄœâL = œÄf‚àó L = i‚àó œÄ ‚Ä≤ L ‚àà i‚àó (QGr(A/J)). Since N is a quotient of œâi‚àó M
it is also annihilated by J; hence we can apply the argument we just used for L to
N and deduce that N ‚àà i‚àó (QGr(A/J)).

That completes the proof of (5) and hence the proof of the theorem (see [5,
p.2928] for the definition of a closed immersion).

Remarks. (1) The three functors (i‚àó , i‚àó , i! ) provide a ‚Äúmap‚Äù which we call i.
Since i‚àó is faithful and has a right adjoint, the map i is an affine map in the sense
of Rosenberg [3, p.278].
(2) It is common in the above situation to define the ‚Äústructure sheaves‚Äù of
X = Projnc (A) and Z = Projnc (A/J) to be OX := œÄA and OZ := œÄ ‚Ä≤ (A/J). The
map i : Z ‚Üí X then has the property that i‚àó OX = OZ .
(3) Suppose that J ‚äÜ J ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ A are graded 2-sided ideals. Let (f ‚àó , f‚àó , f ! ),
‚àó
(g , g‚àó , g ! ), and (h‚àó , h‚àó , h! ), be the adjoint triples associated to the homomorphisms
A ‚Üí A/J, A/J ‚Üí A/J ‚Ä≤ , and A ‚Üí A/J ‚Ä≤ , respectively. Consider the diagram
Gr(A/J ‚Ä≤ )

where i‚àó and j‚àó are the unique functors such that i‚àó œÄ ‚Ä≤ = œÄf‚àó and j‚àó œÄ ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ = œÄg‚àó and
œÄ ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ is the quotient functor. Since h‚àó = f‚àó g‚àó , i‚àó j‚àó œÄ ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ = œÄh‚àó so i‚àó j‚àó is the unique
functor k‚àó such that œÄh‚àó = k‚àó œÄ ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ . If we define k ‚àó = œÄ ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ h‚àó œâ, we can not conclude
that k ‚àó = j ‚àó i‚àó . However, since j ‚àó i‚àó is left adjoint to i‚àó j‚àó = k‚àó we know that
k‚àó ‚àº
= j ‚àó i‚àó .
Theorem 1.3. Let J be a two-sided graded ideal in a connected graded k-algebra
A. Let X be a noetherian scheme having an ample line bundle; for example, let X
be a quasi-projective scheme over Spec(k). If there is an equivalence of categories
Œ¶ : QGr(A) ‚Üí Qcoh(X), then QGr(A/J) ‚â° Qcoh(Z) for some closed subscheme
Z ‚äÜ X. More precisely, there is a commutative diagram
QGr(A/J)

Œ¶

/ Qcoh(X)

in which the horizontal arrows are the natural inclusion functors and the dotted
arrow is an equivalence between QGr(A/J) and the essential image of Œ¶i‚àó .
Proof. By Theorem 1.2, Projnc (A/J) is a closed subspace of Projnc (A). By [4,
Thm. 4.1], the closed subspaces of X, or Qcoh(X), are the same things as closed
subschemes of X in the classical sense. Hence there is a closed subscheme Z ‚äÜ X
such that QGr(A/J) ‚â° Qcoh(Z).
