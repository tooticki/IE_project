Abstract. In this paper we present a proof of the BMZ Reduction Lemma with a motivational
perspective, and state this lemma for maps to manifolds using the classical definition of cohomological dimension. The lemma proved and utilized in [4] gives a geometrical insight in the proof of
the BMZ colored topological Tverberg theorem.

1. Introduction
Let us recall the well-known topological Tverberg theorem [3]:
Theorem 1.1. Let d ≥ 1, r ≥ 2 a prime and N = (d + 1)(r − 1). Consider the N -simplex △N .
Suppose f : △N → Rd is a continuous map. Then there exists a family σ1 , σ2 , · · · σr of r disjoint
faces of △N such that
r
\
f (σi ) 6= φ.

The above Theorem is a generalization of the classical Tverberg Theorem [13] which says that
if we have N = (d + 1)(r − 1) + 1 points in Rd in general position, then we can partition them
into r disjoint subsets F1 , F2 , · · · , Fr such that the convex hulls of all these Fi ’s have a non-empty
intersection. The classical Tverberg Theorem has been proved for all positive integers r ≥ 1 whereas
the topological Tverberg Theorem is proved only when r is a prime power. When r is not a prime
power, a counterexample to the topological Tverberg theorem has recently been published (see [9]).
What would be the colored version of the topological Tverberg Theorem ? This question was first
studied by Bárány, Füredi and Lovász [1], who proved that if we take 21 points in the plane in
general position such that 7 are red, 7 are blue and 7 are green, then we can decompose them
into 7 triangles, each triangle having vertices of different colors, such that their intersection is non
empty. Later, Bárány and Larman [2] studied the above question further and proved the following
general result : If we take 3r points in the plane in general position where r are of red color, r are
of blue color and r are of green color, then we can find r disjoint triangles, each triangle having
vertices of different colors, such that their intersection will be non empty. For higher dimensional
Euclidean spaces Rd , Bárány and Larman asked the question: Given r and N ≥ (d + 1)r points
in Rd , determine the smallest t such that if we take d + 1 color classes of size ≤ t, we can find a
family of r disjoint d-simplices having vertices of different colors, such that their intersection is non
empty. Živaljević and Vrećica [16] introduced the concept of chessboard complexex and showed

that when r is a prime, the colored Tverberg Theorem holds for t ≥ 2r − 1, and also for any
r ≥ 2 due to Bertrand’s postulate that there is a prime between r and 2r. This colored Tverberg
Theorem of ZV attracted a lot of attention, but could not be considered very satisfactory for two
reasons. The first reason was that the classical Tverberg Theorem does not appear as a special case
of this Theorem, and the second reason was that several colored points were left out unaccounted.
In 2009, Blagojević, Matschke and Ziegler(see [4] [5] [6]) formulated and proved a remarkable new
colored topological Tverberg Theorem which is stated as follows:
Theorem 1.2. (BMZ) Let d ≥ 1, r ≥ 2 prime and N = (d + 1)(r − 1). Consider the N -simplex
△N whose vertices are colored into disjoint color classes
C0 , C1 , · · · , Cm m ≥ d + 2
such that for each i, the size |Ci | of these colored classes is at most r−1. Then given any continuous
map f : △N → Rd there exists a family of r disjoint rainbow faces σ1 , σ2 , · · · , σr of △N such that
f (σ1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ f (σr ) 6= φ.
Here a face σi is said to be a rainbow face if each vertex of σi is of different color, i.e., |σi ∩ Cj | ≤
1 ∀ i, 1 ≤ i ≤ r and ∀ j, 1 ≤ j ≤ m.
The above Theorem, to be called the BMZ Theorem in the sequel, turns out to be very interesting
topological colored Tverberg Theorem since the classical Tverberg Theorem becomes a special case
of this Theorem when the size of each color class is one, and also since all points of △N are accounted
for. In this paper we present a simple minded proof of the BMZ Reduction Lemma (see [4] page 3,
Reduction of Theorem 2.1 to Theorem 2.2) with a motivational perspective. We also state the BMZ
reduction Lemma for maps to manifolds using the classical definition of cohomological dimension
over Z rather than the one employed in ([6], Lemma 2.1). We remark here that BMZ Theorem
for manifolds has been proved when r is prime. The corresponding Theorem when r is a prime
power is not resolved yet, though the topological Tverberg Theorem has already been proved for
any prime power r. However, the Reduction Lemma is true for any r, prime or otherwise.
2. Reduction Lemma
Let d ≥ 1, r ≥ 2 and N = (d + 1)(r − 1). Color the vertices of the simplex △N by m colors,
m ≥ d+2. Suppose the color classes are denoted by C0 , C1 · · · , Cm . If |Ci | ≤ r−1, ∀ i = 1, 2, · · · , m
then we say that C0 , C1 · · · , Cm is a general coloring of △N . Since |Ci | ≤ r − 1 for each i, there
has to be at least d + 2 colors. Among all the general colorings of △N , let us consider the colorings
C0 , C1 · · · , Cd+1
where |Ci | = r − 1 for every i except one color class whose size is 1. This accounts for all the points
of △N . Without loss of generality we may occasionally consider the last color class viz., Cd+1 , to
be of size 1. Such colorings of △N will be called the special colorings of △N .
Note : It may be noted that any general coloring G0 , G1 · · · , Gm , m ≥ d + 1, of the vertices of
△N can be obtained from a given special coloring
C0 , C1 · · · , Cd+1
by removing certain number of vertices from each color class and creating new color classes (one
or more) in finitely many steps. It is assumed that when we remove the single vertex of Cd+1 , this
singleton class disappears creating another class of the same color with possibly bigger size.
2

In this process while the number of vertices of △N , N = (d + 1)(r − 1) remains the same, the class
sizes become smaller and smaller and the number of color classes becomes larger and larger. In the
limiting case when the size of each color class becomes 1, the number of color classes will become
N + 1 = (d + 1)(r − 1) + 1.
In terms of the above definitions we can state the Blogojević-Matschke-Ziegler colored Theorem as
follows (see [4] Theorem 2.1):
Theorem 2.1. ( BMZ Theorem) Let d ≥ 1, r ≥ 2 prime and N = (d + 1)(r − 1) and
C0 , C1 · · · , Cm be a general coloring of △N . Then given any continuous map f : △N → Rd there
exists a family of r disjoint rainbow faces σ1 , σ2 , · · · , σr of △N such that
f (σi ) ∩ · · · ∩ f (σr ) 6= φ.

Lemma 1. (Reduction Lemma) Let d ≥ 1, r ≥ 2 and N = (d + 1)(r − 1). If the BMZ Theorem
is true for special colorings for the parameters (d + k, r, Rd+k ), k ≥ 0, then the BMZ theorem is
true for all general colorings of △N for the parameters (d, r, Rd ).
We now give a detailed proof of the above Lemma following a simple minded approach with a
motivational perspective.
Let us start with a special coloring C0 , · · · , Cd , Cd+1 of △N , N = (d + 1)(r − 1), and a continuous
map f : △N → Rd and assume BMZ for special colorings. First we prove the following :
Proposition 2.1. Let us remove one vertex from some color class, say C0 , and give it a new color
creating an additional color class, say Cd+2 such that |Cd+2 | = 1. Then BMZ theorem is true for the
parameters (d, r, Rd ) for the coloring C0 , C1 · · · , Cd+1 , Cd+2 ; |C0 | = r − 2, |Ci | = r − 1, |Cd+1 | =
1 = |Cd+2 |.
Proof. To prove this, we add one new vertex to C0 of the same color as that of C0 , making it C0′ ,
′
′
| = r − 1 (see Fig
so that |Cd+2
add additional r − 2 vertices of the color of Cd+2 to make it Cd+2
1). Thus we have the coloring
′
′
C0′ , C1′ , · · · , Cd+1
, Cd+2
, Ci ⊂ Ci′ ∀ i
′
and |Ci′ | = r − 1 ∀ i 6= d + 1, |Cd+1
| = 1. Now we consider a new simplex △N ′ , N ′ = (d + 2)(r − 1)
and regard △N as the front face of △N ′ . Thus, there are r − 1 additional vertices in ∆N ′ − ∆N .

Now we extend the map f : △N → Rd to a map f ′ : △N ′ → Rd+1 by embedding Rd ⊂ Rd+1 where
the last coordinate of Rd+1 is zero: Let e1 , · · · , ed+1 be the standard basis of Rd+1 and v0 , · · · , vN
be the vertices of △N and v0 , · · · , vN , vN +1 , · · · , vN ′ be the vertices of △N ′ . Let x ∈ △N ′ and write
N′
P
x=
λi vi in terms of barycentric coordinates. Define f ′ : △N ′ → Rd+1 by
0

f ′ (x) = f (λ0 v0 + · · · + λN −1 vN −1 + (λN + λN +1 + · · · + λN ′ )vN ) + (λN + · · · + λN ′ )ed+1
Then note that f ′ naps additional vertices to ed+1 , is continuous and f ′ |△N = f . Since BMZ is
′
is a special coloring of △N ′ , by
true for the parameters (d + 1, r, Rd+1 ) and C0′ , C1′ , · · · , Cd+2
assumption of reduction lemma there exists a family σ¯1 , · · · , σ¯r of r disjoint rainbow faces of △N ′
such that
f ′ (σ¯1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ f ′ (σ¯r ) 6= φ
Now let us consider the faces σi = σ̄i ∩ △N for 1 ≤ i ≤ r of △N . Note that at least one of the faces
σ̄i must be completely inside △N , otherwise we will have r vertices of △N ′ which are outside △N ,
but there are only r − 1 such vertices by definition, a contradiction. Hence σ¯1 ∩ △N = σ¯1 = σ1 is
a rainbow face of △N . Therefore
f ′ (σ¯1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ f ′ (σ¯r ) ⊂ Rd ⊂ Rd+1
Now we also claim that each of σ1 , ..., σr is nonempty, because if some σ̄i , i ≥ 2, does not intersect
△N , then f ′ (σ̄i ) will lie in the positive part of the last axis of Rd+1 , which means f ′ (σ¯1 )∩f ′ (σ̄i ) = φ,
a contradiction. This implies that
f (σi ) ∩ · · · ∩ f (σr ) = f ′ (σ¯1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ f ′ (σ¯r ) 6= φ.


The following is a simple generalization of Proposition 2.1
Proposition 2.2. Let us remove q vertices 2 ≤ q ≤ r − 2 from some color class, say C0 , and
introduce one new color class Cd+2 of size q so that we have the new coloring of △N ,
(2.1)

C0 , C1 , · · · , Cd+! , Cd+2 , |C0 | = r − q + 1, |Ci | = i − 1, |Cd+1 | = 1, |Cd+2 | = q

Then the BMZ Theorem is true for the coloring (2.1) of △N also.
Proof. We add q vertices to the color class C0 of the same color and add r − q − 1 new vertices to
the class Cd+2 of the same color and get the coloring
(2.2)

′
′
, Cd+2
C0′ , C1′ , · · · , Cd+1

′
| = 1 Now consider the simplex △N ′ , N = (d+2)(r −1)
such that |Ci′ | = r −1, ∀ i 6= d+1 and |Cd+1
containing △N as the front face and define a map f : △N ′ → Rd+1 by mapping all additional vertices
of △N ′ onto ed+1 , and extending linearly. Then note that △N ′ − △N has again only r − 1 vertices.
Then using the fact that BMZ is true for (d + 1, r, Rd+1 ) for the special coloring (2.1), we find by
the same argument as in Prop 2.1 that BMZ is true for f : △N → Rd for the coloring (2.1) also. 

The following covers yet another possibility.
4

Proposition 2.3. If we remove two vertices from two different color classes, say C − 0, C − 1, and
add a new color class Cd+2 having these two additional vertices, we will have the coloring
(3.1)

C0 , C1 , C2 , · · · , Cd+1 , Cd+2

such that |C0 | = |C1 | = r − 2, |Ci | = r − 1, |Cd+1 | = 1, |Cd+2 | = 2 Then the BMZ is true for the
coloring (3.1)
Proof. Once again we embed the colorings (3.1) into the coloring
(3.2)

′
′
C0′ , C1′ , C2′ , · · · , Cd+1
, Cd+2

′
′
| = r−1 Then (3.2) is again a special coloring for (d+1, r, Rd+1 ).
| = 1, |Cd+2
where |Ci′ | = r−1, |Cd+1
We define a map f ′ : △N ′ → Rd+1 , N ′ = (d + 2)(r − 1) extending f linearly as before. Then, again
as in Proposition 2.1, this yields BMZ for f : △N → Rd , N = (d + 1)(r − 1).


Note : It is clear from the above propositions that so long as we remove any number of vertices
from anywhere and create only one new color class, the arguments of Proposition 2.1 will work
and we will get BMZ for such general colorings. The argument will have to be changed when the
number of new color classes so created exceeds one, as in the following.
Proposition 2.4. Let us remove two vertices from some color class say C0 , and add two new color
classes Cd+2 , Cd+3 of size one each such that we have the coloring
(4.1)

C0 , C1 , C2 , · · · , Cd+1 , Cd+2 , Cd+3

with |C0 | = r − 3 |Cd+1 | = |Cd+2 | = |Cd+3 | = 1 and |Ci | = r − 1 for all other i’s. Then BMZ is
true for the coloring (4.1) also.
Proof. Add two new vertices to C0 of the same color as that of C0 , add r − 2 new vertices to each
of Cd+2 , Cd+3 to get a new coloring of △N ′ , N ′ = (d + 3)(r − 1)
(4.2)

′
′
′
, Cd+3
, Cd+2
C0′ , C1′ , C2′ , · · · , Cd+1

′
| = 1. Then (4.2) is a special coloring of △N ′ . Let
where |Ci′ | = r − 1 for each i 6= d + 1 and |Cd+1
N = N1 = (d+1)(r−1), N2 = (d+2)(r−1), N ′ = N3 = (d+3)(r−1) and treat △N as a front face of
△N2 , △N2 as a front face of △N3 = △N ′ . Let ei , 1 ≤ i ≤ d+2 be the standard basis of Rd+2 . Define
′
a map f ′ : △N ′ → Rd+2 as follows. Map one removed vertex of C0 and last r − 2 vertices of Cd+1
′
to ed+1 , map other removed vertex of C0 and r − 2 vertices of Cd+2 to ed+2 . Then as in Proposition
2.1, extend f to f ′ : △N ′ → Rd+2 linearly. We have △N1 ⊂ △N2 ⊂ △N3 , Rd ⊂ Rd+1 ⊂ Rd+2 and
△N3 − △N2 , △N2 − △N1 each have only r − 1 vertices. Now using the BMZ for the special coloring
(4.2) and the continuous map f ′ : △N3 → Rd+2 , we find r disjoint rainbow faces σ1 , σ2 , · · · , σr of
△N3 such that
f (σi ) ∩ · · · ∩ f (σr ) 6= φ.
Now arguing as in Proposition 2.1 again, we find that σ1 ∩ ∆N2 , · · · , σr ∩ ∆N2 are rainbow faces of
△N2 such that their f ′ -images have non empty intersection. Intersecting above rainbow faces with
∆N1 and arguing once more, we find that σ1 ∩ ∆N1 , · · · , σr ∩ ∆N1 are rainbow faces of △N1 whose
f ′ -images and therefore f -images have non empty intersection.


Now let us start with a general coloring
(5.1)

C0 , C1 , C2 , · · · , Cd+1 , · · · , Cd+k , k ≥ 1

of △N , N = (d + 1)(r − 1) where |Ci | ≤ r − 1. We introduce a new color class Cd+k+1 = {φ}.

We extend these color classes to the classes

can now think that Cd+1

such that
and giving them a new color. In this way we obtain a new coloring C0′ , C1′ , C2′ , · · · , Cd+1
′
′
|C0 ∪ · · · Cd+2 | = (d + 2)(r − 1) = N2 . We can now assume that N = N1 ⊂ N2 . Similarly we get
numbers N3 , N4 , · · · , Nk+1 such that ∆N1 ⊂ ∆N2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ ∆Nk+1 and |△Ni+1 − △Ni | = r − 1 for
each i. Now we can also assume that

Rd ⊂ Rd+1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Rd+k+1
where the last coordinate is taken as zero everywhere. Let e1 , · · · , ed , ed+1 , · · · , ed+k+1 be the
standard basis for Rd+k+1 . Then as in Proposition 2.4, we can define a map f ′ : △Nk+1 → Rd+k+1
such that f ′ maps first r − 1 additional vertices to ed+1 , second r − 1 additional vertices to ed+2 etc.
Then we extend f to f ′ : △N ′ → Rd+k+1 linearly. By the BMZ for parameters (d + k + 1, r, Rd+k+1 )
for the special coloring (5.2), we find that we have a family σ1 , σ2 , · · · , σr of disjoint rainbow faces
of △N ′ such that
f ′ (σi ) ∩ · · · ∩ f ′ (σr ) 6= φ.
Then arguing as in Proposition 2.4 repeatedly, we find that σ1 ∩ △N , · · · , σr ∩ △N is a family of
r disjoint rainbow faces of △N whose f -images will have non empty intersection.
The above analysis proves the following
Proposition 2.5. Let d ≥ 1, r ≥ 2 prime and N = (d + 1)(r − 1). Let C0 , · · · , Cd+k , k ≥ 1
be a general coloring of △N where |Ci | ≤ r − 1. Then assuming BMZ for special colorings of
△N ′ , N ′ = (d + k)(r − 1), we find that BMZ is true for any general coloring of △N .
3. Reduction Lemma for maps to Manifolds
The BMZ Theorem for a d-manifold M is stated as follows [6]:
Theorem 3.1. (BMZ for Manifolds) Let d ≥ 1, r ≥ 2 a prime N = (d + 1)(r − 1). Suppose
C0 , C1 , · · · , Cm , m ≥ d + 1
is a general coloring of the simplex △N such that |Ci | ≤ r − 1. Then for any given continuous
map f : △N → M , where M is a d-manifold, we can find a family of r disjoint rainbow faces
σ1 , σ2 , · · · , σr of △N such that
\
f (σi ) 6= φ.
Let I = [0, 1] denote the unit interval and M̄ = M × Ik
Reduction Lemma :([6] Lemma 2.1) Suppose the BMZ Theorem for manifolds is true for all
special colorings for the parameters (d + k, r, M × Ik ), k ≥ 0 . Then the BMZ Theorem for maps
to manifolds is true for all general colorings for the parameters (d, r, M ).
Proof. The proof of above Lemma is exactly parallel to the proof of Proposition 2.5 proved earlier
except that we replace Rd+k everywhere by M × Ik and Rd ⊂ Rk+1 ⊂ ... ⊂ Rd+k by M ⊂ M × I.... ⊂
M × Ik .

The reduction lemma as stated by BMZ in [6] says the following
Reduction Lemma : It suffices to consider a manifold M which satisfies the property that
(*)

(r − 1) dim M > r.cohdim M

where cohdim M means the cohomological dimension of M .
Here the cohomological dimension means the largest integer d such that the d-dimensional cohomology of M does not vanish. If we use the classical definition of cohomological dimension which
conforms to the geometric intuition, the inequality (*) may appear a bit surprising. In order to
state it in conformity with classical definition of cohomological dimension, let us recall (see [12]
Appendix, Cohomological Dimension Theory, and also [8], [7] for details).
Definition 3.1. Let X be any topological space and H ∗ (X, Z) denote the Čech cohomology of X
with coefficients in Z. Then the largest integer n (if it exists) such that H q (X, A; Z) = 0 ∀ q > n
and for all closed sets A of X, is called the cohomological dimension of X. Otherwise we say that
cohomological dimension of X is infinite. We write it as cohdim(X).
The role of the pair (X, A) where A is a closed set is very important. Since R is contractible, all
the positive dimensional cohomologies of Rn vanish. This does not mean that that the cohdim
Rn is zero. In fact, let us see that cohdim (Rn ) = n. Let A be any closed subset of Rn . Then it
is well known that H q (Rn , A; Z) = 0 ∀ q > n and for all closed sets A of Rn , which implies that
cohdimRn ≤ n. On the other hand, it is easy to see H n (Rn , Sn−1 ; Z) 6= 0 and so cohdimRn ≥ n.
Thus we find that dim Rn = cohdim Rn = n. Also, for a paracompact Hausdorff space X, cohdim
is a local property [8], which means if M is a paracompact manifold, then
dim M = cohdimM.
Now going back to the BMZ Reduction Lemma for manifolds in [6], observe that M × Ik is a
manifold of dimension d + k (dim M = d) and since M × Ik is homotopically equivalent to M, we
find that H q (M × Ik ) = 0 ∀ q > d. Thus the manifold M ′′ needed at the end of the proof of Lemma
2.1 in [6] satisfies the condition that
(**)

(r − 1) dim M ′′ > r.d

where dim M ′′ = d + k and H q (M ′′ ; Z) = 0 ∀ q > d. The manifold M ′′ = M × Ik clearly satisfies
this property for k suitably large.
