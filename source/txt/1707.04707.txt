The purpose of this erratum and addendum is to correct the errors in [1]. It consists of five
components:
1. Lemma 7.1 and Proposition 7.2 are wrong and discarded;
2. A new proof of existence λ(ξ) in (7.1) without Proposition 7.2;
3. Definition of a new bijection in Theorem 5.2 and a proof by a new technique;
4. A new proof of Theorem 5.5 based on the new bijection in Theorem 5.2;
5. Correction to the list of exceptional simple pairs in Proposition 3.1.
The main results of [1] remain true as stated. We also add a final remark on generalization.
1. Discarding Lemma 7.1 and Proposition 7.2. Lemma 7.1 and Proposition 7.2 missed
a necessary condition, namely the assumption that ν0 is invariant under the induced action of
NK (aqC ). In case ν0 = ρ(m), the lemma is Proposition 3.1 of [2]. However, this condition fails for
general ν0 . We discard both Lemma 7.1 and Proposition 7.2.
2. A Proof of Existence of λ(ξ) in (7.1). Recall that aq is a maximal abelian subalgebra in
p ∩ q and c ⊇ aq is a Cartan subalgebra of g. Let c0 denote the orthogonal complement of aq in
c. Then c = c0 ⊕ aq and cC = c0C ⊕ aq C . Let t = (t1 , . . . , tn−r ) ∈ c0 ∗C and x = (x1 , . . . , xr ) ∈ aq ∗C
denote the coordinates.
We regard symmetric algebra S(c) (resp. S(aq )) as algebra of complex valued polynomial
functions on c∗C (resp. aq ∗C ). Let I(c) = S(c)W (c) and I(aq ) = S(aq )W (aq ) be the Weyl group
invariants. Suppose that U1 , · · · , Ur ∈ I(c) are homogeneous polynomials in (t; x) ∈ c∗C such that
the restriction to aq ∗C
W1 (x) = Rescaq U1 = U1 (0; x), · · · , Wr (x) = Rescaq Ur = Ur (0; x)
are algebraically independent and I(aq ) is a finite free module over C[W1 , · · · , Wr ] of rank d.

J(ζ; x) is a nonzero polynomial with the leading term J(0; x). In particular, U1 (ζ; x), . . . , Ur (ζ; x)
are algebraically independent. Set Aζ = C[U1 (ζ; x), . . . , Ur (ζ; x)]. Then the map
Γ : Aζ → S(aq ), f 7→ f (U1 (ζ; x), . . . , Ur (ζ; x))
is an injective algebra homomorphism. We claim that S(aq ) is integral over Aζ . It is enough to
show any polynomial P (x) ∈ S(aq ) is integral over Aζ . We prove this by induction on deg P (x). If
deg P (x) = 0, this is obvious. Assume that any polynomial P (x) with deg P ≤ m is integral over
Aζ . Now we look at a P (x) with deg P (x) = m + 1. Since S(aq ) is integral over I(aq ), we may
reduce to the case that P (x) in I(aq ). Since I(aq ) is integral over A0 = C[W1 , . . . , Wr ], we may
further reduce to the case P (x) is in A0 . More precisely, suppose that e1 , . . . , em are generators
of S(aq ) as a A0 -module. Then there are Pi (x) = Fi (W1 , . . . , Wr ) ∈ A0 for some homogeneous
polynomial F such that degree of Pi (x) ≤ m + 1 and
P (x) = P1 (x)e1 + · · · + Pm (x)em .
It follows that for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}
Qi (x) = Fi (U1 (ζ; x), . . . , Ur (ζ; x)) − Pi (x) = Fi (U1 (ζ; x), . . . , Ur (ζ; x)) − Fi (U1 (0; x), . . . , Ur (0; x))
has degree at most m. By induction hypothesis, Qi (x) is integral over Aζ , hence Pi (x) is integral
over Aζ for i = 1, . . . , m. Then P (x) is integral over Aζ -module generated by P1 , . . . , Pm , e1 , . . . , em
and hence it is integral over Aζ .
The injective algebra homomorphism Γ : Aζ → S(aq ) induces a finite map φ : SpecS(aq ) →
SpecAζ . By identifying aq ∗C with Cr we have
φ : Cr → Cr , x 7→ (U1 (ζ; x), . . . , Ur (ζ; x)).
The integrality of S(aq ) over Aζ implies that φ is surjective. More precisely, let a = (a1 , . . . , ar ) ∈
Cr determine the maximal ideal
Ia = (U1 (ζ; x) − a1 , . . . , Ur (ζ; x) − ar )C[U1 (ζ; x), . . . , Ur (ζ; x)]
in Aζ . Then there exists a maximal ideal Ib in C[x1 , . . . , xr ] with b ∈ Cr and
Ib = (x1 − b1 , . . . , xr − br )C[x1 , . . . , xr ]
such that Ib ∩ Γ(C[U1 (ζ; x), . . . , Ur (ζ; x)]) = Γ(Ia ). In other words, we have
U1 (ζ, b1 ) = a1 , . . . , Ur (ζ, br ) = ar .
Let γ : Z(g) → I(c) be the Harish-Chandra isomorphism. Let D = C[D1 , . . . , Dr ] be the
polynomial subalgebra of Z(g) generated by Di with γ(Di ) = Ui (i = 1, · · · , r). For λ ∈ aq ∗C , we
define the character
χλ : D = C[D1 , · · · , Dr ] → C by χλ (Di ) = hγ(Di ), λi = Ui (0; λ).

character. Then there exists λ(ξ) ∈ aq C such that
Ui (Λξ ; λ(ξ)) = Ui (0; λ), i = 1, · · · , r.

Thus, γ(Di , Λξ + λ(ξ)) = χλ (Di ) for each i, and it follows that
γ(Z, Λξ + λ(ξ)) = χλ (Z), for all Z ∈ C[D1 , . . . , Dr ].
This establishes (7.1).

defines a hypersurface in aq ∗C . We say that x ∈ aq ∗C is unramified if J(Λξ ; x) 6= 0 for all ξ ∈
cf u . The ramified points (the complement to unramified points) are collection of locally finite
M
hypersurfaces defined by J(Λξ ; x) = 0, since any ideal of S(aq ) is finitely generated and therefore
each point x ∈ aq ∗C can lay in only finite many of such hypersurfaces. We say x ∈ aq ∗C is generic if it
is unramified and in addition it is not on the hyperplanes defined by hx, αi ∈ Z. If x is unramified,

then the set of fibre φ−1 (y) with y = φ(x) has exactly |W (aq )| · d elements. This follows from the
fact that J(ξ; x) 6= 0 for all x ∈ φ−1 (y) and hence φ maps a neighborhood of x homeomorphically
to a neighborhood of y = φ(x). Since each W (aq )-orbits can have at most |W (aq )| points, there
are at least d points λ(ξ)1 , . . . λ(ξ)d ∈ aq ∗C in distinct W (aq )-orbits, such that
γ(Z, Λξ + λ(ξ)i ) = χλ (Z), for all Z ∈ C[D1 , . . . , Dr ].
The character χλ of D (λ ∈ aq ∗C ) or simply λ is said to be generic if all points φ−1 (λ) are generic.
If λ is generic, then the principal series πξ,λ(ξ)i (i = 1, . . . , d) are irreducible and non-isomorphic.
We also note that if ν0 is unramified, then the function ν 7→ λ = (U1 (Λξ ; ν), . . . , Ur (Λξ ; ν)) for
ν ∈ aq ∗C has an inverse ψ in some neighborhood of ν0 by the inverse function theorem, and the
inverse ψ : λ 7→ ν = λ(ξ) is holomorphic in some neighborhood of λ0 = (U1 (Λξ , ν0 ), . . . , Ur (Λξ , ν0 )).
3. The bijection in Theorem 5.2. I am grateful to E. van den Ban and P. Delorme for pointing
out an error in determining the τ -radical part of a differential operator in Section 5 [1]. The error
is the claim that ‘D̄ is right invariant under G+ ’ in 5th line on Page 719. The whole paragraph
(from Line -12 Page 718 to Line 13 page 719) containing this wrong claim is discarded. We define
a new bijection for Theorem 5.2 by restriction of Taylor expansions.
In order to define this new bijection we set up two linear maps Γg and Γg+ regarding U (g) and
U (g+ ) respectively. Recall from (3.6) that the restriction map p : S(c)W (c) → S(aq )W (aq ) is the
composition of the following two maps
I(c) = S(c)W (c) → S(b)W (b) → S(aq )W (aq ) = I(aq ).
This is a surjective map unless g contains exceptional simple Lie algebras of type E6 , E7 or E8 .
In any case, there are homogeneous polynomials U1 , · · · Ur ∈ I(c) such that the restriction Wi =
Rescaa Ui (i = 1, · · · , r) are algebraically independent and I(aq ) is a free module over the subalgebra
C[W1 . . . , Wr ] of rank d, where d is 1 except for the exceptional cases which are determined in
Proposition 3.1.
We regard symmetric algebra S(g) as an algebra of complex polynomial functions on g∗ . Denote
by O(g) the space of complex value polynomial functions on g. By using the Killing form, we
identify the symmetric algebra S(g) with O(g), S(g+ ) with O(g+ ) and S(p ∩ q) with O(p ∩ q), etc.
By Chevalley’s restriction theorem, we have the following algebra isomorphisms:
K∩H
→ S(aq )WK∩H .
Resgc : S(g)G → S(c)W (c) and Resp∩q
aq : S(p ∩ q)

Denote by ι(Ui ) the inverse of Ui under and ι(Wi ) the inverse of Wi , namely,
Resgc ι(Ui ) = Ui and Resp∩q
aq ι(Wi ) = Wi .
Let D = C[ι(U1 ), . . . , ι(Ur )]. Let E be a subspace of S(p ∩ q)K∩H so that S(p ∩ q)K∩H is a free
D-module generated by E, where the action of ι(Ui ) is multiplication by Resgp∩q ι(Ui ) = ι(Wi ).
We have dim E = |W (aq )/WK∩H | · d = |W| · d. It follows that the linear map
S(k) ⊗ H(p ∩ q) ⊗ E ⊗ D ⊗ S(h) → S(g)
+

given by k ⊗ h ⊗ e ⊗ D ⊗ h 7→ kh+ eDh is a surjection. Recall that D = C[D1 , . . . , Dr ] is the
polynomial subalgebra of Z(g) generated by Di with γ(Di ) = Ui (i = 1, · · · , r). Let U j (g) ⊂
U j+1 (g) be the standard filtration of the universal enveloping algebra. We compare the grade
with the filtration and argue as in [W, 11.2.2], and conclude that the linear map
Γg : U (k) ⊗ H(p ∩ q) ⊗ E ⊗ D ⊗ U (h) → U (g)
+

given by k ⊗ h ⊗ e ⊗ D ⊗ h 7→ k symm(h+ ) symm(e)Dh is a surjection. We remark that in the
above linear surjection Γg the algebra D can be replaced by the polynomial subalgebra of Z(g)
generated by symm(ι(Ui )), since γ(symm(ι(Ui ))) equals to Ui modulo lower degree terms.
Now we define the second map Γ+ . Let c+ be a Cartan subalgebra of g+ containing aq . Note
that the restriction p is also equal to the the composition of the following two maps
S(c)W (c) → S(c+ )W (c+ ) → S(aq )W (aq ) .

Set Ui′ = Rescc+ Ui . Then Resca+q Ui′ = Wi . By Chevalley’s restriction theorem, the restrictions
Resgc++ : S(g+ )G+ → S(c+ )W (c+ )
is an algebra isomorphism. Denote by ι(Ui′ ) the inverse of Ui′ , namely, Resgc++ ι(Ui′ ) = Ui′ . It follows
g+
ι(Ui′ ) = ι(Wi ). Let D′ = C[ι(U1′ ), . . . , ι(Ur′ )]. Then S(p ∩ q)K∩H is a free D′ -module
that Resp∩q
generated by E (the action of ι(Ui′ ) is multiplication by ι(Wi )). Then the map h+ ⊗ e ⊗ D ⊗ h 7→
h+ eDh defines a linear bijection
H(p ∩ q) ⊗ E ⊗ D′ ⊗ S(k ∩ h) → S(g+ ).
Let γ ′ : Z(g+ ) → S(c+ )W (c+ ) be the Harish-Chandra isomorphism. Let D′ = C[D1′ , . . . , Dr′ ] be
the polynomial subalgebra of Z(g+ ) generated by Di′ with γ ′ (Di′ ) = Ui′ (i = 1, · · · , r). Once again
by comparing the grade with the filtration and arguing as in [W, 11.2.2], we have the linear map
Γg+ : H(p ∩ q) ⊗ E ⊗ D′ ⊗ U (k ∩ h) → U (g+ )
given by h+ ⊗ e ⊗ D′ ⊗ k 7→ symm(h+ ) symm(e)D′ k is a linear isomorphism.
Let (τ, Vτ ) be an irreducible representation of K and denote by (τ+ , Vτ ) its restriction to K+ =
K ∩ H. Let Eν (G, τ ) (resp. Eν (G+ , τ+ )) denote the space of joint eigenfunctions of D (resp. D′ )
in the space of τ -spherical functions C ∞ (G, τ ) (resp. C ∞ (G+ , τ+ )). For each f ∈ Eν (G, τ ), we
define its Taylor series
Tf : U (g) → Vτ , by Tf (x) = xf (1), for x ∈ U (g).
Let H(p ∩ q) be the harmonics for the symmetric algebra S(p ∩ q) with the adjoint action of K+
on p ∩ q. Hence, Tf is completely determined by its evaluation on symm(H(p ∩ q)) symm(E). Set
Af (h+ ⊗ e) = Tf (symm(h+ ) symm(e)).
If Af = 0, then the function f is constant zero. Moreover,
Af (ad(k)(h+ ⊗ e)) = τ1 (k)Af (h+ ⊗ e)τ2 (k −1 ), for k ∈ K+ .
It follows that Af is contained in HomK+ (H(p ∩ q) ⊗ E, Vτ ). Similarly, for each φ ∈ Eν (G+ , τ+ )
the Taylor series Tφ is completely determined by its evaluation on symm(H(p ∩ q)) symm(E). In
the proof of Theorem 4.3 in [HOW] it has been shown that Eν (G+ , τ+ ) is in linear bijection with
HomK+ (H(p ∩ q) ⊗ E, Vτ ). Define
B : Eν (G, τ ) → Eν (G+ , τ+ ), f 7→ φ iff Af = Aφ .
Then B is a linear injection.
Theorem 5.2. B is a linear bijection of Eν (G, τ ) with Eν (G+ , τ+ ).
Proof. It is enough to show dim Eν (G, τ ) = dim Eν (G+ , τ+ ). Note that
dim Eν (G+ , τ+ ) = dim HomK+ (H(p ∩ q) ⊗ E, Vτ ) = dim E · dim HomK+ (H(p ∩ q), Vτ ),
which is equal to dim E · dim VτM∩K∩H and denoted by d(τ ). We now show dim Eν (G, τ ) = d(τ ).
When ν is generic, the Eisenstein integrals corresponding to the matrix coefficients of irreducible
principal series with H-fixed distribution vectors give d(τ ) linear independent functions in Eν (G, τ ).
Note that the K-types of these principal series πξ,λ(ξ)i are copies of IndK
M (ξ) (which does not depend
on λ(ξ)i , i = 1, . . . , d = dim E) as following

Thus, there exists a basis f1,ν , . . . , fd(τ ),ν for Eν (G, τ ) such that each fi,ν is holomorphic in generic
ν and having meromorphic extension to all ν ([B2]). Let D = {z ∈ C; |z| < 1} denote the unit
disc and D0 = {z ∈ C; 0 < |z| < 1} the punctured disc. For ν0 non-generic, there exists a ν1 ∈ a∗qC
and such that fi,z = fi,ν0 +zν1 is holomorphic in z ∈ D0 and extended meromorphically to D. We

apply Prop. 2.21 [OS1] to obtain linear independent gi,z = j=1 aij (z)fj,z that are holomorphic
in z ∈ D, where aij (z) are d(τ )2 meromorphic functions of z ∈ D. This extends the equality
dim Eν (G, τ ) = d(τ ) to ν = ν0 . Thus, B is a bijection.
This completes the proof of Theorems 5.2 as well as Theorem 5.4.
We remark that Theorems 7.5 and 8.4 can be proved with the above argument using a basis
f1,ν , . . . , fd(τ ),ν for Eν (G, τ ) with ν = ν0 + zν1 and fi,ν0 +zν1 being holomorphic in z ∈ D. Still,
we now prove the general statement in Theorem 5.5 on holomorphic dependence for the severalvariables ν.
4. A Proof of Theorem 5.5. Denote by A the linear bijection defined above for the proof of
Theorem 5.2, namely,
A : Eν (G, τ ) → HomK+ (H(p ∩ q) ⊗ E, Vτ ) by f 7→ Af .
Fix a basis η1 . . . , ηd(τ ) for HomK+ (H(p ∩ q) ⊗ E, Vτ ). Set fi,ν = A−1 (ηi ), namely Afi,ν = ηi . We
now prove that the basis f1,ν , . . . , fd(τ ),ν for Eν (G, τ ) satisfying the required condition, namely
each fi,ν is holomorphic in ν.
First, we assume that ν0 is generic. There exists a basis {gi,ν ; i = 1, . . . , d(τ )} of Eν (G, τ )
such that each gi,ν is holomorphic inPν (in a domain Ω(ν0 ) of ν0 ) as we argued above by using
Eisenstein integrals. Then A(gi,ν ) = j bji (ν)ηj with ν 7→ [bij (ν)] a holomorphic map from Ω(ν0 )
P
to GL(d(τ ), C). Let [cij (ν)] = [bij (ν)]−1 be the inverse matrix. Set hi,ν = j cji (ν)gj,ν . Then
hi,ν is holomorphic in ν. It follows that hi,ν = fi,ν , since A(hi,ν ) = A(fi,ν ) = ηi . Thus, fi,ν is
holomorphic at ν0 .
If dim a∗qC = 1, this has been done above by applying Prop. 2.21 [OS1]. Now we assume
dim a∗qC > 1. We now show that each fi,ν is holomorphic in ν at any point ν0 ∈ a∗qC . Note that
the non-generic points S is in the union of locally finite hypersurfaces ∪H with each H defined
either by the zeros of the polynomial equations J(Λξ ; x) = 0 or by hν, αi ∈ Z for some restricted
root α ∈ Σ(g, aq ). Let S0 ⊆ S be the points contained in precisely one of such hypersurfaces. It
follows from Corollary 7.3.2 [3] that it suffices to show that fi,ν is holomorphic at any ν0 ∈ S0 ,
since the singular locus of this extension is contained in S\S0 and the latter set has codimension
at least two in aq ∗C .
Suppose that ν0 ∈ S0 is in the hypersurface H = {ν ∈ aq ∗C ; g(ν) = 0}, where the holomorphic
function g(ν) is not constant zero. Recall that D is the complex unit disc. Then there is an open
set Ω containing µ0 and a ν1 ∈ a∗qC so that the intersection of the disc D(µ) = µ + ν1 D with S is
contained in {µ} for any µ ∈ Ω. Then there is an open set Ω(ν0 ) consisting of the union of discs
[
Ω(ν0 ) =
D(µ),
µ∈H∩Ω

such that Ω(ν0 ) ∩ S ⊂ H. Once again we apply Prop. 2.21 [OS1] to obtain linear independent
Pd(τ )
gi,ν = j=1 aij (ν)fj,ν that are holomorphic at any ν ∈ Ω(ν0 ), where aij (ν) are d(τ )2 meromorphic
functions of ν in Ω(ν0 ). In particular, gi,ν is bounded at H ∩ Ω(ν0 ). By Riemmann’s removable
singularity theorem (Theorem 7.3.3 [3]), gi,ν is holomorphic at ν0 . Now we use the same argument
above for a generic point ν0 to get hi,ν holomorphic in ν ∈ Ω(ν0 ) and A(hi,ν ) = ηi . Thus,
fi,ν = hi,ν is holomorphic at ν0 . This completes the proof of Theorem 5.5.
5. Correction to the list of exceptional simple pairs in Proposition 3.1. Recall that a
simple symmetric pair (g, h) is called exceptional if the restriction I(c) → I(aq ) is not surjective.
There are totally 35 exceptional simple pairs which are listed in Proposition 3.1. It follows from
Helgason’s restriction theorem [2] that a simple pair (g, h) is exceptional if and only if
(Σ(g, c), Σ(g, aq )) ∈ {(E6 , BC2 ), (E6 , A2 ), (E7 , C3 ), (E8 , F4 )}.

Denote by (g , h ) the dual symmetric pair of (g, h). Note that the two dual pairs have the same
pairs of the restriction root systems. Thus, (g, h) is exceptional if and only if (gd , hd ) is exceptional.
Since G × G/d(G) is dual to GC /KC , the following pairs

listed in Proposition 3.1 should be replaced by
C C
C C
C C
(eC
6 , so10 (C) + C), (e6 , f4 ), (e7 , e6 + C), (e8 , e7 + sl2 (C)).

The above four exceptional pairs are dual to (g × g, d(g)) with g = e6(−14) , e6(−26) , e7(−25) , e8(−24) .
Note that Riemannian symmetric pair G/K, Kǫ -symmetric space G/Kǫ and GC /GR are self-dual
[OS2]. The restriction for the exceptional pairs is calculated case by case in [HOW] Pages 640-642.
6. A final remark. Let D(G/H) be the algebra of G-invariant differential operators on an affine
symmetric space G/H. The right action of G on C ∞ (G) induces a surjective homomorphism
r : U (g)H → D(G/H)
with kernel U (g)H ∩ U (g)h. Note that U (g)H = (U (g)H ∩ U (g)h) ⊕ symm[S(q)H ]. Then r maps
symm[S(q)H ] bijectively onto D(G/H). Recall aq is a maximal abelian subspace in p ∩ q and
b ⊇ aq is a Cartan subspace of G/H. Let
γb : D(G/H) → I(b)
be the Harish-Chandra isomorphism defined in [BS1].
A simple pair (g, h) is called b-exceptional (in comparison with exceptional) if the restriction
I(b) → I(aq ) is not surjective. It follows from Helgason’s restriction theorem [2] that a simple pair
(g, h) is b-exceptional if and only if
(Σ(g, b), Σ(g, aq )) ∈ {(E6 , BC2 ), (E6 , A2 ), (E7 , C3 ), (E8 , F4 )}.
There are totally 10 b-exceptional (in comparison with 35 exceptional) simple pairs:
(e6(−14) , sp2,2 ), (e6(−26) , sp3,1 ), (e7(−25) , su6,2 ), (e7(−25) , su∗8 ), (e8(−24) , so12,4 ), (e8(−24) , so∗16 )
and four pairs of the form (g × g, d(g)) with g = e6(−14) , e6(−26) , e7(−25) , e8(−24) .
The main results of [1] depend on the choice of a polynomial algebra D ⊆ Z(g). We can
generalize the results to a polynomial algebra D ⊂ U (g)H satisfying the following conditions:
(a) D ∼
= S(aq )W(aq ) , if (g, h) contains no simple b-exceptional pair;
(b) D is isomorphic to a subalgebra of S(aq )W (aq ) such that S(aq )W (aq ) is a free D-module of
finite rank, if (g, h) contains some simple b-exceptional pairs.
In particular, if G/H is split, namely b = aq , then D ∼
= D(G/H). The split symmetric spaces
include (but not limited to) the following families:
(i) A Riemannian symmetric space G/K and a Kǫ -symmetric space G/Kǫ ;
(ii) A split groups G regarded as a symmetric space G × G/d(G) and its dual space GC /KC ;
(iii) The symmetric space GC /GR of a complex Lie group GC over a real form GR that has a
compact Cartan subgroup.
The details of the generalization will be published elsewhere.
