Abstract. We confirm a conjecture of Guth concerning the maximal number of δ-tubes, with
δ-separated directions, contained in the δ-neighborhood of a real algebraic variety. Modulo a factor
of δ −ε , we also prove Guth and Zahl’s generalized version for semialgebraic sets. Although the
applications are to be found in harmonic analysis, the proof will employ deep results from algebraic
and differential geometry, including Tarski’s projection theorem and Gromov’s algebraic lemma.

1. Introduction
For δ > 0, we consider δ-neighborhoods of unit line segments, arbitrarily positioned in a compact
subset of Euclidean space. We call these δ-tubes and, to avoid introducing an extra parameter,
they will be supported in a ball of radius two from now on. A formulation of the Kakeya conjecture
seeks to estimate the number of δ-tubes, pointing in δ-separated directions, in terms of the Lebesgue
measure of any set that contains them (take λ = 1 in inequality (1.1) below).
Guth and Zahl showed how progress can be made via polynomial partitioning [8], a technique
introduced in [7]. This partitions the underlying space with the zero set of a polynomial of degree D,
after which a line cannot intersect more than D + 1 of the resulting subsets. The problem is
typically reduced to the harder case concerning what happens on or near the zero set. For this it
is useful to know how many δ-tubes, pointing in δ-separated directions, can be contained in the
δ-neighborhood of the zero set. In relation to the closely related Fourier restriction problem, Guth
made the following conjecture [6, pp. 49].
Conjecture 1.1. For all integers n, D ≥ 2 and all ε > 0, there is a constant C(n, D, ε) > 0 so
that the number of δ-tubes, pointing in δ-separated directions, contained in the δ-neighborhood of
an m-dimensional algebraic variety Z ⊂ Rn , of degree at most D, is bounded by C(n, D, ε)δ1−m−ε .
This was proven by Guth, with n = 3, yielding progress on the three-dimensional restriction
conjecture [5, 12], and by Zahl, with n = 4, yielding progress on the four-dimensional Kakeya
conjecture [15], as well as the four-dimensional restriction conjecture [4]. Here we will prove Conjecture 1.1 in all dimensions. This implies that δ-neighborhoods of varieties cannot contradict the
Kakeya conjecture. This should be compared with the grains decomposition of [8] which tells us
that a union of δ-tubes can only have small measure if it has some algebraic structure. On the other
hand, in [6] it is noted that a resolution of Conjecture 1.1 would lead to further improvements for the
restriction conjecture in higher dimensions. Indeed, the k-broad estimates of [6] can be improved
by arguing as in [5], mapping from L∞ rather than L2 so as to take advantage of Conjecture 1.1
2n n(n+k)−k
with m = n − 1. This controls the k-broad norm with Lebesgue exponent p = n−1
n(n+k)−n and
so the estimate with k = (n + 1)/2 can be inputted into Proposition 9.1 from [6] to provide an
2n

More generally, Guth and Zahl considered the following definition. In Wolff’s original version,
the semialgebraic sets S are taken to be truncated δ-neighborhoods of 2-planes [13]. It is clear that
δ-tubes, pointing in δ-separated directions, satisfy the Wolff axioms, and Guth and Zahl conjectured
that they also satisfy the following stronger condition; see [8, pp. 4].

Definition 1.1. We say that sets T of δ-tubes in Rn satisfy the polynomial Wolff axioms if, for
every integer E ≥ 2, there is a constant C(n, E) > 0 so that

	
# T ∈ T : |T ∩ S| ≥ λ|T | ≤ C(n, E)|S|δ1−n λ−n

whenever S is a semialgebraic set, of complexity at most E, and λ ≥ δ > 0.

We will prove the following theorem, confirming their conjecture up to a factor of Cε δ−ε . The
tubes are contained in a ball of Rn , and the intersection of this with the δ-neighborhood of an
m-dimensional variety, of degree at most D, forms a semialgebraic set S with complexity bounded
in terms of n and D. Moreover, by Wongkew’s lemma [14], the measure of such an S is bounded
by c(n, D)δn−m . Thus, Conjecture 1.1 is proved by taking λ = 1 in the following theorem.
Theorem 1.1. Let n, E ≥ 2 be integers and ε > 0. Then there is a constant C(n, E, ε) > 0 so
that, for every set T of δ-tubes in Rn , pointing in δ-separated directions,

	
# T ∈ T : |T ∩ S| ≥ λ|T | ≤ C(n, E, ε)|S|δ1−n−ε λ−n
(1.1)

whenever S is a semialgebraic set, of complexity at most E, and λ ≥ δ > 0.

The proof will employ deep results from both algebraic and differential geometry. On the one
hand, we use quantifier elimination to build new semialgebraic sets with bounded complexity from
known semialgebraic sets. On the other hand, we will use Gromov’s algebraic lemma to nicely
parametrize semialgebraic sets of bounded complexity. Rather than apply Gromov’s lemma to S,
we would like to apply it to our set of tubes, however this is not semialgebraic. We replace it with
a semialgebraic version using quantifier elimination. We first consider all the tubes contained in S
and then take a semialgebraic section, the result being that the tubes are repositioned. This will
be discussed in more detail in the following section.
In the third section, we prove a simplified version of Theorem 1.1, where the intersections of the
tubes with S contain truncated δ-tubes of length λ, the advantage being that we can perform the
previous steps to obtain a semialgebraic set of tubes. We bound |S| below by the measure of the
union of these tubes, each slice of which can be written in terms of the parametrisation given by
Gromov’s lemma. One part of the parametrisation maps into the directions (and there is no more
than one tube for each direction), and the other part into the uncontrolled position of the tube.
We approximate the parametrisation by a polynomial, allowing us to apply Bézout’s theorem, in
order to ensure that this uncontrolled part does not interfere too often.
In the final section, we complete the proof. This involves a further application of Bézout’s
theorem, a change of scales, and dyadic pigeonholing in order to obtain a version of (1.1) with |S|
on the right-hand side replaced by the measure of the δn -neighborhood of S. The proof is then
completed by bounding |Sδn | = |Sδn \S| + |S| by a constant multiple of |S|, an easy consequence of
the Milnor–Thom theorem [11] combined with Wongkew’s lemma [13].

particular the proof of Lemma 2.2 came from a conversation with him. The second author would
like to thank Jonathan Hickman for helpful discussions regarding the application to restriction.
2. Semialgebraic sets, quantifier elimination and Gromov’s algebraic lemma
Following [1], we say that the semialgebraic sets of Rn are the smallest family of sets, closed under
finite unions, intersections, and complements, that contains both {x : P (x) = 0} and {x : Q(x) > 0}
for all polynomials P and Q. We say that the complexity of a semialgebraic set is the smallest sum
of the degrees of the polynomials appearing in a complete description of the set.
Perhaps the most fundamental result in the subject of semialgebraic sets is Tarski’s projection
theorem; see for example [1].

Theorem 2.1 (Tarski). Let Π be the orthogonal projection of Rn into its first n − 1 coordinates.
Then for every E ≥ 1, there is a constant C(n, E) > 0 so that, for every semialgebraic S ⊂ Rn of
complexity at most E, the projection Π(S) has complexity at most C(n, E).
Noting that (x1 , . . . , xn−1 ) ∈ Π(S) if and only if ∃ (x1 , . . . , xn−1 , xn ) ∈ S, we associate this
theorem with quantifiers. Roughly speaking, Tarski’s theorem tells us that any set described using
semialgebraic sets and quantifiers is semialgebraic with complexity depending only on the length
of the description and the complexity of the semialgebraic sets used in the description.
For notational convenience we work in Rn+1 rather than Rn . With λ ≥ δ and t0 ∈ [−2, 2], we
will consider truncated λ × δ-tubes in Rn+1 defined by

	
Ta,d = (x, t) ∈ Rn × [t0 , t0 + λ] : |x − a − td| ≤ δ ,
(a, d) ∈ [0, 1]2n .
Note that Ta,d is a semialgebraic set of fairly small complexity.

Lemma 2.1. Let S ⊂ Rn+1 be a semialgebraic set of complexity at most E. Then

	
LS := (a, d) ∈ [0, 1]2n : Ta,d ⊂ S

is a semialgebraic set of of complexity at most C(n, E), a constant depending only on n and E.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Tarski’s projection theorem. First we write
	

LS = (a, d) ∈ [0, 1]2n : (x, t) ∈ S ∀ (x, t) ∈ Ta,d .

We then define the clearly semialgebraic Y by
	

Y = (a, d, x, t) ∈ [0, 1]2n × Rn × [t0 , t0 + λ] : (x, t) ∈
/ S, (x, t) ∈ Ta,d .

Writing Z = Π(Y ), where Π is the projection (a, d, x, t) 7→ (a, d), by Theorem 2.1 we conclude
that Z is semialgebraic of complexity depending only on n and E. The proof is completed by noting
that LS is the complement of Z in [0, 1]2n .

Noting that LS is closed if S is closed, we have shown that given a closed semialgebraic set, the
set of tubes it contains is closed and semialgebraic. Next we will show that we can extract a section
semialgebraically. That is, we can choose one tube for each direction.

Lemma 2.2. Let S ⊂ R2n be a compact semialgebraic set of complexity at most E. Let Π be the
orthogonal projection into the final n coordinates (a, d) 7→ d. Then there is a constant C(n, E) > 0,
depending only on n and E, and a semialgebraic set Z, of complexity at most C(n, E), so that
Z ⊂ S,

Π(Z) = Π(S),

and so that for each d, there is at most one a with (a, d) ∈ Z.
Proof. It suffices to show that for the projection Π1 defined by (a, d) 7→ (a2 , . . . , an , d), there is a
constant C(E) > 0 and a semialgebraic Z1 of complexity at most C(E), so that
Z1 ⊂ S,

Π1 (Z1 ) = Π1 (S),

and so that for any (a2 , . . . , an , d) there is at most one a1 with (a, d) ∈ Z1 . Having done that,
we obtain Z2 by applying the same result to Z1 with the first coordinate replaced by the second,
obtain Zj from Zj−1 with the first coordinate replaced by the jth, and finally setting Z = Zn .
It suffices to see that there is a semialgebraic choice of Z1 . Whenever (a2 , . . . , an , d) ∈ Π1 (S) we
let (a, d) ∈ Z1 for a1 the maximal value so that (a, d) ∈ S. More logically, we write

	
Z1 = (a, d) ∈ S : x ≤ a1 ∀ (x, a2 , . . . , an , d) ∈ S .
As before we introduce the clearly semialgebraic Y defined by

	
Y = (x, a, d) ∈ R × S : x > a1 , (x, a2 , . . . , an , d) ∈ S ,

and use Theorem 2.1 to project Y to its last 2n coordinates. We then recover Z1 , by taking the
complement in S, to complete the proof.

An elementary proof of the following algebraic lemma can be found in the work of Burguet [2].
Lemma 2.3 (Gromov). For all integers d, E, r ≥ 1, there exists M (d, E, r) < ∞ with the following
properties. For any compact semialgebraic set A ⊂ [0, 1]d , of dimension n and complexity at most E,
there exists an integer N ≤ M (E, d, r) and maps φ1 , . . . , φN : [0, 1]n −→ [0, 1]d so that

A weaker version of this was first proved by Yomdin [3]. It was first stated as presented here by
Gromov. The first detailed proof of this version appears to have been given by Pila and Wilkie [10].
3. Proof of Theorem 1.1 with λ = 1
For notational convenience we work in Rn+1 rather than Rn . As we can suppose that the δtubes are contained in B(0, 2), without loss of generality we can suppose that our semialgebraic
sets S ⊂ Rn+1 are compact. We choose our coordinates so that a large proportion (at least a
fraction 1/4n ) of our tubes have central lines segments that can be written as (a, 0) + t(d, 1) with t
in an interval I ⊂ [−2, 2] and d ∈ [0, 1]n . Similarly, by translation if necessary, we can also suppose
that a ∈ [0, 1]n .
Recalling from the previous section that a λ × δ-tube is defined to be of the form

	
Ta,d (λ, δ) = (x, t) ∈ Rn × [t0 , t0 + λ] : |x − a − td| ≤ δ ,
(a, d) ∈ [0, 1]2n ,

our δ-tubes always contain a λ×δ-tube with λ = 12 (n+1)−1/2 . Thus, to count the number of δ-tubes
entirely contained in S, it will suffice to prove the following theorem. This does not yet complete
the proof of Theorem 1.1, as the intersection of S with a δ-tube need not contain a λ × δ-tube, for
any λ, when the δ-tube is not contained in S. In that case the mass can be distributed along the
length of the whole tube.
Theorem 3.1. Let n, E ≥ 1 be integers and ε > 0. Then there is a constant C(n, E, ε) > 0 so
that, for every set T of λ × δ-tubes in Rn+1 , pointing in δ-separated directions,

	
# T ∈ T : T ⊂ S ≤ C(n, E, ε)|S|δ−n−ε λ−n−1
(3.1)
whenever S is a semialgebraic set, of complexity at most E, and λ ≥ δ > 0.

Proof. We first cover the t-interval [−2, 2] with nonoverlapping intervals Ik of length λ/2. The
projection of each T ∈ T into the (n + 1)th coordinate must contain some Ik . For each T , we
choose such a k and declare that T ∈ Tk . We let Sk be the subset of S consisting of points whose
(n + 1)th coordinate is in Ik−1 ∪ Ik ∪ Ik+1 . Then it suffices to prove
	

# T ∈ Tk : T ⊂ Sk ≤ C(n, E, ε)|Sk |δ−n−ε λ−n−1 .

Relabelling Tk , Sk and Ik by T, S and I, for the sake of a contradiction we assume that for all
C > 0, we can find sets T of λ × δ-tubes, pointing in δ-separated directions, and semialgebraic
sets S, of complexity bounded by E, such that

	
# T ∈ T : T ⊂ S > C|S|δ−n−ε λ−n−1
(3.2)

for some λ ≥ δ > 0. We can suppose that |S| ≥ λδn as otherwise S would not contain a single tube.
Note also that (3.1) clearly holds when restricted to all δ > c > 0, by simply taking C(n, E, ε)
sufficiently large. Thus the δ for which (3.2) holds must tend to zero as C tends to infinity.
Now instead of counting the tubes of T directly, we first consider L defined by

	
L = (a, d) ∈ [0, 1]2n : Ta,d (λ, δ/2) ⊂ S ,

ON THE POLYNOMIAL WOLFF AXIOMS

the advantage being that we can apply Lemma 2.1 to see that L is semialgebraic. Moreover,
applying Lemma 2.2 to L, we obtain a semialgebraic section L′ consisting of a single vector (a, d)
for each d appearing in L. Letting Π denote the projection (a, d) 7→ d, we then have
|Π(L′ )| > C|S|δ−ε λ−n−1 .
This is because for each Ta,d (λ, δ) ∈ T there is a whole n-dimensional ball B(d, δ/2) in Π(L′ ), and
these balls are disjoint due to the fact that the directions of T are δ-separated. Given that L′ can
be considered to be the graph of a function that maps from Π(L′ ) ⊂ [0, 1]n , we see that L′ is an
n-dimensional subset of [0, 1]2n .
We apply Gromov’s algebraic lemma, Lemma 2.3, to L′ with r taken to be the first integer larger
than 4n2 /ε. This breaks L′ into N pieces, with N depending only on n, E and r. For each piece Lj ,
there is a map (Fj , Gj ) : [0, 1]n −→ [0, 1]2n , with
(Fj , Gj )([0, 1]n ) = Lj

and

k(Fj , Gj )kC r ≤ 1.

By the pigeonhole principle, there is a choice of j for which
|Gj ([0, 1]n )| = |Π(Lj )| > C|S|δ−ε λ−n−1 .
ε

Moreover, we can find a ball B ⊂ [0, 1]n , centered at x0 and of diameter δ 2n , so that
|Gj (B)| > C|S|δ−ε/2 λ−n−1 .

(3.3)

We use this large set of directions to find a lower bound on |S| that will yield the contradiction.
First we replace (Fj , Gj ) by (F, G), the (r − 1)th degree Taylor approximation of (Fj , Gj ) at x0 .
By the estimates on the C r norm of (Fj , Gj ), given by the Gromov algebraic lemma, we have
|(Fj , Gj )(x) − (F, G)(x)| ≤ |x − x0 |r .
As we chose r > 4n2 /ε, for x in our small ball B centered at x0 , this yields
|(Fj , Gj )(x) − (F, G)(x)| ≤ 41 δ2n .

(3.4)

We see that continuous G maps B into the δ2n -neighborhood of Gj (B), and in particular the
boundary of B maps into the δ2n -neighborhood of the boundary of Gj (B). By (3.3), recalling that
|S| ≥ λδn , we can conclude that
|G(B)| > C|S|λ−n−1
(3.5)
whenever C is sufficiently large so that δ2n is sufficiently small. If there are points x ∈ B for which
the determinant of the Jacobian matrix DG(x) is zero, they are mapped to a null set, by Sard’s
theorem. Thus we can remove them without affecting the validity of (3.5).
Now, by (3.4) and the fact that the tubes are contained in S, we have (F (x) + tG(x), t) ∈ S for
all t ∈ I and x ∈ B. Thus we can estimate
Z
|S| ≥ |(F + tG)(B)| dt.
I

In order to contradict (3.5), we would like to bound this below by λn+1 |G(B)|. Using the change of
variables formula, this will follow from estimates for the Jacobian determinants, however for fixed t,
it is not necessarily the case that F + tG is one-to-one. For this reason, we prepared a substitute,
namely that F + tG is a polynomial in n variables of degree r − 1. By restricting ourselves to
Bt ⊂ B, defined to be the points x ∈ B where (DF + tDG)(x) is invertible, the values of F + tG
are isolated, even after complexifying F and G. Thus, by Bézout’s theorem, we see that F + tG
maps at most (r − 1)n points of Bt to the same place. Partitioning Bt into sets Uk on which F + tG
is one-to-one, by the change of variables formula, we obtain

|S| ≥

Note that there may be values of t ∈ I for which Bt is the empty set, however we will see that this
cannot happen too often.
It remains to bound |(DF + tDG)(x)| from below in terms of |DG(x)|. In order to do this, we
first note that
|(DF + tDG)(x)| = |Px (t)|,
where Px (t) is a polynomial of degree n. Fixing x for the moment, we write
Px (t) = |DG(x)|(t − r1 )(t − r2 ) . . . (t − rn ),
where r1 , . . . rn may be complex numbers that depend on x. We observe that for most of the t ∈ I,
we have the estimate
|I|
|t − rj | ≥

4. Proof of Theorem 1.1 with λ ≥ δ
The main difficulty in extending to the general case λ ≥ δ, is that the condition |T ∩ S| ≥ λ|T |
is not semialgebraic. However, Theorem 3.1 implies the following δ-discretized version in which Sδ
denotes the δ-neighborhood of S in Rn+1 .
Theorem 4.1. Let n, E ≥ 1 be integers and ε > 0. Then there is a constant C(n, E, ε) > 0 so
that, for every set T of δ-tubes in Rn+1 , pointing in δ-separated directions,

	
# T ∈ T : |T ∩ S| ≥ λ|T | ≤ C(n, E, ε)|Sδ |δ−n−ε λ−n−1

whenever S is a semialgebraic set, of complexity at most E, and λ ≥ δ > 0.

Proof. Observe that if |T ∩ S| ≥ λ|T |, then there is a unit line segment ℓ ⊂ T whose direction is
that of T and for which |ℓ ∩ S| ≥ λ, where |ℓ ∩ S| denotes one-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Now
ℓ ∩ S breaks into at most C(E) connected components by Bézout’s theorem. Thus, ℓ ∩ S contains a
line segment of length C(E)−1 λ, and so Tδ ∩ Sδ contains a C(E)−1 λ × δ tube in the direction of T .
Now we apply Theorem 3.1, with S replaced by Sδ , to complete the proof.

This would be enough to prove the full theorem if we could bound |Sδ | in terms of |S|. Unfortunately, we do not not always have the appropriate bounds, so first we prove the same result for Sη
for any η ≥ δ2n .

Theorem 4.2. Let n, E ≥ 1 be integers and ε > 0. Then there is a constant C(n, E, ε) > 0 so
that, for every set T of δ-tubes in Rn+1 , pointing in δ-separated directions,

	
# T ∈ T : |T ∩ S| ≥ λ|T | ≤ C(n, E, ε)|Sη |δ−n−ε λ−n−1 .

whenever S is a semialgebraic set, of complexity at most E, and λ ≥ δ ≥ η ≥ δ2n > 0.

Proof. We replace T by Tη , a set of η-tubes pointing in η-separated directions. Taking no more
than (δ/η)n many η-tubes V ⊂ T , all intersecting in some ball of radius η, we can position them
so that they capture a good proportion of the mass of T ∩ S;
X
cn λδn ≤
|V ∩ S|.
(4.1)
V ⊂T

Writing Tλ = {T ∈ T : |T ∩ S| ≥ λ|T |} and partitioning into subsets Vk of thin tubes V that satisfy
2−k λ|V | ≤ |V ∩ S| < 2−k+1 λ|V |,

(4.2)

there must be a set Vk with large cardinality compared to Tλ . Then we apply Theorem 4.1 to
this Vk , with δ replaced by η and λ replaced by 2−k λ, giving
#Vk ≤ C(n, E, ε)|Sη |η −n−ε λ−n−1 2k(n+1) .

(4.3)

It is straightforward to find the subset Vk with large cardinality compared to Tλ . We use the
upper bound in (4.2), to see that
X
X X
|V ∩ S| <
2−k+1 λ|V | ≤ 2−k+1 λδn #Tλ ,
(4.4)
V ∈Vk

T ∈Tλ V ⊂T

where the second inequality is because there are less than (δ/η)n thin tubes in each fat tube. On
the other hand, by summing (4.1), we have
X
X
|V ∩ S|.
(4.5)
cn λδn #Tλ ≤
k≥log2 λ−1 V ∈Vk

Comparing (4.4) and (4.5), we see that the summands with large k contribute little and so, by
the pigeonhole principal, (4.5) must continue to hold for a single Vk , with k ≤ C(n), losing only a
factor of log2 λ−1 . Using the upper bound of (4.2) and recalling that λ ≥ δ, this yields
#Tλ ≤ C(n) log2 δ−1 #Vk 2−k+1 η n δ−n ,
which can be combined with (4.3) to complete the proof.



We are finally in a position to complete the proof of the full theorem.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. We can suppose that |S| ≥ λδn , because otherwise there are no tubes T
with |T ∩ S| ≥ λ|T |. Given that |Sη | ≤ |S| + |Sη \S|, after applying Theorem 4.2, it would suffice
to bound the measure of the η-neighborhood of the boundary of S. By the Milnor–Thom theorem,
this is contained in the η-neighborhood of at most C(n, E) hypersurfaces of degree at most E; see
for example [9, Theorem 9]. Thus, we can apply Wongkew’s lemma [14] to obtain
|Sη \S| ≤ C(n, E)η.
Taking η = δn+1 ≤ |S|, as we may, completes the proof.
