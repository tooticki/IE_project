Abstract. We associate a root system to a finite set in a free abelian group and prove
that its irreducible subsystem is of type A, B or D. Applying this general result to a
torus manifold M , where a torus manifold is a 2n-dimensional connected closed smooth
manifold with a smooth effective action of an n-dimensional compact torus having a fixed
point, we introduce a root system R(M ) for M and show that if the torus action on M
extends to a smooth action of a connected compact Lie group G, then the root system of
G is a subsystem of R(M ) so that any irreducible factor of the Lie algebra of G is of type
A, B or D. Moreover, we show that only type A appears if H ∗ (M ) is generated by H 2 (M )
as a ring. We also discuss a similar problem for a torus manifold with an invariant stable
complex structure. Only type A appears in this case, too.

1. Introduction
One of the original motivation of toric geometry initiated by Demazure [4] was to study
the automorphism group Aut(X) of a toric variety X. He completely determined Aut(X)
when X is complete and non-singular, by introducing a root system associated to the fan
of X (see also [18]). Cox [1] generalized this result to the case when X is complete and
simplicial, i.e., a compact orbifold, using the homogeneous coordinate ring (Cox ring) of
X. Note that Aut(X) is an algebraic group in these cases and the C∗ -torus acting on X is
a maximal torus of Aut(X).
A symplectic toric manifold M is a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 2n with an
action of an n-dimensional compact torus T preserving the symplectic form and admitting
a moment map. As is well-known, M is determined by the moment map image which is
a simple polytope satisfying a non-singular condition ([3]) and hence M is equivariantly
diffeomorphic to the projective non-singular toric variety XP associated to the normal fan
of P . Unlike the complex case above, the group Symp(M) of symplectomorphisms of M
is infinite dimensional. The second named author [16] introduced a root system R(P )
for a non-singular polytope P following the idea of Demazure and showed that if MP is
the symplectic toric manifold corresponding to P and G is a compact Lie subgroup of

Symp(MP ) containing the torus T acting on MP , then the root system ∆(G) of G is a
subsystem of R(P ) and there is a compact Lie subgroup Gmax of Symp(MP ) such that
∆(Gmax ) = R(P ). Note that R(P ) agrees with the root system of the reductive part of
Aut(XP ) and any irreducible subsystem of R(P ) is of type A.
In this paper we consider a similar problem to the above in the smooth category. Our
geometrical object is a torus manifold M which is an orientable connected closed smooth
manifold of dimension 2n with an effective smooth action of the compact torus T of dimension n having a fixed point ([6]). Complete non-singular toric varieties with the restricted
T -action and symplectic toric manifolds are examples of torus manifolds. However, there
are many more torus manifolds, for instance, the standard sphere S 2n of dimension 2n is
a torus manifold with a natural T -action but it is not toric when n ≥ 2.
The T -action on the complex projective space CP n or S 2n extends to a transitive action
of PU(n + 1) or SO(2n + 1) in a natural way. The first named author [10], [12] classified
torus manifolds when the T -actions extend to smooth actions of compact Lie groups which
are transitive or have a codimension one principal orbit. If the T -action on a torus manifold
M extends to an effective action of a compact Lie group G, then T is a maximal torus of G
and we may think of G as a Lie subgroup of the group Diff(M) of diffeomorphisms of M.
The first purpose of this paper is to introduce a root system R(M) for a torus manifold
M, where R(MP ) = R(P ), and prove the following.
Theorem 1.1 (see Theorem 2.6, Corollary 3.6 and Theorem 4.5). Let M be a torus manifold. Then any irreducible subsystem of R(M) is of type A, B or D and only type A appears
if H ∗ (M) is generated by H 2 (M) as a ring. Moreover, if G is a compact Lie subgroup of
Diff(M) containing the torus acting on M, then the root system of G is a subsystem of
R(M).
Wiemeler [21] proves that if the T -action on a torus manifold M extends to an effective
smooth action of a compact Lie group G, then any simple factor of (the Lie algebra of) G
is of type A, B or D. The theorem above recovers this result.
For a torus manifold M with an invariant stable complex structure J (such a manifold is
called a unitary toric manifold in [15]), one can also define a root system, denoted R(M, J),
which is a subsystem of R(M). The subgroup Diff(M, J) of Diff(M) preserving the stable
complex structure J is much smaller than Diff(M), in fact, known to be a Lie group (see
Proposition 5.1). Our second main result in this paper is a stable complex version of
Theorem 1.1.
Theorem 1.2 (see Theorem 5.3 and Corollary 5.5). Let M be a torus manifold with an
invariant stable complex structure J. Then any irreducible subsystem of R(M, J) is of type
A and if G is a compact Lie subgroup of Diff(M, J) containing the torus acting on M, then
the root system of G is a subsystem of R(M, J).
It is natural to ask whether there is a compact Lie subgroup GJ of Diff(M, J) whose root
system agrees with R(M, J). We do not know the answer in general but we can find such
GJ in some cases, for instance when M is a complete non-singular toric variety but J is

not necessarily the standard complex structure. The observation also shows that R(M, J)
and GJ actually depend on J.
We make a remark on our root systems. The root system introduced by Demazure for a
complete non-singular toric variety is defined by the set of primitive edge vectors in the fan
associated with the toric variety. It does not depend on the underlying simplicial complex
of the fan. Similarly, the root system R(P ) for a non-singular polytope P is defined by
the primitive normal vectors to the facets of P and does not depend on the combinatorial
structure of P . This is also the case for our root systems R(M) and R(M, J). They
are defined by some finite set {vi } in H2 (BT ) = Hom(S 1 , T ) where vi ’s correspond to
the primitive edge vectors in the complex toric case and primitive normal vectors in the
symplectic toric case.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we associate a root system R(V )
to a finite set V in a free abelian group and prove that any irreducible subsystem of R(V )
is of type A, B or D. In Section 3, we deduce the finite set V for a torus manifold M using
the equivariant cohomology of M and define the root system R(M) to be R(V ). In Section
4, we apply the results in the previous sections to extended G-actions on M and complete
the proof of Theorem 1.1. In Section 5, we study the stable complex transformations of
a torus manifold M with an invariant stable complex structure J. We define the root
system R(M, J) as a subsystem of R(M) and prove Theorem 1.2. In Section 6, we discuss
R(M, J) and Diff(M, J) for complete non-singular toric varieties M with various stable
complex structures J.
2. Root system associated to a finite set
Let N be a free abelian group of rank n and V = {vi }m
i=1 be a finite set of non-zero
elements in N which generates a subgroup of full rank. In this section we will associate a
root system R(V ) to the finite set V and prove that any irreducible subsystem of R(V ) is
of type A, B or D. This fact will be applied to the study of symmetry of a torus manifold
in later sections.
Definition 2.1. Let V = {vi }m
i=1 be a finite subset of N which generates a subgroup of
full rank. We define R(V ) to be the subset of N ∗ := Hom(N, Z) consisting of all elements
α of the following either type 1 or type 2:
type 1: |hα, vi i| = 1 for some i and hα, vk i = 0 for k 6= i,
type 2: |hα, vi i| = |hα, vj i| = 1 for some i, j and hα, vk i = 0 for k 6= i, j,
where h , i denotes the natural pairing between N ∗ and N.
We shall give some examples of R(V ).
Example 2.2. Take N = Zn and let {ei }ni=1 be the standard basis of Zn and {e∗i }ni=1 be
its dual basis. If V = {ei }ni=1 , then
R(V ) = {±e∗i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ±e∗i ± e∗j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}.

This is a root system
Pn of type Bn and ±ei are of type 1 while ±ei ± ej are of type 2. If
V = {e1 , . . . , en , − i=1 ei }, then

R(V ) = {±e∗i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ±(e∗i − e∗j ) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}.

This is a root system of type An and any element in R(V ) is of type 2.
If R(V ) contains an element α of type 1 (resp. type 2), then all the elements in V except
one element (resp. two elements) lie in the kernel of α which is a subgroup of corank one.
Noting this, we see the following.
Example 2.3. Let N be a free abelian group of rank 2 and V = {vi }m
i=1 (m ≥ 2) be
a subset of N. Suppose that vi and vi+1 form a basis of N for i = 1, 2, . . . , m, where
vm+1 = v1 . Then R(V ) is empty if m ≥ 5. Moreover, one can check that R(V ) is of type
B2 if m = 2, of type A2 if m = 3 (see Example 2.2) and of type A1 or A1 × A1 if m = 4.
One can interpret R(V ) as Q
follows. Assembling evaluation maps h , vi i : N ∗ → Z, we
∗
m
obtain a homomorphism f := m
i=1 h , vi i : N → Z . Then R(V ) is the inverse image of
R(m) := {α ∈ Zm | (α, α) = 1 or 2}

by f , where ( , ) denotes the standard scalar product on Zm . Since V = {vi }m
i=1 is assumed
to generate a subgroup of full rank, f is injective so that we may identify R(V ) with its
image f (R(V )) = f (N ∗ ) ∩ R(m). As is well-known, R(m) is a root system of type B (see
[7, p.64]) and we will see below that R(V ) is also a root system. However, R(V ) is not
necessarily of type B and the main purpose of this section is to determine its type.
In the following, we think of N ∗ as a subgroup of Zm and R(V ) = R(m) ∩ N ∗ through
the map f . The reflection on Zm with respect to α ∈ R(m) is given by
(2.1)

rα (β) := β −

2(β, α)
α
(α, α)

(β ∈ Zm )

and rα preserves R(m). If α is in N ∗ (and hence α ∈ R(V ) = R(m) ∩ N ∗ ), then rα also
preserves N ∗ so that it preserves R(V ). Since R(m) is a root system, this shows that R(V )
is also a root system.
We make one remark. The scalar product ( , ) on Zm induces a positive definite symmetric bilinear form on N ∗ through f , denoted also by ( , ). One notes that
(2.2)

(α, β) =

m
X
i=1

hα, vi ihβ, vi i for α, β ∈ N ∗ .

In the rest of this section, we shall investigate irreducible subsystems of the root system
R(V ). For α, β ∈ R(V ) we set
(2.3)

aβ,α :=

2(β, α)
(α, α)

so that
rα (β) = β − aβ,α α

by (2.1). Note that aβ,α is either 0, ±1 or ±2. We say that α is joined to β when aβ,α 6= 0.
As is well-known, when both α and β are simple roots, aβ,α ≤ 0, and they are joined by an
edge in the Dynkin diagram of an irreducible subsystem of R(V ) if and only if aβ,α < 0.
We will denote the standard basis of Zm by {e∗i }m
i=1 . Note that a type 1 (resp. type 2)
element of R(V ) is of the form ±e∗i (resp. ±e∗i ± e∗j (i 6= j)).
Definition 2.4. We say that type 2 elements in R(V ) are conjugate if they are of the form
±e∗i ± e∗j for some common i 6= j and linearly independent. For instance, e∗i + e∗j and e∗i − e∗j
are conjugate.
The following lemma will be used to prove Theorem 2.6 stated below.
Lemma 2.5. Let Φ be an irreducible subsystem of R(V ).
(1) Let α, β, γ, δ be simple roots in Φ and of type 2. If aβ,α = aγ,α = aδ,α = −1, then
there exists a conjugate pair in {β, γ, δ}.
(2) Let β and γ be conjugate simple roots of type 2 in Φ and λ be another type 2 simple
root in Φ. If aβ,λ = −1, then aγ,λ = −1.
Proof. (1) Since α, β, γ are of type 2, the assumption means that
(2.4)

(β, α) = (γ, α) = (δ, α) = −1

by (2.3). Recall that type 2 elements are of the form ±e∗i ± e∗j . Write α = ae∗i − be∗j with
a, b ∈ {±1}. Then (2.4) implies that two of β, γ, δ, say β and γ, must be of the form
be∗j + ce∗k and be∗j + de∗ℓ for some k, ℓ 6= i and c, d ∈ {±1}. If k 6= ℓ, then aβ,γ = (β, γ) = 1
but aβ,γ ≤ 0 because β and γ are simple roots. This shows that k = ℓ, proving that β and
γ are conjugate.
(2) The assumption aβ,λ = −1 implies (β, λ) < 0. Moreover, (γ, λ) ≤ 0 since γ and λ are
simple roots. On the other hand, since β and γ are conjugate, we may assume β = be∗j +ce∗k
and γ = be∗j − ce∗k for some j 6= k and b, c ∈ {±1}. These show that λ must be of the form

−be∗j + de∗ℓ for some ℓ 6= j, k and d ∈ {±1}, and hence aγ,λ = (γ, λ) = −1.
The following is our main result in this section.

Theorem 2.6. Let Φ be an irreducible subsystem of R(V ) of rank ≥ 2. Then Φ is of type
A, B or D. More precisely, we have
(1) Φ is of type B ⇐⇒ Φ contains a simple root of type 1,
(2) Φ is of type D ⇐⇒ any simple root in Φ is of type 2 and Φ contains conjugate
simple roots,
(3) Φ is of type A ⇐⇒ any simple root in Φ is of type 2 and Φ does not contain
conjugate simple roots,
where rank Φ ≥ 4 when we say Φ is of type D in (2) above.
Proof. By (2.2), a root of type√1 is a short root while a root of type 2 is a long root, and
the ratio of their length is 1 : 2 so that Φ is not of type G2 .
Suppose that Φ contains a simple root of type 1 (short root). If Φ contains two simple
roots α, β of type 1, then aβ,α = 2(β, α) = 0. The reason is as follows. Since α and β are

6

S. KUROKI AND M. MASUDA

of type 1, α = ±e∗i and β = ±e∗j for some i and j, and since α and β are simple roots,
they are linearly independent; so i 6= j and hence (α, β) = 0. Therefore Φ must contain
a simple root of type 2 (a long root) and any two short simple roots are not joined in the
Dynkin diagram of Φ. Such Φ is of type B.
By the above argument, we may assume that every simple root in Φ is of type 2 in the
sequel. Therefore, all simple roots of Φ have the same length and such Φ must be of type
A, D or E. We shall prove that type E does not occur.
Suppose that Φ is of type E. Then the Dynkin diagram of Φ has a vertex connected to
three other vertices and this means that Φ contains simple roots α, β, γ, δ which satisfy the
assumption in Lemma 2.5 (1). Therefore, there is a conjugate pair in β, γ, δ and we may
assume that β and γ are conjugate. Since the Dynkin diagram of Φ is of type E, either β
or γ, say β, is joined to some other simple root λ in Φ so that aβ,λ = −1. Then aγ,λ = −1
by Lemma 2.5 (2) . This means that γ and λ are joined in the Dynkin diagram of Φ but
this does not occur in the Dynkin diagram of type E. Hence, Φ is not of type E.
In the sequel, Φ is of type A or D. We note that −1 does not appear more than twice in
any row of the Cartan matrix of type A and that −1 appears three times in some row of
the Cartan matrix of type D (see [7, p.59]). Therefore, if Φ is of type D, then Φ contains
conjugate simple roots by Lemma 2.5 (1).
Conversely, suppose that Φ contains conjugate simple roots and rank Φ ≥ 4. Let β and
γ be conjugate simple roots. Let λ to be a simple root joined to β. Then since aβ,λ = −1,
aγ,λ = −1 by Lemma 2.5 (2). This means that λ is also joined to γ. But this does not
occur in the Dynkin diagram of type A since rank Φ ≥ 4, thus Φ is of type D.

If β and γ in R(V ) are conjugate, then (β ± γ)/2 are in R(V ) and of type 1. Therefore,
the following follows from Theorem 2.6.
Corollary 2.7. Any irreducible factor of R(V ) is of type A or B. If there is no element of
type 1 in R(V ), then any irreducible factor of R(V ) is of type A.
We conclude this section with a remark. The dual of the root system R(V ) is given by
2α
R∨ (V ) := {α∨ :=
| α ∈ R(V )}
(α, α)
(see [7, p. 43]) and it is again a root system. We note that
(1) if α is of type 1, then |hα∨ , vi i| = 2 for some i and hα∨, vk i = 0 for k 6= i,
(2) if α is of type 2, then |hα∨ , vi i| = |hα∨ , vj i| = 1 for some i, j and hα∨ , vk i = 0 for
k 6= i, j.
Since the dual of an irreducible root system of type A (resp. type B) is of type A (resp.
type C), any irreducible factor of R∨ (V ) is of type A or C by Corollary 2.7.
3. Torus manifolds
A torus manifold M is a closed orientable smooth 2n-dimensional manifold with a smooth
effective action of a compact torus T of dimension n having a fixed point. A closed
codimension 2 submanifold of M is called a characteristic submanifold of M if it is fixed

pointwise under some circle subgroup of T and has a T -fixed point. There are only finitely
many T -fixed points and characteristic submanifolds in M. We denote the characteristic
submanifolds of M by Mi ’s (i ∈ [m] = {1, . . . , m}). Since M is assumed to be orientable
and Mi is fixed pointwise under some circle subgroup, Mi is also orientable. We choose
and fix an omniorientation on M, which is an orientation on M and on each Mi .
3.1. Subfamilies of torus manifolds. A toric variety X (over the complex numbers C)
is a normal algebraic variety of complex dimension n with an algebraic action of (C∗ )n
having an open dense orbit, where C∗ = C\{0}. A toric variety is not necessarily compact
and may have a singularity. A compact smooth (in other words, complete non-singular)
toric variety is often called a toric manifold. A typical example of toric manifold is CP n
with a standard action of (C∗ )n . The (C∗ )n -action on a toric manifold has a finitely many
fixed points and a toric manifold with the restricted action of the compact torus T is a
torus manifold.
A topological toric manifold introduced in [8] is a topological analog of a toric manifold. It
is a closed smooth manifold M of dimension 2n with a smooth effective action of (C∗ )n such
that it has an open dense orbit and M is covered by finitely many invariant open subsets
each equivariantly diffeomorphic to a faithful smooth representation space of (C∗ )n . One
can see that a toric manifold is a topological toric manifold and the family of topological
toric manifolds is much wider than that of toric manifolds. Similarly to the toric case,
a topological toric manifold with the restricted action of the compact torus T is a torus
manifold.
There is another topological analog of a toric manifold, now called a quasitoric manifold,
which was introduced by Davis-Januszkiewicz ([2]). The T -action on a torus manifold M is
called locally standard if any point of M has an invariant open neighborhood equivariantly
diffeomorphic to an invariant open set of a faithful T -representation space of real dimension
2n. If the T -action on M is locally standard, then the orbit space M/T is a manifold with
corners. A quasitoric manifold is a locally standard torus manifold whose orbit space is a
simple polytope of dimension n. It is not difficult to see that there are many quasitoric
manifolds which do not arise from toric manifolds ([2]) while it has been shown by Suyama
[19] recently that there are many toric manifolds which are not quasitoric. However, the
family of topological toric manifolds contains both the family of toric manifolds and the
family of quasitoric manifolds ([8]).
The cohomology rings of topological manifolds are generated by degree two elements ([8,
Proposition 8.3]). So, the sphere S 2n with a standard action of T is not topological toric
when n ≥ 2 while it is a torus manifold (also see [14]). It is easy to see that there are many
torus manifolds which have non-vanishing odd degree cohomology groups (see [8, Section
11] for example), so the family of torus manifolds is much wider than that of topological
toric manifolds.
3.2. Equivariant cohomology. The equivariant cohomology of a torus manifold M fits
well to the study of M. It is defined to be
HT∗ (M) := H ∗ (ET ×T M)

8

S. KUROKI AND M. MASUDA

where ET → BT is the universal principal T -bundle and ET ×T M is the orbit space of
ET × M by the T -action given by (e, p) → (et−1 , tp) for (e, p) ∈ ET × M and t ∈ T . Let
S = H >0 (BT ) and
ĤT∗ (M) := HT∗ (M)/S-torsion.
If H odd (M) = 0 (this is the case when M is a toric or quasitoric manifold), then HT∗ (M)
has no S-torsion and ĤT∗ (M) = HT∗ (M).
We denote the equivariant Poincaré dual of Mi by τi . It is an element of HT2 (M) but
we also regard it as an element of ĤT2 (M). The ring ĤT∗ (M) also has a structure of an
H ∗ (BT )-algebra, via the projection map π : ET ×T M → BT . Since H ∗ (BT ) is generated
by H 2 (BT ) as a ring, the algebra structure over H ∗ (BT ) is determined by the image of
u ∈ H 2 (BT ) by π ∗ : H ∗ (BT ) → ĤT∗ (M) and it is described as follows.
Lemma 3.1 (Lemma 1.5 in [15]). To each i ∈ [m], there is a unique element vi ∈ H2 (BT )
such that
m
X
∗
(3.1)
π (u) =
hu, vi iτi in ĤT2 (M) for any u ∈ H 2(BT )
i=1

where h , i denotes the natural pairing between cohomology and homology.
If we change the omniorientation on M, then τi may become −τi and hence vi may
become −vi ; so ±vi is independent of the choice of an omniorientation. Note that there
are exactly n characteristic submanifolds meeting at each T -fixed point in M.
Lemma 3.2 (Lemma 1.7 in [15]). Let p be a T -fixed point of a torus manifold M and let
I(p) be the subset of [m] consisting of the subscripts of the n characteristic submanifolds
meeting at p. Then {vi }i∈I(p) is a basis of H2 (BT ). In particular, each vi is primitive and
{vi }m
i=1 spans H2 (BT ).
We shall explain that each vi has a nice geometrical meaning. As is well-known, there
is a canonical isomorphism
(3.2)

H2 (BT ) ∼
= Hom(S 1 , T ),

where S 1 denotes the unit circle of the complex numbers C. For v ∈ H2 (BT ), we denote
by λv ∈ Hom(S 1 , T ) the element corresponding to v through the isomorphism (3.2). The
omniorientation on M induces an orientation on the normal bundle νi of Mi so that νi
can be regarded as a complex line bundle because νi is of real dimension 2. With this
understood, one can see that the element vi has the following two properties (see (1.8) and
Lemma 1.10 in [15]):
(P1) λvi (S 1 ) is the circle subgroup of T which fixes Mi pointwise,
(P2) the differential of λvi (z) for z ∈ S 1 (⊂ C) acts on νi as complex multiplication by z.

There are two primitive elements which satisfy (P1), and (P2) determines one of them; so
(P1) and (P2) characterize vi .

Definition 3.3. Let M be a torus manifold with an omniorientation and let vi (i =
1, . . . , m) be the elements of H2 (BT ) defined above. Then the root system R(M)(⊂
H 2 (BT )) of M is defined to be R({vi }m
i=1 ). Note that R(M) is independent of the choice
of the omniorientation on M because so is ±vi .
Here are two examples of R(M) corresponding to Example 2.2 in Section 2.
Example 3.4. (1) Take M = S 2n (regarded as the unit sphere of Cn ⊕ R) with the T action given by (z1 , . . . , zn , y) → (g1 z1 , . . . , gn zn , y) where (g1 , . . . , gn ) ∈ (S 1 )n = T . The
characteristic submanifolds are Mi = {zi = 0} for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and the circle subgroup which
fixes Mi pointwise is {(1, . . . , 1, gi , 1 . . . , 1) ∈ T | gi ∈ S 1 } for each i, so that we may think
of {vi }ni=1 as {ei }ni=1 of Zn through an identification of H2 (BT ) = Hom(S 1 , T ) with Zn .
Hence
R(S 2n ) = {±e∗i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ±e∗i ± e∗j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}
where ±e∗i are of type 1 while ±e∗i ± e∗j are of type 2 as remarked in Example 2.2.
(2) Take M = CP n with the T -action given by [z1 , . . . , zn , zn+1 ] → [g1 z1 , . . . , gn zn , zn+1 ].
The characteristic submanifolds are Mi = {zi = 0} for 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1 and the circle
subgroup which fixes Mi pointwise is {(1, . . . , 1, gi , 1 . . . , 1) ∈ T | gi ∈ S 1 } for 1 ≤ i ≤ n
and the diagonal subgroup
T for i = n + 1, so that we may think of {vi }n+1
i=1 as vi = ei
Pof
n
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and vn+1 = i=1 ei through an identification of H2 (BT ) = Hom(S 1 , T ) with
Zn . Hence
R(CP n ) = {±e∗i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ±(e∗i − e∗j ) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}
where any element in R(CP n ) is of type 2 as remarked in Example 2.2.

The following lemma gives a necessary condition for R(M) to have an element of type 1
or of type 2.
Lemma 3.5. Let α be an element of R(M). If α ∈ R(M) is of type 1, then MiT = M T
for some i, and if α ∈ R(M) is of type 2, then MiT ∪ MjT = M T for some distinct i and j,
where X T denotes the T -fixed point set in X.
Proof. If α ∈ R(M) is of type 1, then π ∗ (α) = ±τi by (3.1). The restriction map HT∗ (M) →
L
∗
∗
∗
∗
p∈M T HT (p) sends π (α) to α in each component (note HT (p) = H (BT )), in particular,
non-zero in each component. On the other hand, τi restricts to 0 in HT∗ (p) if p ∈
/ MiT .
T
T
Therefore, Mi = M .
Similarly, if α ∈ R(M) is of type 2, then π ∗ (α) = ±τi ± τj by (3.1), and this implies that
MiT ∪ MjT = M T by the same argument as above.

If a torus manifold M is S 2n (n ≥ 2) with the standard T -action or a product of S 2k
(k ≥ 2) and any torus manifold of dimension 2(n − k), then MiT = M T for some i while
if H ∗ (M) is generated by H 2 (M) as a ring, then MiT 6= M T for any i (see [17]). The
latter condition is satisfied when M is a topological toric manifold (in particular, a toric
manifold or a quasitoric manifold). Therefore, the following follows from Corollary 2.7 and
Lemma 3.5.

Corollary 3.6. If H ∗ (M) is generated by H 2 (M) as a ring, then any irreducible subsystem
of R(M) is of type A.
Here is an example of R(M) corresponding to Example 2.3.
Example 3.7. Suppose that a torus manifold M is 4-dimensional. Since a characteristic
submanifold is of codimension two, orientable and is assumed to have a T -fixed point,
every characteristic submanifold of our M must be a 2-sphere and have two T -fixed points.
Therefore, Lemma 3.5 tells us that R(M) has no element of type 1 (resp. type 2) unless
|M T | is 2 (resp. 2, 3, 4), and R(M) is empty if |M T | ≥ 5, where |M T | denotes the cardinality
of M T .
Remark 3.8. For some class of manifolds with nice torus actions such as flag manifolds
and toric hyperKähler manifolds (also manifolds treated in [11], [13]), one could define root
systems similarly to Definition 3.3.
3.3. Weakly equivariant diffeomorphisms. We will show in the next section that if
the T -action on a torus manifold M extends to an effective smooth action of a connected
compact Lie group G, then the root system of G is a subsystem of the root system R(M)
of M. In this subsection, we prepare some necessary results to prove the fact.
Let Aut(T ) denote the group of automorphisms of T . A diffeomorphism g of a torus
manifold M is said to be weakly equivariant if g(tp) = ρ(t)g(p) for t ∈ T and p ∈ M
with some ρ ∈ Aut(T ), and in this case we often say that g is ρ-equivariant. Note that
g is weakly equivariant if and only if g is in the normalizer of T in the group Diff(M) of
diffeomorphisms of M.
Lemma 3.9. If g ∈ Diff(M) is ρ-equivariant, then g permutes the characteristic submanifolds Mi ’s, i.e., there is a permutation σ on [m] such that g(Mi ) = Mσ(i) for any
i ∈ [m]. Moreover, ρ∗ (vi ) = ǫi vσ(i) with some ǫi ∈ {±1} for any i ∈ [m], where ρ∗ is an
automorphism of H2 (BT ) induced from ρ.
Proof. Since Mi is fixed pointwise by the circle subgroup λvi (S 1 ) and g is ρ-equivariant,
g(Mi ) is fixed pointwise by a circle subgroup ρ(λvi (S 1 )) which is λρ∗ (vi ) (S 1 ). This shows
that g(Mi ) = Mj for some j and ρ∗ (vi ) = vj up to sign, proving the lemma.

Since ρ induces a ρ-equivariant homeomorphism Eρ of ET (with right T -action), a homeomorphism of ET × M sending (e, p) to (Eρ (e), g(p)) is ρ-equivariant so that it descends
to a homeomorphism of ET ×T M and induces a graded ring automorphism g ∗ of HT∗ (M).
The differential dg of g maps νi to νσ(i) and it follows from Lemma 3.9 and the definition
of τi ’s that
(3.3)

g ∗ (τσ(i) ) = ǫi τi .

Note that ǫi = 1 if and only if dg preserves the orientations on νi and νσ(i) induced from
the omniorientation on M.
The following lemma, which is essentially due to Wiemeler [21], will play a key role in
our argument.

ROOT SYSTEMS AND SYMMETRIES OF TORUS MANIFOLDS

11

Lemma 3.10 (Lemma 2.1 in [21]). If the ρ-equivariant diffeomorphism g of a torus manifold M is in the identity component of Diff(M) and ρ∗ is a reflection on H 2 (BT ), then
the permutation σ in Lemma 3.9 satisfies either of the following:
(1) σ is the identity, ǫi = −1 for some i and ǫj = 1 for j 6= i,
(2) σ permutes two elements, say i and j, fixes the others, ǫi = ǫj and ǫk = 1 for
k 6= i, j.
Moreover, if g preserves the omniorientation on M (this is the case when G preserves a
stable complex structure on M discussed in Section 5), then (1) above does not occur by
the remark after (3.3).
Proof. We shall reproduce the proof in [21] with some modification for the reader’s convenience.
First we will treat the important case where H odd (M) = 0. In this case, it is proved in
[15] that HT2 (M) is freely generated by τi ’s over Z and the following is exact:
(3.4)

π∗

ι∗

0 → H 2 (BT ) −→ HT2 (M) −→ H 2 (M)

where ι : M → ET ×T M is an inclusion of the fiber. Note that g ∗ = ρ∗ on H 2 (BT ),
which follows from the definition of g ∗ on HT∗ (M) mentioned after the proof of Lemma 3.9.
Moreover, ρ∗ is a reflection on H 2 (BT ) by assumption and g ∗ is the identity on H 2 (M)
because g is assumed to be in the identity component of Diff(M). It follows from the
exactness of (3.4) that we have
trace(g ∗ , HT2 (M)) = trace(ρ∗ , H 2 (BT )) + trace(g ∗, ι∗ (HT2 (M)))
(3.5)

= rankZ H 2 (BT ) − 2 + rankZ ι∗ (HT2 (M))

= rankZ HT2 (M) − 2.

Since HT2 (M) is freely generated by τi ’s over Z, the identity (3.5) together with (3.3) implies
that either (1) or (2) in the lemma must occur.
For a general torus manifold M, the argument above up to (3.5) still holds but HT2 (M)
may not be freely generated by τi ’s. Remember that S = H >0 (BT ) and ĤT∗ (M) =
HT∗ (M)/S-torsion. Since the subring H ∗ (BT ) of HT∗ (M) is S-torsion free, we have
H 2 (BT ) ∩ (S-torsion in HT2 (M)) = {0}.

Therefore, it follows from the exactness of (3.4) that the S-torsion in HT2 (M) injects to
H 2 (M) by ι∗ . Since g ∗ is the identity on H 2 (M), this shows that g ∗ is also the identity on
the S-torsion. Therefore, it follows from (3.5) that we have
(3.6)

trace(g ∗ , ĤT2 (M)) = trace(g ∗ , HT2 (M)) − rankZ (S-torsion in HT2 (M))

= rankZ HT2 (M) − 2 − rankZ (S-torsion in HT2 (M))
= rankZ ĤT2 (M) − 2.

Since Ĥ2T (M) is freely generated by τi ’s over Z ([15, Lemma 3.2]), the identity (3.6) together
with (3.3) implies the lemma.

4. Root systems of extended compact Lie group actions
In this section, we will prove that if a connected compact Lie group G acts on a torus
manifold M extending the T -action, then the root system of G is a subsystem of the root
system R(M) of M (Theorem 4.5). This fact gives an “upper bound” for such G.
We recall a canonical isomorphism
H 2 (BT ) ∼
= Hom(T, S 1 ).
For α ∈ H 2 (BT ), we denote by χα ∈ Hom(T, S 1 ) the element corresponding to α through
the isomorphism.
Definition 4.1. A root of G is a non-zero weight of the adjoint representation of T on
g ⊗ C, where g denotes the Lie algebra of G. We think of a root of G as an element of
H 2 (BT ) (through the above canonical isomorphism) and denote the set of roots of G by
∆(G).
For α ∈ ∆(G), we denote by Tα the identity component of the kernel of χα . Let Gα be the
identity component of the subgroup of G which commutes with Tα . The group NGα (T )/T
is of order two and the automorphism of T defined by t → gtg −1 for g ∈ NGα (T )\T does
not depend on the choice of g, so we may denote it by ρα . It is of order two, its fixed point
set contains the codimension-one subtorus Tα and ρ∗α (α) = −α. We note that ρ∗α is the
Weyl group action associated to α ∈ ∆(G).
Similarly, ρα ∗ is a reflection on H2 (BT ) and we note that
(4.1)

Fix(ρα ∗ ) = H2 (BTα ) = Ker α in H2 (BT )
2

where α ∈ H (BT ) is regarded as an element of Hom(H2 (BT ), Z).
Lemma 4.2. Either of the following holds for α ∈ ∆(G):
(1) There is i ∈ [m] such that α takes a non-zero value on vi and zero on the others.
(2) There are i, j ∈ [m] such that

(4.2)

hα, vi i = −ǫα hα, vj i =
6 0 and hα, vk i = 0 for any k 6= i, j

where ǫα = ±1.
If an element of NGα (T )\T preserves the omniorientation on M (this is the case when G
preserves a stable complex structure on M discussed in Section 5), then (1) above does not
occur and ǫα = 1.
Proof. Let g ∈ NGα (T )\T . We note that g is a ρα -equivariant diffeomorphism of M and is
in the identity component of Diff(M), so that we can apply Lemma 3.10 to our g.
For case (1) of Lemma 3.10, it follows from Lemma 3.9 that there is i ∈ [m] such that
(4.3)

ρα ∗ (vi ) = −vi

and ρα ∗ (vk ) = vk for k 6= i,

and this together with (4.1) shows that (1) in our lemma occurs in this case.
Similarly, for case (2) of Lemma 3.10, it follows from Lemma 3.9 that there are distinct
i and j such that
(4.4)

ρα ∗ (vi ) = ǫi vj ,

ρα ∗ (vj ) = ǫj vi ,

ρα ∗ (vk ) = vk for any k 6= i, j

ROOT SYSTEMS AND SYMMETRIES OF TORUS MANIFOLDS

13

and hα, vk i = 0 for k 6= i, j by (4.1), where since ǫi = ǫj , we denote them by ǫα . Finally,
since ρ∗α (α) = −α, we have
hα, vi i = −hρ∗α (α), vi i = −hα, ρα ∗ (vi )i = −ǫα hα, vj i
proving (2).
The last statement in the lemma follows from the last statement in Lemma 3.10.



We will say that α is of type 1 (resp. of type 2) if (1) (resp. (2)) in Lemma 4.2 occurs.
Following (2.2), we define a positive definite symmetric bilinear form ( , ) on H 2 (BT ) as
follows:
m
X
(4.5)
(α, β) :=
hα, vi ihβ, vi i for α, β ∈ H 2 (BT ).
i=1

Lemma 4.3. Let α, β ∈ ∆(G). Then
(4.6)

ρ∗α (β) = β −

2(β, α)
α.
(α, α)

Proof. Since {vk }m
k=1 spans H2 (BT ), it suffices to check that the both sides at (4.6) evaluated on vk agree for each k ∈ [m].
Suppose that α is of type 1. Then, it follows from (4.3) that
(
−hβ, vi i
if k = i,
hρ∗α (β), vk i = hβ, ρα ∗ (vk )i =
hβ, vk i
if k 6= i,
while since hα, vk i is non-zero only when k = i, the right hand side at (4.6) evaluated on
vk reduces to
(
−hβ, vi i
if k = i,
hβ, vk i − 2hβ, vi i =
hβ, vk i
if k 6= i,
proving (4.6) when α is of type 1. When α is of type 2, the desired result can easily be
checked using (4.2) and (4.4) and we leave the check to the reader.

We note that 2(β, α)/(α, α) in (4.6) is an integer because ρ∗α is the Weyl group action
associated to α. We denote |hα,
p vi i| (= |hα, vj i| when α is of type 2) by Nα , and denote
the length of a root α, that is (α, α), by kαk.

Lemma 4.4. Let α and β be roots in an irreducible factor Φ of ∆(G) and assume α 6= ±β.
Then the following holds.
(1) If both α and β are of type 1, then (α, β) = 0.
(2) If both α and β are of type 2 and (α, β) 6= 0, then Nα = Nβ and kαk = kβk.
(3) Suppose that rank
√ Φ ≥ 3. If α is of type 1 and β is of type 2 and (α, β) 6= 0, then
Nα = Nβ and 2kαk = kβk.

14

S. KUROKI AND M. MASUDA

Proof. (1) It suffices to prove that there is no common vi on which both α and β take nonzero values. If there is such a common vi , then α and β take zero on all the vj ’s different
from vi because they are of type 1, which means that α and β are linearly dependent and
hence α = ±β since they are roots, but it is assumed that α 6= ±β.
(2) Since (α, β) 6= 0 and α 6= ±β, there is only one common vi on which both α and
β take non-zero values. Moreover, since α and β are of type 2, (α, α) = 2hα, vi i2 and
(β, β) = 2hβ, vi i2 by Lemma 4.2. Therefore, we have
2(β, α)
hβ, vi i
=
,
(α, α)
hα, vi i

2(β, α) hα, vi i
=
.
(β, β)
hβ, vi i

2(β, α)
2hβ, vi i
=
,
(α, α)
hα, vi i

2(β, α)
hα, vi i
=
.
(β, β)
hβ, vi i

Since these numbers are integers as remarked above, we have Nα = Nβ and kαk = kβk.
(3) Since α is of type 1, there is a unique vi on which α takes a non-zero value. Moreover,
since (α, β) 6= 0, β also takes a non-zero value on the vi and since β is of type 2, (β, β) =
2hβ, vi i2 by Lemma 4.2. Therefore we have

Since these two numbers are integers, either
√
(a) Nα = Nβ and 2kαk =
√kβk or
(b) Nα = 2Nβ and kαk = 2kβk
must hold.
Let α′ and β ′ be another pair of roots in Φ which are of type 1 and type 2 respectively
and (α′ , β ′ ) 6= 0. Since Φ is irreducible, there is a chain of roots β1 (= β), . . . , βm (= β ′ ) in
Φ such that (βk , βk+1 ) 6= 0 for k = 1, 2, . . . , m − 1. By (1), we may assume that each βk
is of type 2. Then kβ1 k = · · · = kβm k by (2). Therefore, kαk = kα′ k because otherwise
Φ contains roots with three different length which does not occur for an irreducible root
system. This shows that only one of (a) and (b) above occurs for Φ.
We shall prove that (b) does not occur when rank Φ ≥ 3. Suppose that it occurs. Then
Φ must be of type C because an element of type 1 is a long root while an element of type
2 is a short root and long roots are not joined by (1). Let K be a simple Lie subgroup of
G corresponding to Φ and consider the K-orbit Kp of a T -fixed point p. The elements in
Φ are homomorphisms from T to S 1 and let L be the identity component of the kernel of
all those homomorphisms. Then L is a torus of rank n − rank Φ. Since L commutes with
K by construction and p is a T -fixed point (in particular, a L-fixed point), the orbit Kp
is fixed pointwise under the L-action. Therefore, the tangent space τp (Kp) of Kp at p is
fixed under the L-action, i.e.
(4.7)
and moreover
(4.8)

τp (Kp) ⊂ (τp M)L
dim(τp M)L ≤ 2 rank Φ

because the tangential T -representation τp M of M at p is faithful, dim τp M = 2 dim T and
dim L = n − rank Φ. Now we consider two cases.

ROOT SYSTEMS AND SYMMETRIES OF TORUS MANIFOLDS

15

Case 1. The case where Kp = {p}. In this case, the K-representation τp (Kp) is faithful
(because the K-action on M is effective) so that K must be embedded into a special
orthogonal group SO(2ℓ) by (4.7) and (4.8) where ℓ = rank Φ. However, this is impossible
because K is of type C and of rank ℓ.
′
Case 2. The case where Kp 6= {p}. Let L′ be a maximal torus of K. Then τp (Kp)L = 0.
′
Indeed, since L′ and L generate the torus T , if τp (Kp)L 6= 0, then this together with (4.7)
implies that (τp M)T 6= 0 but this contradicts the effectiveness of the T -action on M. The
′
fact τp (Kp)L = 0 implies that dim Kp ≥ 2 dim L′ = 2ℓ while dim Kp ≤ 2ℓ by (4.7) and
(4.8). This shows that Kp is a torus manifold. Since Kp is a homogeneous space, the
classification result in [10] for homogeneous torus manifolds shows that K is not of type
C. Thus, case (b) does not occur when rank Φ ≥ 3.

Note that ∆(G) lies in H 2 (BT ) and the irreducible factors of ∆(G) are mutually perpendicular, i.e. if Φ and Φ′ are distinct irreducible factors of ∆(G), then (γ, γ ′ ) = 0 for
any γ ∈ Φ and γ ′ ∈ Φ′ . By Lemma 4.4, if Φ is an irreducible factor of ∆(G), then Nγ is
independent of γ ∈ Φ unless Φ is of rank two and (b) in the proof of Lemma 4.4 occurs
for Φ. When Φ is of rank two and (b) in the proof of Lemma 4.4 occurs for Φ, the dual
of Φ, that is Φ∨ := {α∨ := 2α/(α, α) | α ∈ Φ}, is isomorphic to Φ and Φ∨ satisfies (a) in
the proof of Lemma 4.4, so Nγ is independent of γ ∈ Φ∨ . Therefore, in any case, we may
assume that Nγ is independent of γ ∈ Φ for each irreducible factor Φ of ∆(G). Moreover,
since we are concerned with the isomorphism type of ∆(G) as a root system, we may
assume that Nγ = 1 for any γ ∈ ∆(G) in the sequel. Thus, the following theorem follows
from Lemma 4.3 and the definition of R(M).
Theorem 4.5. If a connected compact Lie group G acts effectively on a torus manifold M
extending the T -action, then the root system ∆(G) of G is a subsystem of the root system
R(M) of M.
An effective action of a compact Lie group G on M can be viewed as a compact Lie
subgroup of Diff(M) and vice versa. Therefore, the following follows from Theorem 4.5.
Corollary 4.6. Let M be a torus manifold and let G be a compact connected Lie subgroup
of Diff(M) containing the torus T . If ∆(G) = R(M), then G is maximal among connected
compact Lie subgroups of Diff(M) containing T .
Remark 4.7. As pointed out by Wiemeler, the equality in Corollary 4.6 cannot be attained in general. For example, take an n-dimensional homology sphere Σ with non-trivial
fundamental group and consider Σ × T , where the T -action on Σ is trivial while that on
the second factor T is the group multiplication. Take also the standard sphere S 2n with
the standard T -action. We choose a free T -orbit from Σ × T and S 2n respectively, remove
their T -invariant open tubular neighborhoods and glue them along their boundaries. The
resulting manifold M is a homology sphere and a torus manifold. The vi ’s for M are the
same as those for S 2n because vi ’s are defined as parametrization of circle subgroups which
fix the characteristic submanifolds and the characteristic submanifolds of M and S 2n are
same. Therefore R(M) = R(S 2n ) and if there is a connected compact Lie subgroup G of

16

S. KUROKI AND M. MASUDA

Diff(M) with ∆(G) = R(M)(= R(S 2n )), then G is a simple Lie group of type A and the
G-action on M must be transitive. Therefore, M must be diffeomorphic to S 2n which is
a contradiction because M is non-simply connected. Therefore, there is no compact Lie
subgroup G of Diff(M) with ∆(G) = R(M).
Here are examples corresponding to Example 3.4.
Example 4.8. (1) Take S 2n with the T -action defined in Example 3.4. The linear action of
SO(2n+1) on S 2n is effective, SO(2n+1) contains the torus T and ∆(SO(2n+1)) = R(S 2n ).
Therefore, SO(2n+1) is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(S 2n ) containing
T by Corollary 4.6.
(2) Take CP n with the T -action defined in Example 3.4. The linear action of U(n+1) on
Cn+1 induces an effective action of PU(n + 1) containing the torus T and ∆(PU(2n + 1)) =
R(CP n ). Therefore, PU(n+1) is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(CP n )
containing T by Corollary 4.6.
5. Stable complex transformations
A T -invariant stable complex structure J on a torus manifold M is a T -invariant complex
structure on τ M ⊕ Rk for some k ≥ 0, where τ M denotes the tangent bundle of M
and Rk denotes the product bundle of rank k over M. Since J is T -invariant and a
characteristic submanifold Mi is fixed pointwise under the circle subgroup vi (S 1 ), where
vi ∈ Hom(S 1 , T ) = H2 (BT ) as before, the quotient bundle of τ M ⊕ Rk restricted to Mi by
the tangent bundle of Mi admits a complex structure induced from J. We give a canonical
orientation on Rk . Therefore, once we fix an orientation on M, J determines an orientation
on each characteristic submanifold Mi . We note that if we change an orientation on M, then
the induced orientation on Mi also changes. Therefore, the elements vi are independent of
the choice of an orientation on M and they are defined without ambiguity of sign.
We denote by (M, J) the torus manifold M with the T -invariant stable complex structure
J and by Diff(M, J) the group of diffeomorphisms of M which preserve J. The following
fact, which we learned from Nigel Ray and thank him, shows that Diff(M, J) is much
smaller than Diff(M).
Proposition 5.1. Diff(M, J) is a Lie group.
Proof. By definition J is a complex structure on τ M ⊕ Rk for some k. Since the tangent
bundle of M̄ := M × (S 1 )k is isomorphic to τ M ⊕ Rk , J defines an almost complex
¯ is a Lie group (see [9, Corollary 4.2 in p.19]). Any
structure J¯ on M̄ , so that Diff(M̄, J)
diffeomorphism of M extends to a diffeomorphism of M̄ by defining the identity on the
¯
added factor (S 1 )k so that Diff(M, J) can be viewed as a closed subgroup of Diff(M̄ , J).
Since any closed subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie group as is well-known, the theorem
follows.

Remember that the elements vi ’s (1 ≤ i ≤ m) in H2 (BT ) for (M, J) are defined without
ambiguity of sign. Moreover, (1) in Lemma 4.2 does not occur in our stable complex case
by the last statement in the lemma. Motivated by this observation, we make the following
definition.

ROOT SYSTEMS AND SYMMETRIES OF TORUS MANIFOLDS

17

Definition 5.2. For (M, J), we define
R(M, J) := {α ∈ H 2 (BT ) | hα, vi i = 1, hα, vj i = −1 for some i 6= j
and hα, vk i = 0 for any k 6= i, j}.

Note that R(M, J) is a subsystem of R(M) and there is no conjugate pair in R(M, J).
Theorem 5.3. Let M be a torus manifold with a T -invariant stable complex structure
J. If a connected compact Lie group G acts effectively on M extending the T -action and
preserving the stable complex structure J, then the root system ∆(G) of G is a subsystem
of R(M, J) and every irreducible factor of ∆(G) is of type A.
Proof. We may assume that any root α ∈ ∆(G) lies in R(M, J) by Lemma 4.2 and ∆(G) is
a subsystem of R(M) by Theorem 4.5, so ∆(G) is a subsystem of R(M, J) and since there
is no conjugate pair in R(M, J), only type A appears as an irreducible factor of ∆(G) by
Theorem 2.6.

Remark 5.4. It is shown in [20, Lemma 5.8] that any irreducible factor of the G in
Theorem 5.3 is of type A.
The following corollary is a stable complex version of Corollary 4.6.
Corollary 5.5. Let M be a torus manifold with a stable complex structure J and let G be a
connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(M, J) containing the torus T . If ∆(G) = R(M, J),
then G is maximal among connected compact Lie subgroups of Diff(M, J) containing T .
Here are two examples of R(M, J) corresponding to Example 4.8 in Section 4.
Example 5.6. (1) Take M = S 2n (⊂ Cn ⊕ R) with the standard T -action defined in
Example 3.4. Since τ S 2n ⊕ R ∼
= Cn ⊕ R, we have
τ S 2n ⊕ R ⊕ R ∼
= Cn+1 .
= Cn ⊕ R ⊕ R ∼

Let J be a stable complex structure defined from this identification. Then one see that
{vi }ni=1 is the standard basis {ei }ni=1 through an identification of H2 (BT ) = Hom(S 1 , T )
with Zn , so that
R(S 2n , J) = {±(e∗i − e∗j ) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}.
This is a root system of type An−1 . Note that R(S 2n , J) is a proper subsystem of R(S 2n ).
The linear action of U(n) on Cn induces an action on S 2n preserving the J and U(n)
contains the torus T and ∆(U(n)) = R(S 2n , J). Therefore, U(n) is a maximal connected
compact Lie subgroup of Diff(S 2n , J) containing T by Corollary 5.5.
(2) Take M = CP n with the T -action defined in Example 3.4 and with the standard
n+1
complex
i ≤ n and vn+1 =
Pn structure Jst . Then one sees that {vi }i=1 as vi1 = ei for 1 ≤
n
− i=1 ei through an identification of H2 (BT ) = Hom(S , T ) with Z . Hence
R(CP n , Jst ) = R(CP n ) = {±e∗i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ±(e∗i − e∗j ) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n)}.

Since the action of PU(n + 1) mentioned in Example 4.8 preserves Jst , PU(n + 1) is also a
maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(CP n , Jst ).

6. Toric manifolds
The complex projective space CP n is a typical example of a complete non-singular toric
variety (which we call a toric manifold ). It turns out that R(X, Jst ) = R(X) for any toric
manifold X with the standard complex structure Jst and that there is a connected compact
Lie group G preserving the Jst such that ∆(G) = R(X, Jst ), which we will discuss in this
section (it is also discussed in [16] from the viewpoint of symplectic category). We also
discuss R(X, J) for an invariant stable complex structure J different from the standard
complex structure Jst . See [5] or [18] for the basics of toric varieties.
6.1. Fan and toric manifold. Let ∆ be a complete non-singular fan of dimension n in
H2 (BT ) ⊗ R = H2 (BT ; R) and let Σ be the underlying simplicial complex of ∆. Let m be
the number of vertices in Σ and let {vi }m
i=1 be the primitive vectors on the one-dimensional
cones in ∆. Since ∆ can be recovered from Σ and {vi }m
i=1 , we may think of ∆ as a pair
m
(Σ, {vi }i=1 ).
Let X(∆) be the toric manifold associated with the complete nonsingular fan ∆ =
(Σ, {vi }m
i=1 ). We shall recall the quotient construction of X(∆). For σ ⊂ [m] we set
[
Lσ := {(z1 , . . . , zm ) ∈ Cm | zi = 0 for i ∈ σ} and Z :=
Lσ .

We define a homomorphism V : (C∗ )m → (C∗ )n by
V(g1 , . . . , gm ) :=

Y

λvi (gi )

i=1

where λvi is a homomorphism from C∗ to (C∗ )n determined by vi . Then
X(∆) = (Cm \Z)/ Ker V.
The standard action of (C∗ )m on Cm induces an action of (C∗ )m / Ker V on X(∆). The
homomorphism V is surjective and identifies (C∗ )m / Ker V with (C∗ )n so that (C∗ )n acts
on X(∆). The toric manifold X(∆) with the restricted action of T = (S 1 )n is a torus
manifold.
The projection (C∗ )m → C∗ on the i-th factor induces a homomorphism ρi : Ker V → C∗ .
Let Li be the complex line bundle over X(∆) associated to ρi , namely the total space of
Li is the orbit space of (Cm \Z) × C by the diagonal action of Ker V (through ρi on C)
and the projection map on X(∆) is the induced one from the projection on the first factor
Cm \Z. Then it is known and not difficult to see that there is a canonical isomorphism

6.2. R(X(∆), Jst) for the standard complex structure Jst . Let Jst be the standard
complex structure on X(∆). For α ∈ R(X(∆), Jst ), there are i, j ∈ [m] such that
α

hα, vi i = 1,

hα, vj i = −1 and hα, vk i = 0 for k 6= i, j.

Ker(χ ◦ V) is a subgroup of (C ) with gi = gj , which we denote by Hα . Obviously
Hα contains Ker V. Let GLα be the (maximal) connected subgroup of GL(m, C) which
commutes with Hα . It is generated by (C∗ )m and linear automorphisms of Cm which fixes
coordinates zk ’s for k 6= i, j.

Lemma 6.1. The action of GLα on Cm leaves Z invariant.

/ Σ. Therefore
Proof. If σ ⊂ σ ′ , then Lσ ⊃ Lσ′ ; so Z is the union of Lσ ’s for minimal σ ∈
it suffices to prove that if σ is minimal among subsets of [m] not contained in Σ, then σ
contains both i and j or contains neither i nor j.
Suppose that σ ∋ i but σ 6∋ j (and we will deduce a contradiction). Since σ is minimal,
σ\{i} ∈ Σ. Let τ be an (n − 1)-simplex in Σ containing σ\{i}. The cone ∠vτ spanned by
vℓ ’s for ℓ ∈ τ is of dimension n. Since σ ∈
/ Σ, we have τ 6∋ i. Then τ ∋ j because otherwise
∠vτ is contained in Ker α and this contradicts the fact that ∠vτ is of dimension n. The
cone ∠vτ \{j} is of dimension n − 1 and contained in Ker α. The cone spanned by ∠vτ \{j}
and vi is not a member of ∆ because otherwise (τ \{j}) ∪ {i} ∈ Σ and since this simplex
contains σ, i.e., σ must be a member of Σ, which gives a contradiction.
The hyperplane Ker α splits H2 (BT ; R) into two (open) half spaces and contains all vk ’s
except vi and vj , so we can say vi -side and vj -side. The fact that the cone spanned by
∠vτ \{j} and vi is not a member of ∆ means that a point of H2 (BT ; R) which is slightly
above the cone ∠vτ \{j} (here “above” means that it is on the vi side) cannot be contained in
any cone of ∆. This contradicts the completeness of ∆. Therefore the claim is proven. 
Set
H :=

Hα

α∈R(X(∆),Jst )

and let GL(∆) be the subgroup of GL(m, C) generated by GLα ’s for α ∈ R(X(∆), Jst ).
The group generated by ρα ∗ ’s acts on the set {vi }m
i=1 (see Section 4) and decomposes it
into a union of orbits. Looking at the induces of vi ’s, this orbit decomposition produces a
partition of [m], say µ1 , . . . , µs . Then
H = {(g1, . . . , gm ) ∈ (C∗ )m | gi = gj when i, j ∈ µr for some r}.

For a subset µ of [m] we denote by GL(µ)
the subgroup of GL(m, C) which fixes coordinates
Q
zk ’s for k ∈
/ µ. Then GL(∆) = sr=1 GL(µr ). The root system of GL(∆) agrees with
R(X(∆), Jst ).
By Lemma 6.1, the action of GL(∆) on Cm leaves Z invariant. Since GL(∆) commutes with H containing Ker V, the action of GL(∆) on Cm \Z descends to an action

of G(∆) := GL(∆)/ Ker V on X(∆) = (Cm \Z)/ Ker V. Therefore a maximal connected
compact Lie subgroup G of G(∆) acts on X(∆) preserving the complex structure Jst .
The root system ∆(G) of G agrees with that of G(∆) and also that of GL(∆). Therefore
∆(G) = R(X(∆), Jst ). Consequently, by Corollary 5.5, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 6.2. Let (X(∆), Jst ) be a toric manifold with the standard complex structure. Then, the G above is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(X(∆), Jst )
containing T .
Remark 6.3. Demazure defines roots associated to the fan ∆ in [4] (also see [18]) and
intoduces a root system which describes the reductive part of Aut(X(∆)). Proposition 6.2
follows from his result.
6.3. R(X(∆), J) for a non-standard stable complex structure J. We may regard the
standard complex structure Jst as the stable complex structure induced from the complex
structure on the right side of (6.1). Each Li has another complex structure which is
complex conjugate to the original one. We denote Li with such a complex structure by
L̄i . We take an integer q between 1L
and m − 1L
and consider the invariant stable complex
structure J on X(∆) induced from qi=1 Li ⊕ m
i=q+1 L̄i through the map (6.1). In terms
m
of C above, we are taking the standard complex structure on the first q factors Cq but the
“anti-complex structure” on the last m − q factors Cm−q . The subset of H2 (BT ) associated
to J is {vi }qi=1 ∪ {−vi }m
i=q+1 .
Claim. There is no α ∈ H 2 (BT ) such that
hα, vi i = 1 for some i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ q,

hα, −vj i = −1,

for some j such that q + 1 ≤ j ≤ m,

hα, vk i = 0 for k 6= i, j.

Proof. If there is such α, then all vℓ ’s sit on the non-negative side of α but this contradicts
the completeness of ∆.

The above claim implies that R(X(∆), J) ⊂ R(X(∆), Jst ). Moreover, if GL(∆)J denotes
the subgroup of GL(m, C) generated by GLα ’s for α ∈ R(X(∆), J), then

GL(∆)J = GL(∆) ∩ GL(q, C) × GL(m − q, C)

so that G(∆)J := GL(∆)J / Ker V is contained in G(∆). The restricted action of G(∆)J on
X(∆) preserves the stable complex structure J. The root system of a maximal connected
compact subgroup GJ of G(∆)J agrees with that of G(∆)J and that of GL(∆)J . Therefore
∆(GJ ) = R(X(∆), J). Consequently, by Corollary 5.5, we get the following generalization
of Proposition 6.2.
Proposition 6.4. Let (X(∆), J) be a toric manifold with the stable complex structure
J. Then, the GJ above is a maximal connected compact Lie subgroup of Diff(X(∆), J)
containing T .

Example 6.5. We take X(∆) = CP 1 . In this case, m = 2 and take q = 1. Then
G(∆)J = (GL(1, C) × GL(1, C))/ GL(1, C) is isomorphic to GL(1, C). Note that our stable
complex structure J on CP 1 is isomorphic to that in Example 5.6 (1) for S 2 . Therefore,
Diff(S 2 , J) is non-compact.
