Abstract
A simple proof has been provided to show that any bounded normal operator on a real Hilbert space is orthogonally equivalent to its transpose(adjoint).
This result and a lemma of Wong [Won69] allow a quick proof of the spectral theorem of real normal operators and lead naturally to some improvisations on the definition of spectral pair for normal operators as propounded
by Goodrich [Goo72]. It also yields a structure theorem for skew-symmetric
operators. These tools are used to prove the main theorem of this article,
which is a generalization of Williamson’s normal form for bounded positive
operators on infinite dimensional separable Hilbert spaces. This has applications in the study of infinite mode Gaussian states.

Introduction

Williamson’s theorem characterizing positive definite real matrices of even order is
fairly well-known and is a very useful result. We begin by stating this theorem,
which we are going to generalize. Let n be a natural number. Suppose A is a
strictly positive (hence invertible) real matrix of order 2n × 2n. Then there exists
a symplectic matrix L of order 2n × 2n and a strictly positive diagonal matrix P of
order n × n, such that



L,
A=L
0 P
where LT denotes the transpose of L. Here the matrix P is uniquely determined up
to permutation and the diagonal entries are known as symplectic eigenvalues of A.
This theorem was first proved by J. Williamson in [Wil36]. It has been extensively used to understand the symplectic geometry and has applications in Harmonic

Analysis and Physics (See [dG11]). In recent years there is somewhat renewed interest in the field ([BJ15],[ISGW17]) in view of its relevance in quantum information
theory and its usefulness to understand symmetries of finite mode quantum Gaussian states [Par13]. We wish to extend some of the results of Parthasarathy [Par13],
to infinite mode Gaussian systems (see [BJS18]) and for the purpose we need a
generalisation of the Williamson’s theorem to separable infinite dimensional Hilbert
spaces. Of course, such a generalization would be of independent interest. Here we
are precisely in the same situation as Böttcher and Pietsch [BP12], namely we are
unable to find any source in literature where such a theorem has been worked out.
The main goal of the present paper is to fill this apparent gap. In the process we
find shortcuts and simplifications of some known results on real normal operators.
In this subject it is necessary to deal with real linear operators on real Hilbert
spaces and their complexifications. We know that non-real eigenvalues of real matrices appear in conjugate pairs. We need appropriate generalization of this result
in infinite dimensions. In Theorem 3.1 we show that every normal operator on a
real Hilbert space is orthogonally equivalent to its adjoint. This result is known
[Vis78], however we have an elementary direct proof of this fact. This is crucial
for our understanding of spectral theorem of real normal operators, for which we
refer to Wong [Won69], Goodrich [Goo72], Viswanath [Vis78], Agrawal and Kulkarni [AK94]. This acts as the main tool for obtaining infinite dimensional version of
Williamson’s theorem. Applications of the theory can be seen in [BJS18].

Preliminary definitions and observations

In this Section, we shall collect the basic definitions and observations relevant to our
work on real Hilbert spaces. Much of the work in this section are similar to what is
seen in [Won69] and [Goo72].
Definition 2.1. Let A be a bounded operator
on


 a real Hilbert space (H, h·, ·i).
Its transpose AT , is defined by hAx, yi = x, AT y , ∀x, y ∈ H. Such an AT exists
uniquely as a bounded operator on H. A is said to be normal if AAT = AT A.
Often we use the term ‘real normal (self-adjoint, positive, invertible) operator ’ for
a normal (self-adjoint, positive, invertible) operator defined on a real Hilbert space.
Following standard notation, for complex linear operators on complex Hilbert spaces
star ( ∗ ) would denote the adjoint.
Definition 2.2. Let H be a real Hilbert space. Then the complexification of H is
the complex Hilbert space H := H + iH := {x + i · y : x ∈ H, y ∈ H} with addition,
complex-scalar product and inner product defined in the obvious way.
For example, if h·, ·i is the inner product on H then the inner product on H is
given by hx1 + i · y1 , x2 + i · y2 iC := hx1 , x2 i + hy1 , y2 i + i (hx1 , y2i − hy1 , x2 i). Also
note that the mapping x 7→ x + i · 0 provides an embedding of H into H as a real
Hilbert space.
Definition 2.3. Let A be a bounded operator on the real Hilbert space H. Define
an operator Â on the complexification H of H by Â(x + iy) = Ax + iAy. Then Â
∗
is well defined, complex linear and bounded, with (Â) (x + iy) = AT x + i · AT y =
2

[
T )(x + iy) and kÂk = kAk. If A is normal then Â is also normal. Â is called
(A
the complexification of A. Define the spectrum of A, denoted by σ(A), to be the
spectrum of Â.
Note that the definition above of spectrum matches with the usual notion of
eigenvalues of a finite dimensional real matrix.
The mapping J : H → H, defined by J (x + i · y) = x − i · y is such that
J (a1 z1 + a2 z2 ) = ā1 J (z1 ) + ā2 J (z2 ), for z1 , z2 ∈ H, a1 , a2 ∈ C. In other words J
is anti-linear. Moreover, J 2 = I, the identity operator on H and hJ z1 , J z2 i =
hz2 , z1 i. We observe that H = {z ∈ H : J z = z} and an operator B on H is the
complexification of some operator on H if and only if BJ = J B.
Definition 2.4. Let A be a bounded normal operator on a real Hilbert space H.
Then a vector x ∈ H is is said to be transpose cyclic for A, if the set {An (AT )m x :
m, n ≥ 0} is total in H. It is said to by cyclic for A, if {An x : n ≥ 0} is total in H.
For the next two sections, H denotes a real Hilbert space, H its complexification,
A denotes a bounded normal operator on H and Â its complexification on H, as
described above.

Symmetry of a real normal operator

Here we prove that any normal operator on a real Hilbert space is orthogonally
equivalent to its transpose (or adjoint). During the preparation of this manuscript
we found that this result has appeared as Corollary 2.7 in Vishwanath [Vis78], but
our proof is different and is very elementary. It just exploits the geometry of real
Hilbert space. Moreover, this result is crucial to understand the spectral theroy of
real normal operators.
Theorem 3.1. Let H be a real Hilbert space and let A ∈ B(H) be a normal operator.
Then there exists an orthogonal transformation U ∈ B(H), such that
UAU T = AT .

(3.1)

Further, U can be chosen such that U T = U.
Proof. Let us assume first that A has a transpose cyclic vector i.e. there exists
x ∈ H such that E := {An (AT )m x : n, m ≥ 0} is total in H. Define U on E by
U(An (AT )m x) = (AT )n Am x, for n, m ≥ 0.

(3.2)

Then for n, m, k, l ≥ 0,
hAn (AT )m x, Ak (AT )l xi = h(AT )k Al An (AT )m x, xi

= hAn (AT )m (AT )k Al x, xi
= h(AT )k Al x, (AT )n Am xi

= h(AT )n Am x, (AT )k Al xi

= hU(An (AT )m x), U(Ak (AT )l x)i,
3

(3.3)

where the second equality follows from normality of A and fourth equality because
real inner product is symmetric. Since U preserves the inner product on a total set
U can be extended as a bounded linear operator on span E = H. Note that the
extended operator also preserves the inner product. We use the same symbol U
for the extended operator also. Thus U is a real orthogonal transformation on H.
Further by using (3.3) note that
hU(Am (AT )n x), Ak (AT )l xi = h(AT )n Am x, (AT )k Al xi = hAm (AT )n x, U(Ak (AT )l x)i.
(3.4)
Therefore,
U T = U.
(3.5)
Also,
UAU T (An (AT )m x) = UAU(An (AT )m x)
= UA((AT )n Am x)
= U(Am+1 (AT )n x)
= (AT )m+1 An x
= AT (An (AT )m x).
Thus (3.1) is satisfied on a total set which in turn proves the required relation on H,
in the special case when A has a transpose cyclic vector. The general case follows
by a familiar application of Zorn’s lemma.
[
T ).
Corollary 3.2. Â is unitarily equivalent to (Â)∗ = (A
Proof. Let U be as in Theorem 3.1, then Û is a unitary which does the job.
Corollary 3.3. For any real normal operator A, σ(A) = σ(AT ) = σ(A) and thus
the spectrum is symmetric about the real axis.
Proof. Immediate from Definition 2.3 and Corollary 3.2
Note that Corollary 3.3 is analogous to the fact that complex eigenvalues of a
real matrix occur in pairs.

The spectral theorem for real normal operators

Let A be a bounded normal operator on a real Hilbert space H. Consider its
complexification Â. By the spectral Rtheorem in the complex case, there exists a
spectral measure Ê, such that Â = λ dÊ(λ). Notice that there is no reason why
σ(Â)

the spectral family Ê(·) consists of complexification of real projections. It is just a
notation for the spectral measure of Â. However the following is true.
Lemma 4.1. [Wong’s lemma, [Won69]] J Ê(e) = Ê(ē)J , for every Borel subset
e ⊆ C, where ē denotes the set of all complex conjugates of elements of e.
4

Proof. Here is a sketch of the proof presented as Lemma 3.1 in [Won69]. For λ ∈
C, ǫ > 0, let F(λ, ǫ) denote the subset {x ∈ H : k(A−λ)n xk ≤ ǫn kxk}. For a Borel set
e ⊆ C, let F(e, ǫ) = ∨ F(λ, ǫ) and F(e) = ∩ F(e, ǫ). We know that F(e) = Ran Ê(e)
ǫ>0

λ∈e

for any compact subset e of C (Section 42 [Hal98]).
Notice that hJ z, wi = hz, −J wi. Therefore J Ê(e)J is a projection for any
Borel subset e of C. Therefore, to prove the lemma it is enough to show that
J Ê(e)J and Ê(ē) have the same range for every Borel set e. To this end first notice
that for λ ∈ C and ǫ > 0, if x ∈ F(λ, ǫ) then J x ∈ F(λ̄, ǫ). From this it follows
that x ∈ F(e) implies J x ∈ F(ē) for any Borel set. Hence we get J F(e) ⊆ F(ē).
Therefore for a compact Borel set e we have J Ê(e)H ⊆ Ê(ē)H. Now by regularity
of the spectral measure if e is a Borel set we have J Ê(e)H ⊆ Ê(ē)H. Therefore we
also have J Ê(ē)H ⊆ Ê(e)H. Applying J on both side we have Ê(ē)H ⊆ J Ê(e)H.
Thus we see that J Ê(e)H = Ê(ē)H. Since H = J H, we get J Ê(e)J H = Ê(ē)H
We use the notation B(D) to denote the Borel σ-algebra of a set D. Let
e ⊆ σ(Â)(same as σ(A)) be any Borel set, define Ê1 (e) := Ê(e)+2 Ê(ē) and Ê2 (e) :=
Ê(e)−Ê(ē)
.
2i

Then

Ê(e) = Ê1 (e) + iÊ2 (e).

(4.1)

By Lemma 4.1, Ê1 (e) and Ê2 (e) both commute with J . Therefore, Ê1 (e) and
Ê2 (e) are complexification of some operators E1 (e) and E2 (e), respectively on H.
E1 (e) is symmetric and E2 (e) is skew symmetric for every Borel set e, because their
complexifications are so. That is,
E1 (ē) = E1 (e);
E2 (ē) = −E2 (e),

(4.2)

for every e ∈ B(C). Also note that by Corollary 3.3 and (4.2) we have E1 (σ(A)) = I
and E2 (σ(A)) = 0
(x,y)

Proposition 4.2. For any fixed x, y ∈ H, define µj (e) := hx, Ej (e)yi , j = 1, 2
(x,y)
for every Borel subset e ⊆ σ(A). Then µj
is a regular Borel (finite valued)
signed measure on σ(A), for j = 1, 2. In particular, since E2 (e) is skew symmetric,
(x,x)
µ2 (e) = hE2 (e)x, xi = 0, ∀x.
(x,y)

(x,y)

Proof. Clearly µ1 and µ2 are real valued functions defined on the Borel subsets
of σ(A). Let e = ∪k ek be a countable disjoint union of Borel sets. By using the
identification of H inside H, (4.1) and properties of the spectral measure Ê, we have
hx, E1 (e)yi + ihx, E2 (e)yi = hx, Ê(e)yiC

(4.3)

= Σk hx, Ê(ek )yiC

= Σk hx, (Ê1 (ek ) + iÊ2 (ek ))yiC
= Σk hx, E1 (ek )yi + iΣk hx, E2 (ek )i.
(x,y)

This proves the countable additivity of µj
going to real and imaginary parts.

, j = 1, 2. Regularity also follows by

(x,x)

Corollary 4.3. µ1

is a positive measure.

Remark 4.4. E1 is a positive operator valued measure (POVM).
For a bounded Borel function f on σ(A), define a bilinear functional φ̂ by
Z
φ̂(z1 , z2 ) := f (λ) dhz1 , Ê(λ)z2 i, ∀z1 , z2 ∈ H.
Then φ̂ is a bounded bilinear functional which provides the usual functional calculus
for Â (proof is easy and can be found in the Theorem 1, Section 37 of [Hal98]).
Theorem 4.5. Let f be a complex valued bounded Borel measurable function defined
on σ(A), then for the values j = 1, 2 there exists a unique bounded operator Aj on
H such that
Z
hx, Aj yi = f (λ) dhx, Ej (λ)yi
(4.4)
R
R
for every pair of vectors x and y. (This is denoted by Aj = f dEj = f (λ) dEj (λ).)

Proof.
Proposition 4.2 and the boundedness of f implies that the integral φj (x, y) =
R
f (λ) dhx, Ej (λ)yi may be formed for every pair of vectors x and y. An easy
computation shows that φj is a bilinear functional. Also, because of 4.3 we have
|φj (x, y)| ≤ |φ̂(x, y)|, ∀x, y ∈ H, j = 1, 2. Therefore, φj is a bounded bilinear functional and so there exists a unique operator Aj (see Section 22, [Hal98]), satisfying
(4.4).
R
R
Corollary 4.6. Im(λ) dE1 (λ) = 0 and Re(λ) dE2(λ) = 0, where Im denotes the
function λ = λ1 + iλ2 7→ λ2 and Re denotes the function λ1 + iλ2 7→ λ1 defined on
σ(A).

Proof. Note that Im(λ̄) = −Im(λ) and Re(λ̄) = Re(λ). Now the result follows from
(4.2).
Let λ = λ1 + iλ2 , be an arbitrary element in σ(A), by going to the definitions
and using the Theorem 4.5, for x ∈ H we have,
Z
A(x) = Â(x) = λ dÊ(λ)(x)
Z
Z
= λ dE1 (λ)(x) + i λ dE2 (λ)(x)
Z
Z
= λ1 dE1 (λ)(x) − λ2 dE2 (λ)(x),

where (4.5) is obtained by using Corollary 4.6 and the fact that there is no ”imaginary” part for elements of H. By considering λ1 as the function r cos θ and λ2 as
r sin θ, we have

where (4.8) is obtained by using the fact that µ2

(e) = hE2 (e)x, xi = 0, ∀e ∈ B(C).

Definition 4.7. Let D be a compact subset of C, which is symmetric about the real
axis. A pair of operator valued functions (E1 , E2 ) defined on the Borel σ-algebra of
D is called a spectral pair if the following holds for every e ∈ B(D),
i) E1 (e) is a bounded symmetric operator and E2 (e) is a bounded skew symmetric
operator.
ii) It satisfies (4.2): E1 (ē) = E1 (e); E2 (ē) = −E2 (e).
iii) If Ê1 (e) and Ê2 (e) denote the complexification of the corresponding operators,
then the operator valued function defined by Ê(e) := Ê1 (e) + iÊ2 (e), is a
spectral measure on H.
Now we obtain the spectral theorem for a real normal operator.
Theorem 4.8. If A is a bounded normal operator on a real Hilbert space H, then
there exists a unique spectral pair (E1 , E2 ) such that (4.6) holds.
Proof. We already proved everything except the uniqueness of the spectral pair.
Suppose (F1 , F2 ) is another spectral pair satisfying
Z
Z
A = r cos θ dF1 − r sin θ dF2 .
(4.9)
Let F̂ (e) = Fˆ1 (e) + iFˆ2 (e), where Fˆ1 (e) and Fˆ2 (e) denotes the complexification of
the corresponding operator. Then a direct computation
of Â(x + i · y) = Ax + i · Ay
R
using (4.9) and Corollary 4.6 proves that Â = λ dF̂ (λ). By uniqueness of spectral
measure in the complex case we have F̂ = Ê this implies F1 = E1 and F2 = E2 .
Observe that if A was originally a self-adjoint operator then E2 = 0 in (4.1) and
we obtain the spectral theorem for a real bounded self adjoint operator exactly the
same as that in complex case. The self adjoint case was already done in [RSN90].
Remark 4.9. For a definition of the spectral pair which is independent of complexification, we refer to [Goo72]. But we find going to the complexification easier.
Further it should be noticed that our Corollary 3.3 which is a consequence of the
fact that a real normal operator orthogonally equivalent to its adjoint enables us to
confine the definition of spectral pair for subsets symmetric to the real axis. Also the
definition of the spectral pair (and proof of Spectral Theorem) has been relatively
simplified and made more operator theoretic in our approach.

Corollary 4.10. If A is a bounded self adjoint operator on a real Hilbert space
RH, then there exists a unique spectral measure E on the real line such that A =
λ dE(λ).
σ(A)
For future reference, let us note that it makes sense to talk about the positive
operators and square root of them in the real field case also.

Definition 4.11. A bounded self adjoint operator A on a real Hilbert space H, is
called a positive operator if σ(A) ⊆ [0, ∞), it is called strictly positive if it is positive
and 0 ∈
/ σ(A).
Corollary 4.12. If A is a positive operator on a real Hilbert space then there exists
a unique positive square root operator for A, i.e. there exists a unique√operator B
such that B 2 = A. We denote the positive square root of A as A1/2 (or A).
R
Proof. Take B = σ(A) λ1/2 dE(λ), where E is the spectral measure associated with
R
A and A = λ dE(λ). The proof is same as that of complex case.

Even though the polar decomposition exists for general bounded linear operators
between real Hilbert spaces, we give the following special case which will be sufficient
for our purpose.
Theorem 4.13. Let H and K be two real Hilbert spaces and A : H → K be an
invertible bounded linear operator, then there exists a unique orthogonal transformation U : H → K such that A = U(AT A)1/2 .
Proof. Similar to the complex situation. For example one can imitate the proof of
Theorem VI.10 in [RS80].

that in the finite dimensional situation a complex eigenvalue is prescribed by a 2dimensional real subspace. A similar scenario happens in the infinite dimensional

case also. We present it here for reader’s convenience as we couldn’t find it in the
literature.
Let µ be a regular Borel measure on the Borel σ-algebra of a compact subset
E ⊆ C, which is symmetric about the real axis. Partition E into a union of three
disjoint sets, E = I ∪ K ∪ K̄ where I = E ∩ R, K = E ∩ H+ , where H+ = {λ ∈
C : Im(λ) > 0}. Let L2 (E) denote the collection of all real valued, square integrable
functions on E, with respect to the measure µ. Then L2 (E) is a real Hilbert space
and L2 (E) = L2 (I) ⊕ L2 (K) ⊕ L2 (K̄). Further, if µ is symmetric about the real axis
i.e. µ(e) = µ(ē), for every Borel set e, then there exists an orthogonal transformation
between L2 (K̄) and L2 (K), which maps f 7→ f¯, where f¯(z) = f (z̄) for all f ∈ L2 (K̄).
Therefore, L2 (E) is orthogonally equivalent to L2 (I) ⊕ L2 (K) ⊕ L2 (K). Considering
this orthogonal equivalence, we will not distinguish between L2 (E) and this direct
sum decomposition in the case where µ is symmetric about the real axis. Define an
operator S on L2 (I) ⊕ L2 (K) ⊕ L2 (K) by


where Mf for a bounded Borel measurable function f denotes the multiplication
operator g 7→ f g, Re(λ), Im(λ) are as in Corollary 4.6, defined on K and λ denotes
the function λ(t) = t, ∀t, on I ⊂ R. Then S is a normal operator and we will prove
that every normal operator is orthogonally equivalent to a direct sum of operators
of this form. We will need the following elementary lemma,
Lemma 4.14. Let µ be a positive regular Borel measure on a compact set E ⊆ C.
Consider the real Hilbert space L2 (E). By abuse of notation, for n, m ≥ 0, let
r n+m cos(n−m)θ denote the function (r, θ) 7→ r n+m cos(n−m)θ and r n+m sin(n−m)θ
denote a function defined similarly. Then the set of functions {r n+m cos(n − m)θ :
n, m ≥ 0} ∪ {r n+m sin(n − m)θ : n, m ≥ 0} is a total set in L2 (E).
Proof. Assume f ∈ L2 (E) is such that hf, r n+m cos(n − m)θi = hf, r n+m sin(n − m)θi
= 0, for n, m ≥ 0. By considering f as an element of the complex Hilbert space
(L2 (µ), h·, ·iC) and by going to polar coordinates, we have hf, z n iC = hf, z̄ m iC = 0, for
all n, m ≥ 0. Similarly by expanding trigonometric identities we have hf, z n z̄ m iC =
0. Therefore, hf, P (z, z̄)iC , for every polynomial P in z and z̄. Now by StoneWeierstrass theorem we have hf, giC = 0, for every continuous function g on E.
This in turn implies that f = 0, the zero element in L2 (E).
Recall from Corollary 3.3 that the spectrum of a bounded real normal operator
is symmetric about the real axis.
Lemma 4.15. Let H be a real Hilbert space and A be a bounded normal operator on
H with σ(A) = E. Assume that A has a transpose cyclic vector. Then there exists
a positive measure µ defined on B(E), with the following properties
i) µ is symmetric about the real axis.
ii) There exists an orthogonal transformation U : H → L2 (E, µ) such that UAU T =
S, where S on L2 (E, µ) is given by (4.10), via the identification described there.

Proof. Define µ = µ1
as in Proposition 4.2. We look at the polar coordinates for

We set out to prove that U is inner product preserving and can be extended as an

that since sin(−θ) = − sin θ and µ is symmetric about the real axis we have

Write k + m = s and l + n = t. Then by using elementary properties of normal

which is now same as the right hand side of 4.13 and thus U is inner product
preserving. Now we will show that U extends as an orthogonal transformation
of H onto L2 (I) ⊕ L2 (K) ⊕ L2 (K). To this end we show that the range of U is

dense.We have U( 21 (An (AT ) +(AT ) Am )) = r n+m ⊕r n+m cos(n−m)θ⊕r n+m cos(n−
m)θ, which is the element corresponding to r n+m cos(n − m)θ ∈ L2 (σ(A)) and

U( 12 (An (AT ) − (AT ) Am )) = r n+m ⊕ r n+m sin(n − m)θ ⊕ −r n+m sin(n − m)θ, which
is the element corresponding to r n+m (sin(n − m)θ ∈ L2 (σ(A)). We already know
from Lemma 4.14 that this collection is total. Thus we have proved that U can
10

be extended uniquely as an orthogonal transformation on H, we use the notation
U for denoting this extended operator also . Further, a direct computation using
trigonometric identities shows that UAU T = S on vectors of the form r n+m ⊕
r n+m cos(n−m)θ⊕r n+m cos(n−m)θ and r n+m ⊕r n+m sin(n−m)θ⊕−r n+m sin(n−m)θ.
This proves the lemma.
Theorem 4.16. Let A be a bounded normal operator on a real Hilbert space H. Then
A is orthogonally equivalent to a countable direct sum of operators of the form (4.10).
( ie. there exists a countable family of compact sets Ei ⊆ C, positive measures µi
symmetric to the real axis, on B(Ei ) and a real orthogonal transformation U : H →
⊕i L2 (Ei , µi ) such that UAU T = ⊕i Si , where Si on L2 (Ei , µi ) is as in (4.10) )
Proof. Use the previous lemma and apply Zorn’s lemma.
Corollary 4.17. If A is a skew symmetric operator on a real Hilbert space H, then
there exists a countable family of compact subsets Fj ⊂ [0, ∞) and positive measures

µj on B(Fj ) and a real orthogonal transformation V : H → ⊕j L2 (µj )

where Mλj : L2 (µj ) → L2 (µj ) is such that f 7→ λf with (λf )(x) = xf (x), ∀x ∈ Fj .

Proof. Since A is skew-symmetric σ(A) is contained in the imaginary axis. Use
Theorem 4.16 to get L2 (Ej ), where Ej subset of the positive imaginary axis. Take
Fj = −iEj . Use the obvious transformation to transfer measure to Fj .
Corollary 4.18. If A is a skew symmetric invertible operator on a real Hilbert space
H, then there exists a real Hilbert space K, a positive invertible operator P on K
and a real orthogonal transformation V : H → K ⊕ K such that

We give two proofs for this result the second proof is very elementary and does
not use the spectral measure.
Proof. (1) If A is invertible then each Mλj in Corollary 4.17 is invertible. So take
P = ⊕j Mλj .
Proof. (2) Assume first that A has a cyclic vector x. Note that if A is skewsymmetric, A2k+1 is skew-symmetric and A2k is symmetric for k ∈ N. Therefore
hA2n x, A2m+1 xi = 0, ∀n, m ≥ 0,

(4.17)

because A2k+1 being skew-symmetric hx, A2k+1 xi = 0 for all k ≥ 0 . Set K =
span{x, A2 x, A4 x, . . . } and N = span{Ax, A3 x, A5 x, . . . }. Then K ⊥ N by (4.17)
and since x is cyclic N = K ⊥ . Therefore, there exists an operator R : K → N such
that

in the direct sum decomposition H = K ⊕ N. Since A(A2n x) = A2n+1 x, R := A|K
maps K onto N, since A is invertible R is an invertible operator. Now we apply
polar decomposition to R. If R = UP then U : K → N√and P : K → K are such
that U is orthogonal (because R is invertible) and P (= RT R) is positive definite
and invertible.
Now we have

If A doesn’t have a cyclic vector then a usual argument using Zorn’s lemma along
with a permutation proves the result.

Williamson’s Normal Form

All the work we have done till now was to obtain the right machinery for a proof
of Williamson’s normal form in the infinite dimensional set up. This was our main
goal. We refer to Parthasarathy [Par13] for an easy proof of this theorem in the
finite dimensional setup.
Definition 5.1. Let H be a real Hilbert space and I be
operator on

 the identity
0 −I
.
H. Define the involution operator J on H ⊕ H by J =
I 0
Definition 5.2. Let H and K be two real Hilbert spaces. A bounded invertible
linear operator Q : H ⊕H → K ⊕K is called a symplectic transformation if QT JQ =
J, where J on left side is the involution operator on K ⊕ K and that on the right
side it is the involution operator on H ⊕ H.
Here is the main Theorem.
Theorem 5.3. Let H be a real Hilbert space and A be a strictly positive invertible
operator on H ⊕ H then there exists a Hilbert space K, a positive invertible operator
P on K and a symplectic transformation L : H ⊕ H → K ⊕ K such that



(5.1)

The decomposition is unique in the sense that if M is any strictly positive invertible operator on a Hilbert space H̃ and L̃ : H ⊕ H → H̃ ⊕ H̃ is a symplectic
transformation such that



(5.2)

then P and M are orthogonally equivalent.
Proof. Define B = A1/2 JA1/2 , where A1/2 is as described in Corollary 4.12 and J is
given by Definition 5.1. Then B is a skew symmetric invertible operator on H ⊕ H.
Hence by Corollary (4.18) there exists a real Hilbert space K, an invertible positive
operator P and a real orthogonal transformation Γ : K ⊕ K → H such that

(5.4)

Then clearly 5.1 is satisfied. A direct computation using 5.3 shows that L is
symplectic, that is LJLT = J, where J on the left side is the involution operator on
H ⊕ H and on the right side is the corresponding involution operator on K ⊕ K.

Now we recall the fact that two similar normal operators are unitarily equivalent

However, we continue with our proof without using this result. To this end, taking

It is true that if A and B are self adjoint operators such that A ⊕ A and B ⊕ B are
orthogonally equivalent then A and B are orthogonally equivalent. We will give a
proof of this as a Lemma below. But if we assume this fact our proof is complete
because we see that for the positive operators P and M, P 2 and M 2 are orthogonally
equivalent. Hence P and M are orthogonally equivalent.
Now we proceed to provide the proof of a lemma we promised. We depend on
Hall [Hal13] for notations and results used below. We write the following in the
framework of complex Hilbert spaces, but as it was observed after Theorem 4.8,
the spectral theory of a self-adjoint operator is identical on both real and complex
Hilbert spaces and hence what we write below works on separable real Hilbert spaces
also.
By the direct integral version of spectral theorem, any bounded self-adjoint operator A on a separable Hilbert space is unitarily equivalent
to the multiplication
R⊕
operator s 7→ xs where xs(λ) := λs(λ), λ ∈ σ(A) on σ(A) Hλ d µ(λ) for some σ-finite
measure µ with a measurable family of Hilbert spaces {Hλ }, satisfying dim(Hλ ) > 0
almost everywhere µ. It is understood that we work with the Borel subsets of the
spectrum σ(A). The function λ 7→ dim(Hλ ) is called the multiplicity function associated with the direct integral representation of A. By Proposition 7.24 from [Hal13],
two bounded self-adjoint operators expressed as direct integrals on their spectrum
are unitarily equivalent if and only if (i) the spectrum are same; (ii) the associated
measures are equivalent in the sense that they are mutually absolutely continuous
and (iii) the multiplicity functions coincide almost everywhere.
Lemma 5.4. Let A, B be self-adjoint operators on separable Hilbert space such that
A ⊕ A and B ⊕ B are unitarily equivalent. Then A and B are unitarily equivalent.
Proof. Let A be unitarily equivalent to the multiplication operator for each section
s, with respect to a measure µ on σ(A) in the direct integral Hilbert space
Z ⊕
Hλ d µ(λ).
σ(A)

Then it can be seen that A ⊕ A is unitarily equivalent to the multiplication operator
on the direct integral
Z
⊕

σ(A)

Kλ d ν(λ),

where Kλ = Hλ ⊕ Hλ , λ ∈ σ(A) and ν = 21 µ. Since A ⊕ A and B ⊕ B are unitarily
equivalent, by the uniqueness of integral representation mentioned above, by comparing spectrum, measures and multiplicity functions it is easy to see that A and B
are unitarily equivalent.
Remark 5.5. We observe that Lemma 5.4 can be proved using standard versions of
Hahn-Hellinger theorem also, for example Theorem 7.6 in [Par12] can also be used.
14

We also note that if we take infinitely many copies of self-adjoint operators A, B and
∞
⊕∞
i=1 A is unitarily equivalent to ⊕i=1 B, does not mean that A and B are unitarily
equivalent. So it is only natural that the multiplicity theory is required in the proof
of last Lemma.
Remark 5.6. Under the situation of Theorem 5.3, in view of the uniqueness part
of the theorem, the spectrum of P , can be defined as the symplectic spectrum of
the positive invertible operator A.
