Abstract. We establish a simple and powerful lemma that provides a criterion for sequences in metric spaces to be Cauchy. Using the lemma, it is
then easily verified that the Picard iterates {T n x}, where T is a contraction
or asymptotic contraction of Meir-Keeler type, are Cauchy sequences. As an
application, new and simple proofs for several known results on the existence
of a fixed point for continuous and asymptotically regular self-maps of complete metric spaces satisfying a contractive condition of Meir-Keeler type are
derived. These results include the remarkable fixed point theorem of Proinov
in [Petko D. Proinov, Fixed point theorems in metric spaces, Nonlinear Anal.
46 (2006) 546–557], the fixed point theorem of Suzuki for asymptotic contractions in [Tomonari Suzuki, A definitive result on asymptotic contractions, J.
Math. Anal. Appl. 335 (2007) 707–715], and others. We also prove some new
fixed point theorems.

1. Introduction
Metric fixed point theory is a very extensive area of analysis with various applications. Many of the most important nonlinear problems of applied mathematics
reduce to finding solutions of nonlinear functional equations which can be formulated in terms of finding the fixed points of a given nonlinear operator of an infinite
dimensional function space X into itself. There is a classical general existence theory of fixed points for mappings satisfying a variety of contractive conditions. The
first basic result is the Banach contraction principle.
Theorem 1.1 (Banach [2]). Let X be a complete metric space and T : X → X be
a strict contraction, that is, there exists α, 0 < α < 1, such that
∀x, y ∈ X,

d(T x, T y) ≤ αd(x, y).

(1.1)

Then T has a unique fixed point z, and T n x → z, for every x ∈ X.
The Banach contraction principle is fundamental in fixed point theory. It has
been extended to some larger classes of contractive mappings by replacing the strict
contractive condition (1.1) by weaker conditions of various types; see, for example,
[4, 17, 30, 9, 3, 29, 8, 15, 10, 6, 13, 31, 11]. A comparative study of some of these
results have been made by Rhoades [28].
There are thousands of theorems which assure the existence of a fixed point of
a self-map T of a complete metric space X. These theorems can be categorized
into different types, [34]. One type, and perhaps the most common one, is called
the Leader-type [20]: the mapping T has a unique fixed point, and the fixed point
can always be found by using Picard iterates {T n x}, beginning with some initial
choice x in X. Most of the theorems belong to Leader-type. For instance, Ćirić
in [10] defined the class of quasi-contractions on a metric space X consisting of all

mappings T for which there exists α, 0 < α < 1, such that d(T x, T y) ≤ αm(x, y),
for every x, y ∈ X, where
m(x, y) = max{d(x, y), d(x, T x), d(y, T y), d(x, T y), d(y, T x)}.
The results presented in [10] show that the condition of quasi-contractivity implies
all conclusions of Banach contraction principle. We remark that Ćirić’s quasicontraction is considered as the most general among contractions listed in [28].
Another interesting generalization of Banach contraction principle was given, in
1969, by Meir and Keeler [24]. They defined weakly uniformly strict contraction
mappings and proved a fixed point theorem that generalized the fixed point theorem
of Boyd and Wong [4] and extended the principle to wider classes of maps than those
covered in [28].
Definiton 1.2. A mapping T on a metric space X is said to be a Meir-Keeler
contraction (or a weakly uniformly strict contraction [24]) if, for every ǫ > 0, there
exists δ > 0 such that
∀ x, y ∈ X,

ǫ ≤ d(x, y) < ǫ + δ =⇒ d(T x, T y) < ǫ.

Theorem 1.3 (Meir and Keeler [24]). Let X be a complete metric space and let
T be a Meir-Keeler contraction on X. Then T has a unique fixed point z, and
T n x → z, for every x ∈ X.
The Meir and Keeler’s generalized version of Banach contraction principle initiated a lot of work in this direction and led to some important contribution in metric
fixed point theory; see, for example, [21, 25, 27, 16, 7]. The following theorem of
Ćirić [11] and Matkowski [19, Theorem 1.5.1] generalizes the above Meir-Keeler
fixed point theorem.
Definiton 1.4. A mapping T on a metric space X is said to be a Ćirić-Matkowski
contraction if d(T x, T y) < d(x, y) for every x, y ∈ X with x 6= y, and, for every
ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
∀x, y ∈ X,

ǫ < d(x, y) < ǫ + δ =⇒ d(T x, T y) ≤ ǫ.

(1.2)

Obviously, the class of Ćirić-Matkowski contractions contains the class of MeirKeeler contractions. As it is mentioned in [16, Proposition 1], it is easy to see that
condition (1.2) in Definition 1.4 can be replaced by the following:
∀ x, y ∈ X,

d(x, y) < ǫ + δ =⇒ d(T x, T y) ≤ ǫ.

Theorem 1.5 (Ćirić [11], Matkowski [19]). Let X be a complete metric space and
let T be a Ćirić-Matkowski contraction on X. Then T has a unique fixed point z,
and T n x → z, for every x ∈ X.
In 1995, Jachymski [16, Theorem 2] replaced the distance function d(x, y) in the
Ćirić-Matkowski theorem by the following:
m(x, y) = max{d(x, y), d(x, T x), d(y, T y), [d(x, T y) + d(y, T x)]/2}.
As in [26], we refer to this result of Jachymski as the Jachymski-Matkowski theorem
because it is equivalent to a result of Matkowski [23, Theorem 1].
In 2006, extending Ćirić’s quasi-contraction to a very general setting, Proinov
[26] obtained the following remarkable fixed point theorem generalizing JachymskiMatkowski theorem.
Definiton 1.6. A self-map T of a metric space X is said to be contractive [12] if
d(T x, T y) < d(x, y), for all x, y ∈ X with x 6= y; it is called asymptotically regular
[5] if d(T n x, T n+1 x) → 0, for each x ∈ X.

Theorem 1.7 (Proinov [26]). Let T be a continuous and asymptotically regular
self-map of a complete metric space X. Fix γ ≥ 0, and define
m(x, y) = d(x, y) + γ[d(x, T x) + d(y, T y)].

(1.3)

Suppose d(T x, T y) < m(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X with x 6= y, and, for any ǫ > 0, there
exists δ > 0 such that m(x, y) < δ + ǫ implies d(T x, T y) ≤ ǫ. Then T has a unique
fixed point z, and the Picard iterates of T converge to z.
After establishing a technical lemma in section 2, we present, in section 3, a fixed
point theorem that generalizes the Proinov’s Theorem 1.7. We shall also discuss
asymptotic contractions of Meir-Keeler type in section 4. The significance of our
results is their simple proofs despite their generality.
Convention. Since we are mainly concerned with Picard iterates {T nx}∞
n=0 of a
given self-map T , it is more convenient to take N0 = N ∪ {0} as the indexing set of
all sequences in this paper.

2. A Technical Lemma
The lemma we present in this section is fundamental in our discussion. It provides a criterion for sequences in metric spaces to be Cauchy. As a result, it can
be easily verified that, if T is a contraction of Meir-Keeler type, then the Picard
iterates of T are Cauchy sequences.
Lemma 2.1. Let {xn } be a sequence in a metric space. If d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0, then
the following condition implies that {xn } is a Cauchy sequence.
• for every ǫ > 0, there exists a sequence {νn } of nonnegative integers such
that, for any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, if lim sup d(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ,
then, for some N ,
d(xpn +νn , xqn +νn ) ≤ ǫ,

(n ≥ N ).

(2.1)

It should be mentioned that the following proof of the lemma actually stems
from the work of Geraghty in [14].
Proof. Assume, towards a contradiction, that {xn } is not a Cauchy sequence. Then,
there exists ǫ > 0 such that
∀k ∈ N, ∃ p, q ≥ k,

d(xp , xq ) > ǫ.

(2.2)

For this ǫ, let {νn } be the sequence of nonnegative integers given by the assumption.
Since d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0, there exist positive integers k1 < k2 < · · · such that
d(xℓ , xℓ+1 ) <

1
,
n(νn + 1)

(ℓ ≥ kn ).

For each kn +νn , by (2.2), there exist integers sn and tn such that tn > sn ≥ kn +νn
and d(xsn , xtn ) > ǫ. We let tn be the smallest such integer so that d(xsn , xtn −1 ) ≤ ǫ.
Take pn = sn − νn and qn = tn − νn . Then qn > pn ≥ kn , and
d(xpn +νn , xqn +νn ) > ǫ and d(xpn +νn , xqn +νn −1 ) ≤ ǫ.
Using triangle inequality, we have, for every n,
d(xpn , xqn ) ≤

νn
νn + 1
+ d(xpn +νn , xqn +νn −1 ) +
.
n(νn + 1)
n(νn + 1)

This implies that lim sup d(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ. Since d(xpn +νn , xqn +νn ) > ǫ, for every n,
we get a contradiction.

Remark. In the above proof of the lemma, if we apply the triangle inequality for
the second time, we get
νn
νn
+ d(xpn , xqn ) +
.
ǫ < d(xpn +νn , xqn +νn ) ≤
n(νn + 1)
n(νn + 1)
This implies that ǫ ≤ lim inf d(xpn , xqn ). Hence we have d(xpn , xqn ) → ǫ.
Using the following theorem, and its successive corollary, we will be able to give
very simple proofs for theorems mentioned in section 1.
Theorem 2.2. Let X be a metric space and let {xn } be a sequence in X. Suppose
m is a nonnegative function on X × X such that, for any two subsequences {xpn }
and {xqn },
(2.3)
lim sup m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ lim sup d(xpn , xqn ).
n→∞

n→∞

If d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0, then the following condition implies that {xn } is Cauchy.
• for every ǫ > 0, there exists a sequence {νn } of nonnegative integers such
that, for any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, if lim sup m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ,
then, for some N ∈ N,
d(xpn +νn , xqn +νn ) ≤ ǫ,

(n ≥ N ).

Proof. Let ǫ > 0 and let {νn } be the sequence of nonnegative integers given by the
assumption. Let {xpn } and {xqn } be two subsequences with lim sup d(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ.
Then lim sup m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ, and thus (2.1) holds. All conditions in Lemma 2.1
are fulfilled and so the sequence is Cauchy.

If {νn } is a constant sequence, e.g. νn = ν for all n, then we get the following
result which is of particular importance.
Corollary 2.3. Suppose the function m satisfies (2.3) and d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0. Then
each of the following conditions implies that {xn } is Cauchy.
(i) for every ǫ > 0 and for any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, if
lim sup m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ, then, for some N ,
d(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ,

(n ≥ N ).

(ii) for every ǫ > 0 and for any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, if
lim sup m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ, then, for some N ,
d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ) ≤ ǫ,

(n ≥ N ).

(iii) for every ǫ > 0, there exists ν ∈ N such that, for any two subsequences {xpn }
and {xqn }, if lim sup m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ, then, for some N ∈ N,
d(xpn +ν , xqn +ν ) ≤ ǫ,

(n ≥ N ).

3. Fixed Point Theorems
In this section, using Theorem 2.2, we present our fixed point theorem.
Lemma 3.1. If {xn } is a sequence in a metric space X and m is a nonnegative
function on X × X, then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) for every ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0 and N ∈ N0 such that
∀p, q ≥ N,

m(xp , xq ) < ǫ + δ =⇒ d(xp+1 , xq+1 ) ≤ ǫ.

(ii) for every ǫ > 0, and for any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, if
lim sup m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ then, for some N ,
d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ) ≤ ǫ,

(n ≥ N ).

(3.1)

Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii): Let ǫ > 0 and assume, for subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, we have
lim sup m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ. There exists, by (i), some δ > 0 and N ∈ N0 such that
(3.1) holds. Take N1 ∈ N0 such that m(xpn , xqn ) < ǫ + δ for n ≥ N1 . Therefore,
we have d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ) ≤ ǫ, for n > max{N, N1 }.
(ii) ⇒ (i): Assume, to get a contradiction, that (i) fails to hold. Then there exist
ǫ > 0 and subsequences {xpn } and {xqn } such that
1
and ǫ < d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ).
n
This contradicts (ii) because lim sup m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ.
m(xpn , xqn ) < ǫ +

Definiton 3.2. Let X be a metric space and let m be a nonnegative function on
X × X. A sequence {xn } in X is said to be m-contractive if it satisfies one (and
hence all) of the conditions in Lemma 3.1.
The following is a direct consequence of Corollary 2.3 and the above lemma.
Theorem 3.3. Let X be a metric space, {xn } be a sequence in X, and m be
a nonnegative function on X × X satisfying (2.3). If {xn } is m-contractive and
d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0, then {xn } is Cauchy.
Corollary 3.4. Let T be a self-map of a metric space X, and m be a nonnegative
function on X × X. Suppose there exists a point x ∈ X such that
(i) for any ǫ > 0, there exist δ > 0 and N ∈ N0 such that
m(T p x, T q x) < δ + ǫ =⇒ d(T p+1 x, T q+1 x) ≤ ǫ,

∀p, q ≥ N,

(3.2)
n

(ii) condition (2.3) holds for any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn } of {T x}.
If d(T n x, T n+1 x) → 0, then {T nx} is a Cauchy sequence.
The requirement that d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0 is essential in Lemma 2.1 and its subsequent results. It can, however, be replaced by other conditions.
Proposition 3.5. Let {xn } be a sequence in a metric space X such that
(
d(xn+1 , xn+2 ) ≤ d(xn , xn+1 ), (n ∈ N0 ),
d(xn+1 , xn+2 ) < d(xn , xn+1 ), (if xn 6= xn+1 ).

(3.3)

If m satisfies (2.3) and {xn } is m-contractive, then d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0 and, hence,
{xn } is Cauchy.
For instance, if T : X → X is contractive then (3.3) holds for xn = T n x.
Proof. If xm = xm+1 , for some m, then xn = xn+1 for all n ≥ m, and there
is nothing to prove. Assume that xn 6= xn+1 for all n. Then d(xn+1 , xn+2 ) <
d(xn , xn+1 ), for every n, and thus d(xn , xn+1 ) ↓ ǫ, for some ǫ ≥ 0. If ǫ > 0, take
pn = n and qn = n + 1 and we have, by (2.3),
lim sup m(xn , xn+1 ) ≤ lim sup d(xn , xn+1 ) = ǫ.
n→∞

n→∞

Therefore, d(xn+1 , xn+2 ) ≤ ǫ for n large. This is a contradiction since ǫ < d(xn , xn+1 )
for all n. So ǫ = 0 and d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0.

We are now in a position to state and prove our fixed point theorem.
Theorem 3.6. Let T be an asymptotically regular self-map of a metric space X,
and m be a nonnegative function on X × X. Suppose
(i) for any ǫ > 0, there exist δ > 0 and N ∈ N0 such that
∀x, y ∈ X,

m(T N x, T N y) < δ + ǫ =⇒ d(T N +1 x, T N +1 y) ≤ ǫ,

(ii) for every x ∈ X, condition (2.3) holds for any two subsequences {xpn } and
{xqn } of the sequence {T n x}.
Then the Picard iterates of T are Cauchy sequences. Moreover, if X is complete,
T is continuous, and d(T n x, T n y) → 0, for all x, y ∈ X, then the Picard iterates
converge to a unique fixed point of T .
Proof. All conditions in Corollary 3.4 are satisfied by every point x in X. Hence
{T n x} is Cauchy, for every x. If X is complete, there is z ∈ X such that T n x → z.
If T is continuous, then T z = z. If d(T n x, T n y) → 0, for every x, y ∈ X, then T
has at most one fixed point.

We remark that, by Corollary 3.4, it is enough to impose condition (3.4) on some
orbit {T n x} as in (3.2) to conclude that {T n x} is Cauchy.
Example 3.7. Let T be a self-map of X, and consider the following functions:
m1 (x, y) = max{d(x, T x), d(y, T y)},

(Bianchini [3])

m2 (x, y) = [d(x, T y) + d(y, T x)]/2,

(Chatterjea [8])

m3 (x, y) = max{d(x, y), d(x, T x), d(y, T y)},

(Maiti and Pal [21])

m4 (x, y) = max{d(x, y), d(x, T x), d(y, T y), d(x, T y), d(y, T x)},

(Ciric [10])

m5 (x, y) = max{d(x, y), d(x, T x), d(y, T y), [d(x, T y) + d(y, T x)]/2},
(Jachymski [16])
m6 (x, y) = d(x, y) + γ[d(x, T x) + d(y, T y)], where γ ≥ 0 is fixed. (Proinov [26])
Choose a point x ∈ X and set xn = T n x, n ∈ N0 . If d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0, then, for
any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, we have

lim sup m1 (xpn , xqn ) = 0,

lim sup mi (xpn , xqn ) = lim sup d(xpn , xqn ), for 3 ≤ i ≤ 6.

n→∞

We now state and prove a generalization of Proinov’s Theorem 1.7. First, a
couple of notations: For a subset E of a metric space X, denote by diam E the
diameter of E. If T is a self-map of X and x ∈ X, for every positive integer s ∈ N,
let Os (x) = {T nx : 0 ≤ n ≤ s}. For positive integers s, t ∈ N and real numbers
α, β ∈ [0, ∞), define a function m on X × X as follows:
m(x, y) = d(x, y) + α diam Os (x) + β diam Ot (y).

(3.5)

Theorem 3.8. Let X be a complete metric space, and T be a continuous and
asymptotically regular self-map of X. Define m by (3.5), and suppose
(i) d(T x, T y) < m(x, y), for every x, y ∈ X with x 6= y,
(ii) for any ǫ > 0, there exist δ > 0 and N ∈ N0 such that
∀x, y ∈ X,

m(T N x, T N y) < δ + ǫ =⇒ d(T N +1 x, T N +1 y) ≤ ǫ.

(3.6)

Then T has a unique fixed point z, and the Picard iterates of T converge to z.
Proof. First, we prove that T has at most one fixed point. If T x = x and T y = y
then Os (x) = {x} and Ot (y) = {y} and thus
m(x, y) = d(x, y) = d(T x, T y).
Condition (i) then implies that x = y.

Now, choose x ∈ X and set xn = T n x, n ∈ N0 . Then d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0 since T is
asymptotically regular. It is easy to see that, for any two subsequences {xpn } and
{xqn }, we have
m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ d(xpn , xqn ) + α

s−1

d(xpn +i , xpn +i+1 ) + β

d(xqn +j , xqn +j+1 ).

Since d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0, we see that (2.3) holds. Hence, by Theorem 3.6, the sequence {T n x} is Cauchy and, since X is complete, it converges to some point z ∈ X.
Since T is continuous, we have T z = z.

We next give an example to show that Theorem 3.8 strictly extends Proinov’s
Theorem 1.7.
Example 3.9. Take ai = i, for 0 ≤ i < 4, let r0 = 0, and rn = 1/n for n ≥ 1, and
set x4n+i = ai + rn . Let
X = {x4n+i : 0 ≤ i < 4, n ≥ 0}.
Then, equipped with the Euclidean metric, X is a complete metric space. Define
a mapping T : X → X by T (xℓ ) = x2ℓ . Define m(x, y) by setting s = t = 1 and
α = β = 1 in (3.5), that is,
m(x, y) = d(x, y) + d(x, T x) + d(y, T y).
(Note that m is also obtained from (1.3) by setting γ = 1.)
First, we show that T satisfies all conditions in Theorem 3.8. Clearly, T is
continuous and, for every xℓ , xν ∈ X, we have
 1

d(T n+2 xℓ , T n+2 xν ) = d(T n x4ℓ , T n x4ν ) =  n+1 − n+1  → 0.

It is a matter of calculation to see that d(T x, T y) < m(x, y), for all x, y ∈ X.
The following shows that T satisfies (3.6) with N = 2:

Next, we show that the following condition (in Proinov’s theorem) is violated:
• for every ǫ > 0, there exist δ > 0 such that
∀x, y ∈ X,

m(x, y) < δ + ǫ =⇒ d(T x, T y) ≤ ǫ.

Take ǫ = a2 − a0 . Let uℓ = x4ℓ and vℓ = x4(ℓ+1)+1 . Then
d(T uℓ , T vℓ ) = |x4(2ℓ) − x4(2ℓ+2)+2 | = a2 − a0 + r2ℓ − r2ℓ+2 > ǫ,
and
m(uℓ , vℓ ) = |uℓ − vℓ | + |uℓ − T uℓ | + |vℓ − T vℓ |
= |x4ℓ − x4(ℓ+1)+1 | + |x4ℓ − x4(2ℓ) | + |x4(ℓ+1)+1 − x4(2ℓ+2)+2 |
= (a1 − a0 + rℓ − rℓ+1 ) + (rℓ − r2ℓ ) + (a2 − a1 + rℓ+1 − r2ℓ+2 )
= a2 − a0 + 2rℓ − r2ℓ − r2ℓ+2 .
If δℓ = 2rℓ − r2ℓ − r2ℓ+2 , we have
ǫ < d(T uℓ , T vℓ ) < m(uℓ , vℓ ) ≤ ǫ + δℓ .
Since δℓ → 0 as ℓ → ∞, we see that T does not satisfy (3.6) for ǫ = a2 − a0 .
We conclude this section by showing that the following theorem of Geraghty [14]
is a special case of our fixe point theorem.

Theorem 3.10 (Geraghty [14]). Let T be a contractive self-map of a complete
metric space X, let x ∈ X, and set xn = T n x, n ∈ N0 . Then {xn } converges to a
unique fixed point of T if and only if, for any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn },
with xpn 6= xqn , condition
d(T xpn , T xqn )
= 1,
d(xpn , xqn )

lim

n→∞

implies d(xpn , xqn ) → 0.
Proposition 3.11. Let {xn } be a sequence in a metric space X such that d(xp+1 , xq+1 ) ≤
d(xp , xq ), for all p, q ∈ N0 . Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) for any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, with xpn 6= xqn , condition
lim

n→∞

d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 )

d(xpn , xqn )

(3.7)

implies d(xpn , xqn ) → 0.
(ii) for every ǫ > 0, for any two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, if
lim sup d(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ then
lim sup d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ) < ǫ.

(3.8)

(iii) for every ǫ > 0, there exist δ > 0, η ∈ (0, ǫ), and N ∈ N0 , such that
∀p, q ≥ N,

d(xp , xq ) < ǫ + δ =⇒ d(xp+1 , xq+1 ) ≤ η.

(3.9)

Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii): Assume that, for two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, we have
lim sup d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ) = lim sup d(xpn , xqn ) > 0.

n→∞

Since d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ) ≤ d(xpn , xqn ) for all n, by passing through subsequences, if
necessary, we can assume that
lim d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ) = lim d(xpn , xqn ) > 0.

n→∞

n→∞

Therefore, we get (3.7). Since d(xpn , xqn ) does not converge to 0, we conclude that
the sequence does not satisfy (i).
(ii) ⇒ (iii): Assume there is ǫ > 0 such that, for every n ∈ N0 , there exist pn
and qn with qn > pn ≥ n such that
d(xpn , xqn ) < ǫ +

n

and ǫ −

≤ d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ).
n

Then
ǫ ≤ lim sup d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ) ≤ lim sup d(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ.
n→∞

n→∞

(iii) ⇒ (i): Assume that, for two subsequences {xpn } and {xqn }, condition (3.7)
holds and also
ǫ = lim sup d(xpn , xqn ) > 0.
n→∞

For this ǫ, by (iii), there exist δ > 0, η ∈ (0, ǫ), and N ∈ N0 , such that (3.9) holds
true. There is N1 > N such that, for n ≥ N1 , we have d(xpn , xqn ) < ǫ + δ and thus
d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ) ≤ η. On the other hand (3.7) implies that, for every r < 1, there
is N2 > N1 such that, for n ≥ N2 ,
rd(xpn , xqn ) ≤ d(xpn +1 , xqn +1 ) ≤ η.
If n → ∞ we get rǫ ≤ η. If r → 1, we get ǫ ≤ η which is absurd.

FIXED POINT THEOREMS FOR MEIR-KEELER TYPE CONTRACTIONS

Now, to see why Theorem 3.10 follows from the results in this section, take a
point x ∈ X and set xn = T n x, n ∈ N0 . If {xn } satisfies the condition in Theorem
3.10, then, by Proposition 3.11, the sequence {xn } is d-contractive (in the sense of
Definition 3.2). On the other hand, T being contractive implies that {xn } satisfies
(3.3). Hence, by Proposition 3.5, we have d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0. Theorem 3.3 now
implies that {xn } is a Cauchy sequence.
4. Asymptotic Contractions of Meir-Keeler Type
In 2003, Kirk [18] introduced the notion of asymptotic contraction on a metric
space, and proved a fixed-point theorem for such contractions (see also [1]). In 2006,
Suzuki [32] introduced the notion of asymptotic contraction of Meir-Keeler type,
and proved a fixed-point theorem for such contractions, which is a generalization of
both Meir and Keeler’s theorem [24] and Kirk’s theorem [18]. A year later, Suzuki
[33] introduced the following notion of asymptotic contractions which is, in some
sense, the final definition of asymptotic contractions (see [33, Theorem 6]).
Definiton 4.1 (Suzuki [33]). A mapping T on a metric space X is said to be an
asymptotic contraction of the final type if
(i) d(T n x, T n y) → 0, for all x, y ∈ X,
(ii) for every x ∈ X and ǫ > 0, there exist δ > 0 and ν ∈ N such that
∀p, q ∈ N,

ǫ < d(T p x, T q x) < ǫ + δ =⇒ d(T p+ν x, T q+ν x) ≤ ǫ.

Then they proved the following result.
Theorem 4.2 (Suzuki [33]). Let X be a metric space and let T be an asymptotic
contraction of the final type on X. Then {T nx}, for every x, is a Cauchy sequence.
We present a short proof of the above theorem using the results in section 2.
But, first, let us make the following definition.
Definiton 4.3. Let T be a mapping on a metric space X, and m a nonnegative
function on X × X. We call T an asymptotic m-contraction if
(i) d(T n x, T n y) → 0, for all x, y ∈ X,
(ii) for every x ∈ X and ǫ > 0, there exist δ > 0, ν ∈ N, and N ∈ N0 such that
∀p, q ≥ N,

m(T p x, T q x) < ǫ + δ =⇒ d(T p+ν x, T q+ν x) ≤ ǫ.

Theorem 4.4. Let T be an asymptotic m-contraction on X. If m satisfies (2.3),
for some x ∈ X, then {T nx} is a Cauchy sequence.
Proof. Let xn = T n x, n ∈ N0 . Then the following are equivalent (the proof is
similar to that of Lemma 3.1 and hence is omitted).
(i) for every ǫ > 0, there exist ν ∈ N, δ > 0 and N ∈ N0 such that
∀ p, q ≥ N,

m(xp , xq ) < ǫ + δ =⇒ d(xp+ν , xq+ν ) ≤ ǫ,

(ii) for every ǫ > 0, there exists ν ∈ N such that, for any two subsequences {xpn }
and {xqn }, if lim sup m(xpn , xqn ) ≤ ǫ, then, for some N ,
d(xpn +ν , xqn +ν ) ≤ ǫ,

(n ≥ N ).

Condition (i) in Definition 4.3 implies that d(xn , xn+1 ) → 0. Now part (iii) of
Corollary 2.3 shows that {xn } is Cauchy.

At first look, because of replacing the distance function d(x, y) with a more general function m(x, y), such as the one defined by (3.5), it may seem that Definition
4.3 and Theorem 4.4 are extensions of Suzuki’s Definition 4.1 and Theorem 4.2,
respectively. However, we have the following result which confirms that Definition
4.1 is the final definition of asymptotic contractions.

Theorem 4.5. Let X be a complete metric space. If T is an asymptotic mcontraction, for some m satisfying (2.3) for all x, then T is an asymptotic contraction of the final type.
Proof. For every x ∈ X, by Theorem 4.4, the sequence {T nx} is Cauchy, and, since
X is complete, there is z ∈ X such that T n x → z. Since d(T n x, T n y) → 0, for
all x, y ∈ X, the point z is unique. Now, Theorem 8 in [33] shows that T is an
asymptotic contraction of the final type.
