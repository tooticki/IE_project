Abstract. We show in Bishop’s constructive mathematics—in particular, using countable choice—
that weak König’s lemma implies the uniform continuity theorem.

In [1] Hannes Diener proved, as part of the programme of reverse constructive mathematics, that
weak König’s lemma
WKL: Every infinite, decidable, binary tree has an infinite path.
implies the uniform continuity theorem
UCT: Every pointwise continuous function f : [0, 1] → R is uniformly continuous.
in Bishop’s constructive mathematics. Diener’s proof relies on several other results in reverse
constructive mathematics; we give a short, direct proof.
Theorem 1. Weak König’s lemma implies the uniform continuity theorem.
The idea of our proof is simple: given a continuous function f : [0, 1] → R and some ε > 0, we use
WKL to focus in on a point where the function exhibits (almost) greatest variation within ε and
then use continuity at that point to find our modulus δ of uniform continuity for ε. Before proving
Theorem 1 we must set up some notation.
For each n > 0 we let Sn = {0, 2−n , . . . , 1 − 2−n , 1} and we write D for the set ∪{Sn : n ∈ ω} of
dyadic rationals. We define a one-one function g from the set 2<ω of finite binary sequences to D
by
|a|−1
X
g(a) =
a(i)2−(i+1)
i=0

and associate x ∈ Sn with the unique finite binary string a of length n such that g(a) = x. The
sum of two finite binary sequences a, b each of length n is the binary sequence a ⊕ b of length 2n
given by

a(n/2)
n is even
a ⊕ b(n) =
b((n − 1)/2) n is odd.
Both g and ⊕ extend to functions on infinite binary sequences and we make no notational distinction
between the functions on finite and infinite sequences. We let π0 , π1 be the left and right inverses
of ⊕ respectively; that is π0 (a ⊕ b) = a and π1 (a ⊕ b) = b for all suitable pairs a, b ∈ 2<ω ∪ 2ω .
For α ∈ 2ω and n ∈ N, ᾱ(n) denotes the unique binary sequence of length n that α extends. The
downward closure of subset A of 2<ω is A ↓= {a ∈ 2<ω : ∃a′ ∈A (a < a′ )}, where a < a′ if a′ extends
a.
For a given function f : [0, 1] → R we define a predicate ϕf on R+ × R+ by
ϕf (ε, δ) ≡ ∃x,y∈[a,b] (|x − y| < δ ∧ |f (x) − f (y)| > ε);
ϕf (ε, δ) holds if we have a witness that δ is not a modulus of uniform continuity for f, ε. Thus to
show that f : [0, 1] → R is uniformly continuous we must, given any ε > 0, find some δ > 0 such

that ϕf (ε, δ) is false. The next lemma shows how we can use WKL to reduce the truth of ϕf (ε, δ)
to whether or not some specific x, y ∈ [0, 1] are witnesses of ϕf (ε, δ).
Lemma 2. WKL ⊢ Let f : [0, 1] → R be pointwise continuous and let δ, ε be positive real numbers.
Then there exist x, y ∈ [a, b] such that if δ is not a modulus of uniform continuity for f , then x, y
witness this:
ϕf (ε, δ) → |x − y| < δ ∧ |f (x) − f (y)| > ε.
Proof. Using countable choice, construct a function γ : D 2 × N → 2 such that
γ(x, y, n) = 0 ⇒ |x − y| > δ − 2−n ∨ |f (x) − f (y)| < ε + 2−n ,
γ(x, y, n) = 1 ⇒ |x − y| < δ ∧ |f (x) − f (y)| > ε;
further we may assume that γ is non-decreasing in the third argument. So if γ(x, y, n) = 1, then
x, y are witnesses of ϕf (ε, δ). Using γ, we can construct an increasing binary sequence (λn )n∈N
such that
λn = 0 ⇒ ∀x,y∈Sn γ(x, y, n) = 0,
λn = 1 ⇒ ∃x,y∈Sn γ(x, y, m) = 1.
Finally we construct a decidable binary tree T as follows. If λn = 0 we let Tn = 2n , and if λn−1 = 1
we set Tn = {σ ∗ 0 : σ ∈ Tn−1 and |σ| = ht(T )}. If λn = 1 − λn−1 , we let x, y be the minimal
elements of Sn such that γ(x, y, n) = 1 and we set Tn = (2n ∪ {x ⊕ y}) ↓—the branch x ⊕ y is the
unique branch of Tn with length ht(Tn ), and it codes the witnesses x, y that δ is not a modulus of
uniform continuity for ε. Then
[
T =
Tn
n∈N

is an infinite decidable tree.
Using WKL we can construct an infinite path α through T . Set x = g(π0 α), y = g(π1 α). Suppose
there exist u, v ∈ [0, 1] such that |u − v| < δ and |f (u) − f (v)| > ε. Since f is pointwise continuous,
there must exist such u, v ∈ D. Hence γ(u, v, n) = 1 for some n ∈ N such that u, v ∈ Sn , so λn = 1.
It now follows from the construction of T that x, y have the desired property.

We recall a result of Hajime Ishihara [2]: WKL is equivalent to the longest path principle
LPP: Let T be a decidable tree. Then there exists α ∈ 2ω such that for all n, if
ᾱ(n) ∈
/ T , then T ⊂ 2<n .
To get a longest path for a decidable tree T apply WKL to the decidable tree
{a ∈ 2<ω : a ∈ T or ∃b∈T (|b| = ht(T ) ∧ a > b)},
where |b| is the length of b and ht(T ) is the height of T .
Here then is our proof of Theorem 1:
Proof. Let f : [0, 1] → R be a pointwise continuous function and fix ε > 0. We define a function
J taking finite binary sequences to subintervals of [0, 1] inductively: J() = [0, 1] and if Ju = [p, q],
then Ju∗0 = [p, (p + q)/2] and Ju∗1 = [(p + q)/2, q]. By repeated application of the lemma, let
xu , yu ∈ Ju be such that
ϕf |Ju (ε, 2−|u| ) → |xu − yu | < 2−|u| ∧ |f (xu ) − f (yu )| > ε/2,
and using countable choice construct a decidable tree T such that
u∈T
u∈
/T

⇒ |f (xu ) − f (yu )| > ε/2 − 2−|u|
⇒ |f (xu ) − f (yu )| < ε/2.

Let α be a longest path of T , and let ξ be the unique element of

Jα(n) .
n∈N

Using the continuity of f at ξ we can find δ > 0 such that |f (x) − f (y)| < ε/2 for all x, y ∈
(ξ − δ, ξ + δ); let n be such that 2−n+1 < max{δ, ε}. If u = α(n) ∈ T , then |xu − yu | < δ and
|f (xu ) − f (yu )| > ε − 2−n > ε/2 contradicting our choice of δ. Hence α(n) ∈
/ T , so T ⊂ 2<n . It
follows from Lemma 2 and the construction of T that for all x, y ∈ [0, 1], if |x − y| < 2−n , then
|f (x) − f (y)| < ε.
