Abstract. For two graphs, G and F , and an integer r ě 2 we write G Ñ pF qr if every
r-coloring of the edges of G results in a monochromatic copy of F . In 1995, the ﬁrst
two authors established a threshold edge probability for the Ramsey property Gpn, pq Ñ
pF qr , where Gpn, pq is a random graph obtained by including each edge of the complete
graph on n vertices, independently, with probability p. The original proof was based on
the regularity lemma of Szemerédi and this led to tower-type dependencies between the
involved parameters. Here, for r “ 2, we provide a self-contained proof of a quantitative
version of the Ramsey threshold theorem with only double exponential dependencies
between the constants. As a corollary we obtain a double exponential upper bound
on the 2-color Folkman numbers. By a diﬀerent proof technique, a similar result was
obtained independently by Conlon and Gowers.

§1. Introduction
For two graphs, G and F , and an integer r ě 2 we write G Ñ pF qr if every r-coloring of

the edges of G results in a monochromatic copy of F . By a copy we mean here a subgraph
` ˘
of G isomorphic to F . Let Gpn, pq be the binomial random graph, where each of n2

possible edges is present, independently, with probability p. In [4] the first two authors
established a threshold edge probability for the Ramsey property Gpn, pq Ñ pF qr .

For a graph F , let vF and eF stand for, respectively, the number of vertices and edges

of F . Assuming eF ě 1, define

Let ∆pF q be the maximum vertex degree in F . Observe that mF “

We now state the main result of [4] in a slightly abridged form.

Theorem 1 ([4]). For every integer r ě 2 and a graph F with ∆pF q ě 2 there exists a
constant CF,r such that if p “ ppnq ě CF,r n´1{mF then

lim PpGpn, pq Ñ pF qr q “ 1.

The original proof of Theorem 1 was based on the regularity lemma of Szemerédi [7] and
this led to tower-type dependencies on the involved parameters. In [5] it was noticed that
for two colors the usage of the regularity lemma could be replaced by a simple Ramseytype argument. Here we follow that thread and for r “ 2 prove a quantitative version of

Theorem 1 with only double exponential dependencies between the constants.

In order to state the result, we first define inductively four parameters indexed by the
number of edges of a k-vertex graph F . For fixed k ě 3 we set

Note that, for r “ 2, Theorem 1 is an immediate corollary of Theorem 2.

Another consequence of Theorem 2 concerns Folkman numbers. Given an integer k ě 3,

the Folkman number f pkq is the smallest integer n for which there exists an n-vertex

graph G such that G Ñ pKk q2 but G Č Kk`1 . In the special case of F “ Kk and r “ 2,
´

2

Theorem 2, with p “ Cpkq n k`1 , provides a lower bound on PpGpn, pq Ñ pKk q2 q. In
2
Section 4, by a standard application of the FKG inequality, we also estimate from below

PpGpn, pq Č Kk`1 q, so that the sum of the two probabililities is strictly greater than 1.

This, after a careful analysis of the involved constants, provides a self-contained derivation
of a double exponential bound for f pkq.
Corollary 3. There exists an absolute constant c ą 0 such that for every k ě 3
f pkq ď 2k

ck2

.

Independently, a similar double exponential bound (with arbitrarily many colors) was
obtained by Conlon and Gowers [1]. The method used in [1] is quite different from ours
and allows for a further generalization to hypergraphs. After Theorem 2 as well as the
result in [1] had been proved, we learned that Nenadov and Steger [3] have found a new
proof of Theorem 1 by means of the celebrated containers’ method. In [6], we used the
ideas from [3] to obtain the bound f pkq ď 2Opk

log kq

which, at least for large k, supersedes

Colorary 3. However, the advantage of our approach here is that the proofs of both

Theorem 2 and Corollary 3, as opposed to those in [6], are self-contained and, in case of
Theorem 2, incorporate the original ideas from [4].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 3 we prove our main result, Theorem 2.
This is preceded by Section 2 collecting preliminary results needed in the main body of
the proof. Section 4 is devoted to a proof of Corollary 3.
§2. Preliminary results
Before we start with the proof of Theorem 2, we need to recall abridged versions of
two useful facts from [2, Lemmas 2.52 and 2.51] (see also [4, 5]), which we formulate as
Propositions 4 and 5 below.
Given a set Γ and a real number p, 0 ď p ď 1, let Γp be the random binomial subset of Γ,

that is, a subset obtained by independently including each element of Γ with probability p.
Further, given an increasing family Q of subsets of a set Γ and an integer h, we denote
by Qh the subfamily of Q consisting of the sets A P Q having the property that all subsets
of A with at least |A| ´ h elements still belong to Q.

Proposition 4. Let 0 ă c ă 1, δ “ c2 {9, Np ě 72{δ 2 “ 23 36 {c4 , and h “ δNp{2. Then
for every increasing family Q of subsets of an N-element set Γ the following holds. If

P Γp1´δqp R Q ď expp´cNpq

then

P pΓp R Qh q ď expp´δ 2 Np{9q .
Proof. We shall apply [2, Lemma 2.52], which is very similar to Proposition 4. Lemma 2.52
from [2] states that if c and δ ą 0 satisfy
δp3 ` logp1{δqq ď c

and
PpΓp1´δqp R Qq ď expp´cNpq
then

To this end we first note that by assumption of Proposition 4 we have δ ă 1{9. Since

where the last inequality follows by our assumption Np ě 72{δ 2 .

such that Γp r E0 contains at most 2λ sets from S.

In the proof of Theorem 2 we will also use an elementary fact about p̺, dq-dense graphs.

For constants ̺ and d with 0 ă d, ̺ ď 1 we call an n-vertex graph Γ p̺, dq-dense if every
induced subgraph on m ě ̺n vertices contains at least dpm2 {2q edges. It follows by an

easy averaging argument that it suffices to check the above inequality only for m “ r̺ns.
Note also that every induced subgraph of a p̺, dq-dense n-vertex graph on at least cn

vertices is p ̺c , dq-dense.

It turns out that for a suitable choice of the parameters, p̺, dq-dense graphs enjoy a

Ramsey-like property. For a two-coloring of (the edges of) Γ we call a sequence of vertices

pv1 , . . . , vℓ q canonical if for each i “ 1, . . . , ℓ ´ 1 all the edges tvi , vj u, for j ą i are of the

same color.

Proposition 6. For every ℓ ě 2 and d P p0, 1q, if n ě 2p4{dqℓ´2 and 0 ă ̺ ď pd{4qℓ´2{2,
then every two-colored n-vertex p̺, dq-dense graph Γ contains at least
ˆ ˙pℓ`1

canonical sequences of length ℓ.
Proof. First, note that as long as ̺ ď 1{2 every p̺, dq-dense graph contains at least n{2

vertices with degrees at least dn{2. Indeed, otherwise a set of m “ rpn ` 1q{2s vertices of

degrees smaller than dn{2 would induce less than mdn{4 ď dpm2 {2q edges, a contradiction.

We prove Proposition 6 by induction on ℓ. For ℓ “ 2, every ordered pair of adjacent
` ˘
vertices is a canonical sequence and there are at least 2d n2 ą fn p2q such pairs if n ě 2.

Assume that the proposition is true for some ℓ ě 2 and consider an n-vertex p̺, dq-dense

graph Γ, where ̺ ď pd{4qℓ´1 {2 and n ě 2p4{dqℓ´1 . As observed above, there is a set U of

at least n{2 vertices with degrees at least dn{2. Fix one vertex u P U and let Mu be a set
of at least dn{4 neighbors of u connected to u by edges of the same color. Let Γu “ ΓrMu s

be the subgraph of Γ induced by the set Mu . Note that Γu has nu ě dn{4 ě 2p4{dqℓ´2

vertices and is p̺u , dq-dense with ̺u ď pd{4qℓ´2 {2. Hence, by the induction assumption,
there are at least

canonical sequences of length ℓ`1 in Γ. This completes the inductive proof of Proposition 6.

Corollary 7. For every k ě 2, every graph F on k vertices, and every d P p0, 1q, if

n ě p4{dq2k and 0 ă ̺ ď pd{4q2k , then every two-colored n-vertex, p̺, dq-dense graph Γ

contains at least γnk monochromatic copies of F , where γ “ d2k 2´5k .

Proof. Every canonical sequence pv1 , . . . , v2k´2 q contains a monochromatic copy of Kk .

Indeed, among the vertices v1 , . . . , v2k´3 , some k´1 have the same color on all the “forward”
edges. Therefore, these vertices together with vertex v2k´2 form a monochromatic copy of
Kk . On the other hand, every such copy is contained in no more than

§3. Proof of Theorem 2

3.1. Preparations and outline. For given n P N, p P p0, 1q, and a k-vertex graph F we

denote by XF the random variable counting the number of copies of F in Gpn, pq. We also
recall that µF “ EXF .

For fixed k ě 3 we prove Theorem 2 by induction on eF . We may assume n ě k, as

for n ă k we have µF “ 0 and there is nothing to prove.

Base case. Let F1 be a graph consisting of one edge and k ´ 2 isolated vertices. Note

that mF1 “ 1{2 (see (2)) and for every two-coloring of the edges of Gpn, pq every copy
of F1 in Gpn, pq is monochromatic. Clearly,

Inductive step. Given a graph G, an edge f of G and a nonedge e, that is an edge of
the complement of G, we denote by G ´ f a graph obtained from G by removing f , and

by G ` f a graph obtained by adding e to G. Let Fi`1 be a graph with i ` 1 ě 2 edges and
maximum degree ∆pFi`1 q ě 2. If i`1 ě 3, then we can remove one edge from Fi`1 in such

a way that the resulting graph Fi still contains at least one vertex of degree at least two,
i.e., ∆pFi q ě 2. If i ` 1 “ 2, the graph Fi`1 “ F2 consists of a path of length two and k ´ 3

isolated vertices and removing any of the two edges results in the graph Fi “ F1 . In either

case, we may fix an edge f P EpFi`1 q such that the graph Fi “ Fi`1 ´ f is k-admissible.
Hence, we can assume that Theorem 2 holds for Fi and for the constants ai , bi , Ci , and ni

inductively defined by (3) and (4).
We have to show that Theorem 2 holds for Fi`1 and constants ai`1 , bi`1 , Ci`1 , and ni`1
given in (4). To this end, let n ě ni`1 and p ě Ci`1 n´1{mFi`1 . We will expose the random
graph Gpn, pq in two independent rounds Gpn, pI q and Gpn, pII q and have
Gpn, pq “ Gpn, pI q Y Gpn, pII q .
For that, we will fix pI and pII as follows. First we fix auxiliary constants1

Outline. At first we consider a two-coloring χ, with colors red and blue, of the edges
of Gpn, pI q (the so-called first round). Owing to the induction assumption (Theorem 2
for Fi ) we note that with high probability the coloring χ yields many monochromatic copies

of Fi . We will say that an unordered pair of vertices e “ tu, vu is χ-rich if Gpn, pI q ` e

possesses “many” (to be defined later) copies of Fi`1 , in which e plays the role of the
edge f and the rest is a monochromatic copy of Fi . Let Γχ be an auxiliary graph of all

χ-rich pairs. We will show that with ‘high’ probability (to be specified later), Γχ is, in
fact, p̺, dq-dense for d and ̺ as in (8) (Claim 8).
1The

proof requires several auxiliary constants which at ﬁrst may appear a bit unmotivated. For

example, we now deﬁne δII , while δI is to be deﬁned only later. Both δ’s will be used in applications of
Proposition 4.

8

VOJTĚCH RÖDL, ANDRZEJ RUCIŃSKI, AND MATHIAS SCHACHT

To this end, note that if the monochromatic copies of Fi were clustered at relatively
few pairs, then we might fall short of proving Claim 8. However, we will show that in
the random graph Gpn, pI q it is unlikely that many copies of Fi share the same pair of

vertices. For that, we will consider the distribution of the graphs T consisting of two

copies of Fi which share the vertices of a missing edge f (and possibly other vertices).
We will show that the number of those copies is of the same order of magnitude as its
expectation (Fact 9), and will also require that this holds with high probability. Such a
sharp concentration result is known to be false, but Proposition 5 asserts that it can be
obtained on the cost of removing a few edges of Gpn, pI q.

The auxiliary graph Γχ is naturally two-colored (by azure and pink), since every χ-rich

pair closes either many blue or many red copies of Fi (or both and then we pick the
color for that edge, azure or blue, arbitrarily). Consequently, Corollary 7 yields many
monochromatic copies of Fi`1 in Γχ and at least half of them are colored, say, pink. That
is, there are many copies of Fi`1 in Γχ such that each of their edges closes many red copies
of Fi in Gpn, pI q under the coloring χ. By Janson’s inequality combined with Proposition 4,

with high probability, many pink copies will be still present in Γχ XGpn, pII q (second round)

even after a fraction of edges is deleted. Thus, we are facing a ‘win-win’ scenario. Namely,
if an extension of χ colors only few pink edges of Γχ X Gpn, pII q red then, by the above,
many copies of Fi`1 in Γχ X Gpn, pII q have to be colored completely blue. Otherwise, many

pink edges of Γχ X Gpn, pII q are red, which, by the definition of a pink edge, results in
many red copies of Fi`1 in Gpn, pq.

Useful estimates. For the verification of several inequalities in the proof, it will be useful
to appeal to the following lower bounds for γ, α, and ̺ in terms of powers of ai and 2.

First round. As outlined above, in the first round we want to show that with high probability the random graph Gpn, pI q has the property that for every two-coloring χ the auxiliary

graph Γχ (defined below) is p̺, dq-dense. For that we set

family of all pairwise non-isomorphic graphs which are unions of two copies of Fi , say

Proof of Claim 8. Let χ be a two-coloring of Gpn, pI q. Fix a set U Ď rns with |U| “ ̺n

(throughout we assume that ̺n is an integer) and consider the random graph Gpn, pI q
induced on U

GpU, pI q :“ Gpn, pI qrUs .
By the induction assumption, if ̺n ě ni and pi ě Ci p̺nq´1{mFi then, with high probability,
there are many monochromatic copies of Fi in GpU, pI q. For technical reasons that will

become clear only later, we want to strengthen the above Ramsey property so that it is
resilient to deletion of a small fraction of edges. For that we apply the induction assumption
to the random graph GpU, p1 ´ δI qpI q, followed by an application of Proposition 4. We

begin by verifying the assumptions of Theorem 2 with respect to Fi and GpU, p1 ´ δI qpI q.

Our goal is to show that, with high probability, any two-coloring χ of GpU, pIq yields

at least dp|U|2 {2q χ-rich edges, and ultimately, by repeating this argument for every set

U Ď rns with ̺n vertices, that Γχ is p̺, dq-dense. The above ‘robust’ Ramsey property

(23) means that after applying Proposition 5 to GpU, pI q the resulting subgraph of GpU, pIq
will still have the Ramsey property with high probability.

Let Y be the random variable counting the number of double creatures in GpU, pI q. It

follows from Fact 9 that

summing up these probabilities over all choices of U Ď rns with |U| “ ̺n. More precisely,

This concludes the analysis of the first round.

Second round. Let B be the conjunction of E and the event that |Gpn, pI q| ď n2 pI . In the

second round we will condition on the event B and sum over all two-colorings χ of Gpn, pI q.

Formally, let A be the (bad) event that there is a two-coloring of the edges of Gpn, pq with
fewer than ai`1 µFi`1 monochromatic copies of Fi`1 . (That is,

A is the Ramsey property

ai`1 µFi`1

Gpn, pq ÝÝÝÝÝÝÑ Fi`1 .) Further, given a two-coloring χ of Gpn, pI q, let Aχ be the event
that there exists an extension of χ to a coloring χ̄ of Gpn, pq yielding altogether fewer than

The edges of Γχ are naturally two-colored according to the majority color among the
monochromatic copies of Fi attached to them. We color an edge of Γχ pink if it closes
at least ℓ{2 red copies of Fi and we color it azure otherwise. Subsequently, we apply
Corollary 7 to Γχ for Fi`1 and d (chosen in (8)). Note that in (8) we chose ̺ to facilitate
such an application. Moreover, the required lower bound on n is equivalent to ̺n ě 1

and this follows from (17). Hence, by Corollary 7 and the choice of γ in (8), we may

assume without loss of generality, that there are at least γnk {2 pink copies of Fi`1 in Γχ .

In particular, all these copies of Fi`1 consist entirely of edges closing each at least ℓ{2
red copies of Fi (from the first round). Let us denote by Fχ the family of these copies
of Fi`1 , and let Γpink
be the subgraph of Γχ containing the pink edges. Since every edge
χ
may belong to at most nk´2 copies of Fi`1 , we have

In order to deduce Corollary 3 from Theorem 2, we first need to estimate the involved

Let x “ 19k 4 , y “ 55k 6 , and set αi “ log ai , i “ 1, . . . , k2 . Recall that a1 “ 21 . The
