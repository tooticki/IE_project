CONTRACTIBLE?
FREDRIC D. ANCEL AND ROBERT D. EDWARDS
Abstract. This paper presents some partial answers to the following question.
Question. If a normal space X is the union of an increasing sequence of open sets
U1 ⊂ U2 ⊂ U3 ⊂ . . . such that each Un contracts to a point in X, must X be
contractible?
The main results of the paper are:
Theorem 1. If a normal space X is the union of a sequence of open subsets {Un }
such that cl(Un ) ⊂ Un+1 and Un contracts to a point in Un+1 for each n ≥ 1, then
X is contractible.
Corollary 2. If a locally compact σ-compact normal space X is the union of an
increasing sequence of open sets U1 ⊂ U2 ⊂ U3 ⊂ . . . such that each Un contracts
to a point in X, then X is contractible.

1. Introduction
In 1935, J. H. C. Whitehead, to illustrate a flaw in his own proposed proof of the
Poincaré Conjecture, constructed a contractible open‡ 3-manifold without boundary
that is not homeomorphic to R3 [7]. Subsequently it was shown that in each dimension n ≥ 3, there exist uncountably many non-homeomorphic contractible open
n-manifolds. (See [5], [1] and [3].) These spaces illustrate the richness of the topology
of manifolds in dimensions greater than 2.
Proofs that a construction yields a contractible open n-manifold that is not homeomorphic to Rn characteristically have two steps. First they establish that the constructed space is contractible. Second they show that it is not homeomorphic to Rn .
While the second step is usually the more interesting and delicate of the two, in this
article we focus on methods used to take the first step.
Typical constructions of contractible open manifolds produce a space X that is
the union of an increasing sequence of open subsets U1 ⊂ U2 ⊂ U3 ⊂ . . . such that
each Un contracts to a point in X. With this information one can justify the contractibility of X in various ways. For instance, if X is a CW complex, then one can
observe that all the homotopy groups of X vanish and use a theorem of J. H. C.
Whitehead (Corollary 24 on page 405 of [6]) to conclude that X is contractible. If a
more elementary justification is sought which avoids assuming that the space X is a

CW complex or appealing to the theorem of Whitehead, then the following theorem
provides an approach.
Theorem 3. If a normal space X is the union of a sequence of open subsets {Un }
and there is a point p0 ∈ U1 such that for each n ≥ 1, cl(Un ) ⊂ Un+1 and Un contracts
to p0 in Un+1 fixing p0 , then X is contractible.
The proof of Theorem 3 is elementary and well known. Observe that Theorem
3 follows immediately from Theorem 1. (Also the first half of the proof of Theorem
1 given below is essentially a proof of Theorem 3. A parenthetical comment in the
proof of Theorem 1 marks the point at which the proof of Theorem 3 is complete.)
Applying Theorem 3 directly to a space X requires some care in the construction of
X to insure that each Un contracts to an initially specified point p0 in Un+1 fixing
the point p0 . The motivation behind this paper is to show that we can weaken the
hypotheses of Theorem 3 to those of Theorem 1 and thereby remove the requirement
that the homotopy contracting Un to a point in Un+1 fixes any particular point. As a
consequence, in the construction of a contractible open manifold, the argument that
the constructed object is contractible becomes easier while still relying on principles
that are valid in a very broad setting (the realm of normal spaces).
We remark that the hypothesis that the homotopy contracting Un to a point in Un+1
fix the point can’t be dropped with impunity because there exist contractible metric
spaces that can’t be contracted to a point fixing that point. The line of Cantor fans
is a simple non-compact example of such a space. This space is the countable union
∪n∈Z Kn in which Kn is the cone in the plane with vertex (n, 0) and base {n + 1} × C
where C is the standard middle-thirds Cantor set in [0, 1]. A more complex compact
example is the Cantor sting ray described in [2]. (A comparable complete description
of the Cantor sting ray can be found in Exercise 7 on pages 18-19 in [4].)
Although the requirement that the contracting homotopies fix a point can’t be
omitted without consequence, it is known that it can be omitted if one is willing to
impose additional conditions on X as in the following result.
Theorem 4. If a normal space X is the union of a sequence of open subsets {Un }
such that for each n ≥ 1, cl(Un ) ⊂ Un+1 and Un contracts to point in Un+1 , then X
is contractible provided that it satisfies the following additional condition.
(∗) There is an open subset V of X that contracts to a point p0 ∈ V in X fixing p0 .
Theorem 4 follows from Theorem 3 and the following lemma.
Lemma 5. If W ⊂ U1 ⊂ U2 are open subsets of a completely regular space X
and if W contracts to a point p0 ∈ W in U1 fixing p0 and U1 contracts to a point in
U2 , then U1 contracts to p0 in U2 fixing p0 .

3

Although the proof of Lemma 5 is known and is similar to the proofs of Theorem 1.4.11 on pages 31 and 32 and Exercise 1.D.4 on page 57 of [6], we follow the
referee’s recommendation that we include a proof.
Proof of Lemma 5. There are homotopies f : W × [0, 1] → U1 and g : U1 × [0, 1] → U2
such that f contracts W to p0 in U1 fixing p0 and g contracts U1 to a point q0 in U2 .
Step 1. There is a map φ : W × ([0, 1]2 ) → U2 with the following properties. For
all (x, (s, t)) ∈ W × ([0, 1]2 ): φ(x, (s, 0)) = g(x, s), φ(x, (0, t)) = x, φ(x, (1, t)) = q0
for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2, φ(x, (1, t)) = g(p0, 2 − 2t) for 1/2 ≤ t ≤ 1 and φ(x, (s, 1)) = f (x, s).
Observe that φ(p0 , (s, 1)) = p0 for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1.
To construct φ invoke the Tietze Extension Theorem to obtain maps λ, µ : [0, 1]2 →
[0, 1] satisfying the following conditions: λ maps ([0, 1] × {0}) ∪ ({0} × [0, 1]) to
0, λ maps ({1} × [1/2, 1]) to 1, λ(s, 1) = s for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1, λ(1, t) = 2t for
0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2, µ maps ({0} × [0, 1]) ∪ ([0, 1] × {1}) to 0, µ maps ({1} × [0, 1/2])
to 1, µ(s, 0) = s for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1 and µ(1, t) = 2 − 2t for 1/2 ≤ t ≤ 1. Then define
φ(x, (s, t)) = g(f (x, λ(s, t)), µ(s, t)) for all (x, (s, t)) ∈ W × ([0, 1]2 ).
Step 2. Let B = ([0, 1] × {0}) ∪ ({0, 1} × [0, 1]). Observe that φ can be extended to a map ψ : (W × ([0, 1]2 )) ∪ (U1 × B) → U2 such that for all x ∈ U1 :
ψ(x, (s, 0)) = g(x, s) for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1, ψ(x, (0, t)) = x for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, ψ(x, (1, t)) = q0
for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2 and ψ(x, (1, t)) = g(p0 , 2 − 2t) for 1/2 ≤ t ≤ 1. Observe that
ψ(x, (1, 1)) = p0 for all x ∈ U1 and ψ(p0 , (s, 1)) = p0 for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1.
Step 3. There is a map r : U1 × [0, 1]2 → (W × [0, 1]2 ) ∪ (U1 × B) that restricts to the identity on (U1 × B) ∪ ({p0 } × [0, 1]2). To construct r, we exploit the
fact that B is a strong deformation retract of [0, 1]2 . Hence, there is a homotopy
δ : [0, 1]2 × [0, 1] → [0, 1]2 that joins the identity on [0, 1]2 to a retraction of [0, 1]2
onto B while keeping the points of B stationary. Also we exploit the fact that X is
a completely regular space to obtain a map ν : X → [0, 1] such that ν(p0 ) = 0 and
ν(X − W ) = {1}. Now we define the map r by r(x, (s, t)) = (x, δ((s, t), ν(x))) for
(x, (s, t)) ∈ U1 × [0, 1]2 .
Step 4. Finally we define the homotopy ω : U1 × [0, 1] → U2 by ω(x, s) =
ψ ◦ r(x, (s, 1)) for (x, s) ∈ U1 × [0, 1]. Then ω contracts U1 to p0 in U2 fixing p0 . 
Proof of Theorem 4. To prove Theorem 4 from Theorem 3 and Lemma 5, observe
that under the hypotheses of Theorem 4, there is an m ≥ 1 for which p0 ∈ Um . Then
a neighborhood W of p0 in V can be chosen so that the homotopy contracting V to
p0 in X fixing p0 restricts to a homotopy contracting W to p0 in Um . Then Lemma 5
implies that for each n ≥ m, Un contracts to p0 in Un+1 fixing p0 . We can now invoke
Theorem 3 to conclude that X is contractible.

Since every manifold and, more generally, every absolute neighborhood retract satisfies hypothesis (∗) of Theorem 4, we have the following corollary.

Corollary 6. If an absolute neighborhood retract X is the union of a sequence
of open subsets {Un } such that for each n ≥ 1, cl(Un ) ⊂ Un+1 and Un contracts to
point in Un+1 , then X is contractible.
Observe that Theorem 1 reaches the same conclusion as Theorem 4 and Corollary 6 without assuming hypotheses like (∗) or that X is an absolute neighborhood
retract. Establishing that the contractibility of X can be proved without imposing
such additional restrictions on X is one of the objectives of this paper.

2. Proofs of Theorem 1 and Corollary 2
Proof of Theorem 1. By hypothesis, for each n ≥ 1, there is a homotopy fn : U3n ×
[0, 1] → U3n+1 such that fn (x, 0) = x for each x ∈ U3n and fn (U3n × {1}) = {pn }
for some point pn ∈ U3n+1 . We modify each fn to get a homotopy with domain
X × [0, 1] by invoking Urysohn’s Lemma to obtain a map λn : X → [0, 1] such
that λn (cl(U3n−2 )) = {1} and λn (X − U3n−1 ) = {0}. Then we define the homotopy
gn : X × [0, 1] → X by:
(
fn (x, λn (x)t) for (x, t) ∈ U3n × [0, 1]
gn (x, t) =
x
for (x, t) ∈ (X − U3n−1 ) × [0, 1]
Therefore:
• gn (x, 0) = x for each x ∈ X,
• gn (U3n−2 × {1}) = {pn },
• gn (x, t) = x for each (x, t) ∈ (X − U3n−1 ) × [0, 1], and
• gn (U3n+1 × [0, 1]) ⊂ U3n+1 .
Next we define a map h : X × [0, ∞) → X by stacking the gn ’s. First we define
φn : X → X by φn (x) = gn (x, 1) for each x ∈ X. Then we define h : X × [0, ∞) → X
by:
(
g1 (x, t)
for (x, t) ∈ X × [0, 1]
h(x, t) =
gn+1(φn ◦ · · · ◦ φ1 (x), t − n) for (x, t) ∈ X × [n, n + 1] and n ≥ 1
Observe that h(x, 0) = g1 (x, 0) = x for each x ∈ X. Let
A=

[

(U3n−2 × [n, n + 1]).

n=1

For n ≥ 1, since φi (U3n−2 ) ⊂ U3n−2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and φn (U3n−2 ) = {pn }, it follows
that h(U3n−2 × {t}) = {gn+1 (pn , t − n)} for t ∈ [n, n + 1]. Thus, h is constant on

5

each horizontal slice of A; in other words, h(A ∩ (X × {t})) is a one-point set for each
t ∈ [1, ∞).
In this situation, if it were the case that the map t 7→ h(A∪(X ×{t})) : [1, ∞) → X
converges to a point p of X as t approaches ∞, it follows that one could extend h
to a map of X × [0, ∞] to X which would contract X to p. (If we were proving
Theorem 3, then this map could be contrived to be the constant map with value
p0 , and the proof of Theorem 3 would be finished at this point.) However, in the
current situation, there is no reason to expect such convergence. Instead, we introduce
another device to establish the contractibility of X. The exposition of this device is
the main contribution of this article.
Let σ : X → [3, ∞) be a map whose graph is contained in A. (See Figure 1.) One
scheme for constructing σ is the following. For each n ≥ 1, invoke Urysohn’s Lemma
to obtain a map σn : X → [0, 1] so that σn (cl(U
P∞ 3n−2 )) = {0} and σn (X −U3n+1 ) = {1}.
Then define σ by the formula σ(x) = 3 + n=1 σn (x).

Define the map ψ : X → X by ψ(x) = h(x, σ(x)). Then a homotopy k : X ×[0, 1] →
X that joins idX to ψ is defined by k(x, t) = (x, σ(x)t). The virtue of ψ that makes
it useful at this juncture is that it factors through [3, ∞). To verify this claim, we
choose a point q ∈ U1 and define the map τ : [3, ∞) → X by τ (t) = h(q, t). Observe
that since {q} × [3, ∞) ⊂ A and h is constant on each horizontal slice of A, it follows
that ψ(x) = h(x, σ(x)) = h(q, σ(x)) = τ (σ(x)). Thus, ψ = τ ◦ σ. Therefore, idX is
homotopic to ψ and ψ is null-homotopic because it factors through the contractible
space [3, ∞). Hence, idX is null-homotopic. Consequently, X is contractible.

Proof of Corollary 2. Since X is locally compact, every compact subset of X is contained in an open subset of X with compact closure. Since X is σ-compact, it follows
that X is the union of a sequence of open subsets {Vm } such that each Vm has compact
closure.
We will now construct by induction a sequence {Wk } of open subsets of X such
that for each k ≥ 1, Vk ⊂ Wk and cl(Wk ) is compact and contracts to a point in
Wk+1 . Begin by letting W1 = V1 . Next let k ≥ 1 and assume Wk is an open subset of
X such that Vk ⊂ Wk and cl(Wk ) is compact. Since {Un } is an increasing open cover
of the compact set cl(Wk ), it follows that cl(Wk ) is a subset of some Un . Therefore,
there is a homotopy which contracts cl(Wk ) to a point in X. Since the image of this
homotopy is compact, there is an m ≥ k + 1 such that the image of this homotopy
lies in V1 ∪ V2 ∪ · · · ∪ Vm . Let Wk+1 = V1 ∪ V2 ∪ · · · ∪ Vm . Then Vk+1 ⊂ Wk+1 , cl(Wk+1 )
is compact and cl(Wk ) contracts to a point in Wk+1 . This completes the construction
of the Wk .
Since {Vk } covers X and Vk ⊂ Wk for each k ≥ 1, {Wk } covers X. Since cl(Wk )
contracts to a point in Wk+1 for each k ≥ 1, it follows that the hypotheses of Theorem
1 are satisfied. Hence, X is contractible.

3. The Question
We are unsure whether the restriction to locally compact σ-compact spaces in the
hypothesis of Corollary 2 is necessary. Moreover, there are large and important classes
of contractible spaces such as infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces that are neither
locally compact nor σ-compact. Thus, omitting the hypotheses of local compactness
and σ-compactness from Corollary 2 would greatly broaden its applicability. This
brings us back to our original question.
Question 1. If a normal space X is the union of an increasing sequence of open
sets U1 ⊂ U2 ⊂ U3 ⊂ . . . such that each Un contracts to a point in X, must X be
contractible?
