Abstract
In view of Tucker’s lemma (an equivalent combinatorial version of the BorsukUlam theorem), the present authors (2013) introduced the k th altermatic number of a graph G as a tight lower bound for the chromatic number of G. In this
note, we present a purely combinatorial proof for this result.
Keywords: General Kneser Graph, Chromatic Number, Altermatic Number.

Introduction

Throughout the paper, the set {1, 2, . . . , n} is denoted by [n]. A hypergraph H is
an ordered pair (V (H), E(H)), where V (H) and E(H) are the vertex set and the
hyperedge set of H, respectively. Hereafter, all hypergraphs are simple, i.e., E(H) is
a family of distinct nonempty subsets of V (H). A proper t-coloring of a hypergraph
H, is a mapping c : V (H) −→ [t] such that no hyperedge is monochromatic, i.e.,
|c(e)| > 1 for any hyperedge e ∈ E(H). The minimum integer t such that H admits
a t-coloring is called the chromatic number of H and is denoted by χ(H). For
a hypergraph containing some hyperedge of cardinality 1, we define its chromatic
number to be infinite.
For a vector X = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ∈ {R, 0, B}n , a subsequence xa1 , xa2 , . . . , xat
(1 ≤ a1 < a2 < · · · < at ≤ n) of nonzero terms of X is called an alternating
subsequence of X if any two consecutive terms in this subsequence are different. We
denote by alt(X) the length of a longest alternating subsequence of X. Moreover, we
define alt(0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0. Also, we denote the number of nonzero terms of X by |X|.
For instance, if X = (R, R, B, B, 0, R, 0, R, B), then alt(X) = 4 and |X| = 7. For an
X = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ∈ {R, 0, B}n , define X R = {i : xi = R} and X B = {i : xi =
B}. Note that if we consider a vector X = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ), then one can obtain
X R and X B , and conversely. Therefore, by abuse of notation, we can set X =
(X R , X B ). Throughout the paper, we use interchangeably these representations,
i.e., X = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) or X = (X R , X B ). For X = (X R , X B ), Y = (Y R , Y B ) ∈

{R, 0, B}n , we write X ⊆ Y , if X R ⊆ Y R and X B ⊆ Y B . Note that if X ⊆ Y ,
then every alternating subsequence of X is an alternating subsequence of Y , and
subsequently, alt(X) ≤ alt(Y ). Also, if the first nonzero term of X is R (resp. B),
then every alternating subsequence of X with the maximum length begins with R
(resp. B), and moreover, we can conclude that X R (resp. X B ) contains the smallest
integer of X R ∪ X B .
Let LV (H) = {vi1 < vi2 . . . < vin : (i1 , i2 , . . . , in ) ∈ Sn } be the set of all linear
orderings of the vertex set of hypergraph H, where V (H) = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn }. For any
X = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ∈ {R, 0, B}n and any linear ordering σ : vi1 < vi2 . . . < vin ∈
LV (H) , define XσR = {vij : xj = R}, XσB = {vik : xk = B}, and Xσ = (XσR , XσB ).
Note that for V = [n] and I : 1 < 2 < · · · < n, we have X R = XIR , X B = XIB , and
X = XI . Also, set H|Xσ to be the hypergraph with the vertex set XσR ∪ XσB and the
edge set

	
E(H|Xσ ) = A ∈ E(H) : A ⊆ XσR or A ⊆ XσB .
For a hypergraph H = (V (H), E(H)), the general Kneser graph KG(H) has
all hyperedges of H as vertex set and two vertices of KG(H) are adjacent if the
corresponding hyperedges are disjoint. The hypergraph H provides a Kneser representation for a graph G whenever G and KG(H) are isomorphic. It is simple to
see that a graph G has various Kneser representations. For any σ ∈ LV (H) and
positive integer k, define altσ (H, k) to be the largest integer t such that there exists
an X ∈ {R, 0, B}n with alt(X) = t and that the chromatic number of KG(H|Xσ ) is
at most k − 1 (For k = 1, it means that H|Xσ contains no hyperedge). Now define

	
alt(H, k) = min altσ (H, k) : σ ∈ LV (H) .

Let G be a graph and k be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ χ(G) + 1. The
kth altermatic number of G, ζ(G, k), is defined as follows
ζ(G, k) = max {|V (H)| − alt(H, k) + k − 1 : KG(H) ←→ G}
H

where KG(H) ←→ G means there are some homomorphisms from G to H and also
from H to G.
One can see that for k = χ(KG(H)) + 1, we have alt(H, k) = |V |; and consequently, χ(KG(H)) = ζ(G, k). In [1], in view of Tucker’s lemma, it was shown
that the kth altermatic number of a graph is a tight lower bound for its chromatic
number.
Theorem A. [1] For any graph G and positive integer k, where k ≤ χ(G) + 1, we
have χ(G) ≥ ζ(G, k).
Furthermore, it was shown [1] that the first altermatic number can be considered as
an improvement of the Dol’nikov-Křı́ž’s lower bound [3, 5] for the chromatic number
of general Kneser hypergraphs. Also, we should mention that by an improvement
of Gale’s lemma, in [2], it was shown that the first altermatic number provides tight
lower bound for some well-known topological parameter which is related to graphs
via the Borsuk-Ulam theorem.
For more details about Tucker’s lemma and Gale’s lemma, we refer readers to [2,
7]. In [9], Meunier showed that it is a hard problem to determine the exact value of
2

the first altermatic number of a graph. Precisely, he proved that for a hypergraph
H and a permutation σ of V (H), it is an NP-hard problem to specify altσ (H, 1).

A Combinatorial Proof of Theorem A

For two positive integers m and n where m ≥ 2n, the usual Kneser graph KG(m, n)
is a graph whose vertex set consists of all n-subsets of [m] and two vertices are
adjacent if the corresponding subsets are disjoint. Kneser in 1955 [4] conjectured that
χ(KG(m, n)) ≥ m − 2n + 2. In 1978 [6], Lovász by using algebraic topology, proved
Kneser conjecture. Next Schrijver [10] introduced the Schrijver graph SG(m, n) as
a subgraph of KG(m, n) and proved that it is critical and has the same chromatic
number as KG(m, n). It is proved in [1] that Theorem A (for k = 1, 2 ) implies
these results. In what follows, we present the proof of Theorem A. It should be
mentioned that the proof relies on an interesting idea used by Matoušek [8] to
present a combinatorial proof of Lovász-Kneser theorem.
Proof of Theorem A. On the contrary, suppose ζ(G, k) > χ(G). Consider a
hypergraph H such that KG(H) is isomorphic to G and that
ζ(G, k) ≥ |V (H)| − alt(H, k) + k − 1 = |V (H)| − altσ (H, k) + k − 1 > χ(G)
where σ ∈ LV (H) . Without loss of generality and for the simplicity of notations,
we may assume that V = [n] and σ = I : 1 < 2 < · · · < n. Let h : V (KG(H)) =
E(H) −→ {1, 2, . . . , n − alt(H, k) + k − 2} be a proper coloring of KG(H). For
any subset M ⊆ V (H), we define h̄(M ) = max{h(A) : A ⊆ M, A ∈ E(H)}. If
there is no A ⊆ M , where A ∈ E(H), then set h̄(M ) = 0. For X = (X R , X B ) ∈
{R, 0, B}n , set h̄(X) = max{h̄(X R ), h̄(X B )}. Define a map λ : {R, 0, B}n −→
{±1, ±2, . . . , ±n} as follows
• If X = (X R , X B ) ∈ {R, 0, B}n and alt(X) ≤ altI (H, k), set

+alt(X) + 1 if X B = ∅ or min(X R ∪ X B ) ∈ X R
λ(X) =
−alt(X) − 1 otherwise
• If X = (X R , X B ) ∈ {R, 0, B}n and alt(X) ≥ altI (H, k) + 1, set

altI (H, k) + h̄(X) − k + 2
if h̄(X) = h̄(X R )
λ(X) =
−(altI (H, k) + h̄(X) − k + 2) if h̄(X) = h̄(X B )
Since h is a proper coloring, one can see that the map λ is well-defined. Moreover,
it is straightforward to check that for any two ordered pairs (Ai , Bi ) ⊆ (Aj , Bj ), we
have λ((Ai , Bi )) + λ((Aj , Bj )) 6= 0. Also, in view of the definition of altI (H, k), if
alt(X) ≥ altI (H, k) + 1, then the chromatic number of KG(F|X ) is at least k, and
consequently, |λ(X)| ≥ altI (H, k) + 2. Also, by the definition of λ, one can see that
λ((∅, ∅)) = 1. In the sequel, we show that there exists a graph H with a unique
vertex of degree one and any other vertex of degree 2, which is impossible. This
contradicts our assumption that h is a proper coloring. For any subset A ⊆ [n],
define −A = {−t : t ∈ A}. Note that if A = ∅, then −A = ∅. A permissible
3

sequence is a sequence (A0 , B0 ) ⊆ (A1 , B1 ) ⊆ · · · ⊆ (Am , Bm ) of disjoint ordered
pairs of {R, 0, B}n such that for any 0 ≤ i ≤ m, we have |Ai | + |Bi | = i and that
Am ∪ −Bm ⊆ {λ((A0 , B0 )), λ((A1 , B1 )), . . . , λ((Am , Bm ))}. By definition, we have
A0 , = B0 = ∅ and 0 ≤ m ≤ n. Also, one can see that (∅, ∅) is a permissible
sequence.
Set the vertex set of the graph H to be the set of all permissible sequences. Now
we introduce the edge set of H. For the permissible sequence (∅, ∅), we define its
unique neighbor to be (∅, ∅) ⊆ ({1}, ∅), which is a permissible sequence. We assign
two neighbors to any other permissible sequence as follows. Moreover, we show that
this assignment is symmetric, i.e., H is an undirected graph. Consider a permissible
sequence (A0 , B0 ) ⊆ (A1 , B1 ) ⊆ · · · ⊆ (Am , Bm ) (m ≥ 1) and set λi = λ((Ai , Bi ))
for any 0 ≤ i ≤ m. By the definition of λ, it is clear that if (A, B) ⊆ (A′ , B ′ ), then
|λ(A, B)| ≤ |λ(A′ , B ′ )|. Therefore, in view of the definition of permissible sequence,
one of the following conditions holds
(i) There exists a unique integer 0 ≤ i < m such that λi = λi+1 .
(ii) There exists a unique integer 0 ≤ i ≤ m such that λi 6∈ Am ∪ −Bm .
Note that in case (i), i = 0 is not possible since for any j > 0, |λj | > 1. If
λi = λi+1 for 1 ≤ i < m, then we define two neighbors of (A0 , B0 ) ⊆ (A1 , B1 ) ⊆
· · · ⊆ (Am , Bm ) as follows.

2. If i < m − 1, then define the other neighbor to be (A′′0 , B0′′ ) ⊆ (A′′1 , B1′′ ) ⊆ · · · ⊆

i+1

for any r 6= i + 1, (A′′r , Br′′ ) = (Ar , Br ). Otherwise, if i = m − 1, define the
other neighbor to be (A0 , B0 ) ⊆ (A1 , B1 ) ⊆ · · · ⊆ (Am−1 , Bm−1 ).
One can check that both of neighbors are permissible. Now suppose that there exists
an integer 0 ≤ i ≤ m such that λi 6∈ Am ∪ −Bm . Define the neighbors as follows

2. If 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1, then define the other neighbor to be (A′′0 , B0′′ ) ⊆ (A′′1 , B1′′ ) ⊆
′′ ), where (A′′ , B ′′ ) = (A
· · · ⊆ (A′′m , Bm

(B0 , A0 ) ⊆ (B1 , A1 ) ⊆ · · · ⊆ (Bm , Am ) as the second neighbor.
Note that all neighbors are permissible. Also, one can check that the aforementioned
assignment is symmetric, which completes the proof.
