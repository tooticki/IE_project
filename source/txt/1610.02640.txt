LUSZTIG DATA OF KASHIWARA-NAKASHIMA TABLEAUX IN
TYPES B AND C
JAE-HOON KWON
Abstract. We provide an explicit combinatorial description of the embedding
of the crystal of Kashiwara-Nakashima tableaux in types B and C into that of iLusztig data associated to a family of reduced expressions i of the longest element
w0 . The description of the embedding is simple and elementary using only the
Schützenberger’s jeu de taquin and RSK algorithm. A spinor model for classical
crystals plays an important role as an intermediate object connecting KashiwaraNakashima tableaux and Lusztig data.

1. Introduction
Suppose that g is a complex finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. Let Bp8q be
the crystal of the negative part of the quantum group Uq pgq and let Bpλq be the
crystal of an integrable highest weight Uq pgq-module with highest weight λ [10].
Let i be a reduced expression of the longest element w0 of length N in the Weyl
group of g. There is a realization of Bp8q given by the set of N -tuples of non-negative
integers called the i-Lusztig data, which parametrizes a PBW basis associated to i
and hence the canonical basis of the negative part of Uq pgq [26, 28]. The crystal
of this Lusztig parametrization has a rich combinatorial structure including a connection with the geometry of the totally positive varieties [1], and is also closely
related with other important realizations of Bp8q, for example the Kashiwara’s
string parametrizaion and MV polytopes [1, 9].
On the other hand, when g is of classical type, there is a well-known combinatorial
model for Bpλq called Kashiwara-Nakashima tableaux (KN tableaux for short) [14],
which generalizes the notion of Young tableaux in type A, and has been an important
tool for studying crystals of classical type [29] and the Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals
of non-exceptional affine type [4, 25].

The purpose of this paper is to give an explicit description of the relationship
between these two primarily important combinatorial models for Bp8q and Bpλq in
types B and C.
Let Bi be the set of i-Lusztig data and KNλ the set of KN tableaux of shape λ.
We assume that the Weyl group of type Bn or Cn is embedded into that of type
A2n´1 as the set of fixed elements under the Dynkin symmetry. Let i be a reduced
expression of w0 such that the image of i in the Weyl group of type A is adapted to
a Dynkin quiver of type A2n´1 , which has a single sink in the middle vertex.
The main result in this paper is to give a combinatorial description of the crystal
embedding

where ωλ is the highest weight corresponding to λ, and Tωλ “ ttωλ u is an abstract
crystal with wtptωλ q “ ωλ and ϕi ptωλ q “ ´8 for each simple root index i (Theorem
5.9).
Let us give some remarks on previous works related to this problem. It is wellknown that there is a concrete description of the embedding in case of type A with
i “ p1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, . . .q, where the i-Lusztig datum of a Young tableau is determined
by counting the number of its entries in each row (see [21] for a generalization to the
case when i is adapted to a quiver of type A with a single sink). For other types,
recall that there is another realization of Bp8q of type ABCD and type G2 in terms
of marginally large tableaux [8]. Recently, a simple combinatorial description of the
isomorphism from the crystal of marginally large tableaux of type BCD to that of
i-Lusztig data is obtained in [34, 35] for some i which is different from our choice.
Using the insertion scheme of BCD types, one may describe an embedding of KNλ
into the crystal of marginally large tableaux to have an embedding from KNλ into
Bi , but it seems more involved than in type A (see Remark 5.10).
The description of (1.1) presented here is simple and elementary using only the
Schützenberger’s jeu de taquin sliding and RSK algorithm (see Examples in Section
5.3). Let us explain our result in more details. A key ingredient of our approach
is to consider intermediate combinatorial models of crystals between KNλ and Bi ,
and factorize the embedding into a composite of the following three morphisms;

where r “ xωλ , hn y, Tλ is another tableau model of Bpωλ q introduced in [19, 20],
and Vλ is the crystal of a parabolic Verma module with respect to a maximal Levi
subalgebra l of type An´1 in g [16, 17].

The crystal Tλ is given by a set of sequences of Young tableaux of two-columned
skew shapes satisfying certain conditions of admissibility. It is based on the fact
that a non-spinor fundamental weight module can be embedded in a two-fold tensor
power of the spin representation of a q-deformed Clifford algebra [7]. Hence the
isomorphism Ψλ maps each column of a non-spinor weight in KN tableaux to a twocolumned skew Young tableaux (Theorems 3.14 and 3.19), where each single column
on the side of Tλ corresponds to a monomial in a spin representation. We may call
Tλ a spinor model of Bpλq for this reason (see [18, 19, 20] for other applications).
The crystal Vλ is given by a set of pairs of Young tableaux, which was introduced
in the study of irreducible characters of classical type as a truncation of Cauchy or
Littlewood identity (multiplied by a Schur polynomial) and their stable branching
formulas. It is the crystal of a parabolic Verma module in the sense that Vλ is a
limit of the crystals of finite-dimensional Uq pgq-modules, whose highest weight with
respect to the Levi subalgebra l is λ. Using a combinatorial description of Bp8q in
terms of quiver representations [32] and a crystal theoretic interpretation of RSK
algorithm [16], the embedding Φλ maps a pair of Young tableaux to a pair of upper
triangular matrix which are the i-Lusztig data corresponding to the Levi subalgebra
l and the associated nilradical of g, respectively (Theorem 4.9).
Now the classical methods in type A combinatorics naturally enters into this
picture of types B and C since both of the crystals Tλ and Vλ are given in terms of
Young tableaux. Indeed, we show that the embedding Θλ is obtained by successive
application of the Schützenberger’s jeu de taquin sliding to a tableau in Tλ (Theorem
5.7). The description of Θλ is a crucial part of (1.2). We conjecture a similar result
for type D using a spinor model of type D [20], while we need an approach different
from types B and C since we do not know yet a direct analogue of Φλ in (1.2) for
type D.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly recall some background
on necessary materials. In Section 3, we review the notion of spinor model Tλ and
describe the isomorphism Ψλ from KNλ to Tλ . In Section 4, we discuss the crystal
structure on Bi and describe the embedding Φλ of Vλ b Trωn into Bi b Tωλ . Finally
in Section 5, we give a description of the embedding Θλ of Tλ into Vλ b Trωn .

partitions. We identify λ “ pλ1 , λ2 , . . .q P P with a Young diagram. We denote by
λ1 “ pλ11 , λ12 , . . .q the conjugate of λ, and by λπ the skew Young diagram obtained

Let A be a linearly ordered set with a Z2 -grading A “ A0 \ A1 . For a skew Young
diagram λ{µ, let SSTA pλ{µq be the set of all semistandard tableaux of shape λ{µ
with entries in A, that is, (1) the entries in each row (resp. column) are weakly
increasing from left to right (resp. from top to bottom), (2) the entries in A0 (resp.
A1 ) are strictly increasing in each column (resp. row). For T P SSTA pλ{µq, let wpT q
be a word obtained by reading the entries of T row by row from top to bottom, and
from right to left in each row (cf. [6]). We denote by WA the set of words of finite
length with letters in A.
2.2. Crystals. Let us give a brief review on crystals (see [3, 12] for more details).
Let g be the Kac-Moody algebra associated to a symmetrizable generalized Cartan
matrix A “ paij qi,jPI indexed by a set I. Let P _ be the dual weight lattice, P “
HomZ pP _ , Zq the weight lattice, Π_ “ t hi | i P I u Ă P _ the set of simple coroots,
and Π “ t αi | i P I u Ă P the set of simple roots of g such that xαj , hi y “ aij for
i, j P I. Let pdi qiPI be a sequence of positive integers such that pdi aij q is symmetric.
Let P ` be the set of integral dominant weights. Let W be the Weyl group of g
generated by the simple reflection si for i P I.
A g-crystal (or simply a crystal if there is no confusion on g) is a set B together
with the maps wt : B Ñ P , εi , ϕi : B Ñ Z Y t´8u and eri , fri : B Ñ B Y t0u for i P I
satisfying the following:

eri b “ fri b “ 0 when ϕi pbq “ ´8,

for b P B and i P I. Here 0 is a formal symbol and ´8 is the smallest element in
i
Z Y t´8u such that ´8 ` n “ ´8 for all n P Z. For b, b1 P B, we write b Ñ b1 if
b1 “ fri b for i P I.
A tensor product B1 b B2 of crystals B1 and B2 is defined to be a crystal, which
is B1 ˆ B2 as a set with elements denoted by b1 b b2 , satisfying

for i P I. Here we assume that 0 b b2 “ b1 b 0 “ 0.
A morphism ψ : B1 Ñ B2 is a map from B1 Y t0u to B2 Y t0u such that

ψpfi bq “ fi ψpbq for b P B1 such that ψpbq ‰ 0 and ψpfri bq ‰ 0.

We call ψ an embedding and B1 a subcrystal of B2 when ψ is injective.
The dual crystal B _ of a crystal B is defined to be the set t b_ | b P B u with
wtpb_ q “ ´wtpbq, εi pb_ q “ ϕi pbq, ϕi pb_ q “ εi pbq, eri pb_ q “ pfri bq_ and fri pb_ q “
pr
ei bq_ for b P B and i P I. (Here we assume that 0_ “ 0.) For µ P P , let Tµ “ ttµ u
be a crystal, where wtptµ q “ µ, and ϕi ptµ q “ ´8 for all i P I. Given bi in crystals
Bi (i “ 1, 2), we write b1 ” b2 if there is an isomorphism of crystals Cpb1 q Ñ Cpb2 q
mapping b1 to b2 , where Cpbi q denotes the connected component of bi in Bi .
Let q be an indeterminate. Let Uq pgq be the quantized enveloping algebra of g,
which is an associative Qpqq-algebra with 1 generated by ei , fi , and q h for i P I and
h P P _ . Let Uq´ pgq be the negative part of Uq pgq, the subalgebra generated by fi
for i P I. We denote by Bp8q the crystal associated to Uq´ pgq, and by BpΛq the
crystal associated to an irreducible highest weight Uq pgq-module with highest weight
Λ P P `.
Let ˚ be the Qpqq-linear anti-automorphism of Uq pgq such that e˚i “ ei , fi˚ “ fi ,
and pq h q˚ “ q ´h for i P I and h P P . It is shown in [10, 11] that ˚ induces a bijection
on Bp8q. For i P I, we define er˚i “ ˚ ˝ eri ˝ ˚ and fri˚ “ ˚ ˝ fri ˝ ˚ on Bp8q.

2.3. PBW basis and Lusztig data. Suppose that g is a complex finite-dimensional
simple Lie algebra. Let us review the PBW basis of Uq´ pgq [26, 27, 33]. Let w0 be the
longest element in W of length N , and let Rpw0 q “ t pi1 , . . . , iN q | w0 “ si1 . . . siN u
be the set of reduced expressions of w0 .

Then the set Bi :“ t bi pcq | c P ZN
` u is a Qpqq-basis of Uq pgq called a PBW basis.
Let A0 denote the subring of Qpqq consisting of rational functions regular at q “ 0.
The A0 -lattice of Uq´ pgq generated by Bi is independent of the choice of i, which we
denote by Lp8q. For i P I, let eri and fri denote the modified Kashiwara operators
on Uq´ pgq given by

invariant under eri , fri . If π : Lp8q Ñ Lp8q{qLp8q is a canonical projection, then
πpBi q is a Q-basis of Lp8q{qLp8q, which is also independent of the choice of i, and
πpBi q Y t0u is invariant under r
ei , fri for i P I. Hence πpBi q becomes a g-crystal with
respect to eri and fri , which is isomorphic to Bp8q. We identify Bi :“ ZN

crystal πpBi q under the map c ÞÑ bi pcq, and call c P Bi an i-Lusztig datum.
2.4. Kashiwara-Nakashima tableaux. Let us review the notion of KashiwaraNakashima tableaux (KN tableaux for short) [14].
Fix a positive integer n ě 2 throughout the paper. From now on, we assume that
g “ bn of type Bn or g “ cn of type Cn with I “ t 1, . . . , n u. Let l be the Levi
subalgebra of g corresponding to t α1 , . . . , αn´1 u.
À
We assume that the weight lattice of g is P “ ni“1 Zǫi , where t ǫi | 1 ď i ď n u is
an orthonormal basis with respect to a symmetric bilinear form p , q. We denote by
ωi the ith fundamental weight for i P I. For λ P Pn , we put

Definition 2.4. Let KNsp be the set of Jˆ

Let Pnsp “ t µ ` σn | µ P Pn u, where σn “ p1{2, . . . , 1{2q (n times). For λ P Pnsp
with λ “ µ ` σn , let KNbλn to be the set of Jˆ

(1) the first column of T (from the right) is a tableau in KNsp ,
(2) the subtableau consisting of the other columns is a tableau in KNbµn ,
(3) the first two columns of T (from the right) satisfy (b-2)-(b-4).

For T P KNsp , put wtpT q “ ni“1 ci pǫi {2q, where ci “ 1 (resp. ci “ ´1) if T
has i (resp. i). For i P I, define eri T to be the unique tableau in KNsp such that
wtpr
ei T q “ si pwtpT qq if ci “ ´1, and 0 if ci “ 1. Then KNsp is a crystal isomorphic
to Bpωn q. For λ P Pnsp with λ “ µ ` σn , we define a crystal structure on KNbλn by
regarding KNbλn Ă KNsp b KNbµn . Then we have
(2.4)

KNbλn – Bpωλ q,

where ωλ “ ωµ ` ωn . For λ P Pn Y Pnsp , we call KNbλn the set of KN tableaux of

We define E and F on a pair of single columned tableaux in general. For a pair
pU, V q P SSTA p1u q ˆ SSTA p1v q (u, v ě 0), let T be a unique tableau in SSTA pλpu ´
k, v ´ k, kqq for some 0 ď k ď mintu, vu such that pT L , T R q “ pU, V q and rT “ 0.
Then we define
$
&ppXT qL , pXT qR q, if XT ‰ 0,
XpU, V q “
(3.1)
pX “ E, Fq,
%0,
if XT “ 0,

where XT is defined in Definition 3.1. In particular, when U is empty, we have
Fk pU, V q “ pUk , Vk q for 0 ď k ď htpV q, where Uk is the subtableau of V consisting
of the first k entries from the bottom and Vk is the complement of Uk in V .
The above sl2 -crystal structure will be used in Section 5.

3.2. Spinor model for classical crystals. In this subsection, we review another
combinatorial model of Bpλq in types Bn and Cn introduced in [19]. We will follow
the convention in [18], where the definition of this model is slightly different from
[19].
For 0 ď a ă n, let

Suppose that B is either
First we regard B as an l-crystal since
rns is the crystal of the natural representation of l, and rns is its dual (cf.[14]). We
denote by wtl pT q the l-weight of T P B. Next we define ern on B as follows (frn is
defined in a similar way):
(1) if T P Tcn paq, then ern T is the tableau obtained from T by removing a domino
n n if T has n n on its top, and 0, otherwise,
(2) if T P Tsp , then ern T is the tableau obtained from T by removing n if T
has n on its top, and 0, otherwise,

(3) if T P Tbn paq, then ern T is the tableau given by ern pT R b T L q, where we regard
Tbn paq Ă pTsp qb2 .
Then B is a g-crystal with respect to eri , fri for i P I and

Note that the highest weight element in Tg paq is given by Ha P SSTrns pλpa, 0, 0qq
where HaL piq “ n ´ a ` i for 1 ď i ď a and HaR is empty, while the highest weight
element Hsp in Tsp is an empty tableau.

Remark 3.5. One can also determine pL T, R T q by the following algorithm [20, (3.6)],
which will be useful in later arguments:
(s-1) Let yi “ T R piq for 1 ď i ď htpT R q. First, slide down the box y1 in T R as far
as the entry of T L in the same row is no greater than y1 . If no entry of T L
is greater than y, we place y1 next to T L p1q.
(s-2) Next, slide down y2 until it is above y1 and the entry of T L in the same
row is no greater than y2 . Repeat the same process with the other boxes
y3 , y4 , . . . until there is no moving down.
(s-3) Slide each box x in T L to the right if its right position is empty (indeed the
number of such boxes is a).
(s-4) Define R T to be the tableau determined by the boxes yi ’s in T R together
with boxes x ’s which have moved from T L by (s-3), and define L T to be the
tableau with the remaining boxes on the left.

Remark 3.7. When we consider the admissibility of a pair pT2 , T1 q, it is convenient
body
to assume that Ti
and Titail for i “ 1, 2 are separated by a common horizontal
line so that the vertical positions of the other column tableaux L Ti , R Ti for i “
1, 2 are determined accordingly (see the dashed lines in Example 3.8). Then the
condition (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) are equivalent to saying that pT2R , L T1 q and pR T2 , T1L q
form semistandard tableaux with respect to this vertical position, respectively.

Lemma 3.11. The map T ÞÝÑ Tr is an isomorphism of cn -crystals from Tcn paq to

Proof. By definition, it is clear that the map T ÞÝÑ Tr is injective and preserves the

that Tr R KNcnn´a . By (c-1) in Definition 2.1, there exists c P rns such Trpi1 q “ c
p1

q

and Trpi2 q “ c for some i1 ă i2 , and i1 ` pn ´ a ´ i2 ` 1q ą c. Put x “ n ´ a ´ i2 ` 1
and y “ i1 . Then x is the number of entries in Tr smaller than c, and y is the
number of entries in Tr or L T greater than or equal to c. Note that there is no c in
R T , and the number of entries in R T greater than c is c ´ x. On the other hand,
the pair pL T, R T q is obtained from T by applying the steps (s-1)-(s-4) in Section 3.2,
and it is reversible. But if y ą c ´ x, then the inverse steps from pL T, R T q to T is
not well-defined, which is a contradiction. This proves our claim. In particular, it
implies that the map is a bijection from Tcn paq to KNcp1nn´a q since both of them have
the same cardinality as Bpωn´a q.
Next we claim that the map T ÞÝÑ Tr commutes with eri and fri for i P I. Since
Ea T is Knuth equivalent to T , we have T ”l R T b L T , where ”l means ” as elements
T b L T . Hence T ”l Tr and the map
T and Tr ”l RĂ
in l-crystals. Also we have R T ”l RĂ
T ÞÝÑ Tr commutes with eri and fri for i P Iztnu. Now, consider ern and frn . It is not
difficult to see that
ern T ‰ 0 ðñ T has n n on its top
T does not have n
ðñ L T has n while RĂ

ðñ ern Tr ‰ 0,

and Tr1 “ ern Tr for T 1 “ ern T in this case. The proof for frn is similar. Therefore the
map is an isomorphism of crystals.

Conversely, suppose that c P B̊i satisfies σpcq “ c and ǫ|ck 2n´k`1 for 1 ď k ď n.

Remark 4.8. One can also derive the crystal structure on Bi presented here and its
tensor product decomposition by using a recent work on combinatorial description
of Bi [36].
In order to describe an embedding of the crystal of a maximal parabolic Verma
module into Bi , let us briefly recall some well-known results on combinatorics of
semistandard tableaux (cf.[6]).
Let T P SSTrns pλπ q be given for λ P Pn . For i P rns, we define T Ð i to be
the tableau obtained by applying the Schensted’s column insertion of i into T in a
reverse way starting from the rightmost column of T so that pT Ð iq P SSTrns pµπ q
for some µ Ą λ obtained by adding a box in a corner of λ. Let M be the set of
ř
rns ˆ rns matrices m “ pmij q such that mij P Z` and i,j mij ă 8. Let m P M be
given. For i P rns, we identify the ith row of m with a tableau T P SSTrns pkq for
some k P Z` such that mij is the number of j’s in T , and let wpmqi “ wpT q. We
define P pmq “ pppwr Ð wr´1 q ¨ ¨ ¨ q Ð w1 q if wpmqn ¨ ¨ ¨ wpmq1 “ w1 . . . wr . By the
well-known symmetry of RSK correspondence, we have P pmq “ P pmt q if and only
if m “ mt , where mt is the transpose of the matrix m. Hence the map sending m
to P pmq is a bijection
κ : Msym ÝÑ

ğ

SSTrns pµπ q,

µPPn

where Msym is the set of symmetric matrices in M.
Now, consider Vλg “ SSTrns pνq ˆ Vg for λ P Pn Y Pnsp . For V “ pV2 , V1 q P Vλg ,
we define dV P Bi by
$
`
`
&pd q` “ pd` q
V
ij 1ďiďjďn with dij “ mij for i ă j and dii “ mii {ǫ,
(4.10)
%pdV q´ “ pd´ q1ďiăjďn with d´ “ vij ,
ij

ij

where mij is the pi, jq-entry of m “ κ´1 pV1 q P Msym , and vij is the number of
i’s in the pn ´ j ` 1qth row of V2 from the top. Note that when g “ cn , we have
V1 P SSTrns pµπ q for some µ P Pc and hence 2|mii for 1 ď i ď n, where m “ pmij q “
κ´1 pV1 q.
Theorem 4.9. Let λ P Pn Y Pnsp and i P Rpw0 q such that i is adapted to Ω0 . Then
the map
Φλ : Vλg b Trωn

/ Bi b Tω
λ

V b trωn ✤

/ dV b t ω
λ

is an embedding of g-crystals, where r “ xλ, hn y.

26

JAE-HOON KWON

Proof. Let us first identify M with B̊i` , where m “ pmij q P M corresponds to
c` “ pcij qpi,jqPU P B̊i` in such a way that
mij “ ci 2n´j`1

p1 ď i ď j ď nq.

Then Msym
:“ t m | m “ pmij q P Msym , ǫ|mii p1 ď i ď nq u is equal to χpB`
ǫ
i q.
`
Under this identification, the g̊-crystal (resp. g-crystal) structure on B̊i (resp. B`
i )
sym
coincides with the one on M (resp. Mǫ ) defined in [16].
Let V “ pV2 , V1 q P Vλg be given. By [16, Theorem 3.6] the map Vg ÝÑ B`
i
sending V1 to pdV q` is an isomorphism of g-crystals. Also the map SSTrns pνq ÝÑ
´
B´
i b Tωλ ´rωn sending V2 to pdV q b tωλ ´rωn is an embedding of g-crystals (see [21,
Proposition 5.2]). Therefore, the map sending V b trωn to dV b tωλ is an embedding
of g-crystals by Lemma 4.7.

Proof. Let N be the set of rns ˆ rrs matrices m “ pmij qiPrns,jPrrs such that mij P

t0, 1u and mij ă 8. One may identify N with Er , where the jth column of m
corresponds to T P SSTrns p1uj q with mij the number of occurrence of i in T . We
recall that there exists a pgln , glr q-bicrystal structure on N (see for example, [15,
Section 4]). Then it is not difficult to see that Ei and Fi for 1 ď i ď r ´ 1 in (5.1)
coincide with the Kashiwara operators for the (regular) glr -crystal structure on N.
This proves the lemma.

As in Remark 3.7, we assume that Ti

the bottoms of T i (1 ď i ď ℓ) are placed on L, and T i (ℓ ă i ď 2ℓ) are placed with
bi boxes above L and ai´ℓ boxes below L. Hence T can be viewed as a tableau of

Lemma 5.2. Under the above hypothesis, we have
(1) T P SSTrns pηq, where η is given in (5.4),
(2) T ”l T, where b ”l b1 means that b is equivalent to b1 as elements of lcrystals.
Proof. Let T “ pT 2ℓ , . . . , T 1 q be in (5.2), which is a tableau of shape η (5.4). It is
clear that (2) holds since Fi preserves Knuth equivalence. So it suffices to show (1).
For simplicity, we say that pT i`1 , T i q is semistandard when the subtableau of
T consisting of the columns pT i`1 , T i q is rns-semistandard. We will show that
pT i`1 , T i q is semistandard for 1 ď i ď 2ℓ ´ 1. We use induction on ℓ and may
assume that ℓ ą 1 since it is clear when ℓ “ 1.

Then L T1 is the tableau with entries T1L pkq for k P tj1 , . . . , jb2 u (see Remark 3.5).

k R ti1 , . . . , ib3 u. It is clear that pT 3 , T 2 q is semistandard.
Since ik ě jk for 1 ď k ď b3 , we have T 2 pkq “ T1L pik q ď T1L pjk q ď T1R pkq “ T 1 pkq
for 1 ď k ď b3 . We also have T 2 pkq “ T1L pk ` a1 q ď T1R pkq “ T 1 pkq for b3 ă k ď b2 .
So pT 2 , T 1 q is semistandard.
Let 1 ď i11 ă i12 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă i1b4 ď a2 ` b4 be a sequence given by
(5.7)

i11 “ mint i | 1 ď i ď a2 ` b4 , T2L piq ď T2R p1q u,
i1k “ mint i | i1k´1 ă i ď a2 ` b4 , T2L piq ď T2R pkq u

p2 ď k ď b4 q.

Recall that R T2 is the tableau with entries in T2R and T2L pkq for 1 ď k ď a2 ` b4 with
k R t i11 , i12 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , i1b4 u.
By Definition 3.6 (1)(iii) and our choice of i1 , . . . , ib3 , we have
(5.8)

i1k ď ik ` pa2 ´ a1 q

for 1 ď k ď b4 . Note that for 1 ď l ď a1 ` b4
(5.9)

T 4 pl ` a2 ´ a1 q “ T2L pl ` a2 ´ a1 q ď R T2 pl ` a2 ´ a1 q ď T1L plq.

Suppose that ik ă l ă ik`1 for 0 ď k ď b3 and l ď a1 ` b4 , where we assume that
i0 “ 0 and ib3 `1 “ a1 ` b3 ` 1. Then T 3 plq “ T1L plq, and hence T 4 pl ` a2 ´ a1 q ď T 3 plq
by (5.9). Next, suppose that l “ ik for 1 ď k ď b3 and l ď a1 ` b4 . Then
T 3 plq “ T 3 pik q “ T2R pkq. On the other hand, if ik ` a2 ´ a1 “ i1k1 for some k1 (which
implies that k1 ě k by (5.8)), then R T2 pik ` a2 ´ a1 q “ T2R pk1 q ď T2R pkq. Otherwise
R T pi `a ´a q ă R T pi1 q “ T R pkq by (5.8). Hence we have T pi `a ´a q ď T pi q.

It follows that pT 4 , T 3 q is semistandard. Hence T is semistandard.

Case 2. ℓ “ 3. Let T “ pT3 , T2 , T1 q be given. Note that
T “ F3a1 F2a1 F4a2 T
First consider
pT 6 , T 5 , U4 , U3 , T 2 , T 1 q “ F2a1 F4a2 T.
We have by Case 1 that both pT 2 , T 1 q and pT 6 , T 5 q are semistandard. Let 1 ď i1 ă
i2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă ib3 ď a1 ` b3 be as in (5.6). Note that U3 and T 2 are the same as T 3 and
T 2 in Case 1, respectively.
Let 1 ď j1 ă j2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă jb5 ď a2 ` b5 be a sequence defined inductively as follows:
jb5 “ maxt j | 1 ď j ď a2 ` b5 , T3R pb5 q ď T2L pjq u,

(5.10)

jk “ maxt j | 1 ď j ă jk`1 , T3R pkq ď T2L pjq u

p1 ď k ď b5 ´ 1q.

Put Y “ tj1 , . . . , jb5 u Y ta2 ` b5 ` 1, a2 ` b5 ` 2, . . . , a2 ` b4 u. By the same arguments
for pT 3 , T 2 q in Case 1, U4 is the tableau with the entries T2L pkq for k P Y , while T 5
is the tableau with the entries of T3R and T2L pkq for 1 ď k ď a2 ` b5 with k R Y .
Next consider
T “ F3a1 pT 6 , T 5 , U4 , U3 , T 2 , T 1 q “ pT 6 , T 5 , Fa1 pU4 , U3 q, T 2 , T 1 q.
Note that
(5.11)

U4 pkq ď T2R pkq

p1 ď k ď b4 q,

by the same argument for the semistandardness of pT 2 , T 1 q in Case 1. Then we
first have T 3 pkq ď T2R pkq for 1 ď k ď b4 by (5.11) and definition of Fa1 pU4 , U3 q,
and hence T 3 pkq ď T2R pkq ď T1L pik q “ T 2 pkq for 1 ď k ď b4 . We also have T 3 pkq “
U3 pk ` a1 q ď T 2 pkq for b4 ă k ď b3 by the semistandardness of pT 3 , T 2 q in Case 1.
So pT 3 , T 2 q is semistandard. It is clear that pT 4 , T 3 q “ Fa1 pU4 , U3 q is semistandard
by (5.11) and definition of F.
So it remains to show that pT 5 , T 4 q is semistandard. Applying the argument in
Case 1 to pT2 , T1 q, pT2L , U3 q is semistandard, that is,
(5.12)

T2L pk ` a2 ´ a1 q ď U3 pkq p1 ď k ď a1 ` b4 q.

Let 1 ď j11 ă j21 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă jb1 4 ď a1 ` b4 be a sequence defined inductively as follows:

2, . . . , a1 ` b3 u. By definition of Fa1 , T 3 is the tableau with the entries U3 pkq for
k P Y 1 , while T 4 is the tableau with the entries of U4 and U3 pkq for 1 ď k ď a1 ` a4
with k R Y 1 .

For 1 ď k ď b4 , we have U4 pkq “ T2L pjk q ď U3 pjk ´ pa2 ´ a1 qq by (5.12), which
implies from (5.13) that
jk ď pa2 ´ a1 q ` jk1 .

(5.14)

Suppose that l “ jk for 1 ď k ď b5 with jk ą a2 ´ a1 . Then we have
T 5 pjk q “ T3R pkq ď T2L pjk q ď U3 pjk ´ pa2 ´ a1 qq

(5.16)

by (5.10) and (5.12). If jk ´ pa2 ´ a1 q “ jk1 1 in (5.15), then we have k1 ď k by (5.14).
By (5.15) and (5.16), we have T 5 pjk q ď T 4 pjk ´ pa2 ´ a1 qq.
Next, suppose that l ą a2 ´ a1 and jk ă l ă jk`1 with 0 ď k ď b5 , where we
assume that j0 “ 0 and jb5 `1 “ a2 ` b5 ` 1. If l ´ pa2 ´ a1 q “ jk1 1 for some k1 , then
we also have k1 ď k by (5.14), and
T 5 plq “ T2L plq ă T2L pjk q ď T2L pjk1 q “ T 4 pl ´ pa2 ´ a1 qq.
Otherwise, we have
T 5 plq “ T2L plq ď U3 pl ´ pa2 ´ a1 qq “ T 4 pl ´ pa2 ´ a1 qq
So pT 5 , T 4 q is semistandard, and hence T is semistandard.

Hence we have
S “ pSℓ´1 , . . . , S2 q P Tg pζq,

(5.20)

where ωζ “ ωλ ´ ωn´aℓ ´ ωn´a1 , and by induction hypothesis,
(5.21)

S “ Y2 S “ pT 2ℓ´2 , . . . , T 3 q P E2ℓ´4

is semistanard. Finally, pT 2ℓ´1 , T 2ℓ´2 q and pT 3 , T 2 q are semistandard by the proofs
of the semistandardness of pT 5 , T 4 q and pT 3 , T 2 q in Case 2, respectively. Therefore
T is semistandard by (5.18) and (5.21). This completes the induction.

Let λ “ µ ` σn P Pnsp be given with ℓ “ µ1 . For T “ pTℓ , . . . , T1 , T0 q P Tgλ , we
define
(5.22)

T “ pT 2ℓ , . . . , T 1 , T 0 q P E2ℓ`1 ,

where pT 2ℓ , . . . , T 1 q is obtained as in (5.2) with paℓ , . . . , a1 q given in Definition 3.6(2),
and T 0 “ T0 . Since T1 ă T0 , T is also semistandard of shape η and T ”l T by
Lemma 5.2. In this case τ “ pb0 , b1 , . . . , b2ℓ q1 P Pg with b0 “ htpT0 q.
Definition 5.3. Let λ P Pn Y Pnsp . For T P Tgλ , let T be the tableau of shape η
given in (5.2) and (5.22). We define Ttail and Tbody to be the tableaux of shape ν
and τ π given by the subtableaux of T located below and above L in (5.4), respectively.
Corollary 5.4. Under the above hypothesis, we have
(1) pTtail , Tbody q P SSTrns pνq ˆ SSTrns pτ π q,
(2) Tbody b Ttail ”l T.
Proof. (1) follows from Lemma 5.2(1). (2) follows from the fact that the crystal
structure on the connected component of T does not depend on the choice of reading
entries (column reading or row reading) (cf.[3, Theorem 7.3.6]).

Remark 5.6. The ℓ-tuples pTℓtail , . . . , T1tail q and pTℓ , . . . , T1 q form tableaux
of shape ν and τ π , respectively, which are not necessarily rns-semistandard. But they
become rns-semistandard when T is equivalent to an rns- semistandard tableau of
a relatively small shape as an element of l-crystals. More precisely, if T ”l S for

some S P SSTrns pγq with γ1 ă ℓ, then pTℓtail , . . . , T1tail q and pTℓ , . . . , T1 q are
rns-semistandard [18, Lemma 4.2], which implies that pTℓtail , . . . , T1tail q “ Ttail

and pTℓ , . . . , T1 q “ Tbody . This phenomenon is closely related to so-called a
stable branching rule, which is discussed in [18] with more details.
5.2. Main result. Let us establish an embedding of Tgλ into Vλg b Trωn , which is
the last step for the construction of an embedding of KNgλ into Bi b Tωλ .
Theorem 5.7. For λ P Pn Y Pnsp , the map
Θλ : Tgλ

is an embedding of g-crystals, where r “ xλ, hn y.
Proof. Note that Θλ is injective since the map T ÞÑ T is reversible. Let T P Tgλ be
given. By Lemma 5.2(2), we have Θλ px̃i Tq “ x̃i Θλ pTq for x “ e, f and i P Iztnu.
So it remains to show that
(5.23)

if x̃n T ‰ 0, then Θλ px̃n Tq “ x̃n Θλ pTq.

Let us prove (5.23) when g “ cn and λ P Pn . The proof for g “ bn and λ P Pn YPnsp
is very similar, which we leave it to the reader.
Let T “ pTℓ , . . . , T1 q and T “ pT 2ℓ , . . . , T 1 q. First, we associate a sequence
σ “ pσℓ , . . . , σ1 q given by

In σ “ pσℓ , . . . , σ1 q, we replace a pair pσj , σi q “ p´, `q, where j ą i and σk “ ¨ for
j ą k ą i, with p ¨ , ¨ q, and repeat this process as far as possible until we get a sequence with no ´ placed to the left of `, which we denote by σ red “ pσℓred , . . . , σ1red q.
Recall from tensor product rule of crystals that if i is the largest (resp. smallest)
index such that σired “ ´ (resp. σired “ `), then ern T “ pTℓ , . . . , ern Ti , . . . , T1 q (resp.

We will prove that σ red “ σ red , which implies (5.23). We assume that ℓ ě 2 and
use induction on ℓ. We separate the cases as in the proof of Lemma 5.2(1) and keep
the notations there. Note that b2i´1 “ b2i for 1 ď i ď ℓ since g “ cn . We denote by
xi yi the domino on top of Ti for 1 ď i ď ℓ, and by zi wi the domino on top of
pT 2i , T 2i´1 q for 1 ď i ď ℓ.

Case 1. ℓ “ 2. Suppose that σ2 “ `, that is, n ă x2 ď y2 . If b3 ă b2 , then
x2 “ z2 , x2 ď w2 ď y2 , and x1 “ z1 , y1 “ w1 , which implies that σ2 “ σ 2 “ ` and
σ1 “ σ 1 . If b3 “ b2 , then x2 “ z2 ď x1 , x2 ď w2 ď y2 , and x1 ď z1 , y1 “ w1 , which
implies that σi “ σ i “ ` for i “ 1, 2.
Suppose that σ2 “ ´, that is, x2 “ y2 “ n. In this case, we have x2 “ y2 “ z2 “
w2 “ n and x1 “ z1 , y1 “ w1 , which implies that σ2 “ σ 2 “ ´ and σ1 “ σ 1 .
Suppose that σ2 “ ¨ , that is, x2 “ n ă y2 . If b3 ă b3 , then it is clear that
x2 “ z2 “ n ă w2 ď y2 and x1 “ z1 , y1 “ w1 , which implies that σi “ σ i for
i “ 1, 2. Assume that b3 “ b2 . If n ă x1 , then x2 “ z2 “ n ă w2 ď y2 , x1 ď z1 , and
y1 “ w1 , which implies that σ2 “ σ 2 “ ¨ and σ1 “ σ 1 “ `. If n “ x1 , then n ă y1
(since n ă y2 and T2 ă T1 ), x2 “ z2 “ w2 “ n, and n ă z1 ď w1 , which implies that
σ “ p ¨ , ¨ q and σ “ p´, `q and hence σ red “ σ red .
Case 2. ℓ “ 3. Let σ 1 “ pσ31 , σ21 , σ11 q be the sequence associated to
U “ pT 6 , T 5 , U4 , U3 , U2 , T 1 q “ F4a2 T,
as in (5.25). Note that T 1 “ T1R , U2 “ T1L , U3 “ T2R , T 6 “ T3L , and σ31 “ σ 3 , σ11 “ σ1 .
By Case 1, we have σ red “ σ 1 red . Recall that T “ F3a1 F2a1 U. Let u2 v2 be the
domino on top of pU4 , U3 q.
Suppose that σ21 “ `, that is, n ă u2 ď v2 . If b3 ă b2 , then n ă z2 ď w2 , x1 “ z1 ,
and y1 “ w1 , which implies that σ21 “ σ 2 “ ` and σ11 “ σ 1 . Assume that b3 “ b2 .
Note that n ă y1 since n ă y2 and T2 ă T1 . If n ă x1 , then n ă z2 ď w2 , x1 ď z1 ,
and y1 “ w1 , which implies that σi1 “ σ i “ ` for i “ 1, 2. If x1 “ n, then we should
have b5 “ b3 , x3 “ x2 “ n, n ă y3 and hence z3 “ w3 “ n since T3 ă T2 ă T1 . So
σi “ ¨ for 1 ď i ď 3 and σ31 “ ´. This implies that z2 “ n ă w2 , x1 ă z1 , and
y1 “ w1 . So we have σ “ p´, ¨ , `q, while σ 1 “ p´, `, ¨ q and σ “ p ¨ , ¨ , ¨ q.

Suppose that σ21 “ ´, that is, u2 “ v2 “ n. By the same argument as in Case

which implies that σ21 “ σ 2 “ ´ and σ11 “ σ 1 .
Suppose that σ21 “ ¨ , that is, u2 “ n ă v2 . By the same argument as in Case 1

Remark 5.8. For the proof of Theorem 5.7 when g “ bn , we have to consider a
sequence σ “ pσ2ℓ , . . . , σ1 q or pσ2ℓ , . . . , σ1 , σ0 q for T P Tbλn where σ2i (resp. σ2i´1 )
is associated to TiL (resp. TiR ), and σ0 to T0 P Tsp . We define σk “ ` and ´ if the
top entry of the column is greater than n and equal to n, respectively. The other
arguments are almost the same.
Now, combining Theorems 3.14, 3.19, 4.9, and 5.7, we have the following.

Remark 5.10. In [8], it is proved that the set of certain KN tableaux of classical
type so called marginally large tableaux is isomorphic to Bp8q (see also [2]). One
may define an embedding of KNgλ into the crystal of marginally large tableaux by
mapping T to T 1 ” T b Hγ , where Hγ is a highest element in KNgµ with xωγ , hi y " 0
for all i. Unlike in type A, it does not seem to be easy in general to describe T 1 since
the insertion scheme in types BCD [23, 24] is more involved. On the other hand, the
embedding Ξλ in Theorem 5.9 uses only the Schützenberger’s jeu de taquin sliding
and RSK.
