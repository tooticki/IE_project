Abstract
The notion of an abstract convex geometry, due to Edelman and Jamison [7], offers an abstraction
of the standard notion of convexity in a linear space. Kashiwabara, Nakamura, and Okamoto [13]
introduce the notion of a generalized convex shelling into RN and prove that a convex geometry
may always be represented with such a shelling. We provide a new, shorter proof of their result
using a representation theorem of [7] and deduce a different upper bound on the dimension of
the shelling. Furthermore, in the spirit of Czédli [5], who shows that any 2-dimensional convex
geometry may be embedded as circles in R2 , we show that any convex geometry may be embedded
as convex polygons in R2 .

1. Introduction
One of the clearest and earliest expositions of the theory of convex geometries is found in
[7]. There, one may find several equivalent definitions of what it means for a collection of sets
to constitute an abstract convex geometry. One is given below in Definition 1 stating that the
collection of sets is i) closed under intersection, ii) includes both the empty set and the entire
set, and iii) given any set in the collection, there is an element outside of it which may be added
to that set and yields another member of the collection. Another equivalent formulation is given
in terms of the anti-exchange property, which states that if one is given two elements and a set
in the collection containing neither of those elements, then there is a larger set in the collection
containing exactly one of those elements. That is, it is possible to include one of the external
elements (perhaps along with additional other elements) without including the other. This is the
same anti-exchange property that appears in antimatroid theory, and there is a clear equivalence
between convex geometries and antimatroids. Additionally, Edelman [9] shows that every convex
geometry is a meet-distributive lattice and vice-versa. In fact, there are several other equivalent
formulations (for surveys, see Stern [16], Adaricheva and Czédli [2], Czédli [6] and Adaricheva
and Nation [3]). Finally, we note that convex geometries have proven useful in economics in

the study of choice (Johnson and Dean [10, 11, 12], Koshevoy [14]) and of abstract economic
equilibrium (Richter and Rubinstein [15]).
In their expansive study of convex geometries, Adaricheva, Gorbunov, and Tumanov [4] provide a series of problems of which one, problem 3, inquires about subclasses of join-semidistributive
lattices which are relatively embeddable into the lattice of convex sets of RN . Partial solutions were
achieved by Adaricheva [1] and Wehrung and Semenova [17] particularly for lower bounded lattices. More recently, [13] have provided a solution by showing that any convex geometry can be
represented as a “generalized convex shelling”, meaning that there is an embedding in RN so that
each set in the geometry is convex if and only if its embedding is convex with respect to a fixed
external set of points in RN . In this paper we provide an alternate proof of this representation
theorem using a representation of [7] which represents a convex geometry through a collection of
orderings. An important feature of this new proof is that it yields an upper bound on the dimension
of the smallest Euclidean space into which a convex geometry may be embedded via a generalized
convex shelling which may be different to the upper bound found by [13]. We then further use the
representation theorem of [7] to provide a new result, that any convex geometry may be embedded
as convex polygons in R2 .
Definition 1. Let E be a finite set containing N points. A convex geometry on E is a collection L
of subsets (called convex sets) of E with the following properties.
1. ∅ and E are in L
2. If X, Y ∈ L then X ∩ Y ∈ L
3. If X ∈ L \ {E} then there is e ∈ E \ X so X ∪ {e} ∈ L
Convex geometries L1 on E 1 and L2 on E 2 are isomorphic if there is a bijection ψ : E 1 → E 2
so ψ(X) ∈ L2 if and only if X ∈ L1 .
The following definition of a generalized convex shelling for a set E ⊂ Rn is due to [13].
Definition 2. Using Conv(Q) to denote the convex hull, let G, Q ⊂ Rn be finite sets such that
G ∩ Conv(Q) = ∅. The generalized convex shelling on G with respect to Q is

	
L = X ⊂ G : Conv(X ∪ Q) ∩ G = X .
It is easily verified that this defines a convex geometry. In [13] the converse is proved.
Theorem 1 ([13] Theorem 2.8). Any convex geometry is isomorphic to a generalized convex
shelling.
Another straightforward way to define a convex geometry on E uses a collection of orderings,
which we denote <i . Throughout the paper, orderings are total and antisymmetric.
M
Definition 3. We say that L is generated by a family {<i }i=1
of orderings on E if

L = {∅} ∪ {X ⊆ E : ∀y < X, ∃i so that ∀x ∈ X, x ≻i y}

2

Given any finite set E of Euclidean space, the standard convexity notion on it can be generated
in the manner of Definition 3 by taking all strict orderings which are generated by linear directions.
Then, given any convex set X and any y ∈ E \ X there is a Euclidean separating hyperplane, so by
projecting onto the line orthogonal to this hyperplane one finds a linear order ≻ for which x ∈ X
implies x ≻ y. This shows that all standard convex sets are convex in the geometry defined by these
orderings. To see the converse, notice that in the generated convexity, each convex set is Euclidean
convex because it is the intersection of the half-spaces defined by some collection of ≻i with E.
Thus, the standard convexity can be represented by the family of orderings arising from linear
directions and the following lemma shows that the above definition produces a convex geometry
for any set and for any set of orderings. This was proven in [7], but for the reader’s convenience
we also demonstrate it here.
Lemma 1 ([7] Theorem 5.2). If L is generated by a family of orderings {<i }mi=1 , then it is a convex
geometry.
Proof. The only non-trivial part of Definition 1 to verify is (3). Take X ∈ L \ {E} and define a
relation on E\X by a <X b if ∀i ∃yi ∈ X ∪ {b} such that a <i yi . The idea behind this relationship
is that a is closer to X than b is in the sense that any convex set which contains X ∪ {b} must also
contain a. The relation <X is easily seen to be reflexive and transitive. To prove antisymmetry
assume a , b are in E \ X. Since X ∈ L this implies ∃i so ∀x ∈ X, x ≻i a. For this i, either b ≻i a
and thus a %X b, or a ≻i b and therefore also ∀x ∈ X, x ≻i b, the two of which imply that b %X a.
Hence <X is antisymmetric and is a partial order. Now take z a maximal element in E\X according
to <X . If y < X ∪ {z} then either z ≻X y or z and y are incomparable according to <X . In either case,
there must be at least one i so that ∀x ∈ X ∪ {z}, x ≻i y (because otherwise it would be the case that
y <X x). Thus, X ∪ {z} ∈ L. This verifies (3) of Definition 1 and completes the proof.

The following converse was proved in [7].
Theorem 2 ([7] Theorem 5.2). If L is a convex geometry on E then there are orderings <i on E
such that L is obtained as in Definition 3.
2. New Proof and Dimensional Bound of a Generalized Convex Shelling
The purpose of this section is to give a proof of Theorem 1 from Theorem 2. We first define a
map which realizes the orderings as the orders on coordinate directions in RM . To do so, for each
i arrange E using the ith order as xi1 ≻i xi2 ≻i · · · ≻i xiN and for x ∈ E let ji (x) be the unique
choice such that x = xi ji (x) . That is, ji (x) denotes x’s place according to the ith ordering. Then
define F i : E → R by F i (x) = −(M + 1) ji (x) and let F(x) = (F 1 (x), . . . , F M (x)) : E → RM . We
have replicated the orderings <i from E using the coordinate directions on F(E), so the following
is obvious.
Lemma 2. On RM define (x1 , . . . , xM ) >i (y1 , . . . , yM ) to mean that xi > yi . Then {≥i } are orderings
on F(E) and the convex geometry L1 they generate is isomorphic to L on E.
There is a hull operation for L1 which we call Pos (an abbreviation of positive sector). If
P ⊂ F(E) then Pos(P) = {x : ∀i ∃p(i) ∈ P with x ≥i p(i)}. Clearly Pos(P) ∩ F(E) ∈ L1 and
P ∈ L1 ⇐⇒ P = Pos(P) ∩ F(E). We will also need another hull operation, which we define by
3

ExtConv(P) = {x : ∃p ∈ Conv(P) with x ≥i p, ∀i}, from which we can define a collection L2 of
subsets of F(E) by P ∈ L2 ⇐⇒ P = ExtConv(P) ∩ F(E). It is not immediately clear whether L2
is a convex geometry, but in fact we have the following.
Theorem 3. Pos(P) ∩ F(E) = ExtConv(P) ∩ F(E) for any P ⊂ F(E). Equivalently, L1 = L2 .
Proof. Let p(i) ∈ P be such that p(i)i = min p∈P pi , where the subscript denotes the ith coordinate.
That is, p(i) is the minimally-ranked member of P in coordinate i. There is exactly one such p(i)
for each i, because >i is an ordering on F(E), however it is possible that p(i) = p( j) for some i , j.
It is clear that Pos(P) = {x : ∀i, xi ≥ p(i)i }.
P
P
If x ∈ ExtConv(P) there are elements pk ∈ P so xi ≥ k αk (pk )i , where αk ≥ 0, αk = 1. But
then (pk )i ≥ p(i)i , so xi ≥ p(i)i for each i, and thus x ∈ Pos(P) and the inclusion ⊃ is proved.
P
For the converse, let p = M −1 i p(i) ∈ Conv(P). Recall from the definition of F(E) that
P
p(i) j < −M for all i, j, so that M p j = i, j p(i) j + p( j) j < −M(M − 1) + p( j) j . Now let
x ∈ Pos(P) ∩ F(E). If x ∈ P then x ∈ ExtConv(P), so we are done. If not, then for all j, the
orderings < j are antisymmetric, and so we have that x ≻ j p( j) and therefore Mx j > p( j) j .
Combining this with our first estimate yields M p j < −M(M − 1) + Mx j , so that p j ≤ x j . As
this is true for all j, it is the case that x ≥ j p for all j and thus x ∈ ExtConv(P).

Finally we relate ExtConv(P) to the geometry given by a generalized convex shelling. Specifically, let ei be the ith coordinate vector in RM , let Q be the set of points {0} ∪ {λei : 1 ≤ i ≤ M}
where λ is a positive real number. Furthermore, let L3 be the convex geometry on F(E) given
by the convex shelling of F(E) with respect to Q as in Definition 2. This is legitimate because
Conv(Q) is in the positive sector, so cannot intersect F(E).
Theorem 4. There exists λ large enough such that Conv(P ∪ Q) ∩ F(E) = ExtConv(P) ∩ F(E) for
any P ⊂ F(E). Equivalently L2 = L3 .
Proof. Since P ⊂ F(E) is in the negative sector, then all points of Q are in ExtConv(P), and thus
Conv(P ∪ Q) ⊂ ExtConv(P). It remains to prove the converse for the intersection with F(E). In
the case M = 1 this is clear with Q = {0}, i.e. λ = 0, so we may assume M ≥ 2.

If x ∈ F(E)∩ExtConv(P)\P then there is y ∈ Conv(P) so that y j ≤ M −1 −(M − 1)(M + 1) + Mx j )
P
2
= − MM−1 + x j < −1+ x j for all j. Notice that we can take y = M −1 i p(i) as in the previous theorem.
Moreover, as y j ≥ −(M + 1)M , it follows that (M + 1)−M y j ≥ −1 and
(1 − (M + 1)−M )y j = y j − (M + 1)−M y j ≤ y j + 1 < x j .
Define u j = x j − (1 − (M + 1)−M )y j > 0 and make these the components of u, so that
x = (1 − (M + 1)−M )y + u with y ∈ Conv(P). Thus x is a convex combination of y and (M + 1)M u.
We know (M + 1)M u is in the positive sector so it is clear that for λ large enough, (M + 1)M u ∈
Conv(Q), thus completing the proof. Since there are a finite number of convex geometries on
X, there exists a uniformly large enough λ. But, a construction is of interest and in particular
u j ≤ −M − (1 − (M + 1)−M )(−(M + 1)M ) < (M + 1)M , so λ = (M + 1)M+1 suffices.

Evidently Lemma 1, Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 together show that for a suitable choice of λ
we have our original geometry L is isomorphic to L1 = L2 = L3 , with this last being a generalized
convex shelling. Therefore, from Theorem 2 we then have Theorem 1. Furthermore, one may
notice from the proof that the coordinates of the embedding may be taken to be integral, so that a
generalized convex shelling into ZN is obtained.

Definition 4. For a convex geometry L, its geometric dimension dim(L) is defined as the lowest
dimension for which the convex geometry is isomorphic to a generalized convex shelling.
Definition 5. (Edelman and Saks [8], Section 2) For a convex geometry L, its convex dimension
cdim(L) is defined as the least number of orderings with which it can be represented as in Definition 3.
The proofs of Lemma 1 and Theorems 3 and 4 together show that any convex geometry L
represented by k orderings may be embedded into Rk as a generalized convex shelling. On the
other hand, the proof of Theorem 2.8 in [13] presents an embedding into R|E| . Therefore, we have
the following corollary.
Corollary 1. For any convex geometry L over E, dim(L) ≤ min(|E|, cdim(L)).
The upper bounds in the corollary are trivially optimal when cdim(L) = 1. The following
examples show that for cdim(L) > 1 it is possible for the bound dim(L) ≤ cdim(L) to be optimal
or very far from optimal. In the first example the bound dim(L) ≤ cdim(L) from our construction
is much better than that from the argument in [13].
Example 1 (Optimal dimension bound from number of orderings). Let E = {a, b, c} and L =
{∅, {a}, {a, b}, {a, c}, E}. Observe that L can be represented by the two orderings c ≺1 b ≺1 a and
b ≺2 c ≺2 a, thus dim(L) ≤ 2. If it were possible to embed E in R so as to obtain L from the
generalized convex shelling with respect to a set Q we would have both Conv(Q) ∩ E = ∅ and
a ∈ Conv({b} ∪ Q) ∩ Conv({c} ∪ Q). It follows easily that if I1 and I2 are the components of R \ {a}
then ∅ , Q ⊂ I1 and {b, c} ⊂ I2 , so without loss of generality we may suppose that q < a < b < c
for all q ∈ Q. Then Conv({c} ∪ Q) ∩ E = E in contradiction to the fact that {a, c} is convex. We
conclude that L cannot be given by a generalized convex shelling in R and therefore dim(L) = 2.
Comparing this to Corollary 1 we see that in this case 2 = dim(L) = cdim(L) < |E| = 3.
The above construction can be generalized to obtain a family of examples with 2 = dim(L) = k
and arbitrarily large finite |E| ≥ 3: Take E ⊇ {a, b, c} and let ≺1 , ≺2 to be any extension of the
orderings given above over {a, b, c}. Then the convex geometry induced by ≺1 , ≺2 as in Definition 3
has dimension at most 2 by Corollary 1 and at least 2 by the previous argument, yet |E| may be
arbitrarily large.
Example 2 (Non-optimal dimension bound from number of orderings). Let E be a finite subset
of the unit circle in R2 with the standard convexity, so L is the power set 2E . If |E| ≥ 3, then
dim(L) = 2 (and otherwise dim(L) = 1). Suppose L is represented by orderings ≺1 , . . . , ≺k . If
x ∈ E then E \ {x} is convex, so from Definition 3 there is j x so that x is minimal with respect to
≺ jx . Additionally, if a set of orderings minimally ranks each element, then this set represents L.
Thus, cdim(L) = |E|, which may be arbitrarily large in comparison to dim(L).
Example 3 (Lower-bounded finite lattices). As mentioned in the introduction, two papers [1] and
[17] found that lower-bounded lattices can be generalized convex shelled into Qn . To understand
whether an atomic finite convex geometry L on E is lower-bounded, the relation D is defined on
the elements of E by aDb if there is a set a ∈ A ⊆ E so that the convex hull of A contains b
and the convex hull of A\a does not. The lower-bound condition states that D is acyclic. Notice
that this restriction prevents the convexity configuration of four points on a line a − b − c − d,
5

because there bDc (because c is in the convex hull of b, d and not d) and likewise cDb. One convex
geometry which is lower-bounded can be specified by a three level poset, E = A ∪ B ∪ C where
A, B, C are distinct non-empty sets and a ≺ b ≺ c ∀a ∈ A, b ∈ B, c ∈ C. For this poset, G ∈ L
if G = {x : ∃a, b ∈ G s.t. a  x  b}.2 According to the construction of [17], the dimension of
the embedding of G is the number of D-chains, which is |B|(|A| + |C|) + |E|. So, for example, if
|A| = |B| = |C| = n/3, then the dimension of the embedding is 2n2 /9 + n. This is larger than the n
embedding of [13]. In fact, one may also notice that cdim(L) = max(|B|, |C|)+max(|A|, |B|) = 2n/3
(every ordering is of the type A > B > C where each member of B, C must be relatively minimal or
of the type C > B > A, again with minimality restrictions). In general, for poset convex geometries,
if the poset’s width is less than half of all elements, then cdim(L) < |E|.
In [8], the authors study the lattice of convex sets in a convex geometry using various latticetheoretic notions of dimension, including the convex dimension cdim described above. In this
paper we have related the lattice-theoretic notion of cdim with the geometric dimension notion
dim due to [13]. From the examples it is apparent that these dimensional notions are generally
distinct although there are cases where the two values coincide. One question of interest would be
a characterization of such geometries. It might also be interesting to know whether there are cases
where dim(L) = |E| , 1.
3. Embeddings of Convex Geometries as Convex Polygons
The idea of giving a concrete realization of a convex geometry as an easily visualized set of
shapes in R2 is due to [5], who views this as a important special case of an embedding of a convex
geometry. A particular case is an embedding as convex polygons in Rn .
Definition 6. Let Pn denote the set of convex polygons with vertices in Rn . An embedding of a
convex geometry L as convex polygons in Rn is a map F : L → Pn such that
L = ∅ ∪ {X ⊆ E : ∀y ∈ E, F (y) ⊆ Conv(F (X)) ⇒ y ∈ X}.

(1)

For notational simplicity, in what follows we will write P for P2 .
Remark 1. Note that similar definitions can be given for other families of shapes. For example,
F is an embedding of L as circles in R2 if the above definition holds with Pn replaced by the set C
of circles in R2 .
The results of the previous section prove that a convex geometry with cdim = n can be embedded as convex polygons in Rn by x → Conv(F(x) ∪ Q). In this section we improve on that result by
showing that any finite convex geometry can be embedded as convex polygons in R2 . This result
is in the spirit of [5], who proves that convex geometries of dimension 2 may be embedded as a
finite, separated, concave set of collinear circles in R2 and that such an embedding characterizes
these geometries.3 From a special case of our argument we also obtain Corollary 4.6 of [5], which
2

A poset of height four or more with this convexity would not generate a lower bounded lattice.
Higher dimensional convex geometries may also be embeddable as circles, but it is not known if this is generally true. Whether three-dimensional convex geometries are embeddable as circles is a fascinating open question,
specifically (4.6) of [5].

is that any convex geometry of dimension ≤ 2 can be embedded as intervals in R. Intervals in R
are a common object of study between the present paper and [5] as they are both convex polygons
and circles.
Lemma 3. If F : E → P define LF to be the right side of (1). If F is strongly injective, meaning
that if x , y then F (x) and F (y) have no common extreme points (i.e. vertices of their convex
polygons) then LF is a convex geometry.
Proof. Evidently both ∅ and E are in LF , so we check conditions 2 and 3 of Defintion 1. For
condition 2, let X, Y ∈ LF and z ∈ E. If F (z) ⊆ Conv(F (X ∩ Y)) ⊆ Conv(F (X)) ∩ Conv(F (Y)),
then z ∈ X ∩ Y. Thus X ∩ Y ∈ LF as required.
To check condition 3 it is easier to use the equivalent anti-exchange property. Suppose X ∈ LF
and there are distinct y, z < X. Then Conv(F (X) ∪ F (y) ∪ F (z)) 1 Conv(F (X)) so has a vertex p
from either F (y) or F (z). If in addition F (z) ⊂ Conv(F (X) ∪ F (y)) then the fact that F (y) and
F (z) have no common vertices implies p ∈ F (y) and thus F (y) 1 Conv(F (X) ∪ F (z)), verifying
anti-exchange.

Theorem 5. Any convex geometry may be embedded as convex polygons in R2 .
Proof. A convex geometry of convex dimension 1 is specified by a single order x1 ≻ . . . ≻ xn . This
convex geometry can be embedded in R as a nested set of intervals where F (x1 ) ⊂ . . . ⊂ F (xn ).
Take a convex geometry of convex dimension n ≥ 2 and for 1 ≤ i ≤ n let the function
ji : E → N be the ranking according to the ith order as in Section 2. Formally, recall that for
each ordering ≻i , the set E can be arranged as xi1 ≻i xi2 ≻i · · · ≻i xiN and ji (x) is the unique
choice such that x = xi ji (x) . That is, ji (x) denotes x’s place according to the ith ordering. For
each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let vi = (cos(2πi/n), sin(2πi/n)) ∈ R2 and define F i (x) = (Cn (E) + ji (x))vi , where
Cn = 2|E|/(| sec(2π/n)| − 1). Each F i (x) is a point on a ray at angle 2πi/n and will define the ith
vertex for the convex polygon F (x). That is, we set F (x) = Conv(F 1 (x), . . . , F n (x)). Clearly the
origin (0, 0) ∈ Conv(F (X)).
We now show LF = L. Suppose X ⊂ E is not in L. Then there is z < X so that for each i, there
exists xi ∈ X with z ≻i xi . Thus ji (xi ) > ji (z) and |F i (xi )| > |F i (z)| for all i. Using that (0, 0) ∈ F (x) it

easily follows that F (z) = Conv {F 1 (x1 ), . . . , F n (xn )} ⊆ Conv(F (x1 )∪· · ·∪F (xn )) ⊆ Conv(F (X)).
But z < X and F(z) ⊆ Conv F (X) implies X < LF , so LF ⊂ L.
Conversely, take a set X ∈ L and z < X. Then there is some i so that for all x ∈ X we have
x ≻i z and therefore ji (z) ≥ ji (x) + 1. Rotate so i = n and let r = max{|F n (x)| : x ∈ X}. It is clear
that

Conv(F (X)) ⊂ Conv {(Cn (E) + |E|)v1 , . . . , (Cn (E) + |E|)vn−1 , rvn } ,
but the first component of any (Cn (E) + |E|)vk does not exceed (Cn (E) + |E|) cos(2π/n) ≤
(Cn (E) + |E|)| cos(2π/n)| ≤ Cn < Cn + jn (z). The first component of rvn is r < Cn + jn (z), so
F n (z) < Conv(F (X)) and F (z) 1 Conv(F (X)). Thus X ∈ LF and L = LF .

The proof of the above theorem demonstrates that any convex geometry of dimension 2 may
be embedded into the real line as intervals.
