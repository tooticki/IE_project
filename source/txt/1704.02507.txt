Introduction

The methods of spectral geometry are useful for investigating the metric aspects of noncommutative geometry
[1, 3–5] and in these contexts require extensive use of pseudo-differential operators. In the foundational
paper [2], Connes showed that, by direct analogy with the theory [12–14] of pseudo-differential operators
on Rn , one may derive a similar pseudo-differential calculus on noncommutative n tori Tnθ . With the
development of this calculus came many results concerning the local differential geometry of noncommutative
tori for n = 2, 4, as shown in the groundbreaking paper [7] in which the Gauss–Bonnet theorem on T2θ
is proved and later papers [6, 8–11]. In these papers, the flat geometry of Tnθ which was studied in [2]
is conformally perturbed using a Weyl factor given by a positive invertible smooth element in C ∞ (Tnθ ).
Connes’ pseudodifferential calculus is critically used to apply heat kernel techniques to geometric operators
on Tnθ to derive small time heat kernel expansions that encode local geometric information such as scalar
curvature. As discovered in [6,9,11], a purely noncommutative feature that appears in the computations and
in the final formula for the curvature is the modular automorphism of the state implementing the conformal
perturbation of the metric.
Certain details of the proofs in the derivation of the calculus in [2] were omitted, such as the evaluation
of oscillatory integrals, so we make it the objective of this paper to fill in all the details. After reproving in
more detail the formula for the symbol of the adjoint of a pseudo-differential operator and the formula for
the symbol of a product of two pseudo-differential operators, we define the corresponding analog of Sobolev
spaces for which we prove the Sobolev and Rellich lemmas. We then extend these results to finitely generated
projective right modules over the noncommutative n torus.
We list these results below.
Theorem 1.1. Suppose P is a pseudodifferential operator with symbol σ(P ) = ρ = ρ(ξ) of order M . Then
the symbol of the adjoint P ∗ is of order M and satisfies

product QP is of order M1 + M2 and satisfies

Preliminaries

Fix some skew symmetric n × n matrix θ with upper triangular entries in R\Q that are linearly independent
over Q. Consider the irrational rotation C ∗ -algebra Aθ with n unitary generators U1 , . . . , Un which satisfy
Uk Uj = e2πiθj,k Uj Uk and Uj∗ = Uj−1 . Let {αs }s∈Rn be a n-parameter group of automorphisms given by
Q m
Q mj
7→ eis·m j Uj j . We define the subalgebra Akθ of C k elements of Aθ to be those a ∈ Aθ such that
j Uj
the mapping Rn → Aθ given by s 7→ αs (a) is C k , and we define the subalgebra A∞
θ of smooth elements of Aθ
to be those a ∈ Aθ such that the mapping Rn → Aθ given by s 7→ αs (a) is smooth. An alternative definition
of theP

θ of smooth elements is the elements in Aθ that can be expressed by an expansion of the
m
form m∈Zn am j Uj j , where the sequence {am }m∈Zn is in the Schwartz space S(Zn ) in the sense that,

The integral above does not converge absolutely; it is an oscillatory integral. We define oscillatory
integrals below as in [13].
Definition 2.2. Let q be a nondegenerate real quadratic form on Rn , a be a C ∞ complex-valued function
defined on Rn such that the functions (1 + |x|2 )−m/2 ∂ α a(x) are bounded on Rn for all α ∈ Zn≥0 , and ϕ be a
Schwartz function, i.e. the functions xα ∂ β ϕ(x) are bounded on Rn for all pairs α, β ∈ Zn≥0 . Suppose further
that ϕ(0) = 1. Then the limit
Z
eiq(x) a(x)ϕ(ǫx) dx
R
exists, is independent of ϕ (as long as
= 1), and is equal to eiq(x) a(x) dx when a ∈ L1 . When a 6∈ L1 ,
R ϕ(0)
we continue to denote this limit by eiq(x) a(x) dx, and have an estimate

where Cq,m depends only on the quadratic form q and the order m.
As shown in [13], oscillatory integrals behave essentially like absolutely convergent integrals in that one
can still make changes of variables, integrate by parts, differentiate under the integral sign, and interverse
integral signs. Given certain conditions on ρ, Pρ (a) satisfies the conditions of the oscillatory integral, and
we can evaluate Pρ (a).
Definition 2.3. An element ρ = ρ(ξ) = ρ(ξ1 , . . . , ξn ) of C ∞ (Rn , A∞
θ ) is a symbol of order m if and only if
for all non-negative integers i1 , . . . , in , j1 , . . . , jn
||δ1i1 · · · δnin (∂1j1 · · · ∂njn ρ)(ξ)|| ≤ Cρ (1 + |ξ|)m−|j| .
Example 2.6(i) of [13] gives a convenient formula for evaluating the oscillatory integrals that appear in
our calculation of Pρ (a).
Proposition 2.4. Suppose that, for some m, a is a C ∞ complex-valued function defined on Rn such that
the functions (1 + |x|2 )−m/2 ∂ α a(x) are bounded on Rn for all α ∈ Zn≥0 . Then

Asymptotic formula for the symbol of the adjoint of a pseudodifferential operator

Here we prove the formula for the symbol of the adjoint for the noncommutative n torus, adapting the proof
of Lemma 1.2.3 of [12] to the noncommutative n torus.

Asymptotic formula for the symbol of a product of two pseudodifferential operators

Next we prove the formula for the product or composition of symbols for the noncommutative n torus,
adapting the proof of Theorem 7.1 of [14].
Theorem 4.1. Suppose that P is a pseudodifferential operator with symbol σ(P ) = ρ = ρ(ξ) of order M1 ,
and Q is a pseudodifferential operator with symbol σ(Q) = φ = φ(ξ) of order M2 . Then the symbol of the
product QP is of order M1 + M2 and satisfies

Sobolev spaces on the noncommutative n torus

Let λ(ξ) = (1 + ξ12 + · · · + ξn2 )1/2 . Consider the following inner product on A∞
θ .
∞
Definition 5.1. Define the Sobolev inner product h·, ·is : A∞
θ × Aθ → C by
X
ha, bis := hPλs (a), Pλs (b)i =
(1 + |m1 |2 + · · · + |mn |2 )s bm am .
m

Note that for s = 0 this agrees with h·, ·i. This inner product induces the following norm.
Definition 5.2. Define the Sobolev norm || · ||s : A∞
θ → R≥0 by
X
||a||2s := hPλs (a), Pλs (a)i =
(1 + |m1 |2 + · · · + |mn |2 )s |am |2 .
m

Using this norm, we can define the analog of Sobolev spaces on the noncommutative n torus.
Definition 5.3. Define the Sobolev space H s to be the completion of A∞
θ with respect to || · ||s .
We can prove that a pseudo-differential operator of order d ∈ R continuously maps H s into H s−d .
However we must first prove the case where s = d.
Theorem 5.4. Suppose ρ ∈ S d . Then ||Pρ (a)||0 ≤ C||a||d for some constant C > 0 and Pρ defines a bounded
operator Pρ : H d → H 0 .
Q m
Proof. Note that { j Uj j : m ∈ Zn } is an orthogonal basis with respect to h·, ·is which is orthonormal in

the case s = 0. We have || j Uj j ||20 = 1, ||ρm (ξ) j Uj j ||20 = |ρm (ξ)|2 , and ||ρ(ξ)||20 = m |ρm (ξ)|2 . Since
ρ is of order d, we have ||ρ(ξ)||0 ≤ Cρ (1 + |ξ|)d , and since (1 − |ξ|)2 ≥ 0 gives us (1 + |ξ|)2 ≤ 2(1 + |ξ|2 ), we
have
||ρ(ξ)||20 ≤ Cρ2 (1 + |ξ|)2d ≤ Cρ2 2d (1 + |ξ|2 )d .
Let kρ := Cρ2 2d . Then we have

|ρm (ξ)|2 ≤ kρ (1 + |ξ|2 )d .

Let es,m := (1 + |m1 |2 + · · · + |mn |2 )−s/2 j Uj j and Es := {es,m | m ∈ Zn }. By definition we have
Es orthonormal with respect to h·, ·is . It suffices to prove this theorem for the case a = ed,m by the

For the general case s 6= d we need to prove a lemma saying that || · ||s = || · ||s−t ◦ Pλt .

Lemma 5.5. For any a ∈ A∞
with ||a||s = ||Pλt (a)||s−t .
θ and s, t ∈ R, a ∈ H if and only if Pλt (a) ∈ H

10

Proof. Suppose that a ∈ H s or Pλt (a) ∈ H s−t . Then

(1 + |m1 |2 + · · · + |mn |2 )s |am |2

= ||a||s
so we know that a ∈ H s and Pλt (a) ∈ H s−t .
Then the general case follows quite easily.
Corollary 5.6. Suppose ρ ∈ S d . Then ||Pρ (a)||s−d ≤ C||a||s for some constant C > 0 and Pρ defines a
bounded operator Pρ : H s → H s−d .
Proof. By Lemma 5.5, we have ||Pρ (a)||s−d = ||Pλs−d (Pρ (a))||0 . By Theorem 4.1, the symbol σ(Pλs−d ◦ Pρ )
is of order d + (s − d) = s, so Theorem 5.4 gives us ||Pλs−d (Pρ (a))||0 ≤ C||a||s for some constant C > 0.
We can also define an analog of the C k norm for the noncommutative n torus.
Definition 5.7. Define the C k norm || · ||∞,k : A∞
θ → R≥0 as follows:
X
||δ ℓ (a)||C ∗

so by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we get

||a||∞,0 ≤ ||a||0 ≤ C||a||s and H s ⊆ A0θ .

We get the following corollary.

We can also prove an analog of the Rellich lemma for the noncommutative n torus.

Theorem 5.10. Let {aN } ∈ A∞
θ be a sequence. Suppose that there is a constant C so that ||aN ||s ≤ C for
all N . Let s > t. Then there is a subsequence {aNj } that converges in H t .
Qn

Proof. Let es,m := (1 + |m1 |2 + · · · + |mn |2 )−s/2 j=1
PUj and Es := {es,m | m ∈ Z }. Es is an orthonormal

X
|aN,k |2 ≤
|aN,k |2 ≤ C 2
k

and |aN,k | ≤ C. Applying the Arzela-Ascoli theorem to {aN,k } for some fixed k, we can get a subsequence
{aNj ,k } of {aN,k } such that for any ǫ > 0 there exists M (ǫ) ∈ N such that |aNi ,k − aNj ,k | < ǫ whenever
i, j ≥ M (ǫ). Do this for all |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 ≤ r, replacing {aN } with {aNj } each time. Then we get a
subsequence {aNj } of {aN } such that for any ǫ > 0 there exists M (ǫ) ∈ N such that, for all |k1 |2 +· · ·+|kn |2 ≤
r, |aNi ,k − aNj ,k | < ǫ whenever i, j ≥ M (ǫ). Now consider the sum
X
||aNi − aNj ||2t =
|aNi ,k − aNj ,k |2 (1 + |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 )t−s .
k

12

Decompose it into two parts: one where |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 > r2 and one where |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 ≤ r. On
|k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 > r2 we estimate
(1 + |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 )t−s < (1 + r2 )t−s
so that
X

|k1 |2 +···+|kn |2 ≥r 2

|aNi ,k − aNj ,k |2 (1 + |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 )t−s < (1 + r2 )t−s

2 t−s

≤ 2C (1 + r )

|aNi ,k − aNj ,k |2
.

If ǫ > 0 is given, we choose r so that 2C 2 (1 + r2 )t−s < ǫ. The remaining part of√the sum is over |k1 |2 + · · · +
|kn |2 ≤ r2 and can be bounded above by ǫ′ := ǫ − 2C 2 (1 + r2 )t−s if i, j ≥ M ( n ǫ′ /(2r + 1)) because a ball
of radius r centered at the origin is contained in a cube of side length 2r that has (2r + 1)n lattice points.
Then the total sum is bounded above by ǫ, and we are done.

The pseudodifferential calculus on finitely generated projective
modules over the noncommutative n torus

We can generalize these results to arbitrary finitely generated projective right modules over the noncommutative n torus following p. 553 of [4], which considers finitely generated projective modules over an arbitrary

the rest of the proof reduces to the r = 1 case, applying it to each summand in the above sum.
Let λ(ξ) = (1 + ξ12 + · · · + ξn2 )1/2 idE . Consider the following inner product on E.
Definition 6.2. Define the Sobolev inner product h·, ·is : E × E → C by
X
(1 + |m1 |2 + · · · + |mn |2 )s bj,m aj,m .
h~a, ~bis := hPλs (~a), Pλs (~b)i =

Note that for s = 0 this agrees with h·, ·i. This inner product induces the following norm.
Definition 6.3. Define the Sobolev norm || · ||s : E → R≥0 by
X
(1 + |m1 |2 + · · · + |mn |2 )s |aj,m |2 .
||~a||2s := hPλs (~a), Pλs (~a)i =

Using this norm, we can define the analog of Sobolev spaces on E.
Definition 6.4. Define the Sobolev space H s to be the completion of E with respect to || · ||s .
We can prove that a pseudo-differential operator of order d ∈ R continuously maps H s into H s−d .
However we must first prove the case where s = d.
Theorem 6.5. Suppose ρ is a matrix valued symbol of order d. Then, for any ~a ∈ E, ||Pρ (~a)||0 ≤ C||~a||d

Proof. Q
Let F := {fj : 1 ≤ j ≤ r} be an orthogonal eigenbasis of e normalized with respect to h·, ·i. Note

(1 + |ξ|) ≤ 2(1 + |ξ| ), we have
||ρ(ξ)h,j ||20 ≤ Cρ2 (1 + |ξ|)2d ≤ Cρ2 2d (1 + |ξ|2 )d .

For the general case s 6= d we need to prove a lemma saying that || · ||s = || · ||s−t ◦ Pλt .

Lemma 6.6. For any ~a ∈ E and s, t ∈ R, ~a ∈ H s if and only if Pλt (~a) ∈ H s−t with ||~a||s = ||Pλt (~a)||s−t .
Proof. Suppose that ~a ∈ H s or Pλt (~a) ∈ H s−t . Then
X
(1 + |m1 |2 + · · · + |mn |2 )s−t λ2t (m)|aj,m |2
||Pλt (~a)||2s−t =

(1 + |m1 |2 + · · · + |mn |2 )s |aj,m |2

= ||~a||s
so we know that ~a ∈ H s and Pλt (~a) ∈ H s−t .
16

Then the general case follows quite easily.
Corollary 6.7. Suppose ρ is a matrix valued symbol of order d. Then ||Pρ (~a)||s−d ≤ C||~a||s for some
constant C > 0 and Pρ defines a bounded operator Pρ : H s → H s−d .
Proof. By Lemma 6.6, we have ||Pρ (~a)||s−d = ||Pλs−d (Pρ (~a))||0 . By Proposition 6.1(b), the matrix valued
symbol σ(Pλs−d ◦ Pρ ) is of order d + (s − d) = s, so Theorem 6.5 gives us ||Pλs−d (Pρ (~a))||0 ≤ C||~a||s for some
constant C > 0.
We can also define an analog of the C k norm on E.
Definition 6.8. Define the C k norm || · ||∞,k : E → R≥0 as follows:
X
||δ ℓ (~a)||C ∗
||~a||∞,k :=
|ℓ|≤k

where the C ∗ norm || · ||C ∗ is given by
||~a||2C ∗ := sup{|λ| : ~a∗~a − λ · 1 not invertible}.

We can easily prove an analog of the Sobolev lemma on E as follows.
Theorem 6.9. For s > k + 1, H s ⊆ (Akθ )r e.

Since 2s > 2, (1 + |m1 |2 + · · · + |mn |2 )−s is summable over m ∈ Zn and j ∈ {1, . . . , r} so ||~a||20 ≤ C||~a||s .
Thus we get ||~a||∞,0 ≤ ||~a||0 ≤ C||~a||s and H s ⊆ (A0θ )r e.
Now suppose k > 0. Using what we’ve proven for the previous case, we have

T sinces H is the completion of (Aθ ) e with respect to || · ||s , (Aθ ) e ⊆ H

for all s ∈ R, and (Aθ ) e ⊆ s∈R H .
We can also prove an analog of the Rellich lemma on E.

Theorem 6.11. Let {~aN } ∈ (A∞
aN ||s ≤ C
θ ) e be a sequence. Suppose that there is a constant C so that ||~
for all N . Let s > t. Then there is a subsequence {~aNj } that converges in H t .

Proof. Let F := {fj : 1 ≤ j ≤ r} be a set of eigenvectors of e normalized with respect
h·, ·i, where fj has
Q to
m
and Es := {es,m |
corresponding eigenvalue λj for 1 ≤ j ≤ r. Let es,m := (1+|m1 |2 +· · ·+|mn |2 )−s/2 g Ug gP
n, m ∈ Z}. Es F is an orthonormal basis with respect to h·, ·is , so we can write ~aN := h,k aN,h,k es,k fh .
Then
X
|aN,h,k |2 ≤
|aN,h,k |2 ≤ C 2
h,k

and |aN,h,k | ≤ C. Applying the Arzela-Ascoli theorem to {aN,h,k } for some fixed (h, k), we can get a
subsequence {aNj ,h,k } of {aN,h,k } such that for any ǫ > 0 there exists M (ǫ) ∈ N such that |aNi ,h,k −aNj ,h,k | <
ǫ whenever i, j ≥ M (ǫ). Do this for all 1 ≤ h ≤ r and |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 ≤ R, replacing {aN } with {aNj }
each time. Then we get a subsequence {aNj } of {aN } such that for any ǫ > 0 there exists M (ǫ) ∈ N such
that, for all 1 ≤ h ≤ r and |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 ≤ R, |aNi ,h,k − aNj ,h,k | < ǫ whenever i, j ≥ M (ǫ). Now consider
the sum
X
||aNi − aNj ||2t =
|aNi ,h,k − aNj ,h,k |2 (1 + |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 )t−s .
h,k

Decompose it into two parts: one where |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 > R2 and one where |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 ≤ R2 . On
|k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 > R2 we estimate
(1 + |k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 )t−s < (1 + R2 )t−s

If ǫ > 0 is given, we choose R so that 2rC 2 (1 + R2 )t−s < ǫ. The remaining part of the√ sum is over
|k1 |2 + · · · + |kn |2 ≤ R2 and can be bounded above by ǫ′ := ǫ − 2rC 2 (1 + R2 )t−s if i, j ≥ M ( n ǫ′ /(2R + 1))
because a ball of radius R centered at the origin is contained in a cube of side length 2R that has (2R + 1)2
lattice points. Then the total sum is bounded above by ǫ, and we are done.
