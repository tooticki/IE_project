Abstract. For an orientable manifold M whose dimension is less than 4, we
use the contractibility of certain complexes associated to its submanifolds to
cut M into simpler pieces in order to do local to global arguments. One of
the deep theorems of Thurston in foliation theory is a homology h-principle
theorem that says the natural map
BHomeoδ (M ) → BHomeo(M ),
induces a homology isomorphism where Homeoδ (M ) denotes the group of
homeomorphisms of M made discrete. In low dimensions, we give a different
proof of this theorem without using foliation theory. Secondly, we show that
the same method applies to give a different proof of the h-principle theorem
in smoothing theory i.e. the map
BDiff(M ) → BHomeo(M )
is a weak equivalence.
Finally, we give a different proof that the diffeomorphism groups of Haken
3-manifolds with boundary are homotopically discrete.

1. Introduction
Often, in h-principle type theorems (e.g. Smale-Hirsch theory), it is easy to check
that the statement holds for the open disks (local data) and then one wishes to
glue them together to prove that the statement holds for closed compact manifolds
(global statement). But there are cases where one has a local statement for a
closed disk relative to the boundary. To use such local data to great effect, instead
of covering the manifold by open balls, we use certain “resolutions” associated to
submanifolds (see Section 2) to cut the manifold into disks.
The first example of this sort is from smoothing theory. Let Diff(Dn , ∂Dn )
denote the group of compactly supported C ∞ -diffeomorphisms of the interior of the
disk Dn with C ∞ -topology and let Homeo(Dn , ∂Dn ) denote the group of compactly
supported homeomorphisms of the interior of the disk Dn with the C 0 -topology. By
the Alexander trick, we know that the group Homeo(Dn , ∂Dn ) is contractible for
all n. On the other hand, it is a well-known theorem of Smale that Diff(D2 , ∂D2 ) is
contractible and by the theorem of Hatcher ([Hat83]) so is Diff(D3 , ∂D3 ). Therefore
the natural map between classifying spaces
BDiff(Dn , ∂Dn ) → BHomeo(Dn , ∂Dn ),
is a weak equivalence for n = 2 and n = 3. The h-principle theorem in smoothing
theory for low dimensional manifolds says
Theorem 1.1 (Earle-Eells, Hamstrom, Cerf). For a smooth manifold M , the map
(1.2)

η ∶ BDiff(M ) → BHomeo(M ),

is a weak equivalence provided dim(M ) = 2 (see [Ham74]) or dim(M ) = 3 (see
[Cer61]). Similar version holds for manifolds with boundary.

The second example is from foliation theory. Let Homeoδ (Dn , ∂Dn ) denote the
same group as Homeo(Dn , ∂Dn ) but with the discrete topology. By an infinite
repetition trick due to Mather ([Mat71]), it is known that BHomeoδ (Dn , ∂Dn ) is
acyclic. Therefore, the natural map
BHomeoδ (Dn , ∂Dn ) → BHomeo(Dn , ∂Dn )
induced by the identity homomorphism is in particular a homology isomorphism.
Thurston generalized Mather’s work on foliation theory in [Thu74a] and as a corollary he obtained the following surprising result.
Theorem 1.3 (Thurston). For a smooth manifold M , the map
ι ∶ BHomeoδ (M ) → BHomeo(M ),
induces an isomorphism on homology.
The first proof of this theorem in the literature was given by McDuff following
Segal’s program in foliation theory (see [McD80]). Thurston in fact proved a more
general homology h-principle theorem for foliations such that Theorem 1.3 is just
its consequence for C 0 -foliations.
In foliation theory, Haefliger defined a topological groupoid Γrq whose space of objects are points in Rq with the usual topology and the space of morphisms between
two points is given by germs of C r -diffeomorphisms sending x to y (see [Hae71,
Section 1] for more details). The homotopy type of the classifying space of this
groupoid, BΓrq , plays an important role in the classification of C r -foliations (see
[Thu74b] and [Thu76]). One of Thurston’s deep theorem in foliation theory relates
the homotopy type of BΓrq to the group homology of C r -diffeomorphism groups
made discrete. For r = 0, he first uses Mather’s theorem ([Mat71]) to show that
BΓ0q is weakly equivalent to the classifying space of rank q microbundles, BTop(q),
and as a consequence he deduces that the map ι in Theorem 1.3 is in fact acyclic.
In the theory of foliations and smoothing theory respectively, people have studied
the homotopy fiber of the maps ι and η. In fact there are general h-prinicple
theorems in all dimensions that identify the homotopy fibers as holonomic sections
of certain section spaces associated to the manifold. Our goal in this paper is
to show that in low dimensions one can directly study the maps instead of their
homotopy fibers. To do so, we provide the strategy in detail for Theorem 1.3 in
low dimensions that does not use any foliation theory and the method is general
enough that can unify the proof of Theorem 1.1 for both dimensions 2 and 3.
The reason that we restrict ourselves to low dimensions is that for surfaces and 3manifolds, there is a procedure to split up the manifold into disks. For the surfaces,
this procedure is given by cutting along handles. But for 3-manifolds, it is more
subtle. To do so, we use the prime decomposition theorem and Haken’s hierarchy
to cut the manifold into disks.
Finally using this technique, we also give a different proof of the contractibility
of the identity component of diffeomorphisms in low dimensions.
Theorem 1.4 (Earle-Schatz, Hatcher). The identity components of diffeomorphism
groups of surfaces with boundary (see [ES70]) and Haken manifolds with boundary
(see [Hat76]) are contractible.
Instead of working with the diffeomorphisms groups, we work with their classifying spaces. Considering the delooping of these topological groups has the advantage
that one can apply homological techniques to the classifying spaces to extract homotopical information about diffeomorphism groups.

1.1. Outline. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe semisimplicial resolutions for the classifying spaces of homeomorphisms using embedded
submanifolds. We will treat the case of three manifolds separately because we
first have to cut three manifolds into their prime pieces. In Section 3, given the
techniques of the previous section, we prove a theorem of Cerf that Diff 0 (M ) ↪
Homeo0 (M ) is a weak homotopy equivalence where M is a three manifold. In
Section 4, we give a short proof of the contractibility of the identity component of
the diffeomorphism groups for certain low dimensional manifolds.
Acknowledgment. I am indebted to Allen Hatcher for his careful reading and
many helpful comments on different versions of this paper. I first aimed to prove
Thurston’s theorem without using foliation theory in all dimensions but Hatcher
pointed out a flaw in my argument for manifolds of dimension larger than 4 which
made me focus only on low dimensional manifolds. I would also thank Sander
Kupers for his comments on transversality issues for topological manifolds and
answering my questions about topological embeddings. Finally, I am also grateful
to Søren Galatius for his comments on the first draft of this paper and to Kathryn
Mann for her comment on Theorem 2.44.
2. Resolving classifying spaces by embedded submanifolds
Let us first sketch the idea for Theorem 1.3. Let M be a smooth manifold and let
Homeo0 (M ) denote the group of the identity component of the topological group
Homeo(M ). Note that the group of connected components π0 (Homeo(M )) is a
discrete group and sits in a short exact sequence
1 → Homeo0 (M ) → Homeo(M ) → π0 (Homeo(M )) → 1.
An easy spectral sequence argument reduces Theorem 1.3 to proving that the map
BHomeoδ0 (M ) → BHomeo0 (M ),
induces a homology isomorphism. To prove this version, we want to inductively
reduce Theorem 1.3 to the case of a simpler manifold. Such simpler manifolds are
obtained from M by cutting along its submanifolds. Let φ be an embedding of
a manifold into M . To cut along this embedding, we construct a semisimplicial
space A● (M, φ) on which the topological group Homeo0 (M ) acts (see [ERW17] or
[RW16, Section 2] for definitions of (augmented) semisimplicial objects and their
fat realizations). Similarly we construct a semisimplicial set Aδ● (M, φ) from the underlying semisimplicial set of the semisimplicial space A● (M, φ) on which the group
Homeoδ0 (M ) acts. These semisimplicial spaces are constructed so that their fat realizations are weakly contractible. Therefore we obtain semisimplicial resolutions

∣A● (M, φ)//Homeoδ0 (M )∣ Ð

We then construct a zig-zag of maps from the space Aδ● (M, φ)//Homeoδ0 (M ) to the
space A● (M, φ)//Homeo0 (M ) that induces a homotopy commutative diagram

Therefore, it is enough to prove that f∗ is an isomorphism. As we shall see in
Section 2.1.4, proving that f∗ induces a homology isomorphism is equivalent to
the statement of Theorem 1.3 for a manifold that is obtained from M by cutting
it along φ. Then, by induction we can reduce Theorem 1.3 to the case of a disk
relative to its boundary that
BHomeoδ (Dn , ∂Dn ) → BHomeo(Dn , ∂Dn ),
induces a homology isomorphism. We restricted ourselves to low dimensions, because we still do not know how to make a certain surgery argument in Theorem 2.30
work in dimensions higher than 3.
We want to cut up M into disks in a “contractible space of choices” (e.g. see
Proposition 2.13 and Theorem 2.30). As we shall explain at the end of Section 2, the
easiest case is when M is homeomorphic to a circle (see also [Jek12, Theorem 4]).
For M being a surface, we define certain space of handles to cut the surface along
them. Finally if M is a three manifold, we first reduce to the case of irreducible
three manifolds and we cut it along incompressible surfaces in a “contractible space
of choices”. For this reason, we consider the case of three manifolds separately.
2.1. The case of surfaces. The first step is to reduce the statement of Theorem 1.3 to the case of the surfaces with boundary to be able to remove 1-handles.
Hence we first want to remove disks (0-handles) from a closed surface M . To consider different choices of 0-handles, we define a semisimplicial spaces. But we give
the definitions in all dimensions and restrict to the case of surfaces whenever it is
necessary.
Definition 2.1 (0-handle resolutions). We give both topological and discrete versions:
● Topological versions: Let [p] denote the set {0, 1, ..., p} of p + 1 ordered elements. Let
Ap (M ) = Emb(∐ Dn , M )
[p]

denote the subspace of the embedding space (equipped with compact-open topology) consisting of orientation preserving embeddings of p disjoint union of n-disks
that admit an external collar into the manifold M . The collection A● (M ) is a
semisimplicial space where the face maps are given by forgetting disks.
We also define an auxiliary semisimplicial space A● (M ) whose space of 0simplices is the same as A0 (M ) but its space of p-simplices is the subspace of
A0 (M )p+1 consisting of (p + 1)-tuples (φ0 , φ1 , . . . , φp ) where the centers of the
embedded disks φi are pairwise disjoint.
Note that the group Homeo0 (M ) acts on Ap (M ) 2 transitively. The 0-handle
resolution of BHomeo0 (M ) is defined to be the augmented semisimplicial space
X● (M ) ∶= A● (M )//Homeo0 (M ) → BHomeo0 (M ).
● Discrete version: We say two embeddings g1 and g2 in Emb(∐[p] Dn , M ) have
the same germ if there exists an open neighborhood U ⊂ Dn around the origin so
that g1 ∣∐[p] U = g2 ∣∐[p] U . Let
Aδ● (M ) ∶= Embg,δ (∐ Dn , M ),
[●]
2In fact the action is transitive in all dimensions thanks to the annulus theorem and the

hypothesis on having external collar for embedded disks is imposed so that the annulus theorem
holds.

denote the set of germs of embeddings of disjoint union of p + 1 disks compatible
δ
with the orientation of M . We define an auxiliary semisimplicial set A● (M )
which is given by the underlying set of the semisimplicial space A● (M ).
Also the 0-handle resolution for BHomeoδ0 (M ) is the augmented semisimplicial
space
X●δ (M ) ∶= Aδ● (M )//Homeoδ0 (M ) → BHomeoδ0 (M ),
Note that there are natural maps
≃

δ

A● (M ) Ð
→ A● (M ) ← A● (M ) → Aδ● (M ),
where the first map is the inclusion (it is easy to see that it induces a weak homotopy
equivalence levelwise), the second map is the identity map from the underlying set
of a topological space to itself and the last map is induced by taking germs of
embdeddings of disks at their centers.
2.1.1. The homotopy type of Xp (M ) and Xpδ (M ). To determine the homotopy type
of Xp (M ), fix an element ep ∈ Ap (M ). Let M /ep denote the manifold obtained
from M by removing the interior of the image of ep . The action of Homeo0 (M ) on
ep gives rise to a map
(2.2)

Homeo0 (M ) → Ap (M ).

Let Homeo(M, ep ) denote those homeomorphisms that are the identity on the image
of ep . The fiber over ep is the topological group Homeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )) whose
identity component is Homeo0 (M, ep ). But given that the embedding ep has a
collar, it is easy to show that the inclusion
(2.3)

Homeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )) ↪ Homeo0 (M, ep ),

is a weak homotopy equivalence.
Lemma 2.4. There is a quasi-fibration
(2.5)

Homeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )) → Homeo0 (M ) → Ap (M ).

Proof. We assume p = 0 and the argument for the general case is the same. Let us
recall the parametrized isotopy extension theorem in the topological setting ([BL74,
page 19]). We consider the simplicial set Emblf● (Dn , M ) whose k-simplices is given
by locally flat embeddings
∆k × Dn ↪ ∆k × M,
that lives over projection to ∆k . Let Sing● (Homeo0 (M )) be the singular set of
the homeomorphism group. Fixing an element in e0 ∈ Emblf● (Dn , M ), we have an
evaluation map
Sing● (Homeo0 (M )) → Emblf● (Dn , M ),
which is a Kan fibration. It is a well known result of Quillen ([Qui68]) that the
realization of the Kan fibration is a Serre fibration. Also for codimension zero
similar to codimension higher than two ([Las76, Appendix]), the natural map
∣Emblf● (Dn , M )∣ → Emb(Dn , M ) = A0 (M ),
is a weak homotopy equivalence. And by the theorem of Milnor ([Mil57]), the
natural map
∣Sing● (Homeo0 (M ))∣ → Homeo0 (M ),
is a weak homotopy equivalence. Hence the evaluation map Homeo0 (M ) → A0 (M )

is a quasi-fibration with the fiber Homeo0 (M /e0 , ∂(M /e0 )).

Recall that for a group G acting on a topological space X, we have a natural
map BStab(σ) → X//G where Stab(σ) is the stabilizer of an element σ ∈ X. Note
that for ep ∈ Ap (M ), the group Homeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )) is the stabilizer of ep for
the action of Homeo0 (M ) on Ap (M ). Therefore, we have a map
(2.6)

→ Ap (M )//Homeo0 (M ) = Xp (M ).
hp ∶ BHomeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )) Ð

Proposition 2.7. The map hp is a weak homotopy equivalence.
Proof. For brevity, let us denote Homeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )) by Hp . Note that we
have the following homotopy commutative diagram
Hp //Hp

Homeo0 (M )//Homeo0 (M )
g

(2.8)
BHp

hp

Ap (M )//Homeo0 (M ).

The left vertical map is a fibration with Hp as the fiber. If we show that g is a quasifibration with Hp as the fiber., then the comparison of the long exact sequence of
the (quasi)fibrations induced by vertical maps implies that hp is a weak homotopy
equivalence.
Recall that for a group G acting on a topological space X, the two sided bar
construction B● (X, G, ∗) = X × G● is a simplicial space with the usual face maps
and degeneracies. If G is a well-pointed topological group, the realization of the
two-sided bar construction B● (X, G, ∗) is a model for the homotopy quotient. Since
Homeo0 (M ) is a well-pointed group ([EK71]), the map g is induced by taking the
geometric realization of the simplicial map
g● ∶ B● (Homeo0 (M ), Homeo0 (M ), ∗) → B● (Ap (M ), Homeo0 (M ), ∗).
To prove that g is a quasi-fibration whose homotopy fiber is Hp , it is enough to
prove that the following diagram is homotopy cartesian
Homeo0 (M ) = B0 (Homeo0 (M ), Homeo0 (M ), ∗)

∣B● (Homeo0 (M ), Homeo0 (M ), ∗)∣
g

Ap (M ) = B0 (Ap (M ), Homeo0 (M ), ∗)

∣B● (Ap (M ), Homeo0 (M ), ∗)∣.

Using Segal’s gluing lemma ([Seg74, Proposition 1.6]), it is enough to show that
the diagram
Bk (Homeo0 (M ), Homeo0 (M ), ∗)

di

Bk−1 (Homeo0 (M ), Homeo0 (M ), ∗)

gk

gk−1

Bk (Ap (M ), Homeo0 (M ), ∗)

di

Bk−1 (Ap (M ), Homeo0 (M ), ∗),

is a homotopy cartesian for all face maps di , 0 ≤ i ≤ k. Since the multiplication in
Homeo0 (M ) has an inverse (see the discussion after [Seg74, Proposition 1.6]), it is
enough to show that the diagram
Homeo0 (M ) × Homeo0 (M )
(2.9)

is a homotopy cartesian. For this, note that g0 and g1 are quasi-fibrations and for
example the fiber of g1 over (ep , f ) is Homeo0 (M, ep ) (see Equation (2.3)) and the
fiber of g0 over f (ep ) is Homeo0 (M, f (ep )). Given that the action of Homeo0 (M )
on Ap (M ) is transitive, these two groups Homeo0 (M, ep ) and Homeo0 (M, f (ep ))
are homeomorphic. Therefore, the diagram 2.9 is homotopy cartesian.

Remark 2.10. The author does not know if the quasi-fibration 2.5 is a locally trivial
bundle similar to the smooth category. If this were true, the space Ap (M ) would become homeomorphic to Homeo0 (M )/Hp and therefore the proof of Proposition 2.7
would become much easier.
It is easier to determine the homotopy type of Xpδ (M ). To do so, let M (ep )
denote the manifold M with (p + 1) punctures at the centers of the germs of embedding of disks ep in M . We may consider ep as an element of Aδp (M ), and
denote the stabilizer of the element ep under the action of Homeoδ0 (M ) on Aδp (M )
by Homeo0,c δ (M (ep )). Let Homeo0,c (M (ep )) be the same group but consider it
as a subgroup of Homeo0 (M ) with the subspace topology. It is useful (in particular in the diagram 2.22) to note that the group of connected components of
Homeo0,c (M (ep )) is the same as the group of components of Homeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )).
Hence, we have a short exact sequence
(2.11)
1 → Homeoδ0 ((M /ep ) → Homeo0,c δ (M (ep )) → π0 (Homeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep ))) → 1.
Recall that Shapiro’s lemma for discrete groups H < G says that the natural map
BH → (G/H)//G is a weak homotopy equivalence. Therefore, the map
≃

→ Xpδ (M ),
BHomeoδ0,c (M (ep )) Ð

(2.12)

is also a weak homotopy equivalence.

2.1.2. A lemma in homotopy theory. Here the goal is to show that ∣A● (M )∣ and
∣A● (M )∣ are weakly contractible. Proving the fat realization of the discrete version
δ

∣A● (M )∣ is contractible is easier. Using a lemma in homotopy theory, we show that
δ

the contractibility of ∣A● (M )∣ implies the weak contractibility of ∣A● (M )∣. This
technique is originally due to Segal ([Seg78, Appendix]) and it is reformulated by
Weiss in [Wei05, Lemma 2.2]. In particular, in the setting of semi-simplicial spaces,
we use an application of this technique ([GRW17, Proposition 2.8]) due to Galatius
and Randal-Williams.
δ

Proposition 2.13. The realizations ∣Aδ● (M )∣ and ∣A● (M )∣ are weakly contractible.
δ

Proof. We give a proof for weak contractibility of ∣Aδ● (M )∣, the case of ∣A● (M )∣
is similar. Let f ∶ S k → ∣Aδ● (M )∣ be an element in the k-th homotopy group of
∣Aδ● (M )∣. Since ∣Aδ● (M )∣ is a CW-complex and S k is compact, the map f hits
finitely many simplices of ∣Aδ● (M )∣. Hence, there exists a point p and an embedded
disk e(Dn ) around it such that as an element of Aδ0 (M ) is not hit by the map f .
Thus, we have f (S k ) ⊂ ∣Aδ● (M /e(Dn ))∣. Adding the germ of e at p to the list of
germs of embeddings of disks in M /e(Dn ) gives a semisimplicial null-homotopy for
the inclusion Aδ● (M /e(Dn )) ↪ Aδ● (M ). Therefore, the element f (S k ) can be coned
off inside ∣Aδ● (M )∣.

δ

Remark 2.14. Note that because ∣Aδ● (M )∣ and ∣A● (M )∣ have CW structures, they
are in fact contractible.

Since the space Aδ● (M ) is discrete and A● (M ) is compactly generated weak

topy equivalence. To prove that the second map is also a weak homotopy equivalence, we need to show that ∣A● (M )∣ is weakly contractible. To do so, we use the
bisimplicial technique due to Quillen [Qui73, Proof of Theorem A]. First note that
since the map
≃

A● (M ) Ð
→ A● (M )
is a weak equivalence, it induces a weak homotopy equivalence between the fat
realizations. Hence, to show that ∣A● (M )∣ is weakly contractible, it is enough to
show that in the zig-zag

the second map β induces a weak homotopy equivalence between fat realizations.
Note that β is equivariant with respect to the map Homeoδ0 (M ) → Homeo0 (M )
and the first map is equivariant with respect to the action of Homeo0 (M ) on its
both sides.
Definition 2.17. Let A●,● (M ) be the bisemisimplicial space such that Ap,q (M ) is

the subspace of Ap (M ) × Aq (M ) consisting of those (p + q + 2)-tuples

weakly contractible, if we show that the map δ is a weak homotopy equivalence, we
then deduce that ∣A● (M )∣ is also weakly contractible.
Let Q be in Aq (M ). By the definition of the bisemisimplicial space A●,● (M ),

Note that by Proposition 2.13, we know that ∣δq−1 (Q)∣ is contractible.
[GRW17, Proposition 2.8], we deduce that the map

Using

∣δq ∣ ∶ ∣A●,q (M )∣ → Aq (M ),

(2.20)

is a microfibration with a contractible fiber, hence it is a fibration (see [Wei05,
Lemma 2.2] or [GRW17, Proposition 2.6]). Therefore ∣δq ∣ induces a weak equivalence. By realizing in q-direction of both sides of the map ∣δq ∣ in 2.20, we deduce
that δ is also a weak homotopy equivalence.

2.1.3. Reducing Theorem 1.3 to the case of manifolds with boundary. Recall that
the maps in 2.15 are weak homotopy equivalence so the semi-simplicial spaces
X● (M ) and X●δ (M ) are resolutions for BHomeo0 (M ) and BHomeoδ0 (M ) respectively. Therefore, to compare BHomeo0 (M ) and BHomeoδ0 (M ), we need to compare
their resolutions. But there is no direct map between them. We, however, show
that there is a map on the level of homology induced by the zig-zag of maps

X●δ (M ) ← A● (M )//Homeoδ0 (M ) → X● (M ),

which in turn is induced by the zig-zag Aδ● (M ) ← A● (M ) → A● (M ).
δ

Given any p-simplex σ in Ap (M ), we have a map

BStab(σ) → A● (M )//Homeoδ0 (M ),
where Stab(σ) is the stabilizer of σ under the action Homeoδ0 (M ). Recall that we
fixed an element ep ∈ Ap (M ) in the quasi-fibration 2.5, we can consider the same eleδ

ment ep ∈ Ap (M ) and therefore the stabilizer of ep is the group Homeoδ0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )).
Thus we have a map
δ

BHomeoδ0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )) → A● (M )//Homeoδ0 (M ).
Given the weak equivalences 2.5, 2.12 and the zig-zag 2.21, we have a homotopy

with the face maps, we have an induced map between the spectral sequences given
by the skeletal filtration of the realizations

To reduce Thurston’s theorem to the case of manifolds with boundary, we need the
following lemma.
Proposition 2.25. Given Thurston’s theorem 1.3 for manifolds with boundary, the
map α∗ is an isomorphism
Proof. Given the diagram 2.22, proving α∗ is an isomorphism is equivalent to proving the map
BHomeoδ0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )) → BHomeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep ))
induces a homology isomorphism. On the other hand, by the hypothesis, we know
that the map
BHomeoδ0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )) → BHomeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )),
induces a homology isomorphism. Recall that the identity component of the topological group Homeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )) is weakly homotopy equivalent to the group
Homeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )). Now using the comparison of Serre spectral sequences
for the fibrations

BHomeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep ))
≅

Bπ0 (Homeo0 (M /ep , ∂(M /ep )),

we readily conclude that the middle horizontal map induces a homology isomorphism.

Hence, if we prove Thurston’s theorem for manifolds without 0-handles or more
generally for manifolds with boundary, the comparison map on the E 1 -page

is an isomorphism, so is on the E ∞ -page. Hence, we deduce that ι̃ in the diagram
2.24 induces a homology isomorphism which implies Thurston’s theorem for the
closed manifold M .
2.1.4. Higher dimensional handles. Now we want to cut along the core of the higher
dimensional handles. To do so, we use the same notation for the handlebody
decomposition as in [CLM]. To recall their notation, let W be a manifold with
boundary. To attach a handle of index q, let φ˜q ∶ S q−1 ×Dn−q ↪ ∂W be an embedding
that admits an external collar similar to the 0-handle case. Let W +(φq ) denote the
manifold W ∪φ˜q Dq ×Dn−q . And let φq denote the embedding Dq ×Dn−q ↪ W +(φq ).

A LOCAL TO GLOBAL ARGUMENT ON LOW DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS

Definition 2.26. We say two handles φ1 , φ2 ∶ Dq × Dn−q ↪ M have the same germ
around the core if there exists ǫ > 0 such that
φ1 ∣Dq ×Dǫn−q = φ2 ∣Dq ×Dǫn−q
where Dǫn−q consists of all x ∈ Dn−q with the norm ∣x∣ ≤ ǫ. We denote the class of
the germ of φi by [φi ].
Given what we proved in the previous section, we can assume that M is a
manifold with boundary whose boundary components are in fact homeomorphic to
spheres.
To reduce the problem to a manifold with fewer number of handles, we use the
same idea as 0-handle resolutions. We shall define semisimplicial spaces encoding
the space of choices of removing a handle.
Definition 2.27 (q-handle resolutions). There are versions with different topologies as Definition 2.1:
● Discrete versions: Let φq ∶ Dq ×Dn−q ↪ M be a q-handle with an external collar
such that φq (Dq ×Dn−q )∩∂M = φq (S q−1 ×Dn−q ). We first define a semisimplicial
set H●δ (M, φq ) associated to φq as follows:
– Let eq+1 be the (q + 1)-st standard basis element. The set of 0-simplices
H0δ (M, φq ), consists of pairs (t, [φ]) where [φ] is a germ of a q-handle Dq ×
Dn−q ↪ M so that for a small ǫ we have
(2.28)

φ∣S q−1 ×Dǫn−q = φq ∣S q−1 ×(Dǫn−q +t.eq+1 ) ,

and φ(Dq × {0}) is isotopic to φq (Dq × {t.eq+1 }) relative to the boundary.
– The set of p-simplices Hpδ (M, φq ), consists of (p + 1)-tuples
((t0 , [φ0 ]), (t1 , [φ1 ]), . . . , (tp , [φp ])),
in H0δ (M, φq )p+1 so that t0 < t1 < ⋯ < tp and the embedded cores φi (Dq ×{0})
are disjoint.
δ
– Let H● (M, φq ) be the semisimplicial set whose 0-simplices consist of pairs
(t, φ) where (t, [φ]) ∈ H0δ (M, φq ). Note that the difference here is we consider
actual embeddings not just their germs around the core. And let p-simplices
be the subset of H0δ (M, φq )p+1 consisting of those (p + 1)-tuples
((t0 , φ0 ), (t1 , φ1 ), . . . , (tp , φp )),
where the cores of φi ’s are pairwise disjoint.
Remark 2.29. Note that by definition, for every pair (t, [φ]) ∈ H0δ (M, φq ), the
real number t is uniquely determined by φ. We denote this t-coordinate by tφ .
δ

The group Homeoδ0 (M, ∂M ) acts on H●δ (M, φq ) and H● (M, φq ). The q-handle
resolution associated to φq in this case is
gφq

X●δ (M, φq ) ∶= H●δ (M, φq )//Homeoδ0 (M, ∂M ) ÐÐ→ BHomeoδ0 (M, ∂M ).
● Topological versions: Let H● (M, φq ) be the semisimplicial space whose 0simplices as a set consists of pairs (t, φ) where (t, [φ]) ∈ H0δ (M, φq ). We topologize
H0 (M, φq ) as the subspace of real numbers times the space of embeddings of a
q-handle into M equipped with the compact-open topology. The space of psimplices Hp (M, φq ) is a subspace of H0 (M, φq )p+1 consisting of (p + 1)-tuples
((t0 , φ0 ), (t1 , φ1 ), . . . , (tp , φp )),
so that t0 < t1 < ⋯ < tp and the embedded handles φi (Dq × Dn−q ) are disjoint. It
is topologized with the subspace topology.

SAM NARIMAN

Note that Homeo0 (M, ∂M ) acts on H● (M, φq ) and we define the q-handle
resolution associated to φq in this case to be the augmented semisimplicial space:
fφq

X● (M, φq ) ∶= H● (M, φq )//Homeo0 (M, ∂M ) ÐÐ→ BHomeo0 (M, ∂M ).
We want to prove that fφq and gφq induce weak homotopy equivalences. Similar
to semi-simplicial resolutions 2.15 and Proposition 2.19, it is enough to show that
∣H●δ (M, φ1 )∣ is contractible.
Theorem 2.30. Let M be a surface with boundary and let φ1 be a 1-handle, then
δ
the fat realizations ∣H●δ (M, φ1 )∣ and ∣H● (M, φ1 )∣ are weakly contractible.
Remark 2.31. In fact for a manifold M whose dimension is larger than 4, one can
show that ∣H●δ (M, φq )∣ is contractible if the handle index q ≤ dim(M )/2. If one
shows that ∣H●δ (M, φq )∣ is contractible for handle indices larger than the middle
dimension, one could deduce Theorem 1.3 in all dimensions without resorting to
foliation theory.
Proof. We give a proof that ∣H●δ (M, φ1 )∣ is contractible and the proof for conδ

tractibility of ∣H● (M, φ1 )∣ is the same. To show that a continuous map f ∶ S k →
∣H●δ (M, φ1 )∣ is nullhomotopic, we fix a triangulation K of S k and without loss of
generality, we assume that f is a PL-map from K to ∣H●δ (M, φ1 )∣.
Let f ∶ K → ∣H●δ (M, φ1 )∣ be a PL-map from a triangulation K of the sphere S k .
To show that f is nullhomotopic, we show that there exists [φ] ∈ H●δ (M, φ1 ) so
that one can homotope the image f (K) into Star([φ]). Note that for every v ∈ K,
the core of the germ of the embedded 1-handle f (v) ∈ H●δ (M, φ1 ) has a normal
(micro)bundle since every core comes equipped with the germ of its cocore.
First we show that we can homotope f so that the cores of f (v) for all v ∈ K
are pairwise transverse to each other. This part of the argument works for higher
dimensional manifolds. But in dimension 2, the transversality argument is easier
and in higher dimensions, one has to use the transversality in the sense of [KS77,
Essay 3, section 1].
To do the first step, we need to consider the parallel copies of the handles. To
explain what we mean by parallel copies, let f (v) = φ0 ∈ f (K) be a vertex and
{φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φn } be all the vertices in f (K) that are connected to φ0 . Recall that
by definition of H0δ (M, φ1 ), there exists a small positive ǫ such that
φ0 ∣S 0 ×Dǫ1 = φ1 ∣S 0 ×(Dǫ1 +tφ0 .e2 )) .
A nearby parallel copy φ′0 ∶ D1 × D1 ↪ M can be described by φ0 restricted to
1
D1 × (Dǫ/3
+ ǫ/2 ⋅ e2 ). Note that [φ′0 ] is a vertex in H0δ (M, φ1 ) and since the cores
′
of φ0 and φ0 are disjoint, the vertices [φ′0 ] and [φ0 ] are connected in H0δ (M, φ1 ).
Let us enumerate the vertices of f (K) by [ψ1 ], [ψ2 ], . . . , [ψm ]. First we choose
a parallel copy of [ψ2 ] and perturb it by a small isotopy to obtain [ψ2′ ] so that
its core becomes transverse to the core of [ψ1 ]. If the isotopy is small enough the
core of [ψ2′ ] is disjoint from the core of ψ2 and the core of all vertices in f (K)
that [ψ2 ] was disjoint from. Therefore, there is a homotopy replacing [ψ2 ] with
[ψ2′ ] and fixing the image of other vertices. Thus we may assume that [ψ1 ] and
[ψ2 ] have transverse cores. Hence the intersection of their cores is a set of points.
Now we move on to [ψ3 ]. Similarly by choosing a nearby copy of [ψ3 ] and a small
perturbation [ψ3′ ] of this nearby copy, we obtain a handle whose core is disjoint
from the points in the intersection of the previous two handles [ψ1 ] and [ψ2 ]. Hence
we can choose a small neighborhood U of the intersection of the cores [ψ1 ] and [ψ2 ]
such that the core of [ψ3′ ] is also disjoint from U . Now by Quinn’s transversality,
we can find a small isotopy whose support is away from U and we obtain a handle

A LOCAL TO GLOBAL ARGUMENT ON LOW DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS

13

[ψ3′′ ] whose core is transverse to the manifold (ψ1 (D1 × {0}) ∪ ψ2 (D1 × {0}))/U .
If we choose the isotopy small enough the core of [ψ3′′ ] is disjoint from the core of
[ψ3 ] and all the cores of the vertices of f (K) that the core of [ψ3 ] was disjoint
from. Hence by a homotopy of the map f , we can replace [ψ3 ] with [ψ3′′ ]. Thus
we may assume that the core of [ψ3 ] is transverse to the core of [ψ1 ] and [ψ2 ]. By
continuing this process we can change f up to homotopy to make the core of [ψi ]
transverse to the core of [ψj ] for j < i. Therefore, we may assume that the core of
the vertices of f (K) are pairwise transverse to each other.
Similarly we can find a vertex [φ] ∈ H0δ (M, φ1 ) whose core is transverse to the
core of all vertices of f (K). For any [φ0 ] ∈ H0δ (M, φ1 ) whose core is transverse to
φ(D1 × {0}), we can order the intersection points. Let p and q be two consecutive
points in the intersection of the cores [φ] and [φ0 ]. Let D and D0 be the arcs
connecting p and q in the core of [φ] and [φ0 ] respectively. Since the cores ate
isotopic, by [FM11, Proposition 1.7] there is a Whitney disk N (or bigon in the
context of surgery of arcs on surfaces) that bounds D ∪ D0 . Let [φ0 ] be the vertex
among the vertices of f (K) whose core gives rise to an innermost bigon. Similar to
the previous case, we can homotope f by replacing [φ0 ] with a handle obtained by
applying the Whitney trick to the disk N . By continuing this procedure, we reduce
the number of intersections between the vertices of f (K) and the core of [φ], so we
can homotope f so that its image lies in Star([φ]).

Remark 2.32. For a three manifold M , it is easy to show that the complex of
H●δ (M, φ1 ) has contractible realization. To prove a similar result for 2-handles, the
first part of the argument that makes the core of the handles pairwise transverse still
works. But the second half which is a surgery argument to reduce the intersections
does not work. The issue is the Whitney disk may not exist in this case. If we
have two transverse isotopic cores of 2-handles, they intersect in circles. Each circle
bounds a 2-disk in the core of the handles. Hence, each circle in the intersection
gives an embedded 2-sphere in M which may not bound a ball. So we may not be
able to reduce the number of circles by doing surgery following the above argument.
Remark 2.33. Note that in general if q < dim(M )/2, the realization of H●δ (M, φq )
is contractible by the same argument as Proposition 2.13. Because transversality
in this codimension implies disjointness.
Lemma 2.34. Let M be a surface with boundary and let φ1 be a 1-handle, the fat
realization ∣H● (M, φ1 )∣ is weakly contractible.
Proof. Similar to Proposition 2.19.



Now since the fibers of the maps ∣fφ1 ∣ ∶ ∣X● (M, φ1 )∣ Ð
→ BHomeo0 (M, ∂M ) and
∣gφ1 ∣ ∶ ∣X●δ (M, φ1 )∣ Ð
→ BHomeoδ0 (M, ∂M ) are weakly contractible, by [RW16, Lemma
2.1] they induce weak equivalences.
2.1.5. The homotopy type of X● (M, φq ) and X●δ (M, φq ). Given that the boundary
condition 2.28 is fixed by the action of Homeo0 (M, ∂M ), unlike the case of the
disk resolutions 3.5, the action of Homeo0 (M, ∂M ) on H0 (M, φq ) and the action of
Homeoδ0 (M, ∂M ) on H0g (M, φq ) are not transitive. But there is a bijection between
the set of the orbits of these actions.
● Action of Homeo0 (M, ∂M ) on Hp (M, φq ): To determine the weak homotopy
type of Xp (M, φq ), we shall first describe the orbits of the action Homeo0 (M, ∂M )
on Hp (M, φq ). To do so, let us first introduce few notations. Let σ = (φ0 , φ1 , . . . , φp )
be a p-simplex in Hp (M, φq ) and let M /σ be the manifold obtained from M by
removing the handles φi (Dq × int(Dn−q )). Let also
Homeo0 (M /σ, ∂(M /σ)),

14

SAM NARIMAN

denote the identity component of the compactly supported homeomorphisms of
int(M )/ ∪i φi (Dq × int(Dn−q )). Note that the submanifold M /σ ↪ M might have
different connected components. Similar to Lemma 2.4, the sequence
Stab(σ) → Homeo0 (M, ∂M ) → orbit(σ),
is a quasi-fibration where the topological group Stab(σ) is naturally identified
with the group Homeo0 (M /σ, ∂(M /σ)) whose identity component has the same
homotopy type as Homeo0 (M /σ, ∂(M /σ)) (similar to the inclusion 2.3). Therefore, choosing once and for all, a p simplex in each orbit, we obtain the map
≃

→ Xp (M, φq ),
∐(BHomeo0 (M /σ, ∂(M /σ))) Ð
σ

which is a weak homotopy equivalence (see Proposition 2.7).
● Action of Homeoδ0 (M, ∂M ) on Hpδ (M, φq ): To determine the weak homotopy
type of Xpδ (M, φq ), we shall first describe the orbits of the action Homeoδ0 (M, ∂M )
on Hpδ (M, φq ). Let [σ] = ([φ0 ], [φ1 ], . . . , [φp ]) be a p-simplex in Hpδ (M, φq ) and
let us denote int(M )/ ∪i φi (Dq × {0}) by M ([σ]). Let Homeoδ 0,c (M ([σ]) denote
the stabilizer of σ as an element of Hpδ (M, φq ) acted on by Homeoδ0 (M, ∂M ).
Similar to the short exact sequence 2.11, we have
1 → Homeoδ0,c (M ([σ]) → Homeoδ 0,c (M ([σ]) → π0 (Homeo0 (M /σ, ∂(M /σ))) → 1.
Given that there is a bijection between the set of the orbits of these two
actions, we shall consider the germs of the representatives of the first action, as a
representative set of the orbits of the action of Homeoδ0 (M, ∂M ) on H0δ (M, φq ).
Hence, by Shapiro’s lemma, we obtain a map
≃

δ
→ Xpδ (M, φq ),
∐(BHomeo0,c (M ([σ])) Ð
[σ]

which is a weak equivalence.
Remark 2.35. Recall that the inclusion M /σ ↪ M ([σ]) induces a natural map
≃

BHomeo0 (M /σ, ∂(M /σ)) Ð
→ BHomeo0,c (M ([σ])).
which is a weak equivalence (similar to the map 2.3). The same map between
discrete homeomorphisms
H∗ iso

BHomeoδ0 (M /σ, ∂(M /σ)) ÐÐÐ→ BHomeoδ0,c (M ([σ])),
induces a homology isomorphism by the same argument as [Nar17, Corollary 2.3].
Proof of Theorem 1.3 for dim(M ) ≤ 2. In Proposition 2.25, we reduced the theorem to manifolds with boundary. Let us fix a handle decomposition of M
M = ∂0 M × [0, 1] + (φq11 ) + (φq22 ) + ⋯ + (φqrr ).
We want to reduce the statement of the theorem for M to the case of a disk
(Mather’s theorem [Mat71]) by cutting handles from M . First suppose dim(M ) = 1.
Since we already reduced the theorem to the case of manifolds with boundary and
in this dimension, a manifold with boundary is homeomorphic to the union of disks
for which the theorem holds by Mather’s theorem ([Mat71]). Now we assume M is
a surface with boundary.
Claim 2.36. If Thurston’s theorem holds for M /σ for all σ ∈ Hp (M, φ1 ) and for
all p, it also holds for M .

A LOCAL TO GLOBAL ARGUMENT ON LOW DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS

15

Proof of the claim: Similar to Proposition 2.25, we have a zig-zag of maps from
Xpδ (M, φ1 ) to Xp (M, φ1 ) which corresponds to the zig-zag
H∗ −iso

BHomeoδ0,c (M ([σ])) ←ÐÐÐÐ BHomeoδ0 (M /σ, ∂(M /σ)) → BHomeo0 (M /σ, ∂(M /σ)).
Given the hypothesis of the lemma, the above zig-zag induces a homology isomorphism between BHomeoδ0,c (M ([σ])) and BHomeo0 (M /σ, ∂(M /σ)). Hence the induced map between H∗ (Xpδ (M, φ1 )) and H∗ (Xp (M, φ1 )) is an isomorphism. Therefore, by the comparison of the spectral sequences
Hq (Xpδ (M, φ1 ))

≅

Hp+q (∣X●δ (M, φ1 )∣)

Hp+q (∣X● (M, φ1 )∣)

≅

Hp+q (BHomeoδ0 (M, ∂M ))

Hq (Xp (M, φ1 ))

≅
ι∗

Hp+q (BHomeo0 (M, ∂M )),

we conclude that ι∗ is an isomorphism. ∎
For a 1-handle [φ1 ] and a p-simplex σ ∈ Hp (M, φ1 ), the manifold M /σ is homeomorphic to the union of p disks and M /φ1 (D1 ×int(D1 )). Thus using the claim, the
theorem holds for M if it holds for M /φ1 (D1 × int(D1 )). Therefore, by removing
1-handles inductively from the surface M , we can reduce the theorem for M to the
case of a disk which is given by Mather’s theorem ([Mat71]).

Remark 2.37. In fact using Remark 2.31 and a similar argument as above, one can
show that Thurston’s theorem for a manifold M whose dimension is larger than
4 is equivalent to Thurston’s theorem for a trivial bordism N × D1 where N is a
manifold whose dimension is dim(M ) − 1.
2.2. The case of three manifolds. To do exactly similar argument as the case of
surfaces, we need to find contractible semi-simplicial spaces that cut the manifold
into union of disks. Doing an inductive process to cut a three manifold into disks,
however, is harder than the case of surfaces.
For certain types of three manifolds, namely for Haken 3-manifolds, this process
of cutting into disks is well known. Recall that M is Haken if it is irreducible
and contains a properly embedded two sided incompressible surface. Being an
irreducible 3-manifold means that every embedded 2-sphere bounds a ball. The
existence of this ball allows us to do a similar surgery argument as we did for
isotopic arcs in a surface. Recall that a compact connected surface S, not S 2 , in
M is an incompressible surface, if it is properly embedded S ∩ ∂M = ∂S, and the
normal bundle of S is trivial and the inclusion S ↪ M is π1 injective. Given the
Haken manifold theory, there is a finite sequence of incompressible surfaces that as
we cut a Haken manifold M along those surfaces, we obtain disjoint union of balls.
The idea is to induct on the number of prime factors in a prime decomposition
of M to reduce Thurston’s theorem to the case of Haken manifolds and then use
the hierarchy of Haken manifolds to reduce it to the case of disks.
Let M ≅ kP #N be the connected sum of k copies of a prime manifold P and
a manifold N where N has no prime factor homeomorphic to P . We will define
semi-simplicial spaces with contractible realizations that encode different ways of
cutting M into the union of k copies of P /int(D3 ) and N / ∪ki=1 int(D3 ) and copies
of S 2 × [0, 1]. By the same argument as the previous section, a spectral sequence
argument shows that Thurston’s theorem holds for M if it does for P /int(D3 ) and
N / ∪ki=1 int(D3 ) and S 2 × [0, 1]. We then show that Thurston’s theorem for Haken
manifolds implies that the theorem holds for S 2 ×[0, 1] and for prime manifolds with

16

SAM NARIMAN

any number of disks removed. Therefore, we deduce that it holds for P /int(D3 )
and by induction for N / ∪ki=1 int(D3 ).
2.2.1. Cutting along separating spheres. Let φ ∶ S ↪ M be an embedding of a
surface S in M with a trivial normal bundle. To cut along this embedding, similar
to Definition 2.27, we define different semisimplicial spaces.
Definition 2.38. Fix an embedding of the two-sided collar ψ ∶ S × [−1, 1] ↪ M .
The germ of embeddings of S into M is defined similar to Definition 2.26 and we
define the core of ψ to be its restriction to S × {0}. We consider the following
semi-simplicial spaces associated to ψ.
● Discrete version: Let K●δ (M, ψ) be a semisimplicial set defined as follows:
– If S has no boundary, the set of 0-simplices K0δ (M, ψ), consists of germs of
embeddings [φ] so that the core of φ is isotopic to a parallel copy of the
core of ψ. And the set of p-simplices Kpδ (M, ψ), consists of (p + 1)-tuples
([φ0 ], [φ1 ], . . . , [φp ]) of germs of embeddings so that their cores are disjoint.
– If S has a boundary, the set of 0-simplices K0δ (M, ψ), consists of pairs (t, [φ])
where [φ] is a germ of an embedding S × [−1, 1] ↪ M so that for a small ǫ
we have
φ(∂S × (−ǫ, ǫ)) = ψ(∂S × (t − ǫ, t + ǫ)),
and φ(S × {0}) is isotopic to ψ(S × {t}) relative to the boundary.
– The set of p-simplices Kpδ (M, ψ), consists of (p + 1)-tuples
((t0 , [φ0 ]), (t1 , [φ1 ]), . . . , (tp , [φp ])),
K0δ (M, ψ)p+1

in
so that t0 < t1 < ⋯ < tp and the embedded surfaces φi (S×{0})
are disjoint. The face maps are given by forgetting the embeddings.
Note that for every (t, φ) ∈ K0δ (M, ψ), the coordinate t is uniquely determined by φ. We might just write φ for a vertex and refer to its t-coordinate
by tφ .
– The face maps are given by omitting the coordinates.
● Topological versions: For a surface S with boundary, let K● (M, ψ) be the
semisimplicial space whose 0-simplices as a set consists of pairs (t, φ) where
(t, [φ]) ∈ K0δ (M, ψ). We topologize K0 (M, ψ) as the subspace of real numbers
times the space of embeddings the collared surface S × [−1, 1] into M equipped
with the compact-open topology. The space of p-simplices Kp (M, ψ) is a subspace
of K0 (M, ψ)p+1 consisting of (p + 1)-tuples
((t0 , φ0 ), (t1 , φ1 ), . . . , (tp , φp )),
so that t0 < t1 < ⋯ < tp and the embedded collared surfaces φi (S × [−1, 1]) are
disjoint. It is topologized with the subspace topology. The case of the closed
surface S is defined similarly without the t-coordinate. The face maps are given
by omitting the coordinates.
Definition 2.39. Let ψi ∶ S × [−1, 1] ↪ M for 1 ≤ i ≤ k be a fixed set of disjoint
proper embeddings. We define the semi-simplicial set K●δ (M ; ψ1 , ψ2 , . . . , ψk ) whose
p-simplices
Kpδ (M ; ψ1 , ψ2 , . . . , ψk ) ⊂ Kpδ (M, ψ1 ) × Kpδ (M, ψ2 ) × ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ × Kpδ (M, ψk )
consist of those k-tuples whose cores are pairwise disjoint. We define the topological
version K● (M ; ψ1 , ψ2 , . . . , ψk ) similarly.
We assume that M is orientable, the non-orientable case is similar. Now for
1 ≤ i ≤ k, let
(2.40)

φi ∶ S 2 × [−1, 1] ↪ M

A LOCAL TO GLOBAL ARGUMENT ON LOW DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS

17

be embeddings whose cores cut M into k + 1 connected components that are homeomorphic to the disjoint union of k copies of P /int(D3 ) and N / ∪ki=1 int(D3 ). Since
in the prime decomposition of N there is no factor homeomorphic to P , for a psimplex σp ∈ Kp (M ; φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φk ), the manifold M /σp is homeomorphic to the
disjoint union of k copies of P /int(D3 ), N / ∪ki=1 int(D3 ) and pk copies of S 2 × [0, 1].
To show that the realization the semi-simplicial set K●δ (M ; φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φk ) is contractible, we need to assume that all prime manifolds in the prime decomposition
of M are irreducible. So let us first reduce to the case that this assumption holds.
To secure this assumption, we need to cut out solid tori from M by defining certain
semi-simplicial spaces.
Definition 2.41. Let φ ∶ S 1 × D2 ↪ M be a π1 -injective embedding. Let T0 (M ; φ)
be the space of embeddings of a solid torus whose core is isotopic to the core of
φ and Tp (M ; φ) ⊂ T0 (M ; φ)p+1 is a subspace consisting of p + 1 tuples of disjoint
embeddings. We define the discrete version T●δ (M ; φ) similar to Definition 2.38, by
taking germs of embeddings with the discrete topology.
Lemma 2.42. The fat realizations ∣T● (M ; φ)∣ and ∣T●δ (M ; φ)∣ are weakly contractible.
Proof. It is enough to show that ∣T●δ (M ; φ)∣ is contractible (see Proposition 2.19).
Similar to Theorem 2.30, to show that a continuous map f ∶ S k → ∣T●δ (M ; φ)∣ is
nullhomotopic, we fix a triangulation K of S k and without loss of generality, we
assume that f is a PL-map from K to ∣T●δ (M ; φ)∣. Again by the similar argument as
Theorem 2.30, we can assume that the core of vertices in the image of f are pairwise
transverse. But note that in this case the codimension of the core of a solid torus is
2 so transversality in this codimension implies disjointness. Therefore, by applying
transversality we can find a vertex v in T0δ (M ; φ) whose core is disjoint from the
core of vertices in the image of the map f which implies that f (K) ⊂ Star(v).
Hence, the map f is null-homotopic.

Proposition 2.43. If Theorem 1.3 holds for those three manifolds that are homeomorphic to a connected sum of irreducible manifolds, then it also holds for any
three manifold.
Proof. It is well-known (see [Hat, Proposition 1.4]) that the only orientable prime
3-manifold that is not irreducible is S 1 × S 2 . For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let θi ∶ S 1 × D2 ↪ S 1 × S 2
be π1 -injective embeddings of solid tori. If the embeddings θi ’s are disjoint, it is
easy to see that S 1 × S 2 / ∪ni=1 θi (S 1 × int(D2 )) is irreducible.
Suppose in the prime decomposition of M there are k copies of S 1 × S 2 . We
inductively reduce to the case with fewer copies of S 1 × S 2 ’s. To do so, we want
to cut out solid tori from these summands. Let φ ∶ S 1 × D2 ↪ M be a π1 -injective
embedding whose image is in one of the copies of S 1 × S 2 . Note that for all σ ∈
T● (M ; φ), the manifold M /σ obtained from M by removing the interior of the solid
tori in σ, has fewer non-irreducible summand in its prime decomposition. Therefore,
the argument in Claim 2.36 implies if we have Thurston’s theorem for those 3manifolds with irreducible summands, we have the theorem for all 3-manifolds. 
Now that we can assume the prime factors in M are all irreducible, we prove the
contractibility of the semi-simplicial spaces of separating spheres φi in 2.40.
Theorem 2.44. If M is a connected sum of irreducible 3-manifolds, the fat realizations ∣K●δ (M ; φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φk )∣ and ∣K● (M ; φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φk )∣ are weakly contractible.
Proof. We give the proof for the case where k = 1 and for the general k, the argument
is the same. Recall from Proposition 2.13 that the contractibility of ∣K●δ (M ; φ1 )∣
implies the weak contractibility of ∣K● (M ; φ1 )∣. So it is enough to prove the former.

We can represent an element of the k-th homotopy group of ∣K●δ (M ; φ1 )∣ by a
PL map f ∶ K → ∣K●δ (M ; φ1 )∣ where K is a triangulation of S k . By the similar
argument as Theorem 2.30, we can assume that the core of vertices in the image of
f are pairwise transverse. Let v1 ∈ K0δ (M ; φ1 ) be a vertex whose core is transverse
to the core of vertices in f (K). To show that f is null-homotopic, we homotope f
to a map g so that g(K) ⊂ Star(v1 ). To do this we need to consider all separating
spheres in the prime decomposition at once. Let {w1 , w2 , . . . , wm } be a set of
separating spheres in a prime decomposition of M where w1 is the core of v1 . We
also assume that all wi ’s are transverse to the cores of the vertices in f (K).
Claim 2.45. Let w be an embedded sphere in M that is isotopic to w1 and is
transverse to all wi ’s. Let C be an innermost circle in the intersection of w and
wi ’s, i.e. it bounds a disk D in w so that the interior of D does not intersect wi
for any i. If C is in the intersection of wj and w, it bounds a disk D′ in wj so that
the embedded sphere D ∪ D′ bounds a ball in M .
We call the ball whose boundary is D ∪ D′ , the Whitney ball. Because we can
push D along the ball to remove the intersection C.
Proof of the claim: Since int(D) does not intersect any of the spheres wi ’s, it lies
entirely in one of the irreducible components, say Pj /int(D3 ) whose boundary is
the sphere wj . Because Pj is irreducible either of two disks in wj that bounds C
union D is an embedded sphere in Pj , hence bounds a ball but one of these balls
lies entirely in Pj /int(D3 ). Therefore, the circle C bounds a disk D′ in wj so that
the sphere D′ ∪ D bounds a ball in M . ∎
By doing surgery similar to Theorem 2.30, we want to homotope the map f to
reduce the number of circles in the intersection of the core of vertices of f (K) with
the spheres {w1 , w2 , . . . , wm }. By the claim for the core of any vertex in f (K) that
intersect the union of wi ’s, there exists a Whitney ball. Let θ0 = f (s0 ) ∈ f (K) be
a vertex whose Whitney ball is innermost, i.e. if {θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θn } are the vertices
that are connected to θ0 in f (K), they do not intersect the Whitney ball of θ0 .
Therefore, by pushing the core of θ0 along the the Whitney ball, we could obtain
a vertex θ0′ whose core is still disjoint from the core of vertices {θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θn }. By
considering a near parallel copy of θ0′ , we can assume that the core of θ0′ is also
disjoint from the core of θ0 . Therefore, we can homotope the map f to a map g
so that it takes the same value on all vertices in K but s0 and g(s0 ) = θ0′ . By
repeating this process, we reduce the number of circles in the intersection of the
cores of f (K) with the spheres {w1 , w2 , . . . , wm } until we homotope f into the star
of the vertex v1 .

The contractibility of these semi-simplicial spaces, similar to the case of surfaces,
reduces Thurston’s theorem to the case of P /int(D3 ) and N /∪ki=1 int(D3 ) and copies
of S 2 × [0, 1].
2.2.2. Reducing Thurston’s theorem to the case of Haken manifolds. Let us first
consider the case S 2 × [0, 1].
Proposition 2.46. Theorem 1.3 holds for M = S 2 × [0, 1] if it holds for Haken
3-manifolds.
Proof. Choose a 1-handle φ ∶ D1 × D2 ↪ S 2 × [0, 1] so that φ({0} × D2 ) ⊂ S 2 × {0}
and φ({1} × D2 ) ⊂ S 2 × {1}. Note that the codimension of this 1-handle is less
that the half of the dimension of the ambient manifold. Therefore, similar to
Lemma 2.42, transversality implies that ∣H●δ (S 2 × [0, 1], φ)∣ is contractible. Hence,
as in Claim 2.36, Thurston’s theorem holds for S 2 × [0, 1] if it holds for S 2 × [0, 1]/σ
for all p-simplices σ ∈ Hpδ (S 2 × [0, 1], φ) and all p. But for a p-simplex σ, the
manifold S 2 × [0, 1]/σ is a handle-body, so it is Haken.

As the general strategy is to cut along submanifolds, we always get manifolds
with boundary. Furthermore, an irreducible 3-manifold with boundary is Haken.
But note that the sphere boundaries in P /int(D3 ) and N /∪ki=1 int(D3 ) destroys the
irreducibility. So to reduce Thurston’s theorem for P /int(D3 ) and N / ∪ki=1 int(D3 )
to the case for Haken manifolds, we first cut along certain 1-handles to reduce
the number of sphere boundaries. To do so, we need to show that P /int(D3 ) and
N / ∪ki=1 int(D3 ) are not simply connected.
Lemma 2.47. If a 3-manifold M with boundary is simply connected, it is obtained
from S 3 by removing the interior of a union of disjoint balls in S 3 .
Proof. It is enough to show that the boundary ∂M is homeomorphic to union of
S 2 ’s. Because if we fill in the sphere boundaries by balls, we obtain a simply
connected closed 3-manifold which has to be homeomorphic to S 3 by Perelman’s
theorem ([Per02, Per03]). Since M is simply connected, we have H1 (M ) = 0, so
by the Poincaré-Lefschetz duality, we also have H2 (M, ∂M ) ≅ H 1 (M ) = 0. The
homology long exact sequence for the pair (M, ∂M ) implies that H2 (M, ∂M ) →
H1 (∂M ) → H1 (M ) is exact. Therefore, H1 (∂M ) = 0 which implies that ∂M is
homeomorphic to a union of S 2 ’s.

Let Q be the manifold obtained from P by removing the interior of m disjoint
balls in P . To prove Thurston’s theorem for Q, we want to cut 1-handles from
Q to make it irreducible. Not that since P is not simply connected and is not
homeomorphic to sphere, so by Lemma 2.47, the manifold Q is not simply connected
either. Let ∂i Q be the i-th boundary component. We choose an arc γi with the two
ends on ∂i Q so that the arc γi with a path between its two ends on the boundary
is non-trivial in the fundamental group of P .
Let φi ∶ D1 × D2 ↪ Q be a 1-handle whose core is γi . Let us denote the manifold
obtained from Q by removing the interior of the handle φi by Q/ ∪m
i=1 φi . Given
that P is irreducible, it is easy to see that Q/ ∪m
i=1 φi is also irreducible. Because
every embedded sphere in Q/ ∪m
i=1 φi bounds a ball in P . If this ball contains any
of the boundary components with the 1-handle attached to it, then the core union
the path between the two ends of the core on the boundary would be trivial in the
fundamental group of P , which is a contradiction.
Proposition 2.48. Thurston’s theorem 1.3 holds for Q, if it does for Haken manifolds.
Proof. By the above discussion, if we remove at least one handle in H0δ (Q, φi ) from
Q for each i, we obtain a Haken manifold. Because it is an irreducible manifold
whose boundary components have positive genus. We inductively reduce the number of sphere boundary components by cutting along 1-handles whose cores are
isotopic to a parallel copy of the core of φi ’s.
Similar to Claim 2.36, we want to show that Theorem 1.3 holds for Q if it holds
for Q/σ for all σ ∈ Hpδ (Q, φi ) and all p. To do this, it is enough to show the
semi-simplicial sets H●δ (Q, φi ) has contractible realization. Since the codimension
of the cores is larger than half of the dimension of Q, transversality implies that
∣H●δ (Q, φi )∣ is contractible (see Lemma 2.42).

Similarly, we can reduce Theorem 1.3 for N / ∪ki=1 int(D3 ) the case where all
boundary components have positive genus. Now we can apply prime decomposition
for 3-manifolds with boundary ([Hem04, Section 3]). Note that all the prime factors
are irreducible again, so we can apply Theorem 2.44 to inductively reduce to the
case with fewer prime factors. Hence, Theorem 1.3 for N / ∪ki=1 int(D3 ) is also
deduced from Proposition 2.48.

2.2.3. Theorem 1.3 for Haken 3-manifolds. By the theory of Haken manifolds ([Hak62]),
we know that they have a hierarchy, where they can be split up into 3-balls along
incompressible surfaces. Let ψ ∶ S×[−1, 1] ↪ M be a proper embedding of an incompressible surface with its trivial normal bundle. Given the case of Haken manifolds
which are lower compared to M in the Haken hierarchy, we inductively prove Theorem 1.3 for M by considering the semi-simplicial set K●δ (M, ψ) (see Definition 2.38
to recall its definition).
Note that for any σ ∈ Kpδ (M, ψ), the manifold M /σ is homeomorphic to the
disjoint union of M /ψ(S × {0}) with p copies of S × [−1, 1]. By induction on the
Haken hierarchy, we can assume that Theorem 1.3 holds for M /ψ(S×{0}). To apply
Claim 2.36, we need also to know Theorem 1.3 for S × [−1, 1]. But S × [−1, 1] is a
handlebody (a 3-ball with 1-handles attached) so there are finitely many properly
embedded 2-disks (that are in fact incompressible surface in S × [−1, 1]) such that
if we cut along those disks, we obtain a 3-ball. Hence, it is a special case of Haken
manifolds. Therefore, to finish the proof of Theorem 1.3 for three manifolds, it is
left to prove the following proposition.
Proposition 2.49. Let M be a Haken manifold with boundary. The fat realization
∣K●δ (M, ψ)∣ is contractible.
Proof. Let us represent an element of the homotopy group f ∶ S k → ∣K●δ (M, ψ)∣ by
a PL map with respect to some triangulation K on S k . Similar to Theorem 2.30
we can homotope f so that the core of the vertices of f (K) are pairwise transverse.
Also by the same argument, we can choose φ ∈ K0δ (M, ψ) so that the collared
embedding φ(S) is transverse to the core of vertices of f (K) and its t-coordinate
tφ is different from that of vertices of f (K). We want to homotope f to a PL map
g ∶ K → ∣K●δ (M, ψ)∣ so that g(K) ⊂ Star(φ), hence f becomes nullhomotopic.
Since the intersections of φ(S) with the core of vertices of f (K) are transverse
and also they do not intersect on the boundary ∂M , all intersections are circles. We
want to do surgery on the image of f to remove these circles. We first do surgery
on the circles that are nullhomotopic in M .
Case 1: Since φ(S) is incompressible, any nullhomotopic circle in the intersection
of φ(S) and the core of the vertices of f (K) is in fact nullhomotopic in φ(S).
Therefore such circles bound a disk D in φ(S). Choose a metric on the surface
φ(S) and among the nullhomotopic circles in the intersection, let C be the one
whose interior has the minimal area. Suppose C is in the intersection of φ(S) and
φ0 (S) where φ0 = f (v) ∈ f (K) is a vertex in the image of f and {φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φn } is
the set of all the vertices in f (K) that are connected to φ0 .
Again by the incompressibility the circle C bounds a disk D0 in φ0 (S). Since M
is irreducible, the sphere D ∪ D0 bounds a ball B in M . Note that by the choice
of the circle C, the ball B does not intersect φi (S) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. By pushing D
across B to D0 and considering a nearby parallel copy, we obtain φ′0 ∈ K0δ (M, ψ)
whose core is disjoint from φ0 (S) and the core of all vertices that are connected to
φ0 in f (K). Therefore, we obtain a homotopy F ∶ K × [0, 1] → ∣K●δ (M, ψ)∣ where
F (−, 0) = f , F (v, 1) = φ′ and F (−, 1) is the same as f on vertices other than v.
But also note that φ′0 (S) has fewer circle component in its intersection with φ(S).
Hence, by repeating this process, we can eliminate all nullhomotopic intersections.
Case 2: Now suppose none of the circles in the intersection of the cores of the
vertices of f (K) and φ(S) is nullhomotopic. We use Hatcher’s idea (see [Hat76,
Page 342]) to deal with this case. Let p ∶ M̃ → M be the covering corresponding to
the subgroup π1 (φ(S), a) ⊂ π1 (M, a) where a is a base point in φ(S). Let S0 be
the homeomorphic lift of φ(S) passing through the base point ã of M̃ . Let {Si }
be the components of p−1 (φ(S)). Each Si separates M̃ into two components. Let

A LOCAL TO GLOBAL ARGUMENT ON LOW DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS

21

Mi be the closure of the component that does not contain the boundary of S0 . Let
Mi0 be minimal with respect to inclusion among Mi ’s that intersect the lifts of the
vertices of f (K).
Suppose that for a vertex v ∈ K, we denote the lift of the surface f (v)(S) that
(v)(S), if it exists. Let Cv be a component of f̃
(v)(S) ∩ Mi0 .
intersects Mi0 by f̃
Laudenbach (see [Lau74, Corollary II.4.2] and also [Hat99, page 8]) showed that
there is a unique trivial h-cobordism Wv in Mi0 whose one end is Cv and the other
end lies on a lift of φ(S). Furthermore, p is a homeomorphism restricted to Wv .
Among the trivial cobordisms, for a vertex v ∈ K, let Wv be minimal with respect
to inclusion. Let {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } be the vertices connected to v in K. Since f (v)(S)
and f (vi )(S) are disjoint for all i and Wv is minimal, one can see that Wv does not
intersect Wvi . Now the trivial cobordism p(Wv ) plays the role of the ball B in the
previous case.
By pushing p(Cv ) across the trivial bordism to its other boundary and considering a nearby parallel copy, we obtain φ′0 ∈ K0δ (M, ψ) whose core is disjoint from
φ0 (S) and the core of all vertices that are connected to φ0 in f (K). Therefore, we
get a homotopy F ∶ K × [0, 1] → ∣K●δ (M, ψ)∣ where F (−, 0) = f , F (v, 1) = φ′0 and
F (−, 1) is the same as f on vertices other than v. Now the number of circles in
the intersections of φ(S) and the vertices of F (−, 1) has been reduced by one. By
repeating this process, we can eliminate all the remaining intersections.

3. Smoothing theory in low dimensions
Let M be a smooth manifold of dimension 2 or 3. To use a similar technique to
prove Theorem 1.1 which says
(3.1)

BDiff(M ) → BHomeo(M ),

is a weak equivalence, first one needs to show that
(3.2)

π0 (Diff(M )) = π0 (Homeo(M )).

This is not hard for surfaces ([Bol09]) but for 3-manifolds, it follows from a theorem
of Cerf ([Cer61]). Assuming that Diff(M ) and Homeo(M ) have the same group of
connected components, the statement is reduced to showing that the map
η ∶ BDiff 0 (M ) → BHomeo0 (M ),
induces a weak homotopy equivalence. But note that both spaces BDiff 0 (M ) and
BHomeo0 (M ) are simply connected, therefore it is enough to show that η induces
a homology isomorphism.
Similar to the previous section, by using certain semi-simplicial spaces, we want
to cut the manifold into pieces until we get to the disks. And the case for disks is a
corollary of Smale’s theorem ([Sma59]) for 2-disks and Hatcher’s theorem ([Hat83])
for 3-disks. But the only difference to the previous section is instead of having discrete and topologized versions of semisimplicial spaces, we would have the smooth
version and the topological version with a slight modification. For those semisimplicial spaces that involve the boundary of the manifold, we have to control the
behavior near the boundary.
Condition. Let M be a smooth manifold with boundary and let c ∶ ∂M ×[0, 1) ↪ M
be a collar neighborhood. For all semi-simplicial spaces (topological versions) that
involved the boundary, namely H● (M, φq ), we impose an extra condition of being
smooth near the boundary: for example a vertex [φ] ∈ H0 (M, φq ) which is given by
an embedding φ ∶ Dq × Dn−q ↪ M that restricts to a smooth embedding in a neighborhood of the boundary c(∂M ×[0, ǫ)) for some ǫ. Note that still Homeo0 (M, ∂M )
acts on H● (M, φq ) since Homeo0 (M, ∂M ) consists of homeomorphisms whose supports are away from the boundary.

22

SAM NARIMAN

Definition 3.3. We can define the smooth version of the topological version of all
semi-simplicial spaces considered in the previous section and we denote them by
superscript sm. For example, let H●sm (M, φq ) ⊂ H● (M, φq ) be a sub-semisimplicial
space consisting of smooth handles with an induced C 0 -topology rather than C ∞ topology.
Lemma 3.4. The maps from the smooth version of the semi-simplicial spaces
to the corresponding topological versions are equivariant with respect to the map
Diff 0 (M ) → Homeo0 (M ) and induce bijections between the set of orbits of the corresponding actions.
Proof. We give the proof for the map
H●sm (M, φq ) → H● (M, φq ),
and the other cases are similar. Note that in every orbit of the action of Homeo0 (M )
on H● (M, φq ), there is a smooth handle. Hence, the induced map between orbits is
surjective. To show that it is also injective, we want to show that for two smooth
q
n−q
handles φ, φ′ ∈ Embsm
, M ) ⊂ Emb∂ (Dq ×Dn−q , M ), if φ and φ′ are in the
∂ (D ×D
same orbit of the action of Homeo0 (M, ∂M ) on Emb∂ (Dq × Dn−q , M ), then they
q
n−q
are in the same orbit of the action of Diff 0 (M, ∂M ) on Embsm
, M ).
∂ (D × D
Now by the isotopy extension theorems for homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms,
we have maps between quasi-fibrations
Diff(M /φq , ∂(M /φq ))

Diff(M, ∂M )

n−q
Embsm
,M)
∂ (D × D

Homeo(M /φq , ∂(M /φq ))

Homeo(M, ∂M )

Emb∂ (Dq × Dn−q , M ).

By our assumption 3.2, since the first two vertical maps induce bijection on π0
so does the third vertical map. So, φ and φ′ are in the same path component of
q
n−q
Embsm
, M ). Therefore, by the isotopy extension theorem again there
∂ (D × D
exists an element in Diff 0 (M, ∂M ) that sends φ to φ′ .

Similar to Theorem 2.30, one can prove that the smooth version of semi-simplicial
spaces are weakly contractible. Hence, a similar argument as the previous section
reduces Theorem 1.1 to the fact that the map
(3.5)

BDiff(Dn , ∂Dn ) → BHomeo(Dn , ∂Dn ),

is a weak equivalence in these dimensions.
Remark 3.6. In dimension 3, Hatcher ([Hat83]) proved that the map
≃

SO(4) Ð
→ Diff(S 3 ),
is a weak equivalence. It is standard to see that this version of Hatcher’s theorem
is equivalent to the weak equivalence 3.5 for n = 3. Cerf in ([Cer61]) also used a
different method to prove that the weak equivalence
≃

Diff(M ) Ð
→ Homeo(M ),
can be reduced to Hatcher’s theorem.
4. Contractibility of the identity component of the diffeomorphism
group for certain low dimensional manifolds
Note that for a manifold M , the (weak) contractibility of Diff 0 (M ) is equivalent
to the acyclicity of the classifying space BDiff 0 (M ). Similar to previous sections,
we obtain a semisimplicial resolution for BDiff 0 (M ) by cutting the manifold into
simpler pieces. To show that BDiff 0 (M ) is acyclic, we then study the spectral
sequence associated to the semisimplicial resolutions.

4.1. Contractibility of Diff 0 (Σ, ∂Σ) for a surface Σ with boundary. We
sketch a new proof of the contractibility of the identity component of the diffeomorphisms of a surface with boundary by first showing that BDiff 0 (Σ, ∂Σ) is acyclic.
Therefore, by the Whitehead theorem it should be contractible. By the argument
of the previous section, we deduce that Homeo0 (Σ, ∂Σ) is also weakly contractible.
For a closed surface Σ with a negative Euler number, the contractibility of
Diff 0 (Σ) was first proved by Earle and Eells ([EE69]) using Teichmüller theory
and it was later extended to the surfaces with boundary by Earle and Schatz
([ES70]). Therefore, by the techniques of the previous sections, the contractibility
of Homeo0 (M ) which is a theorem of Hamstrom [Ham74] can be reduced to the
contractibility of Diff 0 (M ) which has a more concrete proof.
Gramain ([Gra73]) gave a topological proof of contractibility of Diff 0 (Σ) for Σ
with a negative Euler number and hence found a new proof of the contractibility of
the Teichmüller space. As was explained in Hatcher’s exposition ([Hat11, Appendix
B]), the case of the closed surface can be easily reduced to the case of a surface
with boundary.
Gramain’s proof reduces to the case of a disk by proving that certain space of
embeddings of arcs into a surface is contractible. But the advantage of working with
semi-simplicial sets is that proving the contractibility of their realizations is often
easier and more combinatorial. Having the contractibility of such semi-simplicial
sets, it was a homotopy theory lemma (Proposition 2.19) that implies that the
realization of the corresponding semi-simplicial spaces is weakly contractible.
As the input to our proof, we also use the contractibility of Diff(D2 , ∂D2 ) and for
a non-separating arc σ between two points on the boundary, we use a π0 -statement
that the the map between the mapping class groups
(4.1)

π0 (Diff(Σ/σ, ∂Σ/σ)) → π0 (Diff(Σ, ∂Σ)),

is injective where Σ/σ is a surface obtained from Σ by cutting along σ.
Theorem 4.2. Let Σ be a surface with a boundary, BDiff 0 (Σ, ∂Σ) is acyclic.
Proof. Similar to section 2.1.5, we use induction on handles to reduce to the case
of the disk. For a 1-handle φ and a p-simplex σp ∈ Hp (Σ, φ), by the induction
hypothesis, BDiff 0 (Σ/σp , ∂(Σ/σp )) is acyclic. Note that the surface Σ/σp is a union
of of p disjoint disks and a surface that is diffeomorphic to Σ/φ.
By the isotopy extension theorem, we have a fibration
Diff(Σ/σp , ∂(Σ/σp )) → Diff(Σ, ∂Σ) → Emb∂ (σp , Σ).
Given the injectivity of the map 4.1, we deduce that
Diff 0 (Σ/σp , ∂(Σ/σp )) → Diff 0 (Σ, ∂Σ) → orb(σp ),
is also a fibration. Hence, there is a weak equivalence
≃

→ Xp (Σ, φ),
∐ BDiff 0 (Σ/σp , ∂(Σ/σp )) Ð
σp

where the disjoint union is over a representative set of orbits. Given the induction
hypothesis that BDiff 0 (Σ/σp , ∂(Σ/σp )) is acyclic, the spectral sequence
1
Ep,q
= Hq (Xp (Σ, φ)) ⇒ Hp+q (BDiff 0 (Σ, ∂Σ); Z),

is concentrated in the first row q = 0. We have
H0 (Xp (Σ, φ)) = Z[the set of the orbits of the p-simplices].
Note that the set of orbits of the action of Diff 0 (Σ, ∂Σ) on Hp (Σ, φ) is in bijection
with (p + 1)-tuples (t0 , t1 , . . . , tp ) in φ({0} × int(D1 )) ⊂ ∂Σ. Therefore, we can
denote the set of the orbits by the semi-simplicial set Conf(●) where Conf(p) is the

24

SAM NARIMAN

set of p + 1 points in R. Let us denote the first differential of the spectral sequence
by δ which is given by the alternating sum ∑(−1)i di ∗ of the maps induced by the
face maps, di , of the semi-simplicial set Conf(●). Hence, it is enough to prove the
following claim:
Claim 4.3. The chain complex (Z[Conf(●)], δ) is acyclic.
Proof of the claim: To prove the claim, let us recall a theorem attributed to Moore
in [MP73, Theorem 4.1]. For a topological space X, let Sp (X) denote the the
group of singular p-chains of X with coefficients in Z. For a semisimplicial space
X● , let δ ∶ S∗ (X● ) → S∗ (X●−1 ) denote the map given by the alternating sum of maps
induced by the face maps. Let d ∶ S∗ (X● ) → S∗−1 (X● ) be the singular boundary
maps. Recall the total differential is D = d + (−1)p δ for elements in Sp (X● ). Hence,
we obtain a total chain complex (S∗ (X● ), D). Moore ([MP73, Theorem 4.1]) proved
that there is a natural chain equivalence
f ∶ (S∗ (X● ), D) → (S∗ (∣X● ∣), d).
Let us apply this theorem for X● = Conf(●). To compute the homology of the
double complex (S∗ (Conf(●)), D), we first filter it in the simplicial direction. The
1
first page of the associated spectral sequence is Ep,q
= Hq (Conf(p); Z). But Conf(●)
is a discrete space, therefore it is concentrated in the first row q = 0. Note that
1
the chain complex Ep,0
is the same as (Z[Conf(●)], δ). Since this spectral sequence
collapses, by the Moore theorem, we have
2
∞
Ep,0
= Ep,0
= Hp (∣Conf(●)∣; Z).

But similar to Proposition 2.13, one can show that ∣Conf(●)∣ is weakly contractible,
1
therefore the chain complex E∗,0
= (Z[Conf(●)], δ) must be acyclic.

4.2. Contractibility of Diff 0 (M, ∂M ) for a Haken manifold M with boundary. Hatcher computed the homotopy type of the space of PL homemorphisms of
Haken manifolds in [Hat76]. Given his proof of Smale’s conjecture, his computation of PL homeomorphisms carries over to diffeomorphisms of the Haken manifolds
([Hat99]). Here, we simplify his proof of the contractibility of Diff 0 (M, ∂M ) for
a Haken manifold M with boundary using the same idea as the proof of Theorem 4.2. Hatcher improved Laudenbach’s surgery techniques ([Lau74, Chapter
2.5]) to a parametrized surgery on the space of incompressible surfaces. In a way,
we simplify Hatcher’s proof by avoiding his parametrized surgery argument.
Let ψ ∶ S×[−1, 1] ↪ M be an embedding of a two-sided collar of an incompressible
surface. Recall in Definition 2.38, we defined K● (M, ψ) whose realization is weakly
contractible as the corollary of Proposition 2.49. Hence, we can define an augmented
semi-simplicial space X● (M, ψ) → BDiff 0 (M, ∂M ) as follows
X● (M, ψ) ∶= K● (M, ψ)//Diff 0 (M, ∂M ).
Given that ∣K● (M, ψ)∣ is weakly contractible, X● (M, ψ) is a semisimplicial resolution for BDiff 0 (M, ∂M ) i.e. the induced map
∣X● (M, ψ)∣ → BDiff 0 (M, ∂M ),
is a weak equivalence.
Theorem 4.4. If M is a Haken manifold with boundary, the classifying space
BDiff 0 (M, ∂M ) is acyclic.
Proof. Note that for every p-simplex σp ∈ Kp (M, ψ), the space M /σp is diffeomorphic to the disjoint union of M /ψ(S) with p copies of S×[−1, 1]. By the induction on
the Haken hierarchy, we can assume that BDiff 0 (M /ψ(S), ∂(M /ψ(S))) is acyclic.
Recall that S × [−1, 1] is a handlebody so there are finitely many embedded 2-disks

25

such that if we cut along those disks, we obtain a 3-ball. Thus contractibility of
Diff 0 (S × [−1, 1], ∂(S × [−1, 1])) is in fact a special case of Theorem 4.4. Therefore,
we can assume that for all σp , the space BDiff 0 (M /σp , ∂(M /σp )) is acyclic.
To identify the weak homotopy type of Xp (M, ψ), we need to determine the
homotopy type of Stab(σp ) for each σp ∈ Kp (M, ψ). Recall by the isotopy extension
theorem, we have a fibration
Diff(M /σp , ∂(M /σp )) → Diff(M, ∂M ) → Emb∂ (σp , M ).
By [Lau74, Chapter 2, Section 7.2], the fundamental group of Emb∂ (σp , M ) is
trivial, therefore we have an injection
π0 (Diff(M /σp , ∂(M /σp ))) ↪ π0 (Diff(M, ∂M )).
Thus we have a fibration
Diff 0 (M /σp , ∂(M /σp )) → Diff 0 (M, ∂M ) → orb(σp ),
which implies that there is a weak equivalence
≃

→ Xp (M, ψ),
∐ BDiff 0 (M /σp , ∂(M /σp )) Ð
σp

where the disjoint union is over a representative set of orbits. Therefore, similar to
the proof of Theorem 4.2, the spectral sequence
1
Ep,q
= Hq (Xp (M, ψ)) ⇒ Hp+q (BDiff 0 (M, ∂M ); Z),

implies that BDiff 0 (M, ∂M ) is acyclic.

Remark 4.5. We end with a question about hyperbolic three manifolds. Let M be
closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. Gabai in [Gab01] used his high powered “insulator”
machinary (see [Gab97]) and minimal surface theory to prove that Diff 0 (M ) is contractible by reducing to the case of Haken manifolds with boundary. We wondered
if the same techniques could prove Gabai’s theorem without using high powered
tools in geometry. To find a semisimplicial resolution for BDiff 0 (M ) let γ be a
closed geodesic in M . Fix a parametrized tubular neighborhood of γ by embedding
φ ∶ D2 × S 1 ↪ M so that φ({(0, 0)} × S 1 ) = γ.
Definition 4.6. Let B● (M ) be a semisimplicial space whose space of 0 simplices is
given by the space of oriented closed curves that are isotopic to γ. We define Bp (M )
as a subspace of B0 (M )p+1 to be the space of (p + 1)-tuples σp = (γ0 , γ1 , . . . , γp ) so
that there exists a diffeomorphism fσp ∈ Diff 0 (M ) where fσp (γi ) = φ({(ti , 0)} × S 1 )
for a ti such that t0 < t1 < ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ < tp . The i-th face maps is given by forgetting the
i-th curve.
Question 4.7. Is ∣B● (M )∣ weakly contractible?
Note that similar to Proposition 2.19, it is enough to show that realization of
the semi-simplicial set B● (M )δ is contractible. If the answer to this question is
affirmative, one could give a simpler proof of Gabai’s theorem as follows: Consider
the semisimplicial resolution
B● (M )//Diff 0 (M ) → BDiff 0 (M ).
Since the action of Diff 0 (M ) on B● (M ) is transitive, for a p-simplex σp in Bp (M ),
we have Bp (M )//Diff 0 (M ) ≃ BStab(σp ). Given that the complement of σp in M
is a Haken manifold, the identity component of Stab(σp ) is contractible, therefore
BStab(σp ) ≃ Bπ0 (Stab(σp )). On the other hand, using JSJ decomposition and
some hyperbolic geometry, it is not hard to show that π0 (Stab(σp )) is isomorphic
to the pure braid group PBrp+1 . Hence, one might have a spectral sequence
1
Ep,q
= Hq (BPBrp+1 ) ⇒ Hp+q (BDiff 0 (M ); Z),

but recall that a model for BPBrp+1 is an ordered configuration space Emb([p], D2 ).
Thus the above spectral sequence converges to the realization of the semi simplicial space Emb([●], D2 ). Now from Proposition 2.19 we know that the realization
of Emb([●], D2 ) is weakly contractible, therefore the above spectral sequence converges to zero in positive degrees.
