HYPERBOLIC METRIC ON THE STRIP AND THE SCHWARZ
LEMMA FOR HQR MAPPINGS
MIODRAG MATELJEVIĆ & MAREK SVETLIK

Abstract. We give simple proofs of various versions of the Schwarz lemma for
real valued harmonic functions and for holomorphic (more generally harmonic
quasiregular, shortly HQR) mappings with the strip codomain. Along the
way using the principle of subordination and the corresponding conformal
mapping, depicted on the Figure 1, we get a simple proof of a new version
of the Schwarz lemma for real valued harmonic functions (see Theorems 4
and 5) and Theorem 6 related to holomorphic mappings. Using the SchwarzPick lemma related to distortion for harmonic mappings and the elementary
properties of the hyperbolic geometry of the strip we prove Lemma 4, which
is a key ingredient in the proof of Theorem 7 which yields optimal estimates
for modulus of HQR mappings.

1. Introduction and preliminaries
Motivated by the role of the Schwarz lemma in complex analysis and numerous
fundamental results (see [1, 20, 8, 16] and references cited there and for some
recent result which are in our research direction [2, 7, 9, 14, 22]), in 2016, cf.
[21](a), the first author has posted the current research project “Schwarz lemma,
the Carathéodory and Kobayashi Metrics and Applications in Complex Analysis”∗.
Various discussions regarding the subject can also be found in the Q&A section
on ResearchGate under the question “What are the most recent versions of the
Schwarz lemma ?”,[21](b)†. In this project and in [16], cf. also [7] we developed
the method related to holomorphic mappings with strip codomain (we refer to this
method as the approach via the Schwarz-Pick lemma for holomorphic maps from
the unit disc into a strip). Note here that our use of terms the Schwarz lemma
and the Schwarz-Pick lemma is refer to the corresponding versions for modulus and
hyperbolic distances, respectively (we follow the terminology used in [3]).
In particular our work here is related to previous works [15, 13], and some recent
results of Kalaj and Vuorinen [7] (shortly KV-results; see also D. Khavinson [10],
G. Kresin and V. Maz’ya [11]). As we mentioned in [16], it seems that KV-results
influenced further research by H. Chen [4], M. Marković [14], A. Khalfallah [9] and
P. Melentijević [19].

One of the purpose of this paper, which is a relatively elementary contribution
and continuation of these research, is to demonstrate our approach and make a
common frame for previous works.
Throughout this paper by U we denote the unit disc {z ∈ C : |z| < 1}. By the
Riemann mapping theorem simply connected plane domains different from C (we
call these domains hyperbolic) are conformally equivalent to U. Accordingly if Ω is
a hyperbolic domain then by ρΩ (z)|dz| we denote the hyperbolic metric of Ω. This
metric induces a hyperbolic distance on Ω in the following way
Z
dΩ (z1 , z2 ) = inf ρΩ (z)|dz|,
γ

where the infimum is taken over all C 1 curves γ joining z1 to z2 in Ω.
2|dz|
and immediately follows that for all
It is well known that ρU (z)|dz| =
1 − |z|2
z1 , z2 ∈ U it holds
1 + σU (z1 , z2 )
= 2 artanh σU (z1 , z2 ),
1 − σU (z1 , z2 )


 z1 − z2 
.

where the pseudo-hyperbolic distance σU is given by σU (z1 , z2 ) = 
1 − z1 z2 
If f is a conformal map from hyperbolic domain Ω onto U then the hyperbolic
metric ρΩ (z)|dz| of Ω is defined by ρΩ (z)|dz| = ρU (f (z))|f ′ (z)|. Hence, one can
transfer the concept of the hyperbolic distance from U on hyperbolic domain Ω.
For more details related to hyperbolic domains, hyperbolic metric and distance,
see, for example [1, 3, 17].
In this paper, except the disc U, of other hyperbolic domains we will mainly use
the strip S = {z ∈ C : −1 < Re z < 1}.
Let D, G be domains in C. By Hol(D, G) (respectively Har(D, G)) we denote
the set of the all holomorphic (respectively harmonic) mappings f : D → G.
By de we denote Euclidean distance in C and for z ∈ C we define the functions
e and Re , by e(z) = de (0, z) = |z| and Re (z) = Re z, respectively.
For completeness we first give the classical Schwarz lemma which is a direct
corollary of maximum modulus principle.
dU (z1 , z2 ) = ln

Theorem 1 (The classical Schwarz lemma - the Schwarz lemma for holomorphic
maps from U into U). Let f ∈ Hol(U, U) and f (0) = 0. Then
(1)

|f (z)| 6 |z|,

for all

z ∈ U.

and
(2)

|f ′ (0)| 6 1.

In (1) the equality holds for one z ∈ U − {0} and in (2) the equality holds if and
only if f (z) = αz, where α ∈ C such that |α| = 1.
The following theorem is known as the Schwarz lemma for harmonic maps from
U into itself.
Theorem 2 (The Schwarz lemma for harmonic maps from U into U, [6], [5, p.
77]). Let f ∈ Har(U, U) and f (0) = 0. Then

and this inequality is sharp for each point z ∈ U.
Using the concept of the hyperbolic metric and hyperbolic distance on hyperbolic
domains one can derive the Schwarz-Pick lemma for simply connected domains as
a corollary of the classical Schwarz lemma:
Theorem 3 (The Schwarz-Pick lemma for simply connected domains, [3, Theorem
6.4.]). Let Ω1 and Ω2 be hyperbolic domains and f ∈ Hol(Ω1 , Ω2 ). Then
(4)

ρΩ2 (f (z))|f ′ (z)| 6 ρΩ1 (z),

for all

z ∈ Ω1 .

dΩ2 (f (z1 ), f (z2 )) 6 dΩ1 (z1 , z2 ),

for all

z 1 , z 2 ∈ Ω1 .

and
(5)

In (4) and (5) the equalities hold if and only if f is a conformal isomorphism from
Ω1 into Ω2 .
In this paper we will use only the special case of this result if the domain is the
unit disc and the codomain is the strip.
In Example 1 we consider the conformal mapping φ from the unit disc U onto
the strip S. In Lemmas 1 and 2 we explicitly find the maximum and minimum
of the function Re and the maximum of the function e on the closed hyperbolic
disc in S which is obtained as image of the closed hyperbolic disc with center 0 in
U by mapping φ. Note that the proof of Lemma 1 is elementary and it is based
on the properties of mapping φ. The proof of Lemma 2 is based on Proposition 2
which gives us an interesting relation between the hyperbolic and Euclidean distance
on S. Theorem 4 follows directly from the formula (12) of Lemma 1 and the
subordination principle. Further development of this method yields Theorem 5
(without hypothesis that 0 is mapped to 0) which seems to be a new result (see
also Example 3 and Lemma 3).
It seems here that it is right place to emphasize the following difference between
holomorphic and harmonic maps.
If f is holomorphic mapping from U into itself such that f (0) = b, where b ∈ U,
then using the mapping f b = ϕb ◦ f , where ϕb is conformal automorphism of U (see
Example 2 below), we reduce this situation to the case b = 0, since f b (0) = 0. As
far as we know the researchers have some difficulties to handle the case f (0) = b if
f is harmonic mapping from U into (−1, 1), since in that case the mapping f b is
not harmonic in general. Our method overcome this difficulty.
To get optimal estimate for modulus of holomorphic (more generally HQR) mappings we use the elementary properties of the hyperbolic geometry of the strip, see
Lemmas 2 and 4, and Theorems 6 and 7.
In order to establish Theorem 7 (the Schwarz lemma for HQR maps from U
into S) among other things we will use the following elementary considerations (see
[16]):
(I) Suppose that f ∈ Hol(U, S). Then by Theorem 3 we have ρS (f (z))|f ′ (z)| 6
ρU (z), for all z ∈ U.
(II) If f = u+iv is a complex valued harmonic and F = U +iV is a holomorphic
function on a domain D such that Re f = Re F on D (in this setting we say
that F is associated to f or to u), then F ′ = Ux +iVx = Ux −iUy = ux −iuy .
Hence, if ∇u = (ux , uy ) = ux + iuy then F ′ = ∇u and |F ′ | = |∇u| = |∇u|.

4

(III) Suppose that D is a simply connected plane domain and f : D → S is a
complex valued harmonic function. Then it is known from the standard
course of complex analysis that there is a holomorphic function F on D
such that Re f = Re F on D, and it is clear that F : D → S.
(IV) The hyperbolic density ρS at point z depends only on Re z.
By (I)-(IV) it is readable that we have
Proposition 1 ([16, Proposition 2.4], [7, 4]). Let u : U → (−1, 1) be harmonic
function and let F be holomorphic function which is associated to u. Then
(6)

ρS (F (z))|∇u(z)| 6 ρU (z)

for all

z ∈ U.

Note the above described simple method basically based on the Schwarz-Pick
lemma for holomorphic maps from U into S yields a proof of the above proposition to
which we refer as the Schwarz-Pick lemma related to distortion for harmonic maps
from U into (−1, 1). By this proposition we control distortion of HQR mappings.
Note here that there is tightly connection between the subordination principle
and the various versions of the Schwarz-Pick lemma for holomorphic maps from U
into S. Namely in the proof of Theorem 4 and Theorem 6 (the Schwarz lemma for
holomorphic maps from U into S) we have used a corollary of the subordination
principle which can be stated in the form (see Definition 1 for notation):
(V) If f ∈ Hol(U, S) and a ∈ U, then the image of the hyperbolic disc in U with
hyperbolic center a and hyperbolic radius λ under f is in the hyperbolic
disc in S with hyperbolic center at f (a) and hyperbolic radius λ.
Note that (V) is the Schwarz-Pick lemma for holomorphic maps from U into S.
Instead of subordination principle in the proof of Theorem 7 (the Schwarz lemma
for HQR maps from U into S) we use Lemma 4, which can be consider as a generalization of (V):
(VI) If f ∈ HQRK (U, S) (see definition below) and a ∈ U, then the image the
hyperbolic disc in U with hyperbolic center a and hyperbolic radius λ under
f is in the hyperbolic disc in S with hyperbolic center f (a) and hyperbolic
radius Kλ.
Note that proof of Lemma 4 is based on Proposition 1 (the Schwarz-Pick lemma
related to distortion for harmonic maps from U into (−1, 1)).
2. Some useful examples

that the mapping ϕ is holomorphic and injective on S and maps S onto U. Therefore
the inverse mapping of the ϕ maps U onto S. Denote that inverse mapping by φ.
It is of interest to consider in more detail the mapping φ. Let

4. Euclidean properties of hyperbolic discs
Definition 1. Let λ > 0 be arbitrary. By Dλ (a) (respectively Sλ (b)) we denote the
hyperbolic disc in U (respectively in S) with hyperbolic center a ∈ U (respectively
b ∈ S) and hyperbolic radius λ. More precisely Dλ (a) = {z ∈ U : dU (z, a) < λ}
and Sλ (b) = {z ∈ S : dS (z, b) < λ}. Also, Dλ (a) = {z ∈ U : dU (z, a) 6 λ} and
S λ (b) = {z ∈ S : dS (z, b) 6 λ} are corresponding closed discs. Specially, if a = 0
(respectively b = 0) we omit a (respectively b) from the notations.
Remark 1. If f is a conformal isomorphism from U onto S such that f (a) = b
then f (Dλ (a)) = Sλ (b) and f (Dλ (a)) = S λ (b).
Let r ∈ (0, 1) be arbitrary. By Ur we denote Euclidean disc {z ∈ C : |z| < r}
and by U r we denote the corresponding closed disc. Also, let

λ(r) = dU (r, 0) = ln

Since dU (z, 0) = ln

1+r
= 2 artanh r.
1−r

1 + |z|
= 2 artanh |z| for all z ∈ U, we have
1 − |z|

Dλ(r) = {z ∈ C : 2 artanh |z| < 2 artanh r} = {z ∈ C : |z| < r} = Ur ,
and similarly
Dλ(r) = U r .
The closed discs Dλ(r) and S λ(r) are shown on the Figure 1 and the following
lemma to claim that disc S λ(r) be contained in a Euclidean rectangle.

equal 1 and therefore |nθ0 | = 1. Now, it is obviously that tan θ0 = R and therefore
2r
= 2 arctan r.
(15)
θ0 = arctan R = arctan
1 − r2
Further, since ln |nθ0 | = 1 it is easy seen that L0 = max{− ln(c − R), ln(c + R)}.

such that ψ s maps (−i, i) onto (−is, is) with ψ s (0) = 0. Also, for r ∈ (0, 1) set
E r,s = ψ s (U r ). We leave to the interested reader to check that for r enough near

Re (S λ(r) (b)) = [mb (r), Mb (r)],

one can show that
(19)

S λ(r) (b) is symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Also, by [3, Theorem 7.11]

S λ(r) (b) is Euclidean convex.

In this section we first give a simple proof of the classical Schwarz lemma for

known that there exists f ∈ Hol(U, S) such that u = Re f and f (0) = 0. By
subordination principle we have f (U r ) ⊂ φ(U r ), where φ is mapping defined in
Example 1. Now, since U r = Dλ(r) and since S λ(r) = φ(D λ(r) ) by Lemma 1 we

b : U → (−1, 1) on the
following way u
b(ζ) = (Re φ)(e−i arg z ζ)§, where φ is mapping defined in Example
1. Note that function u
b depend on the point z. It immediately follows that u
b is

6. The Schwarz lemma for holomorphic maps from U into S
Theorem 2 is usually considered as harmonic version of Theorem 1. In analogy
with Theorems 1 and 2 we prove the next results (Theorems 6 and 7). Whereby, the
codomain U and the function arctan are replaced by the strip S and the function
artanh, respectively. For K = 1 Theorem 7 is reduced to Theorem 6.

In (24) the equality holds if and only if f (z) = φ(αz), where α ∈ C such that
|α| = 1, and φ is mapping defined in Example 1.

f (U r ) ⊂ φ(U r ), where φ is mapping defined in Example 1. Since U r = Dλ(r) and
since S λ(r) = φ(D λ(r) ) we have f (U r ) ⊂ S λ(r) . Hence, by Lemma 2 we obtain

function fb depend on the point z. It immediately follows that fb ∈ Hol(U, S) and

Quasiregular maps are a class of continuous maps between Euclidean spaces
Rn of the same dimension or, more generally, between Riemannian manifolds of
the same dimension, which share some of the basic properties with holomorphic
functions of one complex variable.
Let D and G be domains in C. A C 1 mapping f : D → G we call sense-preserving
K−quasiregular mapping if
a) |fz (z)| > |fz (z)| for all z ∈ D;
|fz (z)| + |fz (z)|
6 K for all z ∈ D.
|fz (z)| − |fz (z)|
Thus the linear map (df )z = fz (z)dz + fz (z)dz maps circles with center at z onto
ellipses such that the ratio between the big axis and the small axis is uniformly
bounded by K with respect to z ∈ D.
Injective K−quasiregular mappings are called K−quasiconformal mappings. Quasiconformal maps play a crucial role in Teichmüller theory and complex dynamics.
The class of all harmonic sense-preserving K−quasiregular mapping f : D → G
we denote by HQRK (D, G).
b) there exists K > 1 such that

Example 4. Let K > 1 and let AK : S → S be defined by AK (x, y) = (x, Ky).
It is clear that the mapping AK is sense-preserving K−quasiregular. Let ψK =
AK ◦ φ, where φ is the mapping defined in Example 1. It is easy to check that
ψK ∈ HQRK (U, S).
Lemma 4. Let K > 1, f ∈ HQRK (U, S). Then
(26)

dS (f (z1 ), f (z2 )) 6 KdU (z1 , z2 )

for all

z1 , z2 ∈ U.

Proof. Set u = Re f and ∇u = (ux , uy ). Since f is K−quasiregular one can check
that
(27)

|fz (z)| + |fz (z)| 6 K|∇u(z)|

for all

z ∈ U.

By Proposition 1 we have
(28)

ρS (f (z))|∇u(z)| 6 ρU (z)

for all

z ∈ U.

From (27) and (28) it follows that
(29)

ρS (f (z)) (|fz (z)| + |fz (z)|) 6 KρU (z)

for all

z ∈ U.

It is well known in general that the estimate of the gradient by means of the
corresponding densities yields the corresponding estimate between the distances,
see for example [16]. The detailed verification of it being left to the reader. In
particular, we get (26).

Note that if codomain is U the result of this type is proved in [13] and [12].

f ∈ HQRK (U, S) and f (0) = 0. Then

and this inequality is sharp for each point z ∈ U.

Proof. Let z ∈ U be arbitrary. By the Lemma 4 we have
(31)

dS (f (z), 0) 6 KdU (z, 0).

Since dU (z, 0) = λ(|z|), from (31) it follows that f (z) belongs to the closed hyperbolic disc with hyperbolic center 0 and hyperbolic radius Kλ(|z|), i.e. f (z) ∈ S Kλ(|z|) .

Hence, by Lemma 2 we get |f (z)| 6 Kλ(|z|) = K artanh |z|.

As in the proof of Theorem 6, one can show that the inequality (30) is sharp. In
this case, instead of mapping φ defined in Example 1 the mapping ψK defined in
Example 4 should be used.
