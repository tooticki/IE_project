Abstract. A volume growth-based proof of the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem for Banach spaces
is presented, following the approach of Ruelle for cocycles acting on a Hilbert space. As a consequence, we obtain a volume growth interpretation for the Lyapunov exponents of a Banach space
cocycle.

1. Introduction and Statement of Results
1.1. Introduction. The purpose of this paper is to present a volume-based proof of the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (MET) for cocycles on a Banach space, from which a volume growth
rate interpretation of Lyapunov exponents for such cocycles will be readily apparent.
By now, there are many proofs of the MET for cocycles on finite dimensional vector spaces, e.g.,
[18, 20, 21, 28]; for additional treatments, see Section 3.4 of [2] or §1.5 of [15]. For applications, particularly for the purposes of smooth ergodic theory, the most successful interpretation of Lyapunov
exponents is that of volume growth: the exponential growth rate of the q-dimensional volume of a
‘generic’ q-dimensional subspace is the sum of the first q Lyapunov exponents.
The volume growth interpretation for the Lyapunov exponents for cocycles of operators on finite
dimensional spaces is implicit in Ruelle’s proof of the MET [21]: the q-th Lyapunov exponent is
defined as the exponential growth rate of the q-th singular value of high iterates of the cocycle,
and it is shown that the ‘slow’ growing singular value decomposition subspaces for high iterates of
the cocycle converge at an exponentially fast rate to the subspaces of ‘slow’ growing vectors for the
cocycle. The very same approach is used to prove the MET for compact cocycles on Hilbert spaces
in [22], and the volume growth interpretation is the same, since the finite dimensional subspaces of
a Hilbert space carry notions of volume and determinant inherited from the inner product on the
ambient Hilbert space.
For cocycles on Banach spaces, the MET was originally proved by Mañé for compact, injective
cocycles satisfying a certain continuity condition [17]. Thieullen extended Mañé’s result to include
injective cocycles satisfying a quasicompactness condition [27], and Lian and Lu proved a version of
the MET for injective cocycles on separable Banach spaces satisfying only a measurability condition
[16]. The method in these papers is to show that the ‘fast’ growing subspaces (that is, subspaces of
vectors achieving a sufficient rate of exponential contraction in backwards time) are almost surely
finite dimensional. Then, Lyapunov exponents are defined to be the exponential rates at which
the dimension of the ‘fast’ growing subspaces has a jump discontinuity, and it is shown that the
‘slow’ growing subspaces are the graphs of mappings given by a certain convergent infinite series
of graphing maps.
Thieullen also considered non-injective cocycles [27], and deduced from the MET for injective
cocycles that even when the cocycles aren’t injective, the ‘slow’ growing subspaces are finitecodimensional and vary measurably, and the only possible growth rates of vectors are Lyapunov
exponents; this result is referred to as the One-Sided MET, and holds even when the base dynamics are noninvertible. Thieullen’s proof in [27] involves passing to an injective ‘natural extension’

cocycle over an augmented Banach space. Doan, in his PhD thesis [25], carried out an analogous
deduction for strongly measurable cocycles on a separable Banach space, assuming the MET in
[16].
Quas, Froyland and Lloyd [9] deduced from the One-Sided MET in [27] that even when the
cocycle is not injective, there is still an invariant, measurably-varying distribution of ‘fast’ growing
subspaces, as long as the base dynamics are invertible. Quas and González-Tokman [10] also
deduced the existence of an invariant distribution of ‘fast’-growing subspaces for cocycles on a
separable Banach space satisfying the measurability condition in [16], assuming the One-Sided
MET in [25].
In all known proofs of the Banach space MET, genuine finite-dimensional volumes (with multiplicative determinants) are not used, and there is no apparent volume growth interpretation of the
Lyapunov exponents. So, it is natural to ask whether there can be a volume growth interpretation
for Lyapunov exponents of cocyles acting on a Banach space, noting that there is no trouble assigning volumes to the finite dimensional subspaces of a Banach space, using Haar measure, and
that one can define determinants as volume ratios taken using these volumes.
Indeed, once the MET is proven by other means, it is possible to show that Lyapunov exponents
have the very same volume growth interpretation as in the Hilbert space case. In light of Ruelle’s
approach to the MET in [21, 22], though, this order of actions is strange: volume growth is used to
prove the MET, and the volume growth interpretation of the Lyapunov exponents follows naturally.
The purpose of the present paper is to show how to deduce the Banach space MET using volume
growth ideas, using arguments analogous to those in [22], from which the volume growth rate
interpretation of Lyapunov exponents will be easily seen. The proof we present treats non-injective
cocycles with no added effort, and yields immediately that vectors sufficiently inclined away from
‘slow’ growing subspaces grow uniformly quickly.
After the work in the present manuscript was completed, the author was made aware of the similar
work of A. Quas and C. Gonzalez-Tokman [11]. The present work was carried out simultaneously
with and independently of [11]. We note that there are several technical differences between the
precise statement of the MET in [11] and that given in the present paper.
For the rest of this section, we will define and describe the volumes on finite dimensional subspaces
that we use, state assumptions on the cocycles we will study, and state the MET. In Section 2,
we will give preliminaries on the geometry of Banach spaces and the volumes on finite dimensional
subspaces necessary for the proof, which will be given in Section 3.
1.2. Statement of Results. We now state our results precisely, beginning with an overview of
volumes on finite dimensional subspaces of a Banach space.
1.2.1. Volumes and Determinants on Finite Dimensional Subspaces. We let (B, | · |) be an infinite
dimensional Banach space, and let E ⊂ B be a a finite dimensional subspace. Treating E as
a topological group with the group action given by addition of vectors, there exists a nonzero,
translation invariant measure on E, unique up to a scalar factor: the Haar measure on E (§2.2 of
[8]). In the definition of volumes given below, we normalize the Haar measure on E by assigning a
particular volume to the | · |- unit ball of E.
Definition 1.1. Let q ∈ N and let E ⊂ B be a q-dimensional subspace. We define the induced
volume mE on E to be the unique Haar measure on E for which
mE {e ∈ E : |e| ≤ 1} = ωq ,

where ωq is the q-dimensional volume of the Euclidean unit ball in Rq .
Many identities involving volume on inner product spaces can be recovered for the induced
volume as inequalities, with uniform bounds depending only on the dimension q of the subspace.

The following is a prototypical example, and demonstrates that the induced volume really does
‘see’ the geometry on finite dimensional subspaces.
Lemma 1.2. If E ⊂ B has dimension q < ∞, then for any v1 , · · · , vq ∈ E, we have
mE P [v1 , · · · , vq ] ≈ |vq | ·

q−1
Y
i=1

d(vi , hvj : i < j ≤ qi),

where P [v1 , · · · , vq ] = {c1 v1 + · · · + cq vq : 0 ≤ ci ≤ 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ q} is the parallelepiped spanned by
v1 , · · · , vq . For vectors w1 , · · · , wq ∈ B, we denote by hw1 , · · · , wk i the subspace of B spanned by
the vectors w1 , · · · , wq . The symbol ≈ denotes equality up to a multiplicative constant depending
only on q.
Using the tools developed in Section 2, the proof of Lemma 1.2 is straightforward, and is sketched
in Remark 2.16.
With these volumes in place, the determinant is defined as a volume ratio: for a bounded linear
map A : B → B and a finite dimensional subspace E ⊂ B, we write
(
mAE AO
A injective on E,
mE O
(1.1)
det(A|E) =
0
otherwise,
where O is any Borel subset of E with nonzero mE -volume. By the uniqueness of Haar measure,
the right-hand side of (1.1) does not depend on the set O ⊂ E.
Define the maximal q-dimensional volume growth
(1.2)

Vq (A) = sup{det(A|E) : E ⊂ B, dim E = q}

for bounded, linear maps A : B → B, and observe that since the determinant is multiplicative, being
a Radon-Nikodym derivative, Vq is submultiplicative, i.e., for bounded linear maps A, B : B → B,
we have Vq (AB) ≤ Vq (A)Vq (B).
1.2.2. Statement of the MET. Let (X, F, µ) be a probability space, and let f be a measure preserving transformation on (X, F, µ). Throughout the paper, we assume for simplicity that µ is
ergodic; the only real difference in the nonergodic case is that the Lyapunov exponents and their
multiplicities may now depend on the point in the base space, but this complication does not change
the underlying arguments in any substantive way.
A cocycle is a map T : X → L(B), where L(B) is the space of bounded linear operators on B,
subject to the following measurability assumption.
(1.3)

There is a sequence of finite-valued maps T (n) : X → L(B) such that for

any x ∈ X, Tx(n) → Tx in L(B) in the induced operator norm as n → ∞.
(n)

We write Tx , Tx for T, T (n) evaluated at x ∈ X, respectively. The condition (1.3) is called uniform
measurability (Definition 3.5.5 in [12]).
We write Txn = Tf n−1 x ◦ · · · ◦ Tx , and for λ ∈ R, we define the subspaces
(1.4)

Fλ (x) = {v ∈ B : lim sup
n→∞

1
log |Txn v| ≤ λ},
n

using the convention log 0 = −∞. For A ∈ L(B), we denote by |A|α the measure of noncompactness
of A, which will be defined precisely in Definition 2.8.
We now state the main result of this paper, a version of the MET emphasizing the volume growth
interpretation of the Lyapunov exponents of a Banach space cocycle. Note that we do not assume
that Tx is an injective operator.

Then, there is a µ-full, f -invariant set Γ ⊂ X with the following properties.
(1) For x ∈ Γ, the q-dimensional growth rates

exist and are constant over Γ. Similarly, lα = limn→∞ n1 log |Txn |α exists and is constant
over Γ.
(2) Defining the sequence {Kq }q≥1 by K1 = l1 and Kq = lq − lq−1 for q > 1, we have that
K1 ≥ K2 ≥ · · · , and that Kq → lα as q → ∞. We denote by λi the distinct values of
the
P sequence {Kq }q with finite multiplicities mi ; in particular, for any l > lα , we have that
i:λi ≥l mi < +∞. The Lyapunov exponents λi satisfy the following.
(a) For any Lyapunov exponent λi , we have that codim Fλi (x) = m1 + m2 + · · · + mi−1 .
(b) For any subsequent pair of Lyapunov exponents λi > λi+1 ≥ lα and for any x ∈ Γ,

Remark 1.4. The measurability assumption on the cocycle in [17, 27] is called µ-continuity, and is
stronger than (1.3): µ-continuity requires the base space X to be a compact topological space with
Borel σ-algebra F, the base map f to be continuous, and the existence of a sequence of disjoint
compact sets {Kn }n in X with µ (∪n Kn ) = 1 for which T |Kn is norm continuous Kn → L(B).
In [16], the Banach space B is assumed separable, and the measurability condition in that paper
is strong measurability, which requires that the evaluation maps x 7→ Tx v for v ∈ B be measurable
as maps (X, F) → (B, Bor(B)) (Definition 3.5.4 in [12]), where Bor(B) refers to the Borel sigmaalgebra for the norm topology on B; the same measurability hypothesis is used in [11]. The condition
(1.3) implies strong measurability (see Corollary 1 to Theorem 3.5.3 in [12]).
Remark 1.5. Item (3) in Theorem 1.3 is formulated precisely and proved in the Appendix as
Lemma 3.11. We note that this measurability is entirely independent of the arguments proving
items (1), (2); however, we include it for the sake of completeness.
1.3. Notation. We collect here the various notations used in the paper.
(1) We denote by (X, F, µ, f ) an ergodic m.p.t.; we do not assume that f is invertible.
(2) For a, b ∈ R, a ∨ b = max{a, b}.
(3) Let q ∈ N. For a, b ∈ [0, ∞), we will write a . b when a ≤ Cq b, and a ≈ b if a . b and
b . a. It will be clear from context which constant ., ≈ depend on.
(4) For normed vector spaces V1 , V2 , we denote by L(V1 , V2 ) the space of bounded linear operators V1 → V2 .
(5) B will always refer to an infinite dimensional Banach space with norm | · |, and we always
refer to the induced operator norm on L(B) := L(B, B) by the same symbol | · |.
(6) For a subspace E ⊂ B, we let BE := {v ∈ E : |v| ≤ 1} denote the closed unit ball and
SE := {v ∈ E : |v| = 1} denote the unit sphere.

(7) For vectors v1 , · · · , vm ∈ B, we denote by hvi : 1 ≤ i ≤ mi or hv1 , · · · , vm i the subspace of B spanned by v1 , · · · , vm . We denote the parallelepiped spanned by v1 , · · · , vm by
P [v1 , · · · , vm ] = {c1 v1 + · · · + cm vm : ci ∈ [0, 1]}.
(8) Let A ∈ L(B) and let E ⊂ B be a subspace. We denote by A|E ∈ L(E, B) the restriction of
A to E.
(9) When dim E < ∞, we denote by det(A|E) the determinant of A on E, as defined in (1.1).
(10) For a subspace F ⊂ B, we denote by F ◦ the annihilator of F in B ∗ , i.e.,
F ◦ := {l ∈ B ∗ : l(f ) = 0 for all f ∈ F }.
(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

The codimension of a closed subspace F ⊂ B is defined by codim F = dim F ◦ .
For a vector space V , we write V = E ⊕ F when V is the direct sum of E and F , i.e., each
vector in V can be written as the unique sum of an element of E and an element of F ,
and we call such a splitting of V an algebraic splitting; we write πE//F for the projection
operator onto E parallel to F .
When V is a normed vector space, V = E ⊕ F is an algebraic splitting, and πE//F is a
bounded linear operator, we call V = E ⊕ F a topological splitting. For a closed subspace
E ⊂ B, if F ⊂ B is a closed subspace for which B = E ⊕ F is a topological splitting, we call
F a topological complement to E.
G(B) refers to the Grassmanian of closed subspaces of B, and Gq (B), G q (B) refer to the
subsets of q-dimensional and q-codimensional subspaces of B, respectively. dH refers to the
Hausdorff distance on G(B), defined in (2.2).
For A ∈ L(B) and q ∈ N, cq (A) denotes the q-th Gelfand number of A, defined in (2.17), and
c(A) is defined as the limit limq→∞ cq (A). We denote by |A|α the measure of compactness
of A, as in Definition 2.8.
2. Induced Volumes and Banach Space Geometry

In this section, we collect some results on the geometry of Banach spaces and discuss the geometric properties of the induced volumes defined in Section 1.
For our purposes, there are two echelons for the geometry for Banach spaces: the ‘local’ geometry
of finite dimensional subspaces and the induced volumes on them, and the ‘global’ geometry of the
Banach space at large.
2.1. Global Geometry of Banach Spaces. We begin by defining a concept of ‘angle’ in Banach
space, and showing its relation to the projection maps associated to splittings. Next, we recall
some facts about the geometry of the Grassmanian of closed subspaces of B. Finally, we recall the
definition and some basic properties of the measure of noncompactness | · |α .
2.1.1. Angles, Splittings and Complements. Key to volume-growth based approaches to the MET
is a concept of angle between vectors and subspaces. The following notion of angle is well-suited
to our purposes. Definition 2.1 is adapted from Section II of Mañé’s paper [17], and is also very
similar to the minimal angle defined in Section 5 of [3].
Definition 2.1. Let E, F ⊂ B be subspaces. The minimal angle θ(E, F ) ∈ [0, π2 ] from E to F is
defined by
sin θ(E, F ) = inf{|e − f | : e ∈ E, |e| = 1, f ∈ F }.
Roughly speaking, the minimal angle θ(E, F ) will be small whenever E is inclined towards F .
Note that θ(E, F ) may not equal θ(F, E). The minimal angle has an interpretation in terms of
splittings of Banach space.

Lemma 2.2. Let B = E ⊕ F be an algebraic splitting, and assume E 6= {0}. Then, B = E ⊕ F is
topological if and only if θ(E, F ) > 0, in which case we have
sin θ(E, F ) = |πE//F |−1 ,

where πE//F is the projection to E parallel to F .

Proof. Let P = πE//F , which is well-defined and possibly unbounded when B = E ⊕ F is not
topological. One computes

sin θ(E, F )

where we interpret the RHS of this formula as ∞ whenever θ(E, F ) = 0.

It is crucial to also have access to complements for subspaces of finite dimension and codimension,
as there is no assignment of an ‘orthogonal complement’ to closed subspaces of a Banach space.
Lemma 2.3 (III.B.10 and III.B.11 of [29]). Fix q ∈ N.
For any subspace E ⊂ B with dim E = q, there exists a topological complement F for E such
√
that sin θ(E, F ) ≥ √1q , i.e., |πE//F | ≤ q.
For any closed subspace F ⊂ B with codim F = q, there exists a topological complement E for F
√
1
such that sin θ(F, E) ≥ √q+2
, i.e., |πF//E | ≤ q + 2.
We will also need the following lemma regarding complements.
Lemma 2.4. Let A ∈ L(B) and E1 ⊂ B be a finite dimensional subspace for which A|E1 is
injective. If F2 is a topological complement to E2 := AE1 , then F1 = {v ∈ B : Av ∈ F2 } is a
dim E1 -codimensional subspace complementing E1 . Moreover,
(2.1)

πE1 //F1 = (A|E1 )−1 ◦ πE2 //F2 ◦ A

Proof. Let P = (A|E1 )−1 ◦ πE2 //F2 ◦ A, which is a bounded linear operator on B with range E1 ⊂ B.
One computes that P |E1 is the identity on E1 , and so P is a bounded projection operator. Define
Fe = ker P , which is a topological complement to E1 . With F1 := {v ∈ B : Av ∈ F2 }, we will show
that Fe = F1 , as desired.
First, let f1 ∈ F1 . The definition of P implies A◦P f1 = πE2 //F2 ◦Af1 , but Af1 ∈ F2 = ker πE2 //F2
by assumption, and so A ◦ P f1 = 0. But we assumed that A|E1 is injective, and so P f1 = 0;
so, we have deduced that Fe ⊃ F1 . For the other inclusion, if f ∈ Fe, then P f = 0 implies
Af ∈ ker πE2 //F2 = F2 , and so f ∈ {v ∈ B : Av ∈ F2 } = F1 follows, hence Fe ⊂ F1 .


2.1.2. The Grassmanian on Banach Space. We denote by G(B) the space of closed subspaces of B,
endowed with the Hausdorff distance of unit spheres: for U, V ∈ G(B), we set
(2.2)

dH (U, V ) = dH (SU , SV ),

where SU = {u ∈ U : |u| = 1}, and the Hausdorff distance between closed subsets A, B of a metric
space is defined by
dH (A, B) = max{sup d(a, B), sup d(b, A)},
a∈A

b∈B

where d(a, B) := inf{d(a, b) : b ∈ B}. We define Gq (B) = {E ∈ G(B) : dim E = q} and G q (B) =
{F ∈ G(B) : codim F = q}. The following are some basic properties of the Hausdorff distance dH .
Proposition 2.5 (Chapter IV, §2.1 of [13]). The metric space (G(B), dH ) has the following properties.

A VOLUME-BASED APPROACH TO THE MULTIPLICATIVE ERGODIC THEOREM ON BANACH SPACES

7

(1) (G(B), dH ) is complete.
(2) The subsets Gq (B), G q (B) are closed in (G(B), dH ).
It is actually somewhat inconvenient to compute directly with dH , and so frequently it will be
easier to use the gap, defined for E, E ′ ∈ G(B) by
δ(E, E ′ ) :=

sup

d(e, E ′ ).

e∈E,|e|=1

Lemma 2.6. Let U, V ∈ G(B).
(1) δ(U, V ) ∨ δ(V, U ) ≤ dH (U, V ) ≤ 2(δ(U, V ) ∨ δ(V, U )).
(2) δ(U, V ) = δ(V ◦ , U ◦ ).
(3) Let q ∈ N, and assume either that U, V ∈ Gq (B) or that U, V ∈ G q (B). If δ(U, V ) < 1q , then
(2.3)

δ(V, U ) ≤

qδ(U, V )
.
1 − qδ(U, V )

Proof. Item 1 is proven in Chapter IV, §2.1 of [13], and Item 2 is Lemma 2.8 in Chapter IV, §2.3 of
[13]. For Item 3, if U, V ∈ Gq (B), let {u1 , · · · , uq } be a basis of U : for any α > 1, we can obtain a
basis {vi }qi=1 of V by demanding that |ui −vi | ≤ αδ(V, U ). We can now compare v = c1 v1 +· · ·+cq vq
with u := c1 u1 + · · · + c1 uq , proving (2.3) in this case. For U, V ∈ G q (B), note that by Item 2,
δ(U, V ) = δ(V ◦ , U ◦ ) and δ(V, U ) = δ(U ◦ , V ◦ ), and so we can apply the q-dimensional version of
(2.3) to conclude in this case.

When B = E ⊕ F is a topological splitting, it is important to know when a subspace E ′ ⊂ B
nearby to E is also complemented to F . Using intuition from finite dimensional geometry, it is
reasonable to suggest that this involves the distance dH (E, E ′ ) and the inclination of E towards F ,
namely sin θ(E, F ).
Proposition 2.7. Let B = E ⊕ F be a topological splitting. For any E ′ ∈ G(B) for which
dH (E, E ′ ) < sin θ(E, F ), we have that B = E ′ ⊕ F is a topological splitting, in which case the
projection πF//E ′ satisfies
(2.4)

|πF//E ′ |E | ≤

2d(E, E ′ )
.
|πE//F |−1 − d(E, E ′ )

The proof of Proposition 2.7 is given in full detail the Appendix.
2.1.3. Measure of Noncompactness. We close this section with a brief review of the measure of
noncompactness | · |α . Let C ⊂ B be a bounded set. We define q(C) to be the infimum over the set
of all r > 0 for which C admits a finite open cover by | · |-balls of radius r.
Definition 2.8. Let B, B ′ be two Banach spaces, and let A ∈ L(B, B ′ ). We define the measure of
noncompactness of A to be |A|α := q(ABB ).

| · |α and related notions are discussed in [1]. Definition 2.8 is actually given as Theorem 2.4.2 in
[1], as | · |α is defined there in a different, yet equivalent, way. We now list some of the properties
of | · |α .
Proposition 2.9 (1.4.1 of [1]). | · |α is a submultiplicative seminorm on L(B, B ′ ). Precisely, let
B, B ′ , B ′′ Banach spaces; for T, U ∈ L(B, B ′ ) and V ∈ L(B ′ , B ′′ ), we have
|T + U |α ≤ |T |α + |U |α ,
|V U |α ≤ |V |α · |U |α .

Moreover, T is compact iff |T |α = 0.

2.2. Finite dimensional subspaces and the induced volume. In this part, we collect results
on the induced volume in Definition 1.1.
We begin this subsection by enumerating the most basic properties of the induced volume.
Second, we will approximate the norm on a given finite dimensional subspace by an inner product,
using John’s Theorem, obtaining access to the ‘exact’ identities and relations between volumes
and angles for inner product spaces. Translating what we do in the inner product setting back
into the normed vector space vocabulary, we will obtain estimates with errors depending only on
the dimension. Third, we will consider the measurability properties of the maximal q-dimensional
growths Vq defined in (1.2). Fourth, we will relate Vq with the measure of noncompactness | · |α .
2.2.1. Basic Properties of the Induced Volume and Determinants. Recall from Section 1 that the
induced volume mE for a q-dimensional subspace E ⊂ B is the Haar measure on E normalized so
that mE {v ∈ E : |v| ≤ 1} = ωq , the mass of the unit ball in Rq . We now give the most basic
properties of mE .
Lemma 2.10. Let q ∈ N and let E ⊂ B be a q-dimensional subspace. The induced volume mE
satisfies the following.
(1) For any v ∈ E and any Borel B ⊂ E, we have mE (v + B) = mE (B).
(2) If m′ is any other non-zero, translation-invariant measure on E, then m′ , mE are equivalent
m′ (B)
dm′
, where
is constant on E, and equals m
measures. The Radon-Nikodym derivative dm
E
E (B)
B ⊂ E is any Borel set with positive mE -measure.
q
(3) For any a > 0 and any Borel measurable set B ⊂ E, we have mE (aB)
Pq = a mE (B).
(4) Let w1 , · · · , wq is any set of vectors in E, and write P [v1 , · · · , vq ] = { i=1 λi vi : 0 ≤ λi ≤ 1}
for the parallelepiped spanned by {v1 , · · · , vq }. Then, for any a > 0,
mE P [aw1 , w2 , · · · , wq ] = a · mE P [w1 , · · · , wq ].

Proof. These all follow from the uniqueness of Haar measure [8], except for Item 4, which has a
simple proof following from Proposition 2.14.

Remark 2.11. The normalization in Definition 1.1 for the induced volume was introduced by
Busemann [5] as a way of assigning volume elements to Finsler manifolds, where the tangent spaces
are normed vector spaces, not inner product spaces. For more on this, see Chapter I, §8 of [23].
Recall now the definition of the determinant.

Definition 2.12. Let A ∈ L(B, B ′ ) be a map of Banach spaces, and let E ⊂ B be a finite dimensional subspace. We define the determinant det(A|E) of A on E by
(
mAE (ABE )
A|E injective,
mE (BE )
det(A|E) =
0
otherwise.
The following are some basic properties of this determinant.
Proposition 2.13 (Basic Properties of the Determinant). Let E, F, G be normed vector spaces of
the same finite dimension, and let A : E → F, B : F → G be linear maps.
(1) For any Borel set O ⊂ E with mE (O) > 0,
det(A|E) =

and so det(A|E) coincides with the Radon-Nikodym derivative
mF (AO) for Borel O ⊂ E.
(2) If A is not injective on E, then det(A|E) = 0.
(3) det(BA|E) = det(B|F ) · det(A|E).

2.2.2. Approximation by Inner Products. Every pair of norms on a finite dimensional vector space
is equivalent, and so given any finite dimensional subspace E ⊂ B, one can always compare the
norm on E with any choice of inner product (·, ·) on E. There is no control, however, on how bad
this approximation can be, and so we must take care to ensure our approximating inner product is
not too far off from the original norm. The approximation we use here comes from the following
version of John’s theorem.
Proposition 2.14. Let q ∈ N, and let E ⊂ B be a q-dimensional subspace. Then, there exists an
inner product (·, ·)E on E for which the following hold.
(1) The norm k · kE induced by (·, ·)E satisfies the inequality
1
√
(2.5)
√ |v| ≤ kvkE ≤ q|v|.
q
for all v ∈ E.
(2) The induced volume mE coincides with the Lebesgue volume on E arising from the inner
product (·, ·)E .
Proof. This is merely a re-telling of John’s theorem (Theorem 15 in Chapter 4 of [4]), which asserts
that given any convex body C ⊂ Rn which contains 0 in its interior and is symmetric about the
origin, there is a unique ellipsoid D containing C, having minimal volume among all ellipsoids
containing C; additionally, D satisfies the inclusion √1n D ⊂ C.
Noting that ellipsoids centered at 0 in Rn are in one-to-one correspondence with inner products
on Rn , we let (·, ·) refer to the inner product from John’s Theorem applied to the unit ball BE of
(E, | · |). We modify (·, ·) by a scalar to define the inner product (·, ·)E : the scalar is chosen so that
the Lebesgue volume of (·, ·)E and the induced volume mE coincide. By Item 2 of Lemma 2.10,
this is ensured by the condition mE {v ∈ E : kvkE ≤ 1} = ωq .
The bound in (2.5) follows from the fact that the norm k · k induced by the John’s theorem inner
√

product (·, ·) satisfies kvk ≤ |v| ≤ qkvk for all v ∈ E.
Notation. For the remainder of this subsection, q ∈ N is fixed, and if a, b > 0 are real numbers,
we will write a . b if there is a constant Cq depending only on q for which a ≤ Cq b, and similarly
for a & b. We write a ≈ b if a . b and a & b hold. For example, (2.5) in Proposition 2.14 can be
written as kvkE ≈ |v| for v ∈ E.
We now pursue the program of using (·, ·)E , k·kE to deduce approximate identities for the induced
volume mE . There are two applications we will cover in this section: the first is a way of estimating
‘block’ determinants, and the second involves estimating determinants in terms of special bases.
Application 1: Estimating ‘Block Determinants’.
Let V = E ⊕ F be a splitting of a finite dimensional subspace V ⊂ B, where dim V = q and
dim E = k = q − dim F for some k < q. For A ∈ L(B), our goal is to estimate det(A|V ) in terms
of the product det(A|E) · det(A|F ).
The point of departure for us is the explicit formula for the volume of a parallelepiped in an
inner product space: when v1 , · · · , vq ∈ V ,

because of this choice,
mV P [v1 , · · · , vq ] = mV P [vk+1 , · · · , vq ] ·

holds by formula (2.6) for mV P [vk+1 , · · · , vq ], where we abuse notation and let mV refer also to
the volume on F arising from the restriction of k · kV to F . On the other hand, kvkV ≈ |v| ≈ kvkF
by (2.5) for all v ∈ F , from which we deduce mV P [vk+1 , · · · , vq ] ≈ mF P [vk+1 , · · · , vq ] by Lemma
2.10, Items 2 and 3. Collecting this,
(2.7)

mV P [v1 , · · · , vq ] ≈ mF P [vk+1 , · · · , vq ] ·

d(vi , hvj : i < j ≤ qi).

Observe that d(vi , hvj : i < j ≤ qi) = sin θ(hvi i, hvj : i < j ≤ qi) = |πhvi i//hvj :j<i≤qi|−1 by Lemma
2.2, so we must estimate |πhvi i//hvj :j<i≤qi| from above and below. Note that πhvi i//hvj :j<i≤qi =
πhvi i//hvj :i<j≤ki ◦ πE//F and πhvi i//hvj :i<j≤ki = πhvi i//hvj :i<j≤qi |E , so it follows that
d(vi , hvj : i < j ≤ ki)−1 = |πhvi i//hvj :i<j≤ki| ≤ |πhvi i//hvj :j<i≤qi|

≤ |πE//F | · |πhvi i//hvj :i<j≤ki| = |πE//F | · d(vi , hvj : i < j ≤ ki)−1 .

An application of (2.6) to mE P [v1 , · · · , vk ] now implies

mE P [v1 , · · · , vk ] · mF P [vk+1 , · · · , vq ]

as long as the denominator of the central term in (2.8) is nonzero.
Having estimated in this way, one can now estimate the determinant det(A|V ) by considering
(2.8) applied to the parallelepipeds P [v1 , · · · , vq ] and P [Av1 , · · · , Avq ] = AP [v1 , · · · , vq ]. We collect
the results in the following lemma.
Lemma 2.15. Let A ∈ L(B) and V ⊂ B have dimension q. Let V = E ⊕ F be a splitting with
dim E = k < q, and assume that A|V is injective. Writing V ′ = AV, E ′ = AE, F ′ = AF , we have
the estimate
det(A|V )

.
. |πE//F |k .
|πE ′ //F ′ |k

Remark 2.16. Observe that Lemma 1.2 for a q-dimensional subspace E ⊂ B follows straightaway
from (2.6) applied to the norm k · kE , using (2.5) to compare | · | with k · kE .
Application 2: Estimating Determinants from Bases.
Let q ∈ N, A ∈ L(B), and let V ⊂ B be a q-dimensional subspace. We will give here an estimate
for det(A|V ) in terms of a special kind of basis for V . To begin, form a (·, ·)V -orthonormal set
v1 , · · · , vq of V and recall the Hadamard bound for the determinant:
(2.9)

det(A|V ) ≤

where V ′ = AV .
More refined information is realized using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): if {vi } is an
orthonormal SVD basis for A|V on (V, (·, ·)V ) (that is, a (·, ·)V -orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of
(A|V )∗ A|V , where the adjoint (A|V )∗ is taken with respect to (V, (·, ·)V ) and (V ′ , (·, ·)V ′ )), then
(2.10)

det(A|V ) =

i=1

and when A|V is injective, the set {wi } defined by wi = Avi /kAvi kV ′ forms a (·, ·)V ′ -orthonormal
set (as {wi } is a set of eigenvectors for (A|V )(A|V )∗ ).
All this motivates the following definition.
Definition 2.17. Let V ⊂ B be a subspace of dimension q. A basis of | · |-unit vectors v1 , · · · , vq
for V is called an almost orthonormal basis if it is (·, ·)V -orthogonal.

A VOLUME-BASED APPROACH TO THE MULTIPLICATIVE ERGODIC THEOREM ON BANACH SPACES 11

We now apply (2.5) to each of (2.9) and (2.10), obtaining the following.
Proposition 2.18. Let A ∈ L(B) and let V ⊂ B be a subspace with dim V = q.
(1) (Hadamard Bound) If v1 , · · · , vq is an almost orthonormal basis of V , then

Write V ′ = AV . If A : V → V ′ is invertible, then the basis wi = Avi /|Avi | for V ′ is almost
orthonormal.

The following is a simple corollary of Proposition 2.18, relating the minimal expansion of a linear
map on a finite dimensional subspace to volume growth on that subspace.
Corollary 2.19. Let A ∈ L(B) and E ⊂ B be a q-dimensional subspace. For any v ∈ E \ {0},

2.2.3. The Determinant and Measurability. We now give a lemma on the continuity properties of
the determinant and the maximal q-dimensional growth Vq , defined for A ∈ L(B) by
Vq (A) = sup{det(A|E) : dim E = q}.

Lemma 2.20. Let q ∈ N, and let E ⊂ B be q-dimensional subspace.
(1) If Tn → T in norm on L(B), then det(Tn |E) → det(T |E).
(2) If Tn → T in norm on L(B), then Vq (Tn ) → Vq (T ).
Proof. We begin by proving the following.

Claim 2.21. If An , A : V → V ′ are injective linear maps between q-dimensional normed vector
spaces V, V ′ , and An → A in operator norm, then det(An |V ) → det(A|V ).

Proof of Claim. For two injective maps A, B : V → V ′ , it is simple to show that

det(A|V )

Proof of Item 1. If det(T |E) = 0, let v ∈ E be a unit vector for which T v = 0. By Corollary
2.19,
det(Tn |E) ≤ Cq |Tn |E |q−1 |Tn v|,

where Cq > 0 depends on q alone. The right hand side goes to zero as n → ∞ when Tn |E → T |E
in norm, and so det(Tn |E) → 0. So, from here on we assume det(T |E) 6= 0.
To complete the proof of Item 1 in this case, one can compute using Item 1 of Lemma 2.6 that

(2.13)
dH (Tn E, T E) ≤ 2 |(T |E )−1 | ∨ |(Tn |E )−1 | · |Tn − T |.

By (2.12), for n large enough, |(Tn |E )−1 | ≤ 2|(T |E )−1 |, hence dH (Tn E, T E) → 0 as n → ∞.
It now follows by Proposition 2.7 that if F ⊂ B is a fixed topological complement to T E, then
Tn E is complemented to F for n sufficiently large. Since πTn E//F |T E ◦ πT E//F |Tn E = IdTn E , the
identity on Tn E, we may now decompose


det(πT E//F ◦ Tn |E)
det(Tn |E)
= det(πTn E//F |T E) ·
(2.14)
.
det(T |E)
det(T |E)

Note that the parenthetical term on the RHS of (2.14) goes to 1 as n → ∞ by Claim 2.21,
because T |E = πT E//F ◦ T |E , so that πT E//F ◦ Tn |E → T |E in norm in L(E, T E). So, we estimate
the remaining term on the RHS of (2.14); however, since Tn E → T E in the Hausdorff distance, it
follows by (2.4) that πF//Tn E |T E → 0 in norm as n → ∞. Because πTn E//F |T E = IdT E −πF//Tn E |T E ,
it follows by a simple argument involving Lemma 2.10 that det(πTn E//F |T E) → 1, as desired.

Proof of Item 2. If Vq (T ) = 0, then an argument similar to the beginning of the proof of Item
1 lets us conclude Vq (Tn ) → Vq (T ). Hereafter we assume that Vq (T ) > 0.
Note that
(2.15)

Vq (T ) ≤ lim inf Vq (Tn )
n→∞

follows immediately from Item 1: for any subspace E ⊂ B with dimension q, det(T |E) = limn→∞ det(Tn |E) ≤
lim inf n→∞ Vq (Tn ). So, it suffices to show lim supn→∞ Vq (Tn ) ≤ Vq (T ).
For each n, let En ⊂ B be a subspace of dimension q for which Vq (Tn ) ≤ (1 + n1 ) det(Tn |En ). We
take n large enough so that Vq (T ) ≤ 2Vq (Tn ), using (2.15). Now, by Corollary 2.19,


1
Vq (T ) ≤ 2Vq (Tn ) ≤ 2 1 +
det(Tn |En ) ≤ 4Cq |Tn |q−1 · |(Tn |En )−1 |−1 ,

where Cq > 0 depends on q alone, and so taking n large enough so that |Tn | ≤ 2|T |, we have
that |(Tn |En )−1 | ≤ D, where D is a constant independent of n. Applying (2.12), we also obtain
|(T |En )−1 | ≤ 2D for n sufficiently large.
Because we can bound |(Tn |En )−1 |, |(T |En )−1 | from above independently of n, we can apply (2.13)
to the subspace En in place of E, obtaining dH (Tn En , T En ) → 0 as n → ∞. For each n, let Fn be
√
a complement to En with |πT En //Fn | ≤ q (Lemma 2.3). So, by Proposition 2.7, we deduce that
for n sufficiently large, Tn En complements Fn . We now decompose

det(πT En //Fn ◦ Tn |En )
det(Tn |En )
= det(πTn En //Fn |T En ) ·
(2.16)

det(T |En )
det(T |En )
analogously to (2.14). The estimate (2.11) and the fact that |(Tn |En )−1 |, |(T |En )−1 | ≤ 2D imply that
the parenthetical term on the RHS of (2.16) goes to 1 as n → ∞. The fact that πFn //Tn En |T En → 0
in norm (following from (2.4) and that dH (Tn En , T En ) → 0) implies that the remaining RHS term
of (2.16) goes to 1, analogously to the proof of Item 1. Therefore, the LHS of (2.16) goes to 1 as
n → ∞, and we conclude that lim supn→∞ Vq (Tn ) ≤ Vq (T ), as desired.

A VOLUME-BASED APPROACH TO THE MULTIPLICATIVE ERGODIC THEOREM ON BANACH SPACES 13

2.2.4. Global Geometry and the Induced Volume. We will now discuss properties of the induced
volume which depend on the Banach space at large. We will give a relation between Vq and the
Gelfand numbers, and a relation to the measure of noncompactness | · |α .
The Gelfand Numbers and Maximal Volume Growth.
For an operator A on a Hilbert space, Vq (A) (defined by (1.2)) is equal to√the product of the
first q singular values of A, i.e., the product of the highest q eigenvalues of A∗ A (Proposition
1.4 in Chapter V of [26]). As a consequence, one can think of the q-th Lyapunov exponent (with
multiplicity) of a cocycle as the generic asymptotic growth rate of the q-th singular value of high
iterates of the cocycle [20, 21]. In this section, we will recover this identification for a suitable
generalization of ‘singular value’ to the Banach space setting, a fact to be put to use in Section 3.
The idea of ‘singular values’ has been generalized in several nonequivalent ways for Banach
spaces: for an account, see [19]. The definition we shall employ here is that of the Gelfand numbers
cq (·), q ∈ N, defined for A ∈ L(B) by
(2.17)

cq (A) = inf{|A|R | : R closed, codim R = q − 1},

with c1 (A) := |A| (Chapter 2, Section 4 of [19]). Notice that {cq (A)}q is a decreasing sequence, and
so we define c(A) := limm cm (A) = inf m cm (A). Observe that c(A) = inf{|A|R | : R closed, codim R <
∞}; this is a different kind of measure of noncompactness from | · |α (2.4.10 in [1]), and as we will
see in Lemma 2.23, is equivalent to | · |α .
We will now show that Vq (A) is approximated by the product of the first q Gelfand numbers
ci (A).
Lemma 2.22. Let q ∈ N. For any A ∈ L(B),
(2.18)

Vq (A) ≈ cq (A)Vq−1 (A).

where ≈ depends on q alone.
Proof. We prove ., & separately. Assume Vq−1 (A) > 0, since otherwise, A is a finite rank operator
of rank ≤ q − 2 and (2.18) is trivial.
To prove &, let V ⊂ B be a subspace of dimension q for which det(A|V ) ≥ 12 Vq (A), and let
R ⊂ B have codimension q − 1 such that |A|R | ≤ 2cq (A).
Note that dim R ∩ V ≥ 1 by the definition of codimension; fix w ∈ R ∩ V with |w| = 1. Let
V0 ⊂ V be a complement to hwi in V for which |πhwi//V | = 1 (by Lemma 2.3). We now estimate
using the ‘block determinant’ estimate in Lemma 2.15:
Vq (A) ≤ 2 det(A|V ) . det(A|V0 ) det(A|hwi) ≤ Vq−1 (A)|Aw| ≤ 2Vq−1 (A)cq (A),
which is what we wanted.
To prove ., let E ⊂ B be a subspace of dimension q − 1 for which det(A|E) ≥ 21 Vq−1 (A). Now,
AE has dimension q − 1 (from Vq−1 (A) > 0),√so by Lemma 2.3, we can find a (q − 1)-codimensional
complement F2 ⊂ B for which |πAE//F2 | ≤ q − 1. By Lemma 2.4, F1 := {v ∈ B : Av ∈ F2 } has
codimension q − 1.
Let w ∈ F1 , |w| = 1. Using the lower bound in Lemma 2.15, we estimate

1
Vq−1 (A)|Aw|
2
This inequality holds for any w ∈ F1 , |w| = 1, and so implies an upper bound on |A|F1 |, which is
≥ cq (A) by definition. This completes the estimate.

Measures of Noncompactness and Maximal Volume Growth.
Like singular values of operators in Hilbert space, the Gelfand numbers can detect compactness

Proof. For x ∈ B and r > 0, we denote B(x, r) = {v ∈ B : |v − x| < r}.
If A is an operator of finite rank, then (2.19) holds vacuously, and so we can assume without loss
that Vq (A) > 0 for all q ∈ N.

As one can easily check, for Hilbert spaces we have that mEq′ Eq′ ∩ B(xi , r) ≤ r q ωq , with equality
when xi ∈ Eq′ . For Banach spaces, the following can be recovered.
Claim 2.25. Let E ⊂ B be a q-dimensional subspace with dim E = q < ∞. For any x ∈ B, we
have that mE E ∩ B(x, r) ≤ (2r)q ωq .
From Claim 2.25, we obtain


mEq′ Eq′ ∩ AB(0, 1) ≤ Cr (2r)q ωq ,

hence Vq (A) ≤ 2 det(A|Eq ) ≤ 2Cr (2r)q . This implies (2.19).



Proof of Claim 2.25. Let F be a topological complement to E in B (Lemma 2.3), and decompose
x = e + f . If f = 0, then x ∈ E and Claim 2.25 is obvious: so, we may assume f 6= 0. Moreover,
without loss, we can take e = 0 by the the translation invariance of mE on E.
Applying the Riesz Lemma (Lemma 4.7 of §4.1 in [24]) to E ⊂ E ⊕ hf i, there exists a unit vector
g ∈ E ⊕ hf i for which d(g, E) = 1; equivalently, |πhgi//E | = 1 (Lemma 2.2).
Writing f = e0 + ag, with a ∈ R, e0 ∈ E, we will show that B(f, r) ∩ E ⊂ B(e0 , 2r), which
implies Claim 2.25. To see this, we estimate: if v ∈ B(f, r) ∩ E, then |v − f | < r, and so
|v − e0 | = |πE//hgi (v − (e0 + ag))| ≤ |πE//hgi | · |v − f | < 2r,
which is what we wanted.

3. Lyapunov Exponents for Banach Space Cocycles
In this section, we prove our main result, Theorem 1.3, by emulating Ruelle’s proof in [21, 22].
We will begin by using the measurability assumption (1.3) and Lemma 2.20 to obtain the Lyapunov
exponents and show they may accumulate only at the asymptotic exponential growth rate lα of
|Txn |α . Then, we will state our primary tool, Proposition 3.4, which should be thought of as a
‘trajectory-wise’ version of the MET which extracts the ‘slow’ growing subspace corresponding
to the second Lyapunov exponent, and show using an induction procedure (Lemma 3.6) how to
complete the proof. Remaining at that point will be to prove Proposition 3.4 and Lemma 3.6, and
to prove the volume growth (1.5) in Theorem 1.3, which we formulate as Lemma 3.9.

A VOLUME-BASED APPROACH TO THE MULTIPLICATIVE ERGODIC THEOREM ON BANACH SPACES 15

3.1. Lyapunov Exponents for T . In this section, we find the Lyapunov exponents for the cocycle
T using growth rates, and prove their basic properties. To begin, the following is an immediate
consequence of Item 2 in Lemma 2.20.
Corollary 3.1. Assume that the cocycle T : X → L(B) satisfies the measurability hypothesis (1.3).
Then, for any n, q ≥ 1, the map x 7→ Vq (Txn ) is measurable as a map (X, F) → (R, Bor(R)).
We note as well that the map x 7→ |Txn |α is measurable for n ≥ 1 (note |A|α ≤ |A| for A ∈ L(B)).
The following identifies the Lyapunov exponents of the cocycle T in terms of volume growth.
Lemma 3.2. Let T : X → L(B) be a map satisfying (1.3). Assume as well that
Z
(3.1)
log+ |Tx | dµ(x) < ∞.
X

Then, the following hold.
(1) For any q ≥ 1, the exponential growth rates lq , defined by

1
log Vq (Txn ),
n→∞ n
exist and are constant µ-almost surely.
(2) Writing K1 = l1 , Kq = lq − lq−1 for q > 1, the sequence {Kq }q≥1 is nonincreasing, i.e.,
K1 ≥ K2 ≥ · · · .
(3) Defining lα = limq→∞ Kq , we have that µ-almost surely,
lq = lim

(3.2)

1
log |Txn |α = lα
n→∞ n
lim

Remark 3.3. We write λ1 > λ2 > · · · for the distinct values of the sequence {Kq }q . There may
be finitely many of these, in which case the last of these values is equal to lα , or infinitely many,
in which case λi → lα as i → ∞. We write mi for the multiplicity of the value λi amongst the
sequence {Kq }q and M1 := 0, Mi := m1 + · · · + mi−1 for i ≥ 2.
Proof. Item 1. The almost sure convergence of n1 log Vq (Txn ) follows immediately from the Kingman
Subadditive Ergodic Theorem (KSET) (§1.5 of [15]), in light of the integrability hypothesis (3.1)
and the measurability of x 7→ Vq (Txn ) (Corollary 3.1), since

Item 2. From Lemma 2.22, one has that

3.2. Proof of Theorem 1.3. For the remainder of this section, we give the volume-based proof

3.2.1. A ‘trajectory-wise’ version of the MET. Below, we state a version of the MET, to be applied
one trajectory at a time: this the analogue of Proposition 2.1 in Section 2 of Ruelle’s paper [22].
We refer to the norms on the spaces Vi below with the same symbol | · |.
Proposition 3.4. Let V0 , V1 , V2 , · · · be Banach spaces and let Ti : Vi → Vi+1 be a sequence of
bounded linear maps. Write T n = Tn−1 ◦ · · · ◦ T0 , and assume the following of {Tn }.
(1) limn→∞ n1 log+ |Tn | = 0.
(2) For any q ∈ N, the following limits exist:

(3) Writing k1 = L1 , kq = Lq − Lq−1 for q > 1, we have that for some m < ∞, λ := k1 = · · · =

Then, the subspace F := {v ∈ V0 : lim supn→∞ n1 log |T n v| ≤ λ} is closed and m-codimensional.

We now show how to derive all of Theorem 1.3 from Proposition 3.4, except for (1.5). Below, we
assume that there are infinitely many distinct Lyapunov exponents- the proof for when there are
finitely many distinct exponents is virtually identical.
Proof of Theorem 1.3 from Proposition 3.4. We define Γ ⊂ X to be the set of all x ∈ X such that
the limit limn→∞ n1 log Vq (Txn ) exists and equals lq , and for which

For each x ∈ Γ, the sequence Tn := Tf n x satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition 3.4, and so we
obtain the following, which can be thought of as the MET for the first Lyapunov exponent. Below,
with Fλ (x) as in (1.4), we define Fi (x) := Fλi (x) for Lyapunov exponents λi as in Remark 3.3.

Lemma 3.5. Let T : X → L(B) satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma 3.2, and let λ1 , λ2 , m1 be as in

We now formulate an induction step, to show that the hypotheses of Proposition 3.4 are satisfied

We will prove this in Section 3.2.3. One now has that the sequence of operators defined by T0 :=
Tx |F2 (x) , Tn := Tf n x , n > 0, satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition 3.4 with λ = λ2 , λ = λ3 , m = m2 ,
and the subspace F ⊂ F2 (x) as in the statement of Proposition 3.4 is F3 (x). We obtain that the
codimension of F3 (x) in F2 (x) is m2 , and so codim F3 (x) = M3 = m1 + m2 , and

log |Txn v| = λ2 .

Inductively, assume that we have already shown that Fi (x) has codimension Mi , and that for

Under this condition, one can show, repeating the argument in the proof of Lemma 3.6, that
for any x ∈ Γ, the limit limn→∞ n1 log Vq (Txn |Fi (x) ) exists for any q ≥ 1 and equals lq+Mi − lMi .
Therefore, T0 := Tx |Fi (x) , Tn := Tf n x , n > 0 satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition 3.4 with λ =
λi , λ = λi+1 , m = mi , and F = Fi+1 (x). We obtain that the codimension of Fi+1 (x) in Fi (x) is mi ,
hence codim Fi+1 (x) = Mi+1 , and that
∀v ∈ Fi (x) \ Fi+1 (x), lim

This completes the induction argument.

We now give the proofs of Proposition 3.4 and Lemma 3.6, and the proof of the volume growth
formula in (1.5), formulated as Lemma 3.9.
3.2.2. Proof of Proposition 3.4.
Proof of Proposition 3.4. For each n, let En1 be an m-dimensional subspace of V0 for which
det(T n |En1 ) ≥ 12 Vm (T n ), and define En2 = T n En1 . Let Fn2 be a complement to En2 , as in Lemma 2.3,
√
for which Pn2 := πEn2 //Fn2 satisfies |Pn2 | ≤ m. Let Fn1 = {v ∈ V0 : T n v ∈ Fn2 }; this is a complement
to En1 by Lemma 2.4. We write Pn1 = πEn1 //Fn1 .

18

To carry out our argument, we need to show that T n expands vectors on En1 by a factor of
approximately enλ , that |Pn1 | does not grow too quickly in n, and that |T n |Fn1 | is bounded from
above by approximately enλ on Fn1 .
Growth on En1 . Let v ∈ En1 , |v| = 1. Then, by Corollary 2.19, there is a constant Cm depending

From Claim 3.7, it follows that {Fn1 }n ⊂ G m (V0 ) is Cauchy in dH . G m (V0 ) is closed and
(G(V0 ), dH ) is complete (Proposition 2.5), and so {Fn1 } has a limit F ∈ G m (V0 ). We now show
that F = F , hence F is m-codimensional, by showing that vectors in F have an asymptotic exponential growth rate at most λ, hence F ⊂ F , and that vectors in V0 \ F have the exponential
asymptotic growth rate λ, hence F ⊂ F .

Showing lim supn→∞ n1 log |T n |F | ≤ λ. Let v ∈ F be a unit vector, and for each n, let vn ∈ Fn1 be
a unit vector for which |v − vn | ≤ 2dH (Fn1 , F ). Then,
|T n v| ≤ |T n (v − vn )| + |T n vn | ≤ 2|T n | · dH (Fn1 , F ) + |T n |Fn1 |.

Showing that for any v ∈ V0 \ F , limn→∞ n1 log |T n v| = λ. Fix v ∈ V0 \ F . Without loss, assume
|v| = 1, and let η = d(v, F ); since F is closed, η > 0. Let n be large enough so that d(v, Fn1 ) ≥ η/2,
and observe that with vn = Pn1 v, we have |vn | ≥ d(v, Fn1 ) ≥ η/2. Therefore,

By (3.7), (3.8) and (3.9), the growth rate of the RHS of (3.13) is at least λ, and so the growth
rate of |T n v| is at least λ.
For η ∈ (0, 1), that the growth on the cone Cη = {v ∈ V0 : d(v, F ) ≥ η|v|} is uniform, as in (3.3),
is already apparent in the above proof.
Let E ⊂ V0 be a complement to F : we now check (3.4). Note that by Lemma 2.2, for any
η ∈ (0, |πE//F |−1 ), we have E ⊂ Cη , and so by (3.3), it follows that limn→∞ n1 log |(T n |E )−1 | = −λ.
Now, by Proposition 2.18, |(T n |E )−1 |−m . det(T n |E) . |T n |m : this yields (3.4).

Lemma 3.5 implies that limn→∞ n1 log |(Txn |E )−1 |−1 = λ1 , since E ⊂ Cη (x) for any η ∈ (0, |πE//F |)
(Lemma 2.2). Therefore, the numerator and denominator on the RHS of (3.15) both grow at the
exponential rate λ, which implies (3.14).

Proof of Lemma 3.6. We will assume that lm1 +q > −∞. The proof is similar otherwise, and we
omit it.
Let q ∈ N. We will show separately that lim supn→∞ n1 log Vq (Txn |F2 (x) ) ≤ lm1 +q − lm1 and that
lim inf n→∞ n1 log Vq (Txn |F2 (x) ) ≥ lm1 +q − lq .

Lower bound on lim inf n→∞ n1 log Vq (Txn |F2 (x) ). For each n, let Hn ⊂ B be an (m1 +q)-dimensional

Gn ⊂ Hn ∩ F2 (x) be any q-dimensional subspace. Let Jn be a complement to Gn inside Hn of

Using Lemma 2.15, we now estimate:

because Vq (Txn |F2 (x) ) > 0 for any n, which follows from (3.16) and the assumption lm1 +q > −∞.
Let E ⊂ B be any topological complement to F2 (x), so that dim(E ⊕ Gn ) = m1 + q for any n.

Proof. The ideas for the proof are already present in the case when E is a complement to F3 (x)
(that is, i = 2), and so we concentrate on that case.
The first step is to find a splitting of E of the form E = E1 ⊕ E2 , where E1 is a complement
to F2 (x) in B and E2 ⊂ F2 (x). We set E2 := F2 (x) ∩ E, and let E1 be a complement to E2
in E; it is not hard to check that because F2 (x) ⊃ F3 (x) and B = E ⊕ F3 (x), one has that
dim E2 = dim E − codim F2 (x) = m1 , so that B = E1 ⊕ F2 (x) and F2 (x) = E2 ⊕ F3 (x) hold.
By (3.4) in Proposition 3.4, we know that for j = 1, 2,

We will now use the ‘block determinant’ estimate of Lemma 2.15, after first checking that
|πTxn E1 //Txn E2 | does not grow too quickly. But Tx F2 (x) ⊂ F2 (f x) holds for any x ∈ Γ, and so
πTxn E1 //Txn E2 = πTxn E1 //F2 (f n x) |Txn E . From there, it follows that limn→∞ n1 log |πTxn E1 //Txn E2 | = 0 by
(3.14) in Lemma 3.8. Now, by Lemma 2.15,

Appendix A: Proof of Proposition 2.7
Here we record a proof of Proposition 2.7.
Proposition 2.7. Let B = E ⊕ F be a topological splitting. For any E ′ ∈ G(B) for which
dH (E, E ′ ) < |πE//F |−1 , we have that B = E ′ ⊕ F is a topological splitting. The projection πE ′ //F
satisfies
(3.18)

|πF//E ′ |E | ≤

2d(E, E ′ )
.
|πE//F |−1 − d(E, E ′ )

Proof. For simplicity we will write d(·, ·) instead of dH (·, ·). To prove that E ′ complements F , we
shall show all of the following:
(1) E ′ ∩ F = {0} when d(E, E ′ ) < |πE//F |−1 .
(2) The (possibly proper) subspace E ′ ⊕ F is closed when d(E, E ′ ) < |πE//F |−1 .
(3) If the subspace E ′ + F is closed and d(E, E ′ ) < 1, then E ′ + F = B.
Item 1. Suppose E ′ ∩ F 6= {0}. Then for any e′ ∈ E ′ ∩ F with |e′ | = 1, there exists e ∈ E with
|e| = 1 such that |e − e′ | < |πE//F |−1 , hence
1 = |e| = |πE//F e| = |πE//F (e − e′ )| ≤ |πE//F | · |e − e′ | < 1,

which is a contradiction.
Item 2. It will suffice to show that there exists a > 0 such that for any e′ ∈ E ′ , f ∈ F , we have
(3.19)

|e′ | ≤ a|e′ + f |.

This is known as the Kober criterion [14]; for a more modern reference, see Chapter VII, §3,
Paragraph (4) of [7]. Indeed, if (3.19) holds and xn = e′n + fn is a Cauchy sequence, then e′n and
fn are Cauchy, and thus converge to some e′ ∈ E ′ , f ∈ F respectively, by the closedness of each of
E ′ , F , hence with x := e′ + f ∈ E ′ + F , we have xn → x.
We prove (3.19) directly: Let e′ ∈ E ′ and f ∈ F . Fix α > 1 for which αd(E, E ′ ) < |πE//F |, and
let e ∈ E, |e| = |e′ | be such that |e − e′ | ≤ |e′ | · αd(E, E ′ ), so that
|e′ + f | ≥ |e + f | − |e − e′ | ≥ |e′ |(|πE//F |−1 − αd(E, E ′ )) =: a−1 |e′ | > 0.

Item 3. Seeking a contradiction, assume that E ′ ⊕ F is a proper subspace of B. Fix α < 1 < β
such that βd(E, E ′ ) < α (which we can do, since d(E, E ′ ) < 1). Since E ′ ⊕ F is closed (by Item

2), the Riesz lemma (Lemma 4.7 of §4.1 in [24]) asserts that there exists x ∈ B with |x| = 1 such
that |x − (e′ + f )| ≥ α for all e′ ∈ E ′ , f ∈ F . On the other hand, since B = E ⊕ F , we have that
x = e + f for some e ∈ E, f ∈ F . Let e′ ∈ E ′ be such that |e − e′ | ≤ βd(E, E ′ ). Then
|x − (e′ + f )| = |e − e′ | ≤ βd(E, E ′ ) < α,

which is a contradiction.
We now prove (3.18). First, one can show directly from the Definition 2.1 of the minimal angle
θ that sin θ(E ′ , F ) ≥ sin θ(E, F ) − d(E, E ′ ), whence

Appendix B: Measurability of slow-growing subspaces
In this appendix, we formulate and prove a measurability result (Lemma 3.11 below) for slowgrowing Oseledets subspaces. We note that a potential source of complication is that the Banach
space B may not be separable.
The following notion of measurability is suitable for our purposes.

Definition 3.10. Let (Y, H) be a measurable space and let Z be a metric space. We say that
a mapping Φ : Y → Z is measurable if Φ is the pointwise limit of a sequence of finite-valued
measurable maps Φn : Y → Z.

The limit of a pointwise-convergent sequence of uniformly measurable mappings is itself uniformly
measurable (see Chapter III, §0 of [6]).

In what follows, (X, F, µ) is an ergodic mpt and T : X → L(B) is a linear cocycle obeying
the hypotheses of Theorem 1.3; we write {λi } for the Lyapunov exponents of T . We consider the
measurable space (Γ, F|Γ ), where Γ ⊂ X is defined in the proof of Theorem 1.3 and F|Γ denotes
the restriction of the sigma algebra F to Γ.
We let C denote the set of closed, bounded subsets of B, which we regard as a metric space with
the Hausdorff metric dH as defined in Section 2.1.2. We write B1 = {v ∈ B : |v| ≤ 1} for the unit
ball of B.
Lemma 3.11. The mapping x 7→ B1 ∩ Fλi (x) is measurable as a map (Γ, F|Γ ) → C .

Proof. We present the proof in the case i = 2; the general case is a straightforward adaptation of
the same ideas, and is left to the reader.
We use the following notation: for A ∈ L(B) and c > 0, we define
Sc (A) := {v ∈ B1 : |Av| ≤ c} .

It is easy to show that for B ∈ L(B), we have dH (Sc (A), Sc (B)) ≤ c−1 |A − B|; in particular, if
An → A is a convergent sequence of bounded operators in the uniform norm, then Sc (An ) → Sc (A)
in dH . In light of (1.3) it follows that x 7→ Sc (Txn ) is measurable in the sense of Definition 3.10 for
any n ≥ 1, c > 0.
To complete the proof, it suffices to show the following.
Lemma 3.12. Let x ∈ Γ, δ ≪ λ1 − λ2 . Then,

(3.21)

B1 ∩ Fλ2 (x) = dH - lim Sen(λ2 +δ) (Txn ) .
n→∞

Here, dH - lim denotes a limit in the Hausdorff topology on C .

A VOLUME-BASED APPROACH TO THE MULTIPLICATIVE ERGODIC THEOREM ON BANACH SPACES 23

Because the pointwise limit of measurable mappings is measurable, (3.21) implies that x 7→ B1 ∩
Fλ2 (x) is measurable. It remains to prove Lemma 3.12.

Proof of Lemma 3.12. Let E ⊂ B be a complement to Fλ2 (x) for which |πFλ (x)//E | ≤ m1 + 2

(where codim Fλ2 (x) = m1 ; see Remark 3.3). By Proposition 3.4, we have the following for n
sufficiently large:
|Txn |Fλ2 (x) | ≤ en(λ2 +δ) , and

We now prove (3.21). First, note that by (3.22), for n sufficiently large we have that B1 ∩ Fλ2 (x) ⊂
Sen(λ2 +δ) (Txn ). Trivially, then, we have that

w ∈ Sen(λ2 +δ) (T x) and write w = e + f, e ∈ E, f ∈ Fλ2 (x). Note that |f | ≤ ( m1 + 2), and so

en(λ1 −δ) |e| ≤ |Txn e| ≤ |Txn w| + |Txn f | ≤ en(λ2 +δ) + ( m1 + 2)en(λ2 +δ) = (3 + m1 )en(λ2 +δ) ;
it follows that |e| ≤ ǫ, and so in fact we have the bound |f | ≤ |w| + |e| ≤ 1 + ǫ. Thus,
d(w, B1 ∩ Fλ2 (x)) ≤ |w −

d(w, B1 ∩ Fλ2 (x)) ≤ 2ǫ .

Taking ǫ → 0 completes the proof.
