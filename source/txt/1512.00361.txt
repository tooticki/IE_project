Abstract
The intersection graph of a group G is an undirected graph without
loops and multiple edges deﬁned as follows: the vertex set is the set of
all proper non-trivial subgroups of G, and there is an edge between two
distinct vertices H and K if and only if H ∩ K 6= 1 where 1 denotes the
trivial subgroup of G. In this paper, we classify ﬁnite solvable groups whose
intersection graphs are not 2-connected and ﬁnite nilpotent groups whose
intersection graphs are not 3-connected. Our methods are elementary.

Introduction
Let G be a group. We deﬁne the intersection graph Γ(G) of G as the simple graph
with vertex set the proper non-trivial subgroups of G and there is an edge between
two distinct vertices if and only if their intersection is non-trivial. It is not diﬃcult to
determine ﬁnite non-simple groups having a disconnected intersection graph:
Theorem A. Let G be a finite non-simple group. Then Γ(G) is not connected if and
only if for some prime numbers p and q one of the following holds.
1. G ∼
= Zp × Zp , or G ∼
= Zp × Zq .
2. G ∼
= N ⋊ A where N ∼
= Zp × · · · × Zp , A ∼
= Zq , NG (A) = A, and N is a minimal
normal subgroup of G.
In [8], Shen proved this result and also showed that intersection graphs of (nonabelian) simple groups are connected, thereby completed the classiﬁcation for all ﬁnite
groups. Here we shall give a diﬀerent proof for Theorem A which is due to I. M. Isaacs.
In an earlier work [9], Lucido classiﬁed ﬁnite groups whose poset of proper non-trivial

subgroups are connected. Obviously, Γ(G) is connected if and only if the poset of proper
non-trivial subgroups of G is connected.
The aim of the present paper is to give a more detailed account of the “connectivity”
of intersection graphs. For a connected graph Γ, a subset S of the vertex set V (Γ) is said
to be a separating set, if removal of the vertices in S yields more than one component.
We say Γ is k-connected if |V (Γ)| > k and there is no separating set of cardinality
< k. We deﬁne the connectivity κ(Γ) of Γ as the greatest value of k such that Γ is
k-connected. By convention, the connectivity of the complete graph Kn on n vertices is
n − 1. Hence, 1-connected graphs form the class of connected graphs with at least two
vertices. Clearly, Γ is not connected if and only if κ(Γ) = 0. By abuse of notation, we
denote the connectivity of the intersection graph of G by κ(G). For solvable groups we
proved the following theorem. We denote the Frattini subgroup of G, i.e. the intersection
of all maximal subgroups of G, by Φ(G).
Theorem B. Let G be a finite solvable group. Then κ(G) < 2 if and only if for some
prime numbers p and q one of the following holds.
1. |G| = pα with 0 ≤ α ≤ 2.
2. |G| = p3 and neither G ∼
= Q8 nor G ∼
= Zp × Zp × Zp .
3. |G| = p2 q with a Sylow p-subgroup P such that either
(a) P ∼
= Zp2 , or
(b) P ∼
= Zp × Zp , P ⊳ G, and there exists a non-normal subgroup of G of order
p.
4. G = P Q is a group of order pα q (α ≥ 3) with P being the normal Sylow p-subgroup
of G such that either
(a) P is elementary abelian, Q acts on P irreducibly, and the order of NG (Q)
is at most pq, or
(b) N := Φ(P ) is elementary abelian, Q acts on both N and P/N irreducibly,
and either NG (Q) = Q or NG (Q) = N Q ∼
= Zp × Zq .
In particular, any solvable group whose order is divisible by at least three distinct primes
is 2-connected.
Intuitively, intersection graphs should be highly connected graphs and if there are
some examples of such graphs with ‘low’ connectivity, they must be exceptional. By
Menger’s Theorem (see [3, Theorem 3.3.6]), a graph is k-connected if and only if it
contains k independent paths between any two vertices. Hence, if Γ(G) is 3-connected,
there must exist suﬃciently many vertices in the intersection graph forming at least
three independent paths between any pair of vertices. However, claiming the existence
of those subgroups and also verifying that they intersect non-trivially suﬃciently many
times seems to be a fairly complicated problem for the class of solvable groups. For
nilpotent groups we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem C. Let G be a finite nilpotent group. Then κ(G) < 3 if and only if for some
prime numbers p, q, and r one of the following holds.
1. |G| = pα (0 ≤ α ≤ 3) and neither G ∼
= Q8 nor G ∼
= Zp × Zp × Zp .
2. G is a group of order p4 such that

2

(a) G ∼
= Zp4 , or
(b) Φ(G) ∼
= Zp2 except G ∼
= Q16 , or
(c) Φ(G) ∼
= Zp × Zp and Z(G) < Φ(G) except
i. G ∼
= ha, b, c | a9 = b3 = 1, ab = ba, a3 = c3 , bcb−1 = c4 , aca−1 = cb−1 i,
and
2
ii. G ∼
= ha, b, c | ap = bp = cp = 1, bc = cb, bab−1 = ap+1 , cac−1 = abi for
p > 3.
3. G ∼
= Zp3 q , G ∼
= Zp2 q , G ∼
= (Zp × Zp ) × Zq , or G ∼
= Zpqr .
Moreover, any solvable group whose order is divisible by at least four distinct primes is
3-connected.
Let Γ be a simple graph with vertex set V (Γ). A sequence γ = (v0 , v1 , . . . , vk ) of
vertices is a path of length k between v0 and vk , if each consecutive pair of vertices
are adjacent in Γ. We call two or more paths with the same end points internally
independent provided that none of them have a common inner vertex with another. For
brevity, we usually omit ‘internally’ and say simply ‘independent paths’. We shall note
that occasionally we attribute the graph theoretical properties of intersection graphs
directly to the group itself. For example, instead of “Γ(G) is k-connected” we may
simply say “G is k-connected”.

Preliminaries
Let V (G) be the set of proper non-trivial subgroups of G. This vertex set V (G) (of
Γ(G)) naturally carries a poset structure under set inclusion and its minimal elements
are the minimal subgroups of G. A subset S of V (G) is upward closed if whenever H ∈ S
and H ≤ K, then also K ∈ S.
Proposition 1. For a finite group G with |V (G)| > k the following statements are
equivalent:
(i) Γ(G) is k-connected.
(ii) There is no upward closed separating set S of Γ(G) with |S| < k.
(iii) There are at least k independent paths in Γ(G) between any pair of minimal subgroups.
Proof. (i) ⇐⇒ (ii): By deﬁnition a graph is k-connected if and only if there is no
separating set of cardinality < k. Thus, all we need to do is to show that any minimal
separating set for Γ(G) is upward closed (except, if Γ(G) is a complete graph). Take a
vertex S ∈ S where S is a minimal separating set. By the minimality of S, for any two
vertices H, K ∈ V (G) \ S there is a path γ = (H, . . . , K) traversing only the points in
(V (G)\S)∪ {S}. Suppose that H and K belong to diﬀerent components (obtained after
removing all the vertices in S). So γ necessarily visits S, i.e. γ = (H, . . . , S, . . . , K).
If S ∈ V (G) and S < S, then γ̄ = (H, . . . , S, . . . , K) is also a path from H to K and
therefore S ∈ S. Since S was chosen arbitrarily, S is upward closed.
(i) ⇐⇒ (iii): Menger’s Theorem states that a graph is k-connected if and only if
it contains k independent paths between any two vertices. Therefore, it is enough to
show that existence of k independent paths between any pair of minimal subgroups
implies the existence of k independent paths between any pair of subgroups in V (G). If

3

there exists a unique minimal subgroup of G, then Γ(G) is a complete graph on more
than k vertices, thus it is k-connected. Suppose that there are more than one minimal
subgroups of G. Let X, Y ∈ V (G) be two distinct vertices and A, B be two minimal
subgroups with γi = (A, Ai , . . . , Bi , B), 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are independent paths between them.
Suppose that neither X nor Y are minimal subgroups. There are two cases that may
occur:
Case I: X and Y contain a common minimal subgroup, say A. Then γ̄i := (X, Ai , Y )
are independent paths provided that no coincidence occurs. If X coincides with, say A1 ,
then replace γ̄1 with (X, Y ). If, in addition, Y coincides with, say A2 , then substitute
(X, . . . , B1 , B2 , . . . , Y ) for γ̄2 .
Case II: X and Y contain distinct minimal subgroups, say A and B respectively.
In this case, we may simply take γ̄i = (X, Ai , Bi , Y ) as independent paths between X
and Y . If X or Y coincides with some inner vertex, we may simply shorten the path
accordingly.
Finally, it is easy to see that above arguments can still be applied with minor changes
if one of X and Y is a minimal subgroup.
Obviously, if a graph is k-connected, then the degree (valency) of any vertex is at
least k. In view of Proposition 1 (iii) we make the following convention: For a ﬁnite
group G, we say
“G satisﬁes the k-valency condition”
provided that any minimal subgroup of G is strictly contained in at least k proper
subgroups.
A vertex v of a connected graph Γ is called a cut-vertex, if removing v from Γ renders
a disconnected graph, i.e. if {v} is a separating set for Γ. For the complete graph K2 , we
shall regard any of its two vertices as a cut-vertex. (This is not the standard convention.)
Hence, κ(Γ) = 1 if and only if there exists a cut-vertex of Γ.
Lemma 2. Let G be a finite abelian group. Then there exists a cut-vertex of Γ(G) if
and only if G is isomorphic to one of the following groups
Zp3 ,

Zp2 × Zp ,

Zp2 × Zq

for some prime numbers p and q.
Proof. Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group such that there is a cut-vertex M in Γ(G). By
Proposition 1 (ii), M can be taken as a maximal subgroup of G. Actually, M must
be a maximal subgroup unless Γ(G) is a complete graph. Suppose that Γ(G) ∼
= Kn .
Obviously it must be the complete graph on two vertices. In other words, G has a unique
maximal subgroup and a unique minimal subgroup. This is possible only if G ∼
= Zp2 for
some prime number p. (Observe that a ﬁnite group has a unique maximal subgroup if
and only if it is isomorphic to a cyclic group of prime power order.)
Next, suppose that Γ(G) is not complete. Clearly, there are more than one minimal
subgroups, i.e. G is not cyclic of prime power order. Let A be a minimal subgroup of M .
As any subgroup contains a minimal subgroup, any component of the graph obtained by
removing the vertex M and all the incident edges to M from Γ(G) contains at least one
minimal subgroup. Let B be a minimal subgroup which is not in the same component
with A. Since (A, AB, B) is a path between them, M = AB. Moreover, observe that for
either A or B, say A, the subgroup AB must be the unique proper subgroup containing
A strictly. Otherwise, there would be a path (A, X, Y, B) between A and B, where X

4

and Y are some maximal subgroups diﬀerent from AB that are containing A and B
respectively. It can be easily seen that M = AB is a cut-vertex of the abelian group G
if and only if G is isomorphic to either Zp2 × Zp , or Zp2 × Zq for some prime numbers p
and q.
In our context, it is important to know when two minimal subgroups generate a
preferably small proper subgroup. Accordingly, it is easier to describe the connectivity
of groups with many normal subgroups such as p-groups. On the other hand, it is known
that any simple group can be generated by two elements. Let us recapitulate some basic
group theoretical facts that are essential for our arguments.
The Frattini subgroup Φ(G) of a group G is the intersection of all maximal subgroups
of G. It is well-known that the quotient of a ﬁnite p-group by its Frattini subgroup
is elementary abelian. Moreover, Φ(G) is the minimal subgroup with this property.
Therefore, Φ(G) = 1 if and only if G is elementary abelian (see [4, Theorem 5.1.3]).
Notice that Φ(G) is a normal (even characteristic) subgroup of G.
The p-core Op (G) of a ﬁnite group G is the intersection of all Sylow p-subgroups of
G. Like Φ(G) it is a characteristic subgroup; actually, it is the unique largest normal
p-subgroup of G. In a ﬁnite solvable group G, the factors of every chief series are
elementary abelian of prime power order. In particular, every minimal normal subgroup
of G is elementary abelian (see [4, Theorem 2.4.2]). Hence, for a non-trivial solvable
group G, there exists a prime p  |G| such that Op (G) is non-trivial.
A ﬁnite group G is called supersolvable if it possesses a normal series in which
every factor group is cyclic of prime order. If a ﬁnite group is supersolvable, then
every maximal subgroup is of prime index (see [5, p. 85]); and therefore, any maximal
chain of subgroups have the same length. Let G be a group of order pα1 1 pα2 2 . . . pαk k
where pi (1 ≤ i ≤ k) are distinct prime numbers. We deﬁne the order length of G as
P
ℓ(G) := ki=1 αi . Clearly, for a supersolvable group G, the order length ℓ(G) is equal to
the length of a maximal chain. Supersolvable groups form a class between the class of
nilpotent groups and the class of solvable groups.
We close this section by presenting another structural result. Observe that the
intersection graph of the trivial group 1 as well as the intersection graph of Zp (p is
a prime) are empty graphs. However, we set |V (1)| = −1 and |V (Zp )| = 0 to make
the statement of the following Proposition easier. Moreover, we adopt the following
convention
κ(1) = −2,
κ(Zp ) = −1,
κ(Zp2 ) = κ(K1 ) = 0.
Notice that this is in conformity with the our previous convention that κ(Kn ) = n − 1.
Proposition 3. Let G be a finite group and N be a normal subgroup of G. If G/N is
k-connected, then G is (k + x − 1)-connected where x is the length of the series
1 < N1 < N2 < · · · < Nx = N
such that Ni ⊳ G for each 1 ≤ i ≤ x. In particular, κ(G/N ) ≤ κ(G).
Proof. Let G and N be as in the hypothesis of the Proposition. Let A and B be two
minimal subgroups of G. If κ(G/N ) = −2, then there is a normal series
1 < N1 < N2 < · · · < Nx = G,
and we may easily form x − 2 independent paths γi = (A, Ni A, Ni B, B), 1 ≤ i ≤ x − 2,
between A and B. (In case of a possible coincidence of the vertices we can safely shorten

5

the paths.) A similar argument shows that we may construct x − 1 independent paths
if κ(G/N ) = −1.
Next suppose that κ(G/N ) ≥ 0, i.e. |V (G/N )| ≥ 1. By the Correspondence Theorem there is a bijection between the subgroups of the quotient group G/N and the
subgroups of G that are containing N . Observe that N A and N B correspond to some
subgroups of G/N that are either trivial or minimal. Then, as G/N is k-connected by the
assumption, we may construct at least k additional independent paths γj = (A, . . . , B),
x ≤ j ≤ k + x − 1, such that the inner vertices represents some proper subgroups of G
containing N .
Corollary 4. Let G be a supersolvable group with ℓ := ℓ(G). Then κ(G) ≥ ℓ − 3. In
particular, all p-groups of order > pα are (α − 2)-connected.

Non-simple groups
Proof of Theorem A. Let G be a ﬁnite non-simple group and N be a minimal normal
subgroup of G. Suppose that Γ(G) is not connected. Let A be a subgroup of G which
does not lie in the component of N in Γ(G). Then N A = G, as otherwise, (N, N A, A)
would be a path between N and A. Also N ∩ A = 1, as otherwise, N and A would
be linked via the subgroup N ∩ A. Therefore |G : N | = |A|. Since this equality holds
for every subgroup that does not lie in the component containing N , it holds also for
any non-trivial subgroup of A. As a consequence |G : N | = |A| = q is a prime number.
Moreover, A is a maximal subgroup of G. To see this, suppose that there exists a proper
subgroup B containing A. Since B does not lie in the same component with N , we have
|B| = q, i.e. B coincides with A.
Let Q be a Sylow q-subgroup of G containing A. Since A is a maximal subgroup,
either G = Q or A = Q. In the ﬁrst case since N is a minimal normal subgroup and G
is a q-group, the order of N is q. As N and A are distinct subgroups of same order q
and as G = N A, we see that G ∼
= Zq × Zq . Clearly, Γ(Zq × Zq ) is not connected.
In the latter case since G is not a q-group and since G = N A, there must be a
prime p dividing |N | and diﬀerent from q. We want to show that N is a p-group.
Suppose contrarily that N is not a p-group. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of N and
T = NG (P ). (Notice that G 6= T , as N is a minimal
 normal subgroup.) By the Frattini
argument G = N T which, in turn, implies that q  |T |. Since A is a Sylow q-subgroup,
some conjugate of T contains A. However, this contradicts with the maximality of A.
Therefore, N is a p-subgroup. Further, N must be an elementary abelian subgroup since
it is a minimal normal subgroup.
Consider the normalizer NG (A). Since A is a maximal subgroup, there are two
possibilities. If A is a normal subgroup of G, then A centralizes N ; hence, |N | = p and
G∼
= Zp × Zq . Clearly, Γ(Zp × Zq ) is not connected. And if A is self-normalizing, G is a
group described as in the second part of Theorem A. To conclude the proof it is enough
to show that Γ(G) is not connected in such a case.
Let H be a proper non-trivial subgroup of G. We want to show that H is either a
subgroup of the unique (normal) Sylow p-subgroup N of G or it is a Sylow q-subgroup.
Obviously, Γ(G) is not connected if this is
 the case. Suppose contrarily, H is neither
a p-subgroup nor a q-subgroup. Then q  |H| as |G| = |N A| = pα q for some integer
α ≥ 1. Hence, H contains a conjugate of A and we may suppose that H contains A
by replacing H with some conjugate of it if necessary. Then N H = G and it follows
that N ∩ H ⊳ G. (Notice that N ∩ H is normalized by N as N is an abelian subgroup
and N ∩ H is normalized by H as N is a normal subgroup.) Since N is a minimal

6

normal subgroup, either N ∩ H = 1 or N ∩ H = N yielding either |H| = q or H = G.
However, this contradicts with the assumption that H is a proper subgroup which is
not a q-subgroup.
Notice that for a ﬁnite non-simple group G, the connectivity of G is 1 if and only if
G satisﬁes the 1-valency condition.

Solvable groups
Lemma 5. Let G be a finite solvable group. Then κ(G) ≥ 2 if and only if G satisfies
the 2-valency condition.
Proof. Suﬃciency is obvious. Let G be a ﬁnite solvable group satisfying the 2-valency
condition. We want to show that there exist at least two independent paths between any
pair of minimal subgroups A1 and A2 . If hA1 , A2 i is a second maximal subgroup, then
clearly there are two independent paths between them. Thus, for the rest we assume
hA1 , A2 i is either G or a maximal subgroup. Let M be a maximal subgroup of prime
index and N be a minimal normal subgroup. Notice that since G is solvable, there
exist a subgroup of prime index and minimal normal subgroups are elementary abelian.
Further, let A1 < H1 , K1 and A2 < H2 , K2 such that N A1 6= H1 and N A2 6= H2 .
Case I: Suppose that N is of prime index in G and take M = N .
Case I (a): A1 , A2 < M = N . Obviously (A1 , M, A2 ) is a path and hA1 , A2 i = M ∼
=
Zp ×Zp . And the order of G is either p3 or p2 q. By the product formula, (A1 , H1 , H2 , A2 )
is also a path and independent from the ﬁrst.
Case I (b): M and A1 are distinct p-groups. Then G is also a p-group and in turn
|G| = p2 since M must be a cyclic group of prime order. However, intersection graph of
a group of order p2 or pq consists of isolated vertices and G does not satisfy 2-valency
condition in that case.
Case I (c): M is an elementary abelian p-group of rank n ≥ 2 and A1 ∼
= Zq . In
particular |G| = pn q. Observe that A1 ⋪ G, as otherwise, G would be an abelian group
contradicting the fact that M is a minimal normal subgroup. Moreover, Op (H1 ) and
Op (K1 ) are trivial (again this is because M is a minimal normal subgroup) and this in
turn implies H1 , K1 E NG (A1 ) < G. (Notice that this implies n ≥ 3). Hence, we may
assume A1 < H1 < K1 = NG (A1 ). If A2 < M , then we have the two independent paths
(A1 , H1 , M, A2 ) and (A1 , K1 , T, A2 ) where T is a subgroup of order pn−1 containing A2 .
And if A2 is a conjugate of A1 , then (A1 , H1 , M, H2 , A2 ) and (A1 , K1 , T, K2 , A2 ) are two
independent paths between A1 and A2 where H2 < K2 .
Case II: Suppose that [G : N ] is not prime. Then N A1 6= G, N A2 6= G. If one of
N A1 and N A2 coincides with M , say N A1 , then we may take (A1 , H1 , N A2 , A2 ) and
(A1 , K1 , M, H2 , A2 ) as independent paths. If both N A1 and N A2 coincides with M , then
we may take (A1 , M, A2 ) and (A1 , H1 , N, H2 , A2 ). Finally, if N A1 6= M and N A2 6= M ,
then (A1 , N A1 , N A2 , A2 ) and (A1 , H1 , M, H2 , A2 ) are two independent paths between
A1 and A2 .
Lemma 6. Let G be a finite p-group. Then κ(G) < 2 if and only if
1. |G| = pα , 0 ≤ α ≤ 2,
2. |G| = p3 except G ∼
= Q8 or G ∼
= Zp × Zp × Zp
In particular, all p-groups of order > p3 are 2-connected.

7

Proof. By Lemma 5, all we need to do is to determine p-groups which do not satisfy the
2-valency condition. Clearly, intersection graph of a group of order pα , 0 ≤ α ≤ 2, is
either empty graph or consists of isolated vertices. Hence 2-valency condition does not
hold for those groups.
Suppose that |G| = p3 . If G has a unique maximal subgroup, then G ∼
= Zp3 and
Γ(G) ∼
K
.
So
it
is
not
2-connected
in
this
case.
If
G
has
more
than
one
maximal
= 2
subgroup and Φ := Φ(G) is non-trivial, then either G has a unique minimal subgroup
(which is Φ) or there are minimal subgroups diﬀerent from Φ. In the ﬁrst case, G ∼
= Q8
∼
and Γ(Q8 ) = K4 . That is, G is 3-connected. In the latter case, ΦA is a maximal subgroup
of G and it is the unique subgroup of order p2 containing A, as all the maximal subgroups
contain Φ. If Φ is trivial, then G is elementary abelian and by the Correspondence
Theorem any minimal (normal) subgroup is contained in p + 1 maximal subgroups.
Therefore, G is 2-connected in this case, as the 2-valency condition holds.
Suppose that |G| = pα , α > 3. Then any minimal subgroup of G is contained in
a subgroup of order p2 and by a subgroup of order p3 . Hence G satisﬁes the 2-valency
condition.
Lemma 7. Let G be a group of order p2 q with a Sylow p-subgroup P . Then κ(G) < 2
if and only if one of the following holds.
1. P ∼
= Zp2 .
2. P ∼
= Zp × Zp , P ⊳ G, and there exists a non-normal subgroup of G of order p.
Proof. Let G be a group of order p2 q with a Sylow p-subgroup P and a Sylow q-subgroup
Q. It is a well-known fact that a group of order p2 q must have a normal Sylow subgroup.
Thus, either P or Q is a normal subgroup of G.
Case I: P ∼
= Zp2 . If P ⊳ G, then G has a unique subgroup of order p. However, this
implies any q-subgroup is contained in one and only one subgroup (of order pq). Assume
that P ⋪ G. Then Q is a normal subgroup of G and there exists a normal subgroup
M∼
= Zq ⋊ Zp containing all subgroups of order p. Those two facts imply that M is the
unique subgroup containing Q.
Case II: P ∼
= Zp × Zp .
Case II (a): Q ⊳ G. Clearly, 2-valency condition holds in this case.
Case II (b): Q ⋪ G. As was remarked earlier the Sylow p-subgroup must be a normal
subgroup in this case. First, we shall observe that either there is no normal subgroup of
G of order p or there are more than
one. As Q ⋪ G, the index of NG (Q) is either p or

2


p and this implies q p − 1 or q p + 1. Consider the action of Q on the subgroups of P
by conjugation. Since the length of an orbit is either 1 or q, the number of ﬁxed points
(the number of normal subgroups of order p) may be congruent 0 or 2 modulo q. Next,
we determine the groups in which Q is contained in at most one subgroup. If Q acts
on P irreducibly (without ﬁxed points) and Q is contained in subgroup M of order pq,
then M ∼
= Zq ⋊ Zp and it normalizes Q. Moreover, it is the unique subgroup containing
Q as Q ⋪ G. If there are distinct normal subgroups U and V of order p, then clearly
U Q and V Q are distinct subgroups containing Q. Finally, we determine the groups in
which a (non-normal) subgroup T of order p is not contained in a subgroup of order pq.
As we have seen that groups in which Q acts on P irreducibly does not satisfy 2-valency
condition, we further assume that there exist two normal subgroups U and V of order
p. Suppose that T is contained in a subgroup M of order pq. Then as T ⋪ G, we have
M∼
= Zq ⋊ Zp . On the other hand, both U Q and V Q cannot be isomorphic to Zp × Zq , as
otherwise, Q < Z(G) implying G is abelian. That is, one of U Q and V Q is isomorphic

8

to Zp ⋊ Zq which is impossible. Therefore, T is not contained in any subgroup of order
pq.
As is seen by Lemma 7, many of the groups of order p2 q do not satisfy 2-valency
condition. Compare it with the following result.
Lemma 8. Let G be a group of order p2 q. Then G is 3-connected if and only if
G∼
= ha, b, c | ap = bp = cq = 1, ab = ba, cac−1 = aλ , cbc−1 = bλ i
where q  p − 1 and λ > 1 is any integer such that λq ≡ 1 (mod p).


Proof. Let G be a 3-connected group of order p2 q and let Q be a q-subgroup of G. Take
a minimal p-subgroup U of G and let P be a Sylow p-subgroup containing U .
Case I: Q ⊳ G. Clearly, QU is the unique subgroup of order pq containing U . Moreover, there exist at least two distinct Sylow p-subgroups containing U , as otherwise,
3-valency condition does not hold. This, in turn, implies that NG (U ) = G. Suppose
that Sylow p-subgroups are cyclic. Then, U is the unique subgroup of order p and QU is
the unique subgroup containing Q. Again 3-valency condition cannot be satisﬁed. Now,
suppose that Sylow p-subgroups are elementary abelian. Since U is a normal subgroup
of G and since this must be the case for any minimal p-subgroup, P is also a normal
subgroup of G which is a contradiction.
Case II: Q ⋪ G. Since G is a solvable group, the p-core Op (G) is a non-trivial normal
subgroup of G. Thus, we shall consider following two sub-cases.
Case II (a): P ⋪ G, U ⊳ G. Suppose that Sylow p-subgroups are cyclic. As in Case I,
P Q is the unique subgroup containing Q and this case can be discarded. Now, suppose
that Sylow p-subgroups are elementary abelian. However, by the proof of Lemma 7 we
know that no such group exists.
Case II (b): P ⊳ G. As in previous cases, P cannot be a cyclic subgroup. Thus
P ∼
= Zp × Zp . We claim that NG (Q) = Q. Assume contrarily that NG (Q) is a group
of order pq. Then NG (Q) is self-normalizing and by the product formula any two
distinct conjugates of it intersect at Q; however, Q is normal in both of them which
is a contradiction. Therefore, any subgroup of order pq must be isomorphic to Zp ⋊ Zq
and since G is 3-connected there must exist at least three such subgroups containing Q.
To write a presentation for G, let a, b, c be three elements generating G such that a, b are
of order p and c is of order q. Moreover, we may suppose that c normalizes hai, hbi, and
habk i where k ≥ 1 is an integer. (Notice that any subgroup of order p is generated by
some element abk for some integer k.) In other words, we have the relations cac−1 = aλ1 ,
cbc−1 = bλ2 , and cabk c−1 = (abk )t = at btk for some integers λ1 , λ2 , t. On the other hand,
cabk c−1 = aλ1 bλ2 k implying λ1 ≡ λ2 (mod p) and hence we may take λ := λ1 = λ2 . As
a consequence all p-subgroups are normal in G. Notice that λ = 1 implies Q ⊳ G, hence
q
λ > 1. Moreover, since a = cq ac−q = aλ , we have λq ≡ 1 (mod p). Conversely, it can
be veriﬁed that a group with this presentation is of order p2 q.
Let G a the group with the given presentation. To conclude the proof, we shall show
that G is 3-connected. We claim G satisﬁes 3-valency condition. From the previous
arguments, hci is contained in at least three subgroups of order pq and any element of
order q acts on P in the same way as c does. Moreover, all p-subgroups are normal and
there are clearly more than three proper subgroups containing any subgroup of order
p. Finally, since the maximal subgroups of G form a complete graph in Γ(G) by the
product formula, we deduce that G is 3-connected.

Proof of Theorem B. Let G be a ﬁnite solvable group which is not a p-group. (Finite
p-groups that are not 2-connected are presented in Lemma 6.) Since G is a solvable
group by assumption, there exists a maximal subgroup M of G of prime index. By
Lemma 5, it is enough to determine groups for which the 2-valency condition does not
hold. Suppose that G does not satisfy 2-valency condition. Let A be a minimal subgroup
of order q such that A is (strictly)
contained in at most one proper subgroup of G.

2

First, suppose that q
|G| and let Q be a Sylow q-subgroup containing A. Then
either M = Q and |G| = pq 2 where [G : M ] = p, or M 6= Q and [G : M ] = q as Q
is the unique subgroup containing A. The ﬁrst case was considered in Lemma 7. In
the latter case, if Q ⊳ G then |G| = pq 2 as Q is the only proper subgroup containing A;
hence, we again refer to Lemma 7. And if Q ⋪ G, then we may further assume that M
is a normal subgroup. (Notice that since Sylow q-subgroup Q is maximal, there must
be a normal subgroup of G of index q in that case.) Moreover, M must be a minimal
normal subgroup as Q is the unique proper subgroup containing A. Since G is solvable
M ∼
= Zp × · · · × Zp for some prime p diﬀerent from q. However, this is impossible as
q  |M |.
Next, suppose that A is a Sylow q-subgroup. If |G| = pq, clearly 2-valency condition
does not hold and the case |G| = p2 q was already considered in Lemma 7. Suppose
that p, r  |G| where p and r are distinct prime numbers diﬀerent from q. Since G is
solvable, there exist a Hall {p, q}-subgroup and a Hall {q, r}-subgroup containing A.
Hence, we may assume |G| = pα q, α ≥ 3. If A ⊳ G, then it is contained in more than one
proper subgroup. Thus A ⋪ G. Furthermore, P ⊳ G in this case, where P is the Sylow
p-subgroup of G. Suppose to the contrary that P ⋪ G. Since G is solvable, there exists
a normal subgroup M of index p. Hence, M contains all Sylow q-subgroups implying
[M : NM (A)] = [G : NG (A)]. On the other hand, since M is the unique proper subgroup
of G containing A, either NM (A) = A or NM (A) = M . In the ﬁrst case NG (A) would
be a subgroup of order pq contradicting the assumption that A is contained in at most
one subgroup. And in the latter case A would be a normal subgroup of G which is again
a contradiction. Therefore P ⊳ G. For the rest of the proof, we take Q := A. Let N be
a minimal normal subgroup of G. Since G is solvable N is elementary abelian. Now we
examine two cases:
Case I: P = N . Thus, P is elementary abelian. We claim that G does not satisfy
2-valency condition if and only if Q acts on P irreducibly (Q does not normalize any
proper non-trivial subgroup of P ) and the order of NG (Q) is at most pq. Suﬃciency is
obvious. For the necessity, it is obvious that if Q is a maximal subgroup of G, then Q is
self-normalizing and acts on P irreducibly. If Q is not maximal we argue as follows: Let
K be a minimal subgroup properly containing Q. Then either Q is a normal subgroup
of K (hence K ≤ NG (Q)) or Op (K) is a non-trivial normal subgroup of K. In the ﬁrst
case, clearly K = NG (Q) and |K| = pq. Moreover, as K is the unique proper subgroup
of G containing Q by assumption, the action of Q on P is irreducible. In the latter case,
since Op (K) is also a normal subgroup of G which is not trivial, P and Op (K) coincides
by the minimality of P implying K = G. The action of Q on P is irreducible in this
case also.
Case II: P 6= N .
Case II (a): P is elementary abelian. A Theorem of Gaschütz (see [7, Theorem
7.43]) states that an abelian normal p-subgroup has a complement in G if and only if it
has a complement in a Sylow p-subgroup. Clearly, N is complemented in the elementary
abelian p-subgroup P . Let K be the complement of N in G. Then N Q and K are two
distinct subgroups containing A.
Case II (b): P is not elementary abelian. As N Q is a proper subgroup of G contain-

10

ing A, we conclude that P and N are the only proper non-trivial normal subgroups of G.
Moreover, N coincides with Φ(P ), since Φ(P ) is a non-trivial characteristic subgroup of
M . Notice that a characteristic subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal in the whole
group (see [7, Lemma 5.20]). That is, P is a p-group such that its Frattini subgroup N
is elementary abelian. Moreover, since Q is contained in at most one subgroup, either
NG (Q) = Q or NG (Q) = N Q. Notice that in the latter case we have N Q ∼
= Zp × Zq .
Consider the action of Q on the set of subgroups of P by conjugation. It is easy to see
that the ﬁxed points of this action must be precisely P , N , and the trivial subgroup.
Clearly, Q acts on N irreducibly and by the Correspondence Theorem the induced action of Q on P/N is also irreducible. Conversely, if the action of Q on N and P/N
are irreducible, then N is the only proper non-trivial subgroup of P ﬁxed by Q. To see
this, take an element a ∈ Q and consider its action. If 1 < X < N , then X a 6= X by
assumption. Let N < N X, X 6= P and X a = Y . Notice that since N is contained by
every maximal subgroup of G, we have N X 6= P . We want to show that X 6= Y . By
assumption (N X/N )a 6= N X/N . However, (N X/N )a = (N X)a /N = N Y /N implying
X 6= Y .
Remark. The “smallest” non-solvable group is the alternating group A5 on ﬁve letters
and its order is divisible by three distinct primes. However, it does not satisfy the
2-valency condition. To be more precise, if H is a subgroup of order 5, then there is
exactly one proper subgroup, say K, of A5 containing H. To see this, ﬁrst observe
that any maximal subgroup M of A5 has index ≥ 5, as otherwise, there would be a
homomorphism φ : A5 → SG/M with a non-trivial kernel which is impossible. Hence
the only possibility for the order of K is 10. Since H is not a normal subgroup of A5
and since H is normalized by the maximal subgroup K, we see that K is the unique
subgroup containing H.

Nilpotent groups
As it was mentioned in the Introduction, to show that the intersection graph of a given
solvable group is 3-connected we must claim the existence of “suﬃciently” many vertices
to construct at least three independent paths for any pair of minimal subgroups which
seems to be not an easy task. (Or, conversely, we must claim the non-existence of
vertices to verify that the graph is not 3-connected.) Of course, Hall Theorems enables
us to claim that 3-valency condition is satisﬁed if there are at least four distinct prime
divisors of the order of the group. Also, it is not diﬃcult to show that such groups are
indeed 3-connected (compare with Corollory 10 below). However, if there are less than
four prime divisors things are more complicated. Therefore, in this section we restrict
our attention to nilpotent groups.
Lemma 9. Let G be a finite supersolvable group. Then κ(G) ≥ 3 if and only if G
satisfies the 3-valency condition.
Proof. Suﬃciency is obvious. Let G be a ﬁnite supersolvable group satisfying the 3valency condition. We want to show that there are at least three independent paths
between any pair of minimal subgroups A and B. Clearly, we may suppose that ℓ(G) ≥ 3,
since groups of order p2 and pq does not satisfy even 1-valency condition. Notice that
as G is supersolvable, any maximal subgroup is of prime index; and thus, if X is a nontrivial subgroup of G which is not minimal, then X intersects any maximal subgroup
non-trivially.

11

Case I: G has exactly one maximal subgroup. Then G is a cyclic group of prime
power order pα and it satisﬁes 3-valency condition if and only if α ≥ 5 which is the case
if and only if κ(G) ≥ 3.
Case II: G has exactly two maximal subgroups. If G is a p-group, then the number of
maximal subgroups ≡ 1 (mod p) (see [1, p. 30]). Also, if |G| is divisible by three distinct
prime divisors, then it would have at least three maximal subgroups corresponding
(containing the corresponding Hall subgroups). Hence |G| = pa q b . Obviously, maximal
subgroups must be normal and hence G ∼
= P ×Q is a nilpotent group where P and Q are
Sylow p- and Sylow q- subgroups respectively. Observe that if H E P and K E Q, then
HK E G as G is the direct product of P and Q. However, since any maximal subgroup
of a p-group is normal, P and Q have exactly one maximal subgroups meaning both are
cyclic groups of prime power order and in turn G is also a cyclic group. It can be easily
observed that 3-valency condition is equivalent to the 3-connectedness for such groups.
Case III: G has at least three maximal subgroups. Let Mi be maximal subgroups,
Xi be subgroups containing A, and Yi be subgroups containing B for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3. Then
(A, Xi , Mi , Yi , B), 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, are three independent paths between A and B. Of course,
in case of a coincidence the corresponding paths can be shortened accordingly.
Corollary 10. Let G be a finite supersolvable group with κ(G) < 3. Then the number
of prime divisors of |G| is at most three. Moreover, if there are exactly three distinct
prime divisors, then |G| is square-free.
Proof. Obviously, if there are more than three distinct prime divisors of |G|, then G
satisﬁes 3-valency condition, hence is 3-connected as well. Let |G| = pα q β r γ where
p, q, r are distinct prime numbers and α ≥ 2. Let A be a minimal subgroup. If A
is a p-subgroup, then A is properly contained in a Sylow p-subgroup, by a Hall {p, q}subgroup, and by a Hall {p, r}-subgroup. If A is a q-subgroup, then A is contained in Hall
{p, q}-subgroup, by a Hall {q, r}-subgroup and by a maximal subgroup containing the
corresponding Hall {q, r}-subgroup. Similarly, there are at least three proper subgroups
containing A whenever A is a r-subgroup.
By Corollory 4, we know that if G is a supersolvable group such that κ(G) < 3, then
ℓ(G) is at most 5. Moreover, by using Corollory 10 (and ignoring the ℓ(G) ≤ 2 cases),
we may reduce the possible cases for the order of G into the following list

Table 1
|G| = p5 ,
|G| = p4 q,
|G| = p3 q 2 ,

|G| = p4 ,
|G| = p3 q,
|G| = p2 q 2 ,

|G| = p3 ,
|G| = p2 q,
|G| = pqr.

Actually, we may still eliminate some further cases.
Lemma 11. Let G be a finite supersolvable group with κ(G) < 3. Then the order of G
must be equal to one of the following
pα (0 ≤ α ≤ 4),

p3 q,

p2 q 2 ,

p2 q,

pqr,

pq

where p, q, and r are distinct prime numbers. Moreover, if G is nilpotent, then |G| =
6
2
2
3
p q ; and if G is nilpotent and of order p q, then G is cyclic.

12

Proof. By Lemma 9 we know that G is 3-connected, if 3-valency condition holds. Since
G is supersolvable group, any minimal subgroup is contained in at least ℓ(G) − 2 proper
subgroups. Thus, ℓ(G) < 5. This eliminates the ﬁrst column of Table 1.
Let G be a nilpotent group of order p2 q 2 and let A be a minimal subgroup of G.
Obviously, G is an abelian group and the normal subgroup A of G is contained in a
subgroup of order pq, by a subgroup of order p2 q and by the Sylow subgroup. Hence, G
satisﬁes 3-valency condition.
Let G be a nilpotent group of order p3 q. Then the Sylow q-subgroup Q of G is a
normal subgroup and any minimal subgroup of order p is contained in a subgroup of
order p2 , by a subgroup of order p3 , and by a subgroup of order pq. Suppose that Q is
not contained in more than two proper subgroups. However, this is possible only if the
Sylow p-subgroup P is normal and P ∼
= Zp3 . Thus, G is cyclic as well.
Lemma 12. Let G be a finite p-group. Then κ(G) < 3 if and only if one of the following
holds.
1. |G| = pα (0 ≤ α ≤ 3) and neither G ∼
= Q8 nor G ∼
= Zp × Zp × Zp .
2. G is a group of order p4 such that
(a) G ∼
= Zp4 , or
∼ Z 2 except G ∼
(b) Φ(G) =
= Q16 , or
p
(c) Φ(G) ∼
= Zp × Zp and Z(G) < Φ(G) except
i. G ∼
= ha, b, c | a9 = b3 = 1, ab = ba, a3 = c3 , bcb−1 = c4 , aca−1 = cb−1 i,
and
2
ii. G ∼
= ha, b, c | ap = bp = cp = 1, bc = cb, bab−1 = ap+1 , cac−1 = abi for
p > 3.
In particular, all p-groups of order > p4 are 3-connected.
Proof. Obviously, |G| = p2 implies Γ(G) consists of isolated vertices, hence it cannot be
connected. So, let’s assume |G| > p2 .
Case I: |G| = p3 . First, suppose that Φ(G) 6= 1. If all maximal subgroups of G
are cyclic, then G has a unique minimal subgroup and its intersection graph is complete. However, Γ(Zp3 ) has two vertices whereas Γ(Q8 ) has four, thus only the latter
is 3-connected among them. If there exists a maximal subgroup M ∼
= Zp × Zp , then
any minimal subgroup X of M which is diﬀerent from Φ(G) is not contained in any
maximal subgroup other than M , as hX, Φ(G)i uniquely determines M . That is, G does
not satisfy 3-valency condition in such case. Now, suppose that Φ(G) is trivial, i.e. G
is isomorphic to the elementary abelian group of rank 3. By the correspondence theorem, any minimal subgroup is contained in p + 1 maximal subgroups. Also, since any
two maximal subgroups of a p-group intersects non-trivially (by the product formula),
maximal subgroups form a complete subgraph in Γ(G). Therefore, G is 3-connected in
this case.
Case II: |G| = p4 . Recall that the rank of a p-group is the dimension of G/Φ(G)
as a vector space over the ﬁeld of p-elements. If the rank of G is four or three, i.e.
Φ(G) ∼
= 1 or Zp , then for any minimal subgroup X we may form Φ(G)X which is
contained in at least p + 1 maximal subgroups of G. Clearly, G is 3-connected in this
case. On the other hand, if the rank of G is one, i.e. G ∼
= Zp4 , then Γ(G) has exactly
three vertices and hence cannot be 3-connected. Now we shall conﬁne ourselves to the
case G is of rank two.

13

Suppose that Φ(G) ∼
= Zp2 . If G has a unique minimal subgroup then it is isomorphic
to the quaternion group Q16 and its intersection graph is complete, hence 3-connected
as well. Let us assume there exists a minimal subgroup X of G which is diﬀerent from
the minimal subgroup P of Φ(G). Notice that P is a necessarily normal subgroup of
G. Then the only maximal subgroup containing X is M := Φ(G)X as any maximal
subgroup contains Φ(G). This in turn implies that P X is the only subgroup of order
p2 containing X, since P is the Frattini subgroup of M . Therefore G does not satisfy
3-valency condition in such a case, hence it is not 3-connected.
Suppose that Φ(G) ∼
= Zp × Zp . If G is abelian, then it is isomorphic to Zp2 × Zp2 and
any minimal subgroup is contained in the Frattini subgroup, hence it is 3-connected. If
G is not abelian, then either Z(G) = Φ(G) or Z(G) < Φ(G). This is because, any cyclic
extension of a central subgroup is abelian and Z(G) intersects any normal subgroup
non-trivially whenever G is a p-group. Let Z(G) = Φ(G). Then a minimal subgroup P
is normal in G if and only if P is a subgroup of Φ(G). We show that G is 3-connected
in such a case. Let Pi , 1 ≤ i ≤ p + 1 be minimal subgroups of Φ(G) and let X, Y be two
arbitrary minimal subgroups that are not contained in Φ(G). We show that there are
at least three independent paths between any pair of minimal subgroups. Clearly, this
holds if the endpoints are Pi and Pj for any i 6= j. Let Ai := Pi X for 1 ≤ i ≤ p + 1.
Since X  Φ(G) and |Ai | = p2 , Ai ∩ Aj = X for i 6= j. Then, we may form three
internally independent paths (X, A1 , M, Pi ), (X, A2 , N, Pi ), and (X, A3 , T, Pi ) between
X and Pi where M, N, and T are mutually distinct maximal subgroups. Let Bi := Pi Y
for 1 ≤ i ≤ p + 1. Clearly, (X, Ai , Bi , Y ), 1 ≤ i ≤ p + 1 are independent paths between
X and Y .
Let Z(G) < Φ(G). Obviously, Z := Z(G) is the unique minimal normal subgroup of
G. If all minimal subgroups of G are contained in Φ(G), then clearly 3-valency condition
holds and G is 3-connected by Lemma 9. We want to show that under these conditions
G is unique up to isomorphism.
(I) There exists a maximal subgroup A which is abelian, moreover A ∼
= Zp2 × Zp .
By the N/C lemma (see [7, Theorem 7.1]), NG (Φ(G))/CG (Φ(G)) = G/CG (Φ(G)) can
2
2
be embedded into Aut(Φ(G)) ∼
=
 Zp × Zp which is of order (p − 1)(p − p). Then
2

CG (Φ(G)) = Φ(G) implies p
|Aut(Φ(G))| and this is impossible. Also, since the
center of G is a proper subgroup of Φ(G), then CG (Φ(G)) is not the whole group G
either. Thus, A := CG (Φ(G)) is an abelian subgroup of order p3 ; and since any maximal
subgroup Y of A diﬀerent from Φ(G) is cyclic, A ∼
= Zp2 × Zp .
(II) A := CG (Φ(G)) is the unique abelian group of order p3 , moreover M ∼
= Zp2 ⋊ Zp
for any maximal subgroup M diﬀerent from A. Suppose that there exists an abelian
subgroup B ∼
= Zp2 × Zp diﬀerent from A. Then, as hA, Bi = G and A ∩ B = Φ(G), the
center Z of G contains Φ(G) which is a contradiction. Therefore, any maximal subgroup
M other than A is isomorphic to Zp2 ⋊ Zp , since any non-Frattini subgroup of order p2
is cyclic.
(III) G has a presentation
2

ha, b, c | ap = bp = 1, ab = ba, ap = ckp , bcb−1 = c1+p , aca−1 = c1+mp bn i
for some suitable values of the prime p and integers k, m, n. Let a, b ∈ A and c ∈ M
such that a, c are of order p2 and b is of order p. Clearly, those elements generate G
and we have ab = ba, ap , cp ∈ Z, and bcb−1 = c1+p as hb, ci ∼
= Zp2 ⋊ Zp . Moreover, any
conjugate of c can be written as cγ bβ for some integers γ, β; and since acp a−1 = cp = crp
where γ ≡ r (mod p), we have r = 1.
(IV) p = 3. We want to show that for p > 3, there is an element g of order p such that
g∈
/ Φ(G). Then the subgroup generated by this element is a minimal one and it is not

14

contained in the Frattini subgroup contrary to our assumption. Thus, we shall deduce
p = 3. Using the above relations, we may obtain bβ cγ = cγ bβ cβγp and acx = cx abxn u
1
where u = c( 2 x(x−1)n+xm)p . Clearly acx ∈
/ Φ(G) for p ∤ x. By some further computation
1

1

1

(acx )p = cxp{1+ 6 (p−1)p(p+1)xn} ap b 2 p(p−1)xn u 2 p(p−1) = cxp{1+ 6 (p−1)p(p+1)xn} ap .
However, this formula implies that (ac−k )p = 1 for p 6= 3.
(V) Without loss of generality we may take k = 1, m = 0, n = −1. Suppose that
p = 3. Clearly, k ∈ {−1, 1} and m, n ∈ {−1, 0, 1}. However, n = 0 implies that CG (hci)
is an abelian group of order p3 (compare with (I)). As CG (hci) is diﬀerent from A,
this contradicts with (II). Moreover, using the relation presented in (IV), we see that
(ack )3 = c3(n−k) . Therefore, n and k have opposite parity, as otherwise, hack i would be
a minimal subgroup which is not contained in Φ(G). Thus, there are totally six distinct
triples (k, m, n) that we shall consider. If triples (k1 , m1 , n1 ) and (k2 , m2 , n2 ) yields
isomorphic groups, we simply write (k1 , m1 , n1 ) ∼ (k2 , m2 , n2 ). Now substituting a−1
for a yields an automorphism of G showing that (1, 0, −1) ∼ (−1, 0, 1), (1, −1, −1) ∼
(−1, 1, 1), and (1, 1, −1) ∼ (−1, −1, 1). Also, it can be veriﬁed that the automorphisms
ϕ : a 7→ a, b 7→ b, c 7→ c2 and ψ : a 7→ ab, b 7→ b, c 7→ b−1 cb yields (1, 0, −1) ∼ (−1, 1, 1)
and (1, 0, −1) ∼ (1, 1, −1) respectively. Hence, we have
(1, 0, −1) ∼ (1, −1, −1) ∼ (1, 1, −1) ∼ (−1, 0, 1) ∼ (−1, 1, 1) ∼ (−1, −1, 1)
Conversely, it can be veriﬁed that a group with this presentation is of order 81 and all
minimal subgroups are contained in Φ(G).
Next suppose that there are minimal subgroups of G which do not lie in Φ(G). Let
X be such a minimal subgroup. Observe that X is contained in exactly one maximal
subgroup, say M . Otherwise, there exist two distinct maximal subgroups such that
their intersection strictly contains Φ(G) which is impossible. For the rest of the proof
we assume that G is a 3-connected group. Then, there exist two subgroups Y and
W of order p2 containing X, as otherwise, 3-valency condition would not be satisﬁed.
Since Y, W, and Φ(G) are maximal subgroups of M intersecting trivially, we see that
M ∼
= Zp × Zp × Zp . Moreover, M contains all minimal subgroups of G, as otherwise,
there would be another maximal subgroup of G which is abelian and this implies that
Φ(G) is in the center of G contrary to our assumption. In other words, any maximal
subgroup L of G diﬀerent from M is isomorphic to Zp2 ⋊ Zp . We want to show that G
has a presentation
2

G∼
= ha, b, c | ap = bp = cp = 1, bc = cb, bab−1 = ap+1 , cac−1 = abi.
Let a, b ∈ L and c ∈ M such that a is of order p2 and b, c are of order p. Clearly, those
elements generate G and we have bc = cb, ap ∈ Z, and bab−1 = ap+1 as ha, bi ∼
= Zp2 × Zp .
Moreover, any conjugate of a can be written as aα bβ for some integers α, β; and since
cap c−1 = ap = arp where γ ≡ r (mod p), we have r = 1. One may observe that distinct
conjugates of hai are generated by a1+mp b for 1 ≤ m ≤ p; and c ∈ M can be chosen
in a way that cac−1 = ab holds. Conversely, it can be veriﬁed that a group with this
presentation is of order p4 and has the desired structure for p > 3. Notice that the
generators a and b commutes for p = 2. Also the element ac clearly does not belong to
Φ(G); however its order is p for p = 3. For the classiﬁcation of groups of order p4 , the
reader may refer to [2, p. 140].

15

Proof of Theorem C. It can be easily veriﬁed that nilpotent groups of order p2 q do not
satisfy the 3-valency condition. (This is also a consequence of Lemma 8.) Also, a
nilpotent group of order pqr is cyclic and does not satisfy the 3-valency condition. Then
the ﬁrst part of the Theorem follows from Lemmas 9, 12, and 11.
For the second part we argue as follows. Let A and B be two distinct minimal
subgroups of a ﬁnite solvable group G such that there are at least four distinct prime
divisors of |G|. Suppose that A and B are of same order, say p. Let Aq , Ar , and As
be some maximal Hall subgroups of G containing A such that their indexes is a power
of prime numbers q, r, and s respectively. Also, let Bq , Br , and Bs be some maximal
Hall subgroups containing B. (Of course, [G : Bq ] = q α for some integer α, and so
on.) By the product formula (A, Aq , Br , B), (A, Ar , Bs , B), and (A, As , Bq , B) are three
independent paths between A and B. Similar arguments can be applied if |A| =
6 |B|.
