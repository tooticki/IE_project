Abstract. Proof is given for the “only if” part of the result stated in
the previous paper of the series that a suitably nondegenerate Calderón-Zygmund operator T is bounded in a Banach lattice X on Rn if and
only if the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator M is bounded in both
X and X ′ , under the assumption that X has the Fatou property and X
is p-convex and q-concave with some 1 < p, q < ∞. We also get rid of an
application of a fixed point theorem in the proof of the main lemma and
give an improved version of an earlier result concerning the divisibility
of BMO-regularity.

This paper is closely related to [7] and contains essentially no new nontechnical results, hence for the background and the generalities we refer the
reader to [7].
A. Yu. Karlovich and L. Maligranda kindly pointed out to the author
that the proof of [7, Theorem 16] has a flaw, namely that the relationship
(XLs )′ = X ′ Ls′ is incorrect (and in fact it is always false). Unfortunately,
it is not clear if [7, Theorem 16] is true in the stated form.
Nevertheless, we will see that the main result of [7] is still true with
only a slight loss of generality concerning the nondegeneracy assumption
imposed on a Calderón-Zygmund operator T . Specifically, in place of A2 nondegeneracy
of T (which is a condition that the boundedness of T in
 1

L2 w
implies w ∈ A2 with an estimate for the constant) we require that
the kernels of both T and its conjugate T ∗ satisfy a standard assumption
on growth along a certain singular direction (see [10, Chapter 5, §4.6]).
Definition 1. We say that a singular integral operator T on Rn is nondegenerate if there exists a constant c > 0 and some x0 ∈ Rn \ {0} such that
for any ball B ⊂ Rn of radius r > 0 and any locally summable nonnegative
function f supported on B we have

For example, the Hilbert transform H and any of the Riesz transforms
Rj are nondegenerate in this sense. A nondegenerate operator T is also
A2 -nondegenerate. For details see [10, Chapter 5, §4.6].
Theorem 2. Suppose that X is a Banach lattice of measurable functions
on Rn ×Ω that satisfies the Fatou property and X is p-convex and q-concave
with some 1 < p, q < ∞. Let T be a Calderón-Zygmund operator in L2 (Rn )
such that both T and T ∗ are nondegenerate. The following conditions are
equivalent.
(1) The Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator M acts boundedly in X and
in the order dual X ′ of X.
(2) All Calderón-Zygmund operators act boundedly in X.
(3) T acts boundedly in X.
Thus, concerning the necessity of A1 -regularity we make no claims about
the general spaces of homogeneous type, although in many cases a suitable
generalization of Definition 1 seems to be possible. Another subtle loss of
generality is that in contrast to [10, Theorem 16] in the proof of 3 ⇒ 1 we
take advantage of the assumption that T is a Calderón-Zygmund operator
as well as a nondegenerate operator, specifically that T is bounded in Lt for
1 < t < ∞ with norm O(t) as t → ∞.
For the proof of 1 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 3 of Theorem 2 see [7]. The proof of 3 ⇒ 1
essentially follows the scheme of the flawed proof of [7, Theorem 16], but
it seems to require a much more delicate approach that we will present
throughout the rest of the paper, leading to the proof itself given at the end
of Section 5 below. We briefly outline the structure of the argument, the
details of which are also of some independent interest.
The following result was established (with some caveats) in [5, Theorem A’]; a complete proof in the stated form can be found in [6, Theorem 4].
Here and elsewhere (S, ν) is a space of homogeneous type and (Ω, µ) is a
σ-finite measurable space.
Theorem 3. Suppose that Y is a Banach lattice on (S × Ω, ν × µ) with
1
an order continuous norm. If a linear operator T is bounded in Y 2 then
for every f ∈ Y ′ there exists a majorant w > |f |, kw kY ′ 6 2kf kY ′ , such
that kT kL w − 21 →L w − 21  6 CkT kY 12 →Y 21 , where C depends only on the
2

Grothendieck constant KG .
This yields almost at once the following version of Theorem 2 that we
will need in the proof of Theorem 2, showing that Theorem 2 is also valid
for p = 2, q = ∞ (and by duality for p = 1 and q = 2), provided that X

A1 -REGULARITY AND CALDERÓN-ZYGMUND OPERATORS

3

(respectively, X ′ ) has order continuous norm. The proof is given in Section 1
below.
Theorem 4. Suppose that X is a 2-convex Banach lattice of measurable
functions on (S × Ω, ν × µ) having order continuous norm and the Fatou
property. Let T be an A2 -nondegenerate linear operator in L2 (S × Ω). If T
acts boundedly in X then the maximal operator M is bounded in both X
and X ′ with a suitable estimate for the constants.
In contrast to [7], in the present work we use the standard definition of
the constant [w ]Ap , p > 1 of a Muckenhoupt weight w ∈ Ap on (S ×Ω, ν ×µ)
based on the Muckenhoupt condition:

where the supremum is taken over all balls B ⊂ S.
Recall that a quasi-normed lattice X is called Ap regular with constants
(C, m) if every f ∈ X admits a majorant w ∈ X, w > |f |, such that kw kX 6
mkf kX and w belongs to the Muckenhoupt class Ap with [w ]Ap 6 C.
In Section 2 we give (Proposition 7) a simplified proof of [7, Proposition 8]
that does not use a fixed point theorem. This yields a slightly improved
version (Proposition 8) of [7, Proposition 12] stating that A∞ -regularity of
both X and X ′ implies A1 -regularity of these lattices, where the assumption
that X satisfies the Fatou property is replaced by a weaker assumption that
X ′ is a norming lattice for X. Thus it suffices to establish that condition 3
of Theorem 2 implies that X ′ is A∞ -regular; interchanging X with X ′ would
then show that X is also A∞ -regular.
Under condition 3 of Theorem 4 we may apply Theorem 3 to lattice
Y = X r Ls with some fixed r > 1 sufficiently close to 1 and all sufficiently
1
large s, since T is bounded in Y 2 by interpolation with some estimate for
1
′
the norm that grows with s. This yields A2 -regularity of Y ′ = (X rs )′ s′ ,
with an estimate on the growth of the constant Cs as s → ∞. Now the key
idea is to show that the A2 -majorants w of functions from Y ′ also satisfy
the reverse Hölder inequality with exponent s′ for some sufficiently large s,
which would yield A2 -regularity of (X u )′ , u = rs′ , and thus the required
1

1− 1

A2 -regularity of the lattice X ′ = (X u )′ u L1 u .
However, as discussed in Section 4 below, in order to get an estimate
for Cs with a suitable rate of growth we also need to make sure that the
weight w appearing in the conclusion of Theorem 3 (applied to Y ) satisfies
some additional assumptions, namely that w −1 is a doubling weight with

4

a constant independent of s. Theorem 4 allows us to obtain A1 -regularity
1
1
of Y ′ 2 Lt2 from condition 3 of Theorem 2 with a sufficiently large fixed t,
where an estimate for the constants is independent of s. An extension (Theorem 15) of [6, Theorem 2] concerning the divisibility of Ap -regularity, which
we introduce in Section 3 below, allows us to prove that Y ′ admits suitable
majorants w such that w −1 ∈ A3 (and hence w −1 is a doubling weight)
with a constant independent of s, and an adaptation (Theorem 18) of the
original fixed point argument from [7, §2] makes it possible to impose this
condition on the weights appearing in the conclusion of Theorem 3, thus
completing the proof.

1. Proof of Theorem 4
Suppose that X and Y are normed lattices on a measurable space Ω.
Lattice Y is said to be norming for X if f g ∈ L1 for all f ∈ X and g ∈ Y
R
and kf kX = supg∈Y,kgkY =1 Ω |f g| for all f ∈ X. A normed lattice X is
always norming for its order dual X ′ . Conversely, it is well known that X ′
is a norming lattice for X if X satisfies either the Fatou property (implying
that X = X ′′ ), or if X is a Banach lattice having order continuous norm
(since then X ′ = X ∗ ). The fact
 that
 w ∈ Ap if and only if the maximal
1

operator M is bounded in Lp w − p with the appropriate estimates of the
constants yields at once the following result; see [6, Proposition 13].

Proposition 5. Suppose that X and Y are normed lattices on (S ×Ω, ν ×µ)
such that Y is a norming space for X. If Y is Ap -regular with some p > 1
1
then X p is A1 -regular with appropriate estimates for the constants.
The following result is a particular case of [8, Proposition 13]; we give a
complete proof for clarity.
Proposition 6. Suppose that Z is an A2 -regular quasi-normed lattice on
1
1
(S × Ω, ν × µ). Then lattice Z 2 L12 is A1 -regular.

Indeed, suppose that f ∈ Z 2 L12 = Z 2 L2 with norm 1, so there exist
some g ∈ Z and h ∈ L2 with norms at most 2 such that g > 0 almost

everywhere and f = g 2 h. Let w be a suitable A2 -majorant for g in Z. Then

Now we can prove Theorem 4. Since X is 2-convex, we may apply
Theorem 3 to lattice Y = X 2 and obtain A2 -regularity of lattice Y ′ by
the assumed A2 -nondegeneracy of operator T . By Proposition 5 lattice

2. Main lemma revisited
Recall that a lattice X is called Ap -regular if functions from X admit Ap
majorants with the appropriate control on the norm; see also Definition 10
in Section 3 below. Lattice X is A∞ -regular if and only if it is Ap -regular
with some p < ∞. A1 -regularity is equivalent to the boundedness of the
Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator (see, e. g., [6, Proposition 1]).
The following result was established in [7, Theorem 8] with the help of
a fixed point theorem under an additional assumption that X is a Banach
lattice satisfying the Fatou property. However, we will now see that for the
proof it suffices to carry out a slightly modified version of estimate [7, (6)]
with the appropriate majorants.
Proposition 7. Suppose that X is a quasi-Banach lattice of measurable
functions on (S × Ω, µ × ν) such that X is Ap -regular with some 1 6 p <
∞ and X δ is A1 -regular with some δ > 0. Then X is A1 -regular with an
appropriate estimate for the constants depending only on the corresponding
Ap -regularity constants of X, A1 -regularity constants of X δ and the value
of δ.
Indeed, let f ∈ X. Then there exists an Ap -majorant w for f in X, and
in turn there exists an A1 -majorant u for w δ in X δ . We fix some ω ∈ Ω such
that w (·, ω) ∈ Ap and u(·, ω) ∈ A1 , and let B(x, r) ⊂ S, x ∈ S, r > 0, be an
arbitrary ball in S. Sequential application of the Ap condition satisfied by
weight w , the Jensen inequality with convex function t 7→ t−δ(p−1) , t > 0,

stants c′′ and c′′′ . Thus M is bounded in X with an appropriate estimate of
the norm, and so lattice X is suitably A1 -regular.
Proposition 8. Let X be a normed lattice on (S × Ω, ν × µ) such that X ′
is norming for X. Suppose that both X and X ′ are A∞ -regular. Then both
X and X ′ are A1 -regular.
Indeed, since X and X ′ are A∞ -regular, they are also Ap -regular with
1
1
some p < ∞. By Proposition 5 both X ′ p and X p are then A1 -regular, and
it remains to apply Theorem 7 to X and to X ′ with δ = p1 .
3. Divisibility of Ap -regularity
It is often convenient to think about Muckenhoupt weights in terms
of the Jones factorization theorem (see, e. g., [10, Chapter 5, §5.3]: w ∈
Ap if and only if w = ω0 ω11−p with some weights ω0 , ω1 ∈ A1 with the
appropriate estimates on the constants. This makes it intuitive that, for
example, division by the A1 weights turns Ap weights into Ap+1 weights,
which is the main insight behind the divisibility theorem for Ap -regularity
[6, Theorem 2]: under certain assumptions on Banach lattices X and Y ,
if lattice XY is Ap -regular and lattice Y is A1 -regular then lattice X is
Ap+1 -regular.
However, in the present work a somewhat more general problem arises:
we need to make sure that a lattice X admits majorants w such that w −1 ∈

A1 -REGULARITY AND CALDERÓN-ZYGMUND OPERATORS

A∞ based on the assumption that lattice (XY )δ is A1 -regular with an A1 regular lattice Y and some δ > 0. With that in mind we introduce the
following notions; see also [8, §1].
Definition 9. Let α, β > 0. We say that a weight w on (S × Ω, ν × µ)
belongs to class Fαβ with a constant C if there exist two weights ω0 , ω1 ∈ A1
ωα
with constant C such that w = ω0β .
1

Definition 10. Let α, β > 0, and suppose that X is a quasi-normed lattice
on (S × Ω, ν × µ). We say that X is Fαβ -regular with constants (C, m) if
for any f ∈ X there exists a majorant w ∈ X, w > |f | such that kw kX 6
mkf kX and w ∈ Fαβ with constant C.
“F” in the notation Fαβ stands for “factorizable weight”, and the properties of the A1 weights imply that at least in the local terms ω0 roughly
represents the “poles” of the weight w where the weight takes relatively
large values, whereas ω1 represents the “zeroes” of w where the weight is
relatively small. The corresponding factorization is generally not unique.
Since ω ∈ A1 implies ω δ ∈ A1 for 0 < δ 6 1, we see that Fαβ ⊂ Fαβ11
for α 6 α1 and β 6 β1 . Likewise, Fαβ -regularity of a lattice X implies its
Fαβ11 -regularity.
It is easy to see that these properties are closely related to Ap -regularity.
Proposition 11. Suppose that α > 0, β > 0 and w is a weight on (S ×
1
Ω, ν × µ). Then w ∈ Fαβ if and only if w α ∈ A β +1 , and w ∈ F0β if and only
if w

∈ A1 with the appropriate estimates on the constants.

for α > 0.
Indeed, it suffices to observe that ωβ = ω0 ω1

Proposition 11 yields at once the corresponding result for Fαβ -regularity.

Proposition 12. Let X be a quasi-normed lattice on (S × Ω, ν × µ), and
1
suppose that α > 0, β > 0. Lattice X is Fαβ -regular if and only if lattice X α
is A β +1 -regular.

Incidentally, as a corollary we get yet another characterization of the
property log w ∈ BMO and the corresponding BMO-regularity in terms of
w ∈ Fαβ with some α and β and, respectively, Fαβ -regularity of lattice X.
Notation Fαβ allows convenient computations for exponents and products
of weights. The following property is immediate from the definitions.
Proposition 13. Suppose that α, β, γ > 0 and w ∈ Fαβ . Then w γ ∈ Fγα
γβ
with the same constants. If w > 0 almost everywhere then w −γ ∈ Fγβ
with
γα

8

the same constants. If a lattice X is Fαβ -regular and γ > 0 then lattice X γ
is Fγα
γβ -regular with the same constants.
Proposition 14. Suppose that α0 , α1 , β0 , β1 > 0, w0 ∈ Fαβ00 and w1 ∈ Fαβ11 .
+α1
then w0 w1 ∈ Fβα00+β
with the appropriate estimates on the constants. Like1
wise, if X and Y are some lattices on (S×Ω, ν×µ) such that X is Fαβ00 -regular
+α1
and Y is Fαβ11 -regular then lattice XY is Fαβ00+β
-regular with the appropriate
1
estimates on the constants.
Indeed, since the sets of A1 weights with constant at most C are logaα

It is remarkable that the statement of Proposition 14 can be reversed not
only for weights but also for lattices. The following result is a generalization
of [6, Theorem 2]; in the proof of Theorem 2 in Section 5 below it is applied
with α1 = 2, α0 = 1, β0 = β1 = 0,
Theorem 15. Suppose that X and Y are quasi-Banach lattices on (S ×
Ω, ν × µ) satisfying the Fatou property, XY is Fαβ11 -regular and Y is Fαβ00 +β0
regular. Then lattice X is Fβα11+α
-regular.

Examining the case of weighted L∞ (w ) lattices with suitable weights
shows that the conclusion of Theorem 15 is sharp in the sense that the
indexes of regularity cannot be replaced by smaller values.
A complete proof of theorem 15 is given in Section 6 below. A weaker
statement can be obtained directly from [6, Theorem 2]; however, the resulting indexes of regularity are too crude for our purposes. However, we
may deduce the case needed in the present work from the following recently
obtained result, which seems to be somewhat less involved technically than
the proof of Theorem 15 in full generality that, among other things, uses a
fixed point theorem.
Theorem 16 ([8, Theorem 14]). Suppose that X is a Banach lattice of
measurable functions on S × Ω satisfying the Fatou property and α > 1,
β > 0. Then X is Fαβ -regular if and only if X ′ is Fβ+1
α−1 -regular.

Indeed, suppose that under the conditions of Theorem 15 both lattices X
and Y are r-convex with some r > 0 such that α0 r > 1 and (α1 + β0 )r > 1;
these conditions are satisfied in the application to the proof of Theorem 2

Nevertheless, securing an additional restriction on the doubling constant

in the sense that B ′ ⊂ B(x, r(1 + |x0 |)) and B ⊂ B(x + rx0 , r(1 + |x0 |)), the
doubling condition of either the weight w or the weight w −1 implies that
one of the factors on the left-hand side of (6) is suitably comparable to a
similar factor with either B replaced by B ′ or vice versa. This observation
yields (3), since both B and B ′ are arbitrary balls of Rn .

Here “BAp ” denotes “the ball of Ap ”, and “(MC)” indicates that these sets
are defined by the Muckenhoupt condition to avoid confusion with earlier
work (e. g. [6, Section 3]), where different (for p > 1) sets BAp (C) were
used. The latter have the advantage of being convex and they can also be
used to establish the results of the present work; however, we do not need

Consequently, these sets are also logarithmically convex and closed with

Proposition 20. Suppose that Z is a Banach1 lattice on a σ-finite measurable space, ω1 ∈ Z, ω1 > 0 almost everywhere, E ⊂ Z is a bounded set

for all g ∈ L2 W − 2 , so extending (9) to all g ∈ L2 w − 2 by density
yields w ∈ BT .
Suppose that f ∈ X. We may assume that kf kX = 1 and f > 0 almost
everywhere. By the assumptions lattice X is Fα1 -regular with some constants
(C1 , m1 ). Let 0 < β 6 1 be a sufficiently small number to be determined
later. We introduce a set D = {log w | w ∈ X, w > βf, kw kX 6 1} and a
set-valued map Φ : D × D → 2D×D by
Φ((log u, log v )) = {(log u1 , log v1 ) ∈ D × D |
u1 ∈ X, v1 ∈ X, ku1 kX 6 1, kv1kX 6 1,
u1 ∈ BT , v1 ∈ BFα1 (C1 ) , f ∨ u ∨ v 6 A(u1 ∧ v1 )}
for all (log u, log v ) ∈ D × D with a sufficiently large constant A to be
determined in a moment.
Let (log u, log v ) ∈ D × D. Then w = f ∨ u ∨ v ∈ X with kw kX 6 3. Applying Theorem 3 to function w yields a majorant u2 ∈ X, u2 > w , ku2 kX 6
2kw kX 6 6 such that u2 ∈ BT . On the other hand, by the Fα1 -regularity of
X there exists some majorant v2 ∈ X, v2 > w , kv2 kX 6 m1 kw kX 6 3m1
such that v2 ∈ BFα1 (C1 ). Setting u1 = 61 u2 , v1 = 3m1 1 v2 and choosing
A = 6 ∨ 3m1 and β = A1 shows that (log u1 , log v1 ) ∈ Φ((log u, log v )),
so Φ takes nonempty values.
Now it suffices to establish that map Φ has a fixed point (log u, log v ) ∈
D × D, Φ((log u, log v )) ∋ (log u, log v ). If this is the case then f ∨ u ∨ v 6
A(u ∧ v ), so w = A(u ∨ v ) is a majorant of f such that kw kX 6 2A
and w is pointwise equivalent to both u and v with constant A, which
implies that kT kL w − 21 →L w − 12  6 A2 CkT kY 12 →Y 21 and w ∈ Fα1 with a

constant depending only on A, C1 and m1 . Thus w −1 ∈ F1α = Aα+1 by
Proposition 13, and hence w −1 is a doubling weight with an estimate for the
doubling constant depending only on A, C1 and m1 . Finally, Proposition 17
yields the required estimate 7 with a suitable constant C2 .
Thus it suffices to verify that Φ satisfies the assumptions of the Fan–
Kakutani fixed point theorem [1]. We apply Proposition

weak topology of L2 ω − 2 . D is a convex set that is closed with respect to
the convergence in measure, and hence D is compact. Likewise, the graph
Γ of Φ is a convex set, so it suffices to show that Γ is closed in the strong
topology of D × D × D × D, which easily follows from the closedness of Γ
with respect to the convergence in measure by the Fatou property of the
lattice X. This concludes the proof of Proposition 18.
5. Proof of the main result
We begin by stating a recently developed (see [3]) quantitative estimate
for the reverse Hölder inequality as it applies to Ap -regularity.
The Fujii-Wilson constant of a weight w ∈ A∞ on S × Ω, which gives an
equavalent definition of the class A∞ , is

where the supremum is taken over all balls B ⊂ S. This constant is dominated by the Muckenhoupt constant [w ]Ap for any p (see, e. g., [2, Proposition 2.2]). By [3, Theorem 1.1] any weight w ∈ A∞ satisfies the reverse
Hölder inequality with all exponents 1 6 r 6 1 + c[w1]A for some constant

immediately that w ∈ Ap implies w ∈ Ap and [w ]Ap 6 c2 [w ]Ap for all
1 6 r 6 1 + c1 [w1]A with some constants c1 and c2 independent of w . This

implies the following observation.

Proposition 21. Suppose that a quasi-Banach lattice X on (S × Ω, ν × µ)
is A∞ -regular with (Fujii-Wilson) constants (CA∞ , m), and X is Ap -regular
with some 1 6 p < ∞. Then X r is also Ap -regular for all 1 < r 6 1 + c C1A

with some constant c independent of CA∞ .

Ap -regular. Then lattices X θ L11−θ are also Ap -regular for all 0 < θ < 1.

and X r is Ap -regular for small enough values of r by Proposition 21, which
implies (by, e. g., Propositions 14 and 13) that Z is also Ap -regular.

We are now ready to prove implication 3 ⇒ 1 of Theorem 2. Suppose
that under the conditions of Theorem 2 operator T is bounded in X; we
need to show that lattices X and X ′ are A1 -regular. By Proposition 8 it is
sufficient to show that both X and X ′ are A2 -regular.
The Fatou property together with p-convexity and q-concavity assumptions on X imply that both X and X ′ have order continuous norm (since,
1

for example, X ′ = (X p )′ p L1p and the product of a couple if Banach lattices
has order continuous norm if one of the lattices has it), so L2 ∩ X is dense in
X and it is easy to see that T is bounded in X if and only if T ∗ is bounded
in X ′ . Thus by the symmetry it suffices to prove that X ′ is A2 -regular.

6. Proof of Theorem 15
Compared to [6, Theorem 2], the proof of Theorem 15 essentially requires
only minor technical adjustments; however, to avoid confusion we provide
a complete version of it. The only apparent difficulty that arises in direct
translation of the proof is that the sets of the corresponding Fαβ -majorants
seem to lack convexity for α 6= 1; however, they are still logarithmically
convex, which suffices to establish closedness of the graph of the map using
the same method. We also use a different ambient space for the map, which
makes approximating the problem by restricting the conditions to sets of
finite measure unnecessary. This modification also allows us to avoid using
a compactness-type result for sets closed with respect to the convergence
in measure, since the standard weak compactness of sets in a weighted L2
space suffices.
See Section 4 above for the definition of sets BFαβ (C).
Proposition 23. Suppose that u, v ∈ BFαβ (C) with a constant C. Then
u ∨ v ∈ BFαβ (2C). If α = 0 then u ∨ v ∈ BFαβ (C).

for all balls B ⊂ S and almost all ω ∈ Ω, so indeed u ∨ v ∈ BAp
(C).
In the case α = 0 it suffices to show that u, v ∈ BA1 (C) implies u ∧ v ∈
BA1 (C), which follows at once from the estimates M(u ∧ v ) 6 Mu 6 Cu
and M(u ∧ v ) 6 Mv 6 Cv .
We begin the proof of Theorem 15. First of all, since for all δ > 0 the
statement of Theorem 15 for lattices X and Y is equivalent to the same
statement for lattices X δ and Y δ with all indices multiplied by δ, and since
for any quasi-Banach lattice Z lattice Z δ is (up to a renorming) Banach
for small enough values of δ (see, e. g., [9, Theorem 3.2.1]), we may assume
that lattices XY , X and Y are all Banach.
Suppose that lattice XY is Fαβ11 -regular with constants (CXY , mXY ) and
Y is Fαβ00 -regular with constants (CY , mY ). We can choose C large enough
(depending on CXY and CY ) that the Fαβ11 -majorants in XY lie in BFαβ11 (C)
and the Fαβ00 -majorants in Y belong to BFαβ00 (C).
Take any ω0 ∈ Y such that kω0 kY > 0. There exists an Fαβ majorant
ω1 ∈ BFαβ (C) for ω0 . We may assume that kω1 kY = 1. Let

	
D = log w | w ∈ BFαβ (2C) , w > ω1 , kw kY 6 2 .

+β0
Suppose that f ∈ X; we need to prove that there exists a suitable Fβα11+α
0
majorant for f . We may assume that f > 0 almost everywhere and that
kf kX = 1.
Take any function log w ∈ D. Then f w ∈ XY with norm at most 2, and
there exist some majorants g > f , g ∈ BFαβ11 (C), kgkXY 6 2mXY . It is easy
to see that (see, e. g., [6, (16)])
 −1

so there exists some b ∈ Y , b > ω0 , kbkY 6 2 such that kgb−1 kX 6 4mXY .
Now let v > b, v ∈ BFαβ00 (C), kv kY 6 2mY be an Fαβ00 -majorant for b, and

Thus it suffices to show that Φ satisfies the conditions of the Fan–

takes convex closed values that are compact.
