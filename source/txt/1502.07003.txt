Abstract
We prove an incidence theorem for points and curves in the complex plane. Given a set
of m points in R2 and a set of n curves with k degrees of freedom, Pach and Sharir proved

2k−2
k
that the number of point-curve incidences is O m 2k−1 n 2k−1 + m + n . We establish the slightly

2k−2
k
weaker bound Oε m 2k−1 +ε n 2k−1 + m + n on the number of incidences between m points and
n (complex) algebraic curves in C2 with k degrees of freedom. We combine tools from algebraic
geometry and differential geometry to prove a key technical lemma that controls the number
of complex curves that can be contained inside a real hypersurface. This lemma may be of
independent interest to other researchers proving incidence theorems over C.

Introduction

Let P be a set of points and let V be a set of geometric objects (for example, one might consider
lines, circles, or planes) in a vector space K d over a field K. An incidence is a pair (p, V ) ∈ P × V
such that the point p is contained in the object V . In incidence problems, one is usually interested
in the maximum number of incidences in P × V, taken over all possible sets P, V of a given size.
For example, the well-known Szemerédi-Trotter Theorem [25] states that any set of m points and
n lines in R2 must have O(m2/3 n2/3 + m + n) incidences.
Incidence theorems have a large variety of applications. For example, in the last few years
they have been used by Guth and Katz [12] to almost completely settle Erdős’ distinct distances
problem in the plane; by Bourgain and Demeter [3, 2] to study restriction problems in harmonic
analysis; by Raz, Sharir, and Solymosi [21] to study expanding polynomials; and by Farber, Ray,
and Smorodinsky [10] to study properties of totally positive matrices.

1.1

Previous work

We will be concerned with the number of incidences between points and various classes of curves.
Later, we will define several different types of curves, but for the definition below one can think of
a curve as merely a subset of K 2 , where K is either R or C.
Let C be a set of curves in K 2 and let P be a set of points in K 2 . We say that the arrangement
(P, C) has k degrees of freedom and multiplicity type s if
• For any subset P ′ ⊂ P of size k, there are at most s curves from C that contain P ′ .
• Any pair of curves from C intersect in at most s points from P.

We will use I(P, C) to denote the number of incidences between the points in P and curves in
C. The current best bound for incidences between points and general curves in R2 is the following
(better bounds are known for some specific types of curves, such as circles and parabolas1 ).
Theorem 1.1 (Pach and Sharir [19]). Let P be a set of m points in R2 and let C be a set of n
simple plane curves. Suppose that (P, C) has k degrees of freedom and multiplicity type s. Then

2k−2
k
I(P, C) = Ok,s m 2k−1 n 2k−1 + m + n .

If the curves are algebraic, then we can drop the requirement that the curves are simple (however,
the implicit constant will now depend on the degree of the curves). This special case was proved
several years earlier than Theorem 1.1. The proof follows from the techniques in [5], and appears
explicitly in [18].

Theorem 1.2 (Pach and Sharir [18, 19]). Let P be a set of m points in R2 and let C be a set of n
algebraic curves of degree at most D. Suppose that (P, C) has k degrees of freedom and multiplicity
type s. Then

2k−2
k
I(P, C) = Ok,s,D m 2k−1 n 2k−1 + m + n .

Less is known about point-curve incidences in the complex plane. If we add the additional
requirement that pairs of curves must intersect transversely2 , then an analogue of Theorem 1.2 can
be proved using the techniques of Solymosi-Tao from [24], although these methods introduce an
ε loss in the exponent. Previously, Tóth [26] proved the important special case where the curves
in C are lines. This was generalized by the third author in [28], who proved a bound analogous
to that in Theorem 1.2 for complex curves. However, in addition to the requirement that curves
intersect transversely, the results of [28] have an additional restriction on the relative sizes of P and
C, and they require that the curves be smooth. Elekes and the second author [9, Theorem 9] proved
Pach-Sharir-like estimates for arbitrary complex subvarieties in Cd , but their exponent is far from
optimal. Finally, Dvir and Gopi [8] and the third author [29] considered incidences between points
and lines in Cd , for any d ≥ 3.
Asking for the curves to intersect transversely is rather restrictive; some of the simplest cases
such as incidences with circles or parabolas do not satisfy this requirement. If we do not require
that pairs of curves intersect transversely, then much less is known. Very recently, Solymosi and
de Zeeuw [23] proved a complex analog of Theorem 1.2, but only for the special case where the
point set is a Cartesian product A × B ⊂ C. This bound has already been used to prove several
results—see [20, 27].

1.2

New results

We obtain a complex analogue of Theorem 1.2, although our version introduces an ε loss in the
exponent.
Theorem 1.3. For each k ≥ 1, D ≥ 1, s ≥ 1, and ǫ > 0, there is a constant C = Cǫ,D,s,k so that
the following holds. Let P ⊂ C2 be a set of m points and let C be a set of n complex algebraic curves
of degree at most D. Suppose that (P, C) has k degrees of freedom and multiplicity type s. Then


I(P, C) ≤ C m 2k−1 +ε n 2k−1 + m + n .

Recently, Sharir and the third author obtained an improvement [22] to Theorem 1.1 whenever the curves are
algebraic.
2
That is, whenever two complex curves intersect at a smooth point of both curves, their complex tangent lines at
the point of intersection are distinct.

2

The new improvement is that Theorem 1.3 does not require the curves to intersect transversely.
The main new tool in the proof is the Picard–Lindelöf theorem.

2.1

Preliminaries
Varieties and ideals

In this paper we work over the fields R and C. Let K = R or C. Varieties are (possibly reducible)
Zariski closed subsets of K d . If X ⊂ K d is a set, let X be the Zariski closure of X; this is the
smallest variety in K d that contains X.
If Z ⊂ Rd is a variety, let Z ∗ ⊂ Cd be the smallest complex variety containing Z; i.e., Z ∗ is
obtained by embedding Z into Cd and then taking the Zariski closure. If Z ⊂ Cd , let Z(R) ⊂ Rd
be the set of real points of Z. We also identify C2 with R4 using the map ι(x1 + iy1 , x2 + iy2 ) =
(x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ) (where x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ∈ R). If C is a set of curves in C2 , we define ι(C) = {ι(γ) : γ ∈ C}.
If Z ⊂ K d is a variety, let I(Z) be the ideal of polynomials in K[x1 , . . . , xd ] that vanish on Z. If
I ⊂ K[x1 , . . . , xd ] is an ideal, let Z(I) ⊂ K d be the intersection of the zero-sets of all polynomials
in I. Sometimes it will be ambiguous whether an ideal is a subset of R[x1 , . . . , xd ] or C[x1 , . . . , xd ].
To help resolve this ambiguity, we will write ZR (I) or ZC (I). If P ∈ K[x1 , . . . , xd ] is a polynomial,
we abuse notation and write Z(P ) instead of Z((P )). If I ⊂ C[x1 , . . . , xd ] is an ideal, we use
√
I = I(Z(I)) to denote the radical of I.
Often in our arguments we will refer to properties that hold for most points on a variety. To
make this precise, we will introduce the notion of a generic point. Let Z ⊂ Cd be an irreducible
variety, and let M be a finite set of polynomials, none of which vanish on Z. We say that a point
z ∈ Z is generic (with respect to M ) if none of the polynomials in M vanish at z. In particular,
for Z and M fixed, the set of generic points of Z is Zariski dense in Z.
In practice, the set of polynomials will be apparent from context, so we will abuse notation and
simply refer to generic points. In general, the set of polynomials M will depend on the variety
Z, the points and curves from the statement of Theorem 1.3, any previously defined objects, and
whatever property is currently under consideration.
If Z(R) is Zariski dense in Z, then we define a generic real point of Z(R) to be a point z ∈ Z(R)
for which no polynomial in M vanishes. In particular, if Z(R) is dense in Z, then Z always contains
a generic real point.
Finally, we will sometimes refer to generic linear spaces or generic linear transformations. A
generic linear space of dimension ℓ in Cd is a generic point of the Grassmannian of ℓ-dimensional
vector spaces in Cd . Similarly, a generic linear transformation in Cd is a generic point of GL(C, d).
The degree of an irreducible affine variety V ⊂ Cd of dimension d′ is the number of points of the
intersection of V with a generic linear space of dimension d − d′ (for several equivalent definitions,
see [13, Chapter 18]). We define the degree of a reducible variety V as the sum of the degrees of
the irreducible components of V (note that these components may have different dimension). In
practice, we are only interested in showing that the degrees of various varieties are bounded, so the
specific definition of degree is not too important.
Lemma 2.1 (Varieties and their defining ideals). Let Z ⊂ Cd P
be a variety of degree C. Then there
exist polynomials f1 , . . . , fℓ such that (f1 , . . . , fℓ ) = I(X) and ℓj=1 deg fj = OC,d (1).

Proof. This is essentially [4, Theorem A.3]. In [4], P
the authors prove the weaker statement
that
p
there exists a set of polynomials g1p
, . . . , gt such that
deg gj = Od,C (1) and I(Z) = (g1 , . . . , gt ).
However, a set of generators for (g1 , . . . , gt ) can then be computed using Gröbner bases (see
e.g. [6] for an introduction to Gröbner bases). The key result is due to Dubé [7], which says that a
3

reduced Gröbner basis for (g1 , . . . , gt ) can be found (for any monomial
the sum
Pordering) such that
′
′
deg gj . Since C = Od,C (1),
of the degrees of the polynomials in the basis is Od,C ′ (1), where C =
we conclude that the sum of the degrees of the polynomials in the Gröbner
p basis is Od,C (1). Once
a Gröbner basis for (g1 , . . . , gt ) has been obtained, a set of generators for (g1 , . . . , gt ) can then be
computed (see e.g. [11, Section 9]).

2.2

Regular points, singular points, and smooth points

We will often refer to the dimension of an affine real algebraic variety. Informally, a real algebraic
variety X has dimension d′ if there exists a subset of X that is homeomorphic to the open d′ dimensional cube, but there does not exist a subset of X that is homeomorphic to the open (d′ + 1)dimensional cube. See [1] for a precise definition of the dimension of a real algebraic variety.
Let X ⊂ Rd be a variety of dimension d′ and let ζ ∈ X. We say that ζ is a smooth point of
X if there is a Euclidean neighborhood U ⊂ Rd containing ζ such that X ∩ U is a d′ -dimensional
embedded submanifold; for example, see [1, Section 3.3]. In this paper we only consider smooth
manifolds, and for brevity we refer to these simply as manifolds. Let Xsmooth be the set of smooth
points of X; then Xsmooth is a d′ -dimensional smooth manifold.
Similarly, let X ⊂ Cd be a variety of dimension d′ and let ζ ∈ X. We say that ζ is a smooth
point of X if there is a Euclidean neighborhood U ⊂ Cd containing ζ such that X ∩ U is a d′ dimensional embedded complex submanifold. Again, let Xsmooth be the set of smooth point of X;
then Xsmooth is a d′ -dimensional complex manifold.
Let X ⊂ Cd be a variety of pure dimension d′ (i.e., all irreducible components of X have
dimension d′ ), and let f1 , . . . , fℓ be polynomials that generate I(X). We say that ζ ∈ X is a regular
point of X if

Let Xreg be the set of regular points of X. If ζ ∈ X is not a regular point of X, then ζ is a singular
point of X. Let Xsing be the set of singular points of X.
Lemma 2.2 ([17], Corollary 1.26). Let X ⊂ Cd be a variety of pure dimension d′ . Then Xsmooth =
Xreg .
Lemma 2.3. Let X ⊂ Cd be a variety of degree C. Then Xsing is a variety of dimension strictly
smaller than dim(X), and deg(Xsing ) = OC,d (1).
P
Proof. By Lemma 2.1, there exist polynomials f1 , . . . , fℓ such that (f1 , . . . , fℓ ) = I(X) and ℓj=1 deg fj =
OC,d (1). We have

Equation (4) shows that Xsing can be written as the zero locus of Oℓ (1) = Od,C (1) polynomials,
each of degree Od,C (1). Thus Xsing is a variety of degree Od,C (1). It remains to prove that Xsing has
dimension strictly smaller than dim(X). This property can be found, for example, in [14, Chapter
I, Theorem 5.3].

Images of complex curves in a real variety

The goal of this section is to prove Lemma 3.2. In this lemma we consider a hypersurface V ⊂ R4 ,
and study the behavior of complex curves γ ⊂ C2 that satisfy ι(γ) ⊂ V .
Let M ⊆ Rn be a submanifold and ζ ∈ M a point. We identify the tangent space Tζ Rn with Rn
itself, so Tζ M becomes a linear subspace of Rn . Analogously, let N ⊆ Cn be a variety and x ∈ Nreg
a smooth point. Then we identify Tx Cn with the complex vector space Cn , and Tx N becomes a
complex linear subspace of Cn .
Let M be a d-dimensional smooth manifold. The tangent bundle T M is a 2d-dimensional
smooth manifold that is the disjoint union of the tangent spaces {Tζ }ζ∈M . Each element of the
tangent bundle can be identified with a pair (ζ, v), where ζ ∈ M and v ∈ Tζ M .
Let E ⊂ T M be a (d + d′ )-dimensional sub-manifold of T M . We say that E is a d′ -dimensional
sub-bundle of T M if for every ζ ∈ M , we have ({ζ} × Tζ M ) ∩ E = {ζ} × V , where V is a d′ dimensional vector subspace of Tζ M = Rd . We will call this subspace E(ζ) ⊂ Rd . Intuitively, the
vector space E(ζ) varies smoothly as the base-point ζ changes.
A vector field on M is a smooth function X : M → T M that assigns an element of Tζ M to each
point ζ ∈ M . We will abuse notation slightly and write X(ζ) = v to mean X(ζ) = (ζ, v) ∈ T M . If
E is a sub-bundle of T M and X : M → T M is a vector field, we say that X takes values in E if
X(ζ) ∈ E for all ζ ∈ M .
The following is a variant of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem (e.g., see [15]).
Theorem 3.1. Let X be a smooth vector field on a manifold M and ζ ∈ M a point where X(ζ) 6= 0.
Then for any sufficiently small ε > 0 there exists a unique smooth arc α : [−ε, ε] → M starting at
ζ whose tangent vectors are in X; that is, a unique arc α that solves the initial value problem

α(0) = ζ,
α̇(t) = X α(t) for all t ∈ [−ε, ε].
(5)
We are now ready to show that if Z is a bounded-degree hypersurface in R4 , then for a generic
point z ∈ Z there is at most one irreducible curve γ ⊂ C2 that satisfies z ∈ ι(γ) ⊂ Z.

Lemma 3.2. Let P ∈ R[x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ] be a polynomial of degree at most D. Then for every
p ∈ ZR (P )\ZC (P )sing , there is at most one irreducible complex curve γ ⊂ C2 with p ∈ ι(γreg )
and ι(γ) ⊂ ZR (P ).
Proof. We set M = ZR (P ) \ ZC (P )sing and note that M , if non-empty, is a three-dimensional
submanifold in R4 . The isomorphism ι carries the multiplication by i in C2 into the linear transformation
J : R4 → R4 ,
J(x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ) = (−y1 , x1 , −y2 , x2 ).

Notice that for any vector v ∈ R4 we have J(J(v)) = −v. Thus, for any linear subspace V ⊂ R4
we have J(J(V )) = V . Since J corresponds to multiplication by i in C2 , a linear subspace V
is J-invariant if and only if V = ι(V ′ ) for some complex subspace V ′ ≤ C2 . In particular, all
J-invariant subspaces are even dimensional.
For every point p ∈ M we define the linear subspace Ep = Tp M ∩ J −1 (Tp M ). Intuitively, Ep
is the largest subset of Tp M that is invariant under J. Since the linear subspace Tp M is threedimensional, it cannot be J-invariant. This implies that J −1 (Tp M ) is a different three-dimensional
subspace, and thus Ep is a two-dimensional linear subspace. As p varies, the union of the p × Ep
forms a two-dimensional sub-bundle E of the tangent bundle T M .
Fix a point p ∈ M , and choose a vector field X defined in an open neighbourhood U ⊆ M of
p which takes values in E, and X(p) 6= 0. By Theorem 3.1 there is a unique arc α : [−ε, ε] → γreg
that solves (5).
5

Consider an irreducible complex curve γ ⊂ C2 that satisfies ι(γ) ⊂ ZR (P ) and p ∈ ι(γreg ). For
any point q ∈ ι(γreg ) the tangent space Tι−1 (q) γ is a complex line in C2 , hence Tq ι(γ) = ι Tι−1 (q) γ)
is a J-invariant 2-plane in R4 which is contained in Tq M . This implies that Tq ι(γ) = Eq , so X(q)
is tangent to ι(γ). By applying Theorem 3.1 to the manifold ι(γreg ), and the restriction of X to
ι(γreg ), we obtain an arc β : [−ε′ , ε′ ] → ι(γreg ) that solves the same equation (5). While we might
get that ε′ 6= ε, the uniqueness of the solution implies that α and β must have a common sub-arc
α′ around p. Since α′ is an infinite set, the complex curve γ must be the Zariski closure of ι−1 (α′ ).
Suppose now that α′′ ⊂ α is any sub-arc around p such that the Zariski closure of ι−1 (α′′ ) is an
irreducible curve γ ′′ ⊂ C2 . By the above argument γ is the Zariski closure of ι−1 (α′ ∩ α′′ ), hence
γ = γ ′′ . This proves that γ, if exists, is uniquely determinded by α.

Proof of Theorem 1.3

We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.3. For the reader’s convenience we will restate it here.
Theorem 1.3. For each k ≥ 1, D ≥ 1, s ≥ 1, and ǫ > 0, there is a constant C = Cǫ,D,s,k such
that the following holds. Let P ⊂ C2 be a set of m points and let C be a set of n complex algebraic
curves of degree at most D. Suppose that (P, C) has k degrees of freedom and multiplicity type s.
Then

2k−2
k
I(P, C) ≤ C m 2k−1 +ε n 2k−1 + m + n .
Proof. We will make crucial use of the Guth-Katz polynomial partitioning technique from [12,
Theorem 4.1].

Theorem 4.1. Let P be a set of m points in Rd . For each r ≥ 1, there exists a polynomial P of
degree at most r such that Rd \Z(P ) is a union of O(r d ) connected components (cells), and each
cell contains O(m/r d ) points of P.
Since the curves of C have k degrees of freedom, the Kővári-Sós-Turán theorem (e.g., see [16,
Section 4.5]) implies I(P, C) = O(mn1−1/k + n). When m = O(n1/k ), this implies the bound
I(P, C) = O(n). Thus, we may assume that
 
(6)
n = O mk .
We will prove by induction on m + n that
k

2k−2

I(P, C) ≤ α1 m 2k−1 +ε n 2k−1 + α2 (m + n),
where α1 , α2 are sufficiently large constants. The base case where m + n is small can be handled
by choosing sufficiently large values of α1 and α2 . In practice, we will bound I(ι(P), ι(C)). Since
ι : C2 → R4 is a bijection, I(P, C) = I(ι(P), ι(C)).
Partitioning R4 . Let P be a partitioning polynomial of degree at most r, as described in Theorem
4.1. The constant r is taken to be sufficiently large, as described below. The asymptotic relations
between the various constants in the proof are
21/ε ≪ r ≪ α2 ≪ α1 .
Let Ω1 , . . . , Ωℓ be the cells of the partition; we have ℓ = O(r 4 ). Let Vi be the set of varieties
from ι(C) that intersect
such that ι(p) ∈ Ωi .

Incidences on the partitioning hypersurface. It remains to bound incidences with points
that are on the partitioning hypersurface Z(P ). To do this, we will make use of the point-curve
bound from Theorem 1.2.
Lemma 4.2. Let P ⊂ C2 . Let C be a set of complex curves of degree at most C0 such that (P, C)
has k degrees of freedom and multiplicity type s. Let Y ⊂ C4 be an algebraic variety of degree at
most C1 . Suppose that for each γ ∈ C, the intersection ι(γ) ∩ Y (R) is a real algebraic variety of
dimension at most one. Then
I(ι(P) ∩ Y (R), ι(C)) = O(|P|k/(2k−1) |C|(2k−2)/(2k−1) + |P| + |C|),

(8)

where the implicit constant depends on k, s, C0 , and C1 .
Proof. Let π : R4 → R2 be a generic linear transformation (see Section 2.1). Then for each γ ∈ C,
π(ι(γ) ∩ Y (R)) ⊂ R2 is the zero set of a non-zero polynomial of degree OC0 ,C1 (1) (e.g., see [24,
Section 5.1]); each set of this form is a union of plane curves and a finite set of points.

7


Let Γ = {π ι(γ) ∩ Y (R) : γ ∈ C}. Then Γ is a finite
 set of (not necessarily irreducible) plane
algebraic curves and isolated points, and π(ι(P)), Γ has k degrees of freedom and multiplicity
type Os,C0 ,C1 (1).
By Theorem 1.2,
I(π(ι(P)), Γ) = O(|P|k/(2k−1) |C|(2k−2)/(2k−1) + |P| + |C|),

(9)

where the implicit constant depends on k, s, C0 , and C1 . Since each incidence in I(ι(P)∩Y (R), ι(C))
appears as an incidence in I(π(ι(P)), Γ), (9) implies (8).
We are now ready to bound the number of incidences involving points lying on ZR (P ). Let
P0 = ι(P) ∩ ZR (P ), let m0 = |P0 | = m − m′ , and let C0 = {γ ∈ C : ι(γ) ⊂ ZR (P )}. By Lemma 2.3,
for each γ ∈ C, we have that ι(γ)sing = ι(γsing ) is a finite set of size OD (1), hence
|{(p, γ) ∈ P0 × C : ι(p) ∈ ι(γ)sing }| = OD (n).

(10)

Let Y be the real part of ZC (P )sing . We apply Lemma 3.2 to P , to obtain
|{(p, γ) ∈ P0 × C0 : ι(p) ∈ ZR (P )\Y, ι(p) ∈ ι(γ)reg }| ≤ m0 .

(11)

Lemma 2.3 implies that ZC (P )sing is a variety of degree Or (1) and dimension at most two. This
in turn implies that Or (1) varieties of the form ι(γ) are contained in Y . Thus
|{(p, γ) ∈ P0 × C0 : ι(p) ∈ ι(γ)reg , ι(γ) ⊂ Y }| = Or (m0 ).

(12)

Let C ′ = C \ C0 . It remains to control the size of the sets
{(p, γ) ∈ P0 × C ′ : ι(p) ∈ ι(γ)reg }
and
{(p, γ) ∈ P0 × C0 : ι(γ) 6⊂ Y, ι(p) ∈ (ι(γ)reg ∩ Y )}.
By Lemma 4.2, both of these sets have size
k/(2k−1) (2k−2)/(2k−1)

O(m0

+ m0 + n).

(13)

Combining (10), (11), (12), and (13) implies

I(P0 , ι(C)) = O(m0

n

+ m0 + n).

Taking α1 , α2 to be sufficiently large with respect to the constant of the O-notation, we have
I(ι(P) ∩ ZR (P ), ι(C)) ≤

α1 k/(2k−1) (2k−2)/(2k−1)

+ α2 (m0 + n).

Combining (14) and (7) completes the induction.
