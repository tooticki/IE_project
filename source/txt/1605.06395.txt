Abstract. We give new characterizations to ensure that a free product of groups with
amalgamation has a simple reduced group C ∗ -algebra, and provide a concrete example
of an amalgam with trivial kernel, such that its reduced group C ∗ -algebra has a unique
tracial state, but is not simple.
Moreover, we show that there is a radical class of groups for which the reduced group C ∗ algebra of any group is simple precisely when the group has a trivial radical corresponding
to this class.

1. Introduction
Groups have been among the most studied objects in connection with operator algebras,
and one of the natural questions to consider in this regard is whether group C ∗ -algebras are
simple. While full group C ∗ -algebras can never be simple (unless the group is trivial), the
problem for reduced group C ∗ -algebras has been of great interest ever since the work of Powers
[28], showing that nonabelian free groups have a simple reduced group C ∗ -algebra. Larger
classes of groups with properties similar to the one Powers described were later studied, and
several results and open problems on this topic are discussed by de la Harpe [18].
Recall that a discrete group G is called C ∗ -simple if its reduced group C ∗ -algebra Cr∗ (G)
is simple, and G is said to have the unique trace property if Cr∗ (G) has a unique tracial
state. A long-standing open problem was whether the two properties were equivalent, but
fairly recently it has been shown that C ∗ -simplicity is strictly stronger than the unique trace
property. The “stronger” part is due to Breuillard, Kalantar, Kennedy, and Ozawa [7, 22]
and the “strictly” part is due to Le Boudec [5]. The former showed that the unique trace
property is equivalent to having a trivial amenable radical, a property already known to be
weaker than C ∗ -simplicity, see [18]. Both of the works [7, 22] use extensively the theory of
boundary actions developed by Furstenberg and Hamana. Even more recently, some other
more operator-theoretical characterizations have been obtained by Haagerup [15] and Kennedy
[23]. However, the conditions from [15, 23] that are equivalent with C ∗ -simplicity, are not
always easy to check in concrete situations, for example by combinatorial group properties.
We also note that the unique trace property for G always implies that G is icc, that is, every
nontrivial conjugacy class in G is infinite, and it is well-known that the group von Neumann
algebra associated to G is a factor if and only if G is icc.
The problem of finding conditions to ensure that a free product of groups with amalgamation
is C ∗ -simple was first considered by Bédos [1], and mentioned as Problem 27 in [18].
In this article, we first make a detailed study of amalgamated free products, inspired by
work of de la Harpe and Préaux [20]. By making use of a few new observations, we are able
to improve some of the results in [20]. Then we present in Section 4 a concrete example of an
amalgam that has the unique trace property, but is not C ∗ -simple.

In particular, our example shows that a free product with amalgamation can fail to be
C ∗ -simple when it has a trivial kernel, but has “one-sided” kernels that are nontrivial (and
amenable). Every amalgam G0 ∗H G1 acts on its Bass-Serre tree, and in this setup the
one-sided kernels consist of the elements that fix all vertices of the “half-trees” obtained by
removing the edge corresponding to H. This has similarities with [5].
We keep the first sections mostly to “elementary” proofs, restricting to combinatorial group
properties, and delay the involvement of boundary actions to Section 5.
In the final two sections, we first recall the definitions of radical and residual classes of
groups and prove several statements that will be of later use. The result of [7] implies that
the class of groups with the unique trace property is the residual class “dual” to the radical
class of amenable groups. We then show that the class of C ∗ -simple groups is also a residual
class, giving rise to a “predual” radical class of groups that contains all the amenable groups,
and we will call a group “amenablish” if it belongs to this class. The example we provide
of an amalgam that is not C ∗ -simple, but has the unique trace property, turns out to be a
(nonamenable) amenablish group. Moreover, for every group there is an amenablish radical
such that C ∗ -simplicity of the group is equivalent to this radical being trivial, giving an analog
of the relation between the amenable radical and the unique trace property.
2. Preliminaries
We consider only discrete groups in this article.
Let G be a group. As usual, we equip the Hilbert space `2 (G) with the standard orthonormal
basis {δg }g∈G , and define the left regular representation λ of G on `2 (G) by λ(g)δh = δgh .
Then the reduced group C ∗ -algebra of G, denoted by Cr∗ (G), is the C ∗ -subalgebra of B(`2 (G))
generated by λ(G). The group G is called C ∗ -simple if Cr∗ (G) is simple, that is, if it has no
nontrivial proper two-sided closed ideals.
A state on a unital C ∗ -algebra A is a linear functional φ : A → C that is positive, i.e.,
φ(a) ≥ 0 whenever a ∈ A and a ≥ 0, and unital, i.e., φ(1) = 1. A state φ is called tracial if it
satisfies the additional property that φ(ab) = φ(ba) for all a, b ∈ A. There is a canonical faithful
tracial state τ on Cr∗ (G), namely the vector state associated with δe , that is, τ (a) = haδe , δe i
for all a ∈ Cr∗ (G). The group G is said to have the unique trace property if τ is the only tracial
state on Cr∗ (G).
Recall that a group G is amenable if there exists a state on `∞ (G) which is invariant under
the left translation action by G. It is explained by Day [10] that every group G has a unique
maximal normal amenable subgroup, called the amenable radical of G. Then [7, Theorem 1.3]
shows that G has the unique trace property if and only if the amenable radical of G is trivial,
so C ∗ -simplicity is stronger than the unique trace property by [18, Proposition 3].
The first larger class of groups that were shown to be C ∗ -simple with the unique trace
property, was the so-called Powers groups introduced by de la Harpe [17] (see also [19]).
Definition 2.1. A group G is called a Powers group if for any finite subset F of G \ {e} and
any integer k ≥ 1 there exists a partition G = D t E and elements g1 , g2 , . . . , gk in G such
that
f D ∩ D = ∅ for all f ∈ F,
gi E ∩ gj E = ∅ for all distinct 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k.
Moreover, a group G is called a weak Powers group if it satisfies the above definition for
all finite sets F that are contained in a nontrivial conjugacy class. Finally, G is called a
weak∗ Powers group if it satisfies the above definition for all nontrivial one-element sets F .
Clearly, every Powers group is a weak Powers group and every weak Powers group is a
weak∗ Powers group. It is known that the weak Powers property implies C ∗ -simplicity [3],
while the weak∗ Powers property implies the unique trace property [31, Section 5.2].

Lemma 2.2. Assume that N is a normal subgroup of a group G. If G is a Powers group,
then N is a Powers group. If G is a weak Powers group, then N is a weak Powers group. If
G is a weak∗ Powers group, then N is a weak∗ Powers group.
Proof. The first statement is a (seemingly unnoticed) result by Kim [24, Theorem 1], and the
last two statements are identically proven. For the convenience of the reader, we present the
argument of the middle one:
Let k ≥ 1, and suppose that F is a finite set and C 0 a nontrivial conjugacy class in N such
that F ⊆ C 0 . If two elements are conjugate in N they are also conjugate in G, so there is a
nontrivial conjugacy class C in G such that F ⊆ C. Since G is weak Powers, there exists a
partition G = D t E and g1 , g2 , . . . , gk such that f D ∩ D = ∅ for all f ∈ F and gi E ∩ gj E = ∅
whenever i 6= j.
If k = 1, set D0 = {e}, E 0 = N \ {e}, and s1 = e.
If k ≥ 2, set D0 = D ∩ N and E 0 = E ∩ N , so N = D0 t E 0 and f D0 ∩ D0 ⊆ f D ∩ D = ∅
for all f ∈ F .
Furthermore, fix an f ∈ F and note that the sets g1−1 gi E are mutually disjoint for i ≥ 1,
so that in particular, for i ≥ 2, then g1−1 gi E ∩ E = ∅, i.e., g1−1 gi E ⊆ G \ E = D. This again
implies that f g1−1 gi E ∩ D ⊆ f D ∩ D = ∅, so f g1−1 gi E ⊆ G \ D = E.
Set s1 = e and si = g1−1 gi f gi−1 g1 for i ≥ 2. Since N is normal in G, we have si ∈ N for all
i, and if i 6= j, then
si E 0 ∩ sj E 0 = g1−1 gi f gi−1 g1 E 0 ∩ g1−1 gj f gj−1 g1 E 0 ⊆ g1−1 gi f gi−1 g1 E ∩ g1−1 gj f gj−1 g1 E
⊆ g1−1 gi E ∩ g1−1 gj E = ∅.
Kim also proves that D0 and E 0 are nonempty, but that does not seem to be necessary.

In [20] a group is said to be “strongly Powers” if every subnormal subgroup is a Powers
group. A consequence of the above lemma is that the notion of strongly Powers coincides with
Powers.
We conclude this section by mentioning two definitions. First, a group G has the free
semigroup property if for any finite subset F of G there exists g in G such that gF is semifree,
that is, the subsemigroup generated by gF in G is free over gF . Finally, a group G is said to
have stable rank one if its reduced group C ∗ -algebra has stable rank one, that is, the invertible
elements of Cr∗ (G) are dense in Cr∗ (G).
3. Free products of groups with amalgamation
Recall that (see e.g. [30]) a free product of groups G0 and G1 with amalgamation over a
common subgroup H (embedded via injective homomorphisms H → Gi for i = 0, 1) is a group
G together with homomorphisms φi : Gi → G for i = 0, 1, that agree on H, universal in the
sense that for any other group G0 with homomorphisms φ0i : Gi → G0 that agree on H, there
is a unique homomorphism φ : G → G0 such that φ0i = φ ◦ φi .
The amalgamated free products G = G0 ∗H G1 that we consider in this article are always
assumed to be nondegenerate in the sense that ([G0 : H] − 1) · ([G1 : H] − 1) ≥ 2, otherwise
the situation is T
very different.
Let ker G = g∈G gHg −1 denote the kernel of the amalgam. It coincides with the normal
core of H in G, i.e., the largest subgroup of H which is normal in G (and thus in G0 and G1 ).
If N is any subgroup of H which is normal in G, then the quotient G/N is isomorphic to
(G0 /N ) ∗H/N (G1 /N ). In particular, this holds when N = ker G. Note that we always have
ker(G/ ker G) = {e}. Indeed, if ker(G/ ker G) = N ⊆ H/ ker G, let N 0 be the inverse image
of N under the quotient map G → G/ ker G. Then N 0 is a normal subgroup of G containing
ker G and sitting inside H, so we must have N 0 = ker G by maximality of ker G.

If G is nondegenerate, then G/ ker G is nondegenerate, as [Gi : H] = [Gi / ker G : H/ ker G].
Let F C(G) denote the normal subgroup of G consisting of elements with finite conjugacy
class in G. Clearly, if g ∈ Gi \ H, then the conjugacy class of g in G must be infinite. Hence,
F C(G) is contained in H.
Let now AR(G) denote the amenable radical of G and let N F (G) denote the largest normal
subgroup of G that does not contain any nonabelian free subgroup. By [9, Proposition 7],
these groups fit in general into a sequence of subgroups, namely
(1)

F C(G) ⊆ AR(G) ⊆ N F (G) ⊆ ker G ⊆ H.

In particular, N F (G) ( G, so G always contains a nonabelian free group. Moreover, there is
an even longer sequence
F C(G) ⊆ F C(ker G) ⊆ AR(ker G) = AR(G) ⊆ N F (G) = N F (ker G) ⊆ ker G.
The first containment is clear, the second holds since F C(ker G) is an amenable normal
subgroup of ker G, and the two equalities follow from Examples 6.4, 6.6, and Lemma 6.7.
If H is finite, then F C(G) = ker G, so the sequence collapses. Indeed, if h ∈ ker G, then
h ∈ gHg −1 for all g ∈ G, so g −1 hg ∈ H for all g ∈ G. Hence, the conjugacy class of h is
contained in H, which is finite, so h ∈ F C(G). See Theorem 3.7 for more on this case.
Proposition 3.1. A nondegenerate amalgamated free product G has the unique trace property
if and only if ker G has the unique trace property.
Proof. Since AR(G) = AR(ker G) as explained above, this follows from [7, Theorem 1.3]. 
Let us now recall the normal form for an element in G. First, for i = 0, 1, we choose sets Si
so that Si ∪{e} form systems of representatives for the left cosets of Gi /H. Then every element
of G can be written uniquely as either s0 s1 · · · sn−1 sn h or s1 · · · sn−1 sn h, where si ∈ Si (mod 2)
and h ∈ H. To avoid division into separate cases, the notation (s0 )s1 s2 · · · sn−1 sn h for the
normal form of an element of G is often used, especially in Section 5.
Since we will not always assume that elements are on normal form, the following observation
is sometimes useful: for i = 0, 1, if gi ∈ Gi \ H and h ∈ H, then there exists gi0 ∈ Gi \ H such
that gi h = hgi0 . In other words, we can “cycle” a letter from H through a word (g0 )g1 · · · gn
in G, with gi ∈ Gi (mod 2) \ H, without changing the length of the word.
Let G be any nondegenerate free product with amalgamation. We decompose G as follows.
For j = 0, 1 and k ≥ 1, let
Tj,k = {g0 · · · gk−1 : gi ∈ Gi+j (mod 2) \ H},
i.e., Tj,k consists of all words of length k starting with a letter from Gj \ H. To simplify
notation, we set T0,0 = T1,0 = H. For j = 0, 1 and every k ≥ 0, we now define the set
\
(2)
Cj,k =
gHg −1 ,
g∈Tj,k

and note that C0,0 = C1,0 = H and that H ∩ Cj,k is always a normal subgroup of H. Then
\
ker G =
Cj,k ,
k≥0
j=0,1

which, as mentioned above, is always normal in G. Next, we set
\
\
(3)
K0 =
C0,k and K1 =
C1,k .

Both K0 and K1 are normal subgroups of H. Remark that it actually follows that

Indeed, if h ∈
/ K0 , then g −1 hg ∈
/ H for some g ∈ T0,n with n ≥ 1. If n is odd, take any
g1 ∈TG1 \ H, and note that gg1 ∈ T0,n+1 and g1−1 g −1 hgg1 ∈
/ H, so h ∈
/ gg1 Hg1−1 g −1 , hence,
h∈
/ k≥0 C0,2k . A similar argument works for K1 .
Moreover, it should be clear that ker G = K0 ∩ K1 and that
\
\
(5)
K0 = H ∩
g0 K1 g0−1 and K1 = H ∩
g1 K0 g1−1 .
g0 ∈G0 \H

g1 ∈G1 \H

If K0 = ker G, then K1 ⊆ ker G since ker G is normal, so K0 = K1 (similarly if K1 = ker G).
Also, we have that K0 = {e} if and only if K1 = {e}.
Finally, using the notation from [20, (i) p. 2-3] we set
\
(6)
Ck =
Cj,n .
0≤n≤k
j=0,1

Note that for any g ∈ T0,k+1 , we have K0 ⊆ gCk g −1 , and for any g ∈ T1,k+1 , we have
K1 ⊆ gCk g −1 . Thus, if Ck is trivial for some k ≥ 0, then K0 = K1 = {e}. Indeed, pick k ≥ 0,
g ∈ T0,k+1 , h ∈ K0 , and let s be an arbitrary element of length ≤ k. Then gs ∈ T0,n for some
n ≥ 1, so h ∈ gsHs−1 g −1 . Since, this holds for all such s, we have h ∈ gCk g −1 .
Moreover, it is worth noticing the difference between K0 , K1 , and Ck :
• the intersections defining the Ck ’s involve conjugation of elements of finite length
(bounded by some k), while the first letter of the words can come from any of G0 , G1 .
• the intersections defining the Ki ’s involve conjugation of elements of arbitrary length,
where the first letter of the words comes from the same group.
Theorem 3.2. Let G = G0 ∗H G1 be a nondegenerate free product with amalgamation, and
let K0 , K1 be as defined above. Then the following are equivalent:
(i) K0 = K1 = {e}.
(ii) for every finite F ⊆ G \ {e}, there exists g ∈ G such that gF g −1 ∩ H = ∅.
(iii) for every finite F ⊆ H \ {e}, there exists g ∈ G such that gF g −1 ∩ H = ∅.
Moreover, any one of these equivalent conditions implies that G is a Powers group and has
the free semigroup property.
Proof. It is obvious that (ii) implies (iii).
To see that (iii) implies (i) suppose first that ker G 6= {e}. Then pick f ∈ ker G \ {e} and
set F = {f } and clearly gf g −1 ∈ H for all g ∈ G, i.e., gf g −1 ∈ gF g −1 ∩ H. Next, assume
that ker G = {e}, but K0 =
6 K1 . Recall from (5) and the subsequent note that this means
both K0 6= {e} and K1 6= {e}. Thus we pick fi ∈ Ki \ {e} for i = 0, 1 and set F = {f0 , f1 }.
Let g ∈ G be arbitrary. If g ∈ H there is nothing to show, so assume that g ends with a letter
from Gi \ H. But then gfi g −1 ∈ H, i.e., gfi g −1 ∈ gF g −1 ∩ H.
Finally we prove that (i) implies (ii). Choose an arbitrary finite set F ⊆ G \ {e}. The idea
is to conjugate the elements from F out of H one by one, and at the same time make sure we
do not conjugate any elements back into H.
Assume first there is an element f1 ∈ F ∩ H (else there is nothing to show). Because K0 is
trivial, then (4) means that all elements in H can be conjugated out of H by an element of
even length starting with a letter from G0 \ H. That is, we can find r1 = g0 g1 · · · g2n1 −1 such
that gi ∈ Gi (mod 2) \ H and r1−1 f1 r1 ∈
/ H.
Next, consider the set F1 = {r1−1 f r1 : f ∈ F }. Assume that there is an element f2 ∈ F ,
0
so that r1−1 f2 r1 ∈ H (otherwise we are done). Then there exists r2 = g00 g10 · · · g2n
such
2 −1
−1 −1

0
that gi ∈ Gi (mod 2) \ H and r2 r1 f2 r1 r2 ∈

Indeed, let j be the smallest number such that gj · · · g0 f1 g0 · · · gj ∈

Gj (mod 2) \ H = Tj (mod 2),1 . Then gj+1
gj · · · g0−1 f g0 · · · gj gj+1 ∈ Tj+1 (mod 2),3 , and as we

continue to conjugate by elements alternating between G0 \ H and G1 \ H this product will
only increase in length.
Now we set F2 = {r2−1 r1−1 f r1 r2 : f ∈ F }. If all elements of F2 are outside H we are done,
so assume that there is some f3 ∈ F such that r2−1 r1−1 f3 r1 r2 ∈ H.
It should be clear how this process continues, and since F is finite, we take r to be the
product of the ri ’s, and then r−1 f r ∈
/ H for every f ∈ F .
The last two observations follow from [17, Proposition 10] and [13, Example 4.4 (iii),(iv),
and Remark 4.5].

Remark 3.3. The above result shows that [20, Theorem 3 (i)] can be slightly improved, as
Lemma 2.2 shows that “strongly Powers” is the same as Powers. In fact, using the comment
following (6), one can replace “Ck = {e} for some k” with any of the equivalent properties of
Theorem 3.2. Additionally, the countability assumption is no longer needed.
We will come back to the geometric interpretation of K0 and K1 in Section 5. In particular,
Proposition 5.3 below gives more properties equivalent to those in Theorem 3.2.
Remark 3.4. In Section 4, we give an explicit example of a group Γ for which ker Γ = {e},
while K0 and K1 are both nontrivial. We show that the group has the unique trace property, but
is not C ∗ -simple. This gives a counterexample to the first author’s statement [21, Corollary 4.7],
which the second author noticed to be incorrect.
Proposition 3.5. If G is countable, H is amenable, and K0 or K1 is nontrivial, then G is
not C ∗ -simple.
This result is generalized in Theorem 5.9 below, but in the context of recent works, we
provide two other short proofs of the statement.
First proof. We will show that H is recurrent in G in the sense of [23, Definition 5.1]. Let
(gn ) be a sequence in G. Then at least one of the following holds:
(a) infinitely many elements from (gn ) belong to H
(b) infinitely many elements from (gn ) start with a letter from G0 \ H
(c) infinitely many elements from (gn ) start with a letter from G1 \ H
Pick a subsequence T
(gnk ) of (gn ) with elements from theTone of (a),(b),(c) that holds. If
it is (a) then H = k gnk Hgn−1
, if it is (b) then K0 ⊆ k gnk Hgn−1
, and if it is (c) then
k
k
T
−1
K1 ⊆ k gnk Hgnk . If one of K0 and K1 is nontrivial, then both the other one and H are
nontrivial as well. Hence, it follows from [23, Theorem 1.1] that G is not C ∗ -simple.

Second proof. If K0 = ker G, then K1 = ker G by the comment following (5). Thus, by
assumption, ker G is a nontrivial normal amenable subgroup of G, and hence G cannot be
C ∗ -simple. The similar argument holds if K1 = ker G, so we may assume that both K0 and
K1 are different from ker G.
Choose a ∈ K0 \ ker G and b ∈ K1 \ ker G. Then
{gH : gH 6= agH} ⊆ {gH : g ∈ T1,k for some k ≥ 1}

and

{gH : gH 6= bgH} ⊆ {gH : g ∈ T0,k for some k ≥ 1},
which are clearly disjoint. By using the technique from [16, Proposition 5.8], explained in [27,
p. 12], the action of G on G/H gives rise to a unitary representation π : G → `2 (G/H), that
extends to a continuous representation of Cr∗ (G). It follows that (1 − λ(a))(1 − λ(b)) generates
a proper two-sided closed ideal of Cr∗ (G). Hence, G is not C ∗ -simple.

Example 3.6. For any triple of groups H, G0 , and G1 , we have
∼ (G0 ∗ G1 ) × H.
G = (G0 × H) ∗H (H × G1 ) =

In this case H = ker G = K0 = K1 , and G is C ∗ -simple if and only if H is C ∗ -simple. In
particular, this means that G can be C ∗ -simple even if ker G is nontrivial.
We now consider the special case where H is finite.
Theorem 3.7. Let G = G0 ∗H G1 be a nondegenerate free product with amalgamation, and
assume that H is finite.
Then the following are equivalent:
(i) G is icc
(ii) ker G = {e}
(iii) K0 = K1 = {e}
(iv) G is Powers
(v) G is C ∗ -simple
(vi) G has the unique trace property
(vii) there exists g ∈ G such that H ∩ gHg −1 = {e}
(viii) G has the free semigroup property
Proof. (i) =⇒ (ii): Since ker G ⊆ H, it is a finite normal subgroup of G, so it must be trivial
when G is icc.
(ii) =⇒ (iii): Let Ck be defined as in (6), so that ker G is the intersection of the decreasing
chain C0 ⊇ C1 ⊇ C2 ⊇ · · · . Since all the Ck ’s are subgroups of H, they are finite, so if
ker G = {e}, we must have Ck = {e} for some k. Hence, the remark following (6) explains
that K0 = K1 = {e}.
(iii) =⇒ (iv) follows from Theorem 3.2.
(iv) =⇒ (v) =⇒ (vi) =⇒ (i) is known to hold for all groups.
(iii) =⇒ (vii) is also a consequence of Theorem 3.2, by taking F = H \ {e}.
(vii) =⇒ (viii) follows from [13, Proposition 5.1].
(viii) =⇒ (ii): If H is finite and ker G 6= {e}, then there is no g ∈ G such that g ker G is
semifree, i.e., G does not have the free semigroup property.

Remark 3.8. If G is an amalgam with finite H satisfying the equivalent conditions of
Theorem 3.7, then G has stable rank one by [13, Theorem 1.6] (where the argument is based
on [12, Corollary 3.9] for trivial H). However, there also exists amalgams G with finite H
such that G has stable rank one, but G does not satisfy the conditions of Theorem 3.7, as
explained in the paragraph following [13, Theorem 1.6].
Moreover, it follows from condition (vii) and [21, Corollary 3.6] that for G = G0 ∗H G1 , the
positive cone of the K0 -group of Cr∗ (G) is not perforated, i.e.,
K0 (Cr∗ (G))+ = {γ ∈ K0 (Cr∗ (G)) : K0 (τ )(γ) > 0} ∪ {0},
where τ is the canonical tracial state on Cr∗ (G). Indeed, the assumption K1 (Cr∗ (H)) = 0 is
easily seen to hold from the fact that for a finite group H, Cr∗ (H) is a direct sum of matrix
algebras and those have trivial K1 -groups.
4. An example
In this section ⊕, when applied to indices, will denote summation modulo 2, and N will
denote the positive integers.
The group Γ = G0 ∗H G1 is defined as follows: first H is given by the set of generators
{h(i1 , i2 , . . . , in ) : n ∈ N and ik ∈ {0, 1} for all k ∈ {1, . . . , n}},
with the relations
h(i1 , i2 , . . . , in )2 = e for all n ∈ N, k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, and ik ∈ {0, 1},

and for n ≥ k
h(i1 , . . . , ik )h(j1 , . . . , jn )h(i1 , . . . , ik ) =
(
h(j1 , . . . , jk , jk+1 ⊕ 1, . . . , jn ) if n > k and i` = j` for all 1 ≤ ` ≤ k,
h(j1 , . . . , jk , jk+1 , . . . , jn )
otherwise.
Then define
Γ = hH ∪ {g0 , g1 }i,
with the additional relations
g02 = g12 = e,

(g0 h(1))3 = e,

g0 h(1, 0, i3 , . . . , in )g0 = h(0, i3 , . . . , in ),

(g1 h(0))3 = e,

g0 h(1, 1, i3 , . . . , in )g0 = h(1, 1, i3 , . . . , in ),

g1 h(0, 0, i3 , . . . , in )g1 = h(0, 0, i3 , . . . , in ),

g1 h(0, 1, i3 , . . . , in )g1 = h(1, i3 , . . . , in ).

Finally, let
G0 = hH ∪ {g0 }i and G1 = hH ∪ {g1 }i,
so that Γ = G0 ∗H G1 . Note also that
H = h{h(0, . . . , 0), n ∈ N} ∪ {h(1, 0, . . . , 0 ), n ∈ N}i.

Lemma 4.1. For every g ∈ G0 \H, there exists h ∈ H such that either g = g0 h or g = h(1)g0 h,
and for every g ∈ G1 \ H, there exists h ∈ H such that either g = g1 h or g = h(0)g1 h.
Consequently, [G0 : H] = [G1 : H] = 3, and the sets
(7)

S0 = {g0 , h(1)g0 }

and

S1 = {g1 , h(0)g1 }.

provide representatives for the nontrivial left cosets of G0 /H and G1 /H, respectively.
Proof. First, if h is one of the generators of H and h 6= h(1), then the defining relations above
show that there exists an h0 such that hg0 = g0 h0 . Moreover, for h ∈ H, with h =
6 h(1), we
have hh(1) = h(1) · h(1)hh(1) = h(1)h0 for some h0 =
6 h(1), that is, we can move the h(1)’s
to the left in the product. Hence, for any element g = (g0 )h1 g0 h2 g0 · · · g0 hn (g0 ) ∈ G0 , where
hi ∈ H, we can combine the two observations above to find the required h.
A similar argument holds in G1 .

Let us now denote the subgroups of H with elements determined by a prescribed start by
H(j1 , . . . , j` ) = h{h(j1 , . . . , j` , i`+1 , . . . , in ) : n ∈ N, n ≥ `, i`+1 , . . . , in ∈ {0, 1}}i
and the subgroups of H(j1 , . . . , j` ) of elements having arguments of minimum length k by
Hk (j1 , . . . , j` ) = h{h(j1 , . . . , j` , i`+1 , . . . , in ) : n ∈ N, n ≥ k ≥ `, i`+1 , . . . , in ∈ {0, 1}}i.
Remark 4.2. Let i, j be two sequences such that h(i) and h(j) commute. For any k, ` greater
than the respective lengths of i, j, we have
hHk (i) ∪ H` (j)i = Hk (i)H` (j) = H` (j)Hk (i).
Let k ≥ 1 and note that g0 h(1)g0 ∈
/ H. By using the defining relations for Γ, we compute
g0 Hk (0)g0 = Hk+1 (1, 0)
h(1)g0 Hk (0)g0 h(1) = h(1)Hk+1 (1, 0)h(1) = Hk+1 (1, 1)
H ∩ g0 H(1)g0 = H(0)H(1, 1)
H ∩ h(1)g0 H(1)g0 h(1) = h(1)(H ∩ g0 H(1)g0 )h(1) = h(1)H(0)H(1, 1)h(1) = H(0)H(1, 0),

and then
H ∩ g0 Hg0 = H(0)H2 (1)
H ∩ h(1)g0 Hg0 h(1) = h(1)(H ∩ g0 Hg0 )h(1) = h(1)H(0)H2 (1)h(1) = H(0)H2 (1).
Finally,

H ∩ g0 Hk (0)H(1)g0 = g0 Hk (0)g0 H ∩ g0 H(1)g0 = Hk+1 (1, 0)H(0)H(1, 1),
where the first equality follows from Dedekind’s modular law for groups, and
H ∩ h(1)g0 Hk (0)H(1)g0 h(1) = h(1)(H ∩ g0 Hk (0)H(1)g0 )h(1)
= h(1)Hk+1 (1, 0)H(0)H(1, 1)h(1) = Hk+1 (1, 1)H(0)H(1, 0).
Similarly,
H ∩ g1 Hg1 = H ∩ h(0)g1 Hg1 h(0) = H(1)H2 (0)
H ∩ g1 H(0)Hk (1)g1 = Hk+1 (0, 1)H(1)H(0, 0)
H ∩ h(0)g1 H(0)Hk (1)g1 h(0) = Hk+1 (0, 0)H(1)H(0, 1).
Lemma 4.3. We have K0 = H(0), K1 = H(1), and ker Γ = K0 ∩ K1 = H(0) ∩ H(1) = {e}.
Proof. We use the notation for Cj,k from (2), so that C0,0 = C1,0 = H, and remark that for
every j, k we have
\
\
C0,k+1 =
gC1,k g −1 and C1,k+1 =
gC0,k g −1 .
g∈G0 \H

g∈G1 \H

In the following we will make use of Remark 4.2, the coset representatives from (7), and the
fact that every Cj,k is invariant under conjugation by elements of H. We compute that
\
H ∩ C0,1 = H ∩
gHg −1 = H ∩ g0 Hg0 ∩ h(1)g0 Hg0 h(1) = H(0)H2 (1)
g∈G0 \H

and
H ∩ C1,1 = H ∩

\

gHg −1 = H ∩ g1 Hg1 ∩ h(0)g1 Hg1 h(0) = H(1)H2 (0).

g∈G1 \H

Theorem 4.4. The group Γ defined above has the unique trace property, but is not C ∗ -simple.
Proof. By Lemma 4.3 we have ker Γ = {e}, so Proposition 3.1 gives that Γ has the unique
trace property. Moreover, Γ is countable, H is amenable since it is locally finite, and K0 and
K1 are nontrivial. Hence, it follows from Proposition 3.5 that Γ is not C ∗ -simple.

Note that Γ contains uncountably many amenable (abelian) subgroups, for example the
ones generated by subsets of
{h(0, . . . , 0, 1) | n ∈ N)},
| {z }
n times

so [7, Theorem 1.7] does not apply.
We can find an explicit free nonabelian subgroup of Γ by checking that hg0 h(1), g1 h(0)i is
isomorphic to Z3 ∗ Z3 , which clearly contains a nonabelian free group as a subgroup.
Finally, we remark that hK0 ∪ K1 i = H, and that the normal closure of H is all of Γ.
Proposition 4.5. Let
θ : Γ → Z/2Z × Z/2Z
be the group homomorphism defined on generators by
θ(h(0)) = (−1, 1),

θ(h(1)) = (1, −1),

θ(g0 ) = (1, −1),

θ(g1 ) = (−1, 1).

Set Γ0 = ker θ. Then Γ0 is simple.
Proof. Below we only provide the idea of the argument and omit most of the technicalities.
Observe that since t−1 h(0)t = h(0, i1 , . . . , i2k ) for a suitable element t ∈ T0,2k , it follows
that θ(h(0, i1 , . . . , i2k )) = θ(h(0)) = (−1, 1). Therefore
h(0)h(0, i1 , . . . , i2k ) ∈ Γ0
for all k ∈ N, j ∈ {1, . . . , 2k}, and ij ∈ {0, 1}. Analogous arguments yield
h(0)h(1, i1 , . . . , i2k−1 ), h(1)h(1, i1 , . . . , i2k ), h(1)h(0, i1 , . . . , i2k−1 ) ∈ Γ0
for all k ∈ N, j ∈ {1, . . . , 2k}, and ij ∈ {0, 1}.
Notice also that g1 h(0), h(0)g1 , g0 h(1), h(1)g0 ∈ Γ0 . One can now check that
Γ0 = h{h(0)h(0, i1 , . . . , i2k ), h(0)h(1, i1 , . . . , i2k−1 ), h(1)h(1, i1 , . . . , i2k ),
h(1)h(0, i1 , . . . , i2k−1 ), ∀k ∈ N, ∀ij ∈ {0, 1}, ∀j} ∪ {h(0)g1 , h(1)g0 }i.
Let N 6= {e} be a normal subgroup of Γ0 and pick an element a ∈ N \ {e}. The remainder
of the proof is about showing that each of the generators of Γ0 listed above can be described by
a suitable product of conjugates of a by elements of Γ0 . Since these computations are rather
tedious, we leave them out.

Remark 4.6. If G is an exact group with stable rank one and the unique trace property, then
G is C ∗ -simple by [2, Theorem 2.1]. Let Γ = G0 ∗H G1 be the group defined above. Since H
is amenable and has finite index in G0 and G1 , both these groups are amenable, and therefore
Γ is exact by [11, Corollary 3.3]. Hence, Γ does not have stable rank one by Theorem 4.4.

Remark 4.7. It was pointed out to us by Adrien Le Boudec that the group Γ is isomorphic
to the group G(A3 , S3 )? , which is one of the examples from [5, Section 5].
Let S3 and A3 denote the symmetric and alternating group, respectively, on a three-element
set. Consider a 3-regular tree T and color the edges {1, 2, 3}, so that neighboring edges have
different colors. Let σ(g, v) ∈ S3 be the permutation of the three colors induced in the natural
way by the element g ∈ Aut(T ). Then G(A3 , S3 ) < Aut(T ) is the group of all automorphisms
g of T such that σ(g, v) ∈ A3 for all but finitely many vertices v. Then G(A3 , S3 )? is the
subgroup of G(A3 , S3 ) of index two preserving the natural bipartition of vertices of T .
To see this, remark that by Bass-Serre’s theory (cf. [30, I.4 Theorem 6]) this index two
subgroup is an amalgamated product Ḡ0 ∗H̄ Ḡ1 , where Ḡ0 and Ḡ1 are the stabilizers of two
adjacent vertices (we will call them v0 and v1 ), and H̄ is the stabilizer of the edge between
them (we will call it e). Then, using the notation from [4, Subsection 3.1], we may write Ḡi
as an increasing union
[
G(S3 )vi =
Kn (vi ), i = 0, 1,
n≥1

where Kn (vi ) is the subgroup of G(A3 , S3 ) that fixes the vertex vi and has σ(g, v) ∈ A3
for all g ∈ Kn (vi ) and all v that are at a distance larger than n from vi . With this notation, the element h(0, i2 , . . . , in ) acts on T by swapping the two half-trees, emanating from
a vertex (we will call it v(0, i2 , . . . , in )) that is at a distance n − 1 from v0 and at a distance n from v1 , and not intersecting the geodesic between v0 and v(0, i2 , . . . , in ). Clearly,
σ(h(0, i2 , . . . , in ), v(0, i2 , . . . , in )) ∈
/ A3 , because it leaves one edge (therefore one color) fixed.
The matching of the other vertices of the half-trees is defined so the local permutations belong
to A3 . This matching is just a matter of orientation of the tree. Adding the element g1 to the
picture, we see that Kn (v0 ) is isomorphic to the wreath product Z2 o · · · o Z2 o S3 (n − 1 factors
of Z2 ), where the top elements beneath the S3 factor are h(1), h(0, 0), and h(0, 1). Likewise
Kn (v1 ) is isomorphic to Z2 o · · · o Z2 o S3 (n − 1 factors of Z2 ), where the top elements beneath
the S3 factor are h(0), h(1, 0) and h(1, 1). In this way, we see that Ḡi is isomorphic to Gi ,
i = 0, 1, and therefore Γ is isomorphic to G(A3 , S3 )? .
The simplicity of the group Γ0 is not covered by [4, Corollary 4.20], because A3 is not
generated by its point stabilizers.
We finally note that G(A3 , S3 ) is isomorphic to Γ o Z2 , where Z2 acts on Γ by interchanging
the indices 0 and 1 of all generating elements of Γ.
5. Actions of free products with amalgamation
Let G be any group acting on a space X, and let us first recall some notation. The stabilizer
subgroup of an element x ∈ X is Gx = {g ∈ G : gx = x}, and the fixed-point set of g ∈ G is
X g = {x ∈ X : gx = x}. The kernel of the action is the set of elements in G acting trivially
on X, namely
\
ker(G y X) =
Gx = {g ∈ G : X g = X}.
x∈X
−1

Note that for every x ∈ X and all s, g ∈ G, we have sGx s−1 = Gsx and X sgs = sX g , so the
kernel is a normal subgroup of G. The action is called faithful when the kernel is trivial, i.e.,
if for every g ∈ G \ {e} there exists x ∈ X such that gx 6= x, and strongly faithful if for every
finite set F ⊆ G \ {e} there exists x ∈ X such that gx 6= x for all g ∈ F .
Furthermore, the action of G on X is called free if whenever g ∈ G, x ∈ X, and gx = x,
then g = e. Since hGx : x ∈ Xi is invariant under conjugation, it is a normal subgroup of G,
which coincides with the subgroup of G generated by {g ∈ G : X g 6= ∅}. This subgroup is the
so-called “join” of {Gx : x ∈ X}, while ker(G y X) is the “meet” of {Gx : x ∈ X}. Obviously,
G acts freely on X if and only if this subgroup is trivial.

12

NIKOLAY A. IVANOV AND TRON OMLAND

Let X be a topological space, and suppose that G acts continuously on X, that is, by
homeomorphisms. For every x ∈ X define Gox as the subgroup of Gx consisting of all elements
that fix a neighborhood of x pointwise. We notice that g ∈ Gox for some x ∈ X if and only if
X g has nonempty interior, and we define the interior of the action as
(8)

int(G y X) = hGox : x ∈ Xi = h{g ∈ G : X g has nonempty interior}i.
−1

Then, by using the identity X sgs = sX g , we see that {g ∈ G : X g has nonempty interior}
is invariant under conjugation. Indeed, if X g contains a nonempty open subset V , then sV is
−1
a nonempty open subset of sX g = X sgs . Therefore, int(G y X) is automatically a normal
subgroup of G. One may also check that sGox s−1 = Gosx for every x ∈ X and s ∈ G. We say
that the action is topologically free if X g has empty interior for every g ∈ G \ {e}, that is, if
the interior is trivial. Finally, we note that for a topological space X, the interior and kernel
of an action corresponds to the join and meet, respectively, of {Gox : x ∈ X}.
Now, fix a nondegenerate amalgam G = G0 ∗H G1 and let T denote its Bass-Serre tree
(cf. [30], see also [20] and references therein). Then T has vertex set G/G0 t G/G1 and
(geometric) edge set G/H. Two vertices in T are adjacent if either of the form
(g0 )g1 ···g2n−1 g2n H

(g0 )g1 · · · g2n−1 G0 −−−−−−−−−−−−→ (g0 )g1 · · · g2n−1 g2n G1
or of the form (for a transversal edge)
(g0 )g1 ···g2n g2n+1 H

(g0 )g1 · · · g2n G1 −−−−−−−−−−−−→ (g0 )g1 · · · g2n g2n+1 G0
for gi ∈ Gi (mod 2) \ H.
Let V be the set of vertices and E the set of edges of T , and let s, r : E → V denote the
source and range maps. Given any two vertices v, w, there are exactly two paths between
them (one starting in v and ending in w, and one in the opposite direction), and the length of
these paths is the combinatorial distance d(v, w). A ray in T is a sequence (xn )∞
n=0 of vertices,
which is geodesic in the sense that d(xm , xn ) = |m − n| for all m, n (i.e., xn+2 6= xn for all
∞
n). Moreover, given two rays (xn )∞
n=0 and (yn )n=0 in T , we say they are cofinal, and write
∞
∞
(xn )n=0 ∼ (yn )n=0 if there exist integers k and N such that yn = xn+k for all n > N . Define
the boundary ∂T of the Bass-Serre tree T as the set of equivalence classes of cofinal rays.
For e ∈ E, define Z0 (e) = {v ∈ V : d(v, s(e)) > d(v, r(e))}, i.e., the set of all vertices that
are closer to the endpoint of e than the starting point. Moreover, define Z∞ (e) as the set of all
rays (xn )∞
n=0 such that xj = s(e) and xj+1 = r(e) for some j ≥ 0, and then define ZB (e) ⊂ ∂T
as Z∞ (e)/ ∼. Finally, set Z(e) = Z0 (e) ∪ ZB (e). The family of all finite intersections of
sets from the collection {Z(e) : e ∈ E} forms a base of compact clopen sets for a totally
disconnected compact Hausdorff topology on V ∪ ∂T , sometimes called the “shadow topology”
on V ∪ ∂T . We refer to [25, Section 4, especially Proposition 4.4] in this regard (there it is
assumed that T is countable, but their proofs hold also without this hypothesis, although then
the topology is not metrizable).
Moreover, by removing an edge from T , we get two components, so-called half-trees. An
extended half-tree is a half-tree together with all its associated boundary points. In this
terminology, as explained in [6, Section 4.3], the shadow topology is generated by all the
extended half-trees of V ∪ ∂T .
Next, define F ⊆ V as the set of all vertices v such that s−1 (v) = r−1 (v) is finite, i.e., only
finitely many edges start and end in v. The following can be deduced from sections of [6, 25]
mentioned above:
Proposition (new). The closure ∂T of ∂T in V ∪ ∂T is (V \ F ) ∪ ∂T , and is compact,
minimal, and G-invariant. Moreover, ∂T is closed in V ∪ ∂T if and only if F = V , if and
only if T is locally finite, if and only if H has finite index in both G0 and G1 .

Henceforth, we fix sets S0 and S1 of representatives for the nontrivial left cosets of G/G0
and G/G1 , respectively. Then every x ∈ ∂T can be uniquely represented by an infinite word
(g0 )g1 g2 · · · , where gi ∈ Si (mod 2) , that is, we take either x0 = g0 G1 , x1 = g0 g1 G0 etc. or
x0 = G1 , x1 = g1 G0 , etc., i.e., every class of cofinal rays will be represented by the unique ray
in the class starting with gG1 for g ∈ S0 ∪ {e}.
The boundary ∂T becomes a totally disconnected locally compact Hausdorff space when
equipped with the subspace topology coming from the shadow topology on V ∪ ∂T . This
topology is generated by basic clopen sets U ((g0 )g1 · · · gn ), where n ≥ 0 and gi ∈ Si (mod 2) ,
consisting of all equivalence classes of cofinal rays that are identified with infinite words
starting with (g0 )g1 · · · gn .
The amalgam G acts on its Bass-Serre tree T by left translation, that is, the action of
s ∈ G on vertices is given by s · gG0 = sgG0 , s · gG1 = sgG1 and on edges by s · gH = sgH.
Clearly, this also induces an action of G on the boundary of its Bass-Serre tree ∂T .
Lemma (new). Let g, s ∈ G, and suppose that s fixes U (g) pointwise. Then sgH = gH.
Consequently, s fixes every vertex in any ray coming from an infinite word starting with g.
For a complete proof that holds in a more general case, see [8, Lemma 3.6].
Sketch of proof. The idea is to assume that sgH 6= gH, and then construct an infinite word
starting with g, that gives rise to a ray that is not fixed (up to cofinality) by s. The argument
involves division into several subcases, where the infinite word depends upon the last letter of
g, and the first and last letter of g −1 sg.

Recall (3) and define the set
(9)

K((g0 )g1 · · · gn ) = (g0 )g1 · · · gn Kn+1 (mod 2) gn−1 · · · g1−1 (g0−1 ),

where gi ∈ Si (mod 2) . This is the subgroup of G consisting of all elements that fix the basic
open set U ((g0 )g1 · · · gn ) pointwise.
Lemma 5.1. We have that ker G = ker(G y T ) = ker(G y ∂T ) = ker(G y ∂T ), and that
int(G y ∂T ) equals int(G y ∂T ) and coincides with the normal closure of K0 ∪ K1 .
Proof. It should be clear that ker G = ker(G y T ) ⊆ ker(G y ∂T ) ⊆ H. Indeed, the latter
inclusion follows from the new lemma above. Suppose that h ∈ H \ ker G. Then there exists g
such that ghg −1 ∈
/ H. Moreover, we can find a g of the form (g0 )g1 · · · gn with gi ∈ Si (mod 2)
with this property. Let x be any ray starting with the corresponding vertices. Then hx 6∼ x,
so h ∈
/ ker(G y ∂T ) ⊆ H The equality ker(G y ∂T ) = ker(G y ∂T ) follows from continuity
of the action.
To see that int(G y ∂T ) = int(G y ∂T ), note first that if (∂T )g has nonempty interior,
i.e., there exists open nonempty V ⊆ (∂T )g , then V ∩ ∂T ⊆ (∂T )g is open nonempty in ∂T .
Next, if (∂T )g has nonempty interior, i.e., there exists open nonempty U ⊆ (∂T )g , then there
exists open V ⊆ ∂T such that U = V ∩ ∂T . Using density and continuity of the action, it
follows that V ⊆ U ⊆ (∂T )g .
Next, K0 fixes U (g0 ), i.e., all sequences of vertices starting with g0 G1 for any g0 ∈ S0 ,
pointwise, and K1 fixes U (g1 ), i.e., all sequences of vertices starting with G1 , g1 G0 for any
g1 ∈ S1 , pointwise. Hence, K0 ∪ K1 ⊆ int(G y ∂T ). Therefore, as the latter is normal, the
same inclusion holds for the normal closure of K0 ∪ K1 .
Pick g ∈ G and suppose that (∂T )h has nonempty interior. Then h must fix some basic
open set pointwise, say U (g) for g = (g0 )g1 · · · gn . This means that h ∈ K(g), as defined in
(9), so h ∈ gKn+1 (mod 2) g −1 , that is, h belongs to the normal closure of Kn+1 (mod 2) . Since
int(G y ∂T ) is generated by {h ∈ G : (∂T )h has nonempty interior}, the conclusion follows.
Note that h also fixes U ((g0 )g1 · · · gn+1 ), so h belongs to the normal closure of the other
Ki as well. In fact, the normal closures of K0 , K1 , and K0 ∪ K1 are all the same.

NIKOLAY A. IVANOV AND TRON OMLAND

Definition 5.2. The subgroup int(G y ∂T ) = h{g ∈ G : (∂T )g has nonempty interior}i of
G, or equivalently, the normal closure of K0 ∪ K1 in G, will be called the interior of G and
denoted int G.
In Proposition 5.4 below, we show that G is C ∗ -simple if and only if int G is C ∗ -simple,
giving an analog of Proposition 3.1 (however int G can be all of G).
Proposition 5.3. The following are equivalent:
(i) int G = {e},
(ii) G y T is strongly faithful,
(iii) G y ∂T is strongly faithful,
(iv) G y ∂T is topologically free, i.e., G y T is slender in the sense of [20].
Proof. The equivalences between (i), (iv), and condition (i) of Theorem 3.2 follow directly
from Lemma 5.1 and Definition 5.2. Moreover, condition (ii) of Theorem 3.2 coincides with
condition (SF) from [17, p. 245]. Remark that in [17], the notations Edg+ X and Y are used
for T and ∂T , respectively. In particular, (ii) is the same as condition (SF), and thus the
above means that (ii) is equivalent with (i) and (iv). Finally, it follows from [17, Lemma 9]
that (ii) implies (iii), and it is stated immediately after the proof of [17, Lemma 9] that its
converse holds as well.

Using the terminology of [5], we see from the proof of Lemma 5.1 that K0 and K1 are
precisely the fixators of the half-trees of T obtained by removing the edge H.
Proposition 5.4. Let G be a nondegenerate free product with amalgamation. Then G is
C ∗ -simple if and only if int G is C ∗ -simple.
Proof. Suppose that int G is C ∗ -simple.
First, assume that int G ⊆ H. For the moment, write Ki (G) and Ki (G/ ker G) for the
Ki ’s corresponding to the amalgams G and G/ ker G, respectively. Clearly, a word in G
starts with a letter in Gi \ H if and only if its image in G/ ker G starts with a letter in
∼ Ki (G/ ker G).
(Gi / ker G) \ (H/ ker G). Thus, we see that Ki (G)/ ker G =
Because int G is a normal subgroup of G contained in H, we must have int G = ker G, and
then also K0 = K1 = ker G. Thus, G/ int G is C ∗ -simple by Theorem 3.2. Since we have
assumed that int G is C ∗ -simple, it follows from [7, Theorem 1.4] that G is C ∗ -simple.
Next, let CG (int G) denote the centralizer of int G in G, and suppose that g ∈ CG (int G) \ H.
In particular, this means that g commutes with all elements in K0 and K1 , so gKi g −1 = Ki
for i = 0, 1. Moreover, for all gi ∈ Gi \ H, we always have that gi Ki+1 (mod 2) gi−1 ⊇ Ki . From
this it follows that K0 = K1 , which means that ker G = int G.
Indeed, let g have length n and denote by gn the last letter of g. If n is odd, then
Kn (mod 2) = gKn (mod 2) g −1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ gn Kn (mod 2) gn−1 ⊆ Kn+1 (mod 2) ,
which easily implies K0 = K1 , and hence ker G = int G. If n is even, then
Kn+1 (mod 2) = gKn+1 (mod 2) g −1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ gn Kn (mod 2) gn−1 ⊆ Kn+1 (mod 2) ,
and therefore all containments are equalities. Assume that [Gj : H] ≥ 3, for j = 0 or 1, pick a
letter gj ∈ Gj \ H of g, and choose another element gj0 ∈ Gj \ H such that gj−1 gj0 ∈ Gj \ H.
Then
(gj0 )−1 gj Kj (mod 2) gj−1 gj0 = (gj0 )−1 Kj+1 (mod 2) gj0 ⊇ Kj (mod 2) .
Moreover,
(gj0 )−1 gj Kj (mod 2) gj−1 gj0 ⊆ Kj+1 (mod 2) ,
meaning that ker G = int G.

so Kj (mod 2) ⊆ Kj+1 (mod 2) ,

Finally, if CG (int G) ⊆ H, then CG (int G) ⊆ ker G, since it is normal in G and contained in
H. Then CG (int G) = Z(int G), since it is contained in int G, so it must be trivial since int G
is assumed to be C ∗ -simple. Hence, it follows from [7, Theorem 1.4] that G is C ∗ -simple.
The converse holds by [7, Theorem 1.4] because int G is a normal subgroup of G.

Proposition 5.5. Suppose that ker G is trivial. Then G is a weak∗ Powers group.
Proof. The action of G on the boundary of its Bass-Serre tree is always minimal and strongly
hyperbolic (see [20, Proposition 19]). If ker G is trivial, then the action is also faithful by
Lemma 5.1. In [17, Lemma 4] we now replace “strongly faithful” by “faithful”, and the first
part of the proof still works, under the assumption that F 6= {e} is a one-element set. The
rest of the argument goes along the same lines.

Example 5.6. The group Γ from Section 4 is a weak∗ Powers group that is not C ∗ -simple.
We complete this section by some facts about boundary actions and refer to [7, 22, 27]
for further details. An action of G on a compact space X is called a boundary action if it
is minimal (i.e., the orbits are dense) and strongly proximal (i.e., the orbit-closure in P (X)
of every probability measure on X contains a point mass). In this case we also say that the
space X is a G-boundary.
For every group G there is a universal G-boundary called the Furstenberg boundary and
denoted ∂F G. If X is any other G-boundary, then there exists a continuous surjective Gequivariant map ∂F G → X. Moreover, we remark that for every g ∈ G, the set (∂F G)g is
always clopen, cf. [7, Lemma 3.3].
In Section 7 we will often make use of the following observation from [7].
Lemma 5.7. Let G be a group, N a normal subgroup of G, and L a normal subgroup of N .
Suppose that g ∈ N is such that (∂F G)g 6= ∅. Then (∂F (N/L))gL 6= ∅.
Proof. First, the quotient map N → N/L gives rise to an action of N on ∂F (N/L), which
makes ∂F (N/L) an N -boundary. Thus, there exists an N -equivariant continuous surjective
map ψ : ∂F N → ∂F (N/L). Next, [7, Lemma 5.2] says that the N -action on ∂F N extends to
an action of G, such that ∂F N becomes a G-boundary. Therefore, there is a G-equivariant
continuous surjective map φ : ∂F G → ∂F N , so altogether we have surjections
φ

ψ

∂F G −→ ∂F N −→ ∂F (N/L).
Now, if g ∈ N and (∂F G)g =
6 ∅, there exists x ∈ ∂F G such that gx = x. It follows that
gψ(φ(x)) = ψ(φ(gx)) = ψ(φ(x)), so ψ(φ(x)) ∈ (∂F (N/L))g = (∂F (N/L))gL , which is therefore
nonempty. In particular, we have ψ(φ((∂F G)g )) ⊆ (∂F (N/L))gL .

Lemma 5.8. Suppose that G is a nondegenerate amalgam. Then ∂T is a G-boundary.
Proof. The action of a nondegenerate amalgam G = G0 ∗H G1 on its Bass-Serre Tree T is
minimal and strongly hyperbolic (see [20, Proposition 19]), that is, of “general type” in the sense
of [6, Section 4.3]. It follows that the action of G on ∂T is minimal by [20, Proposition 19] and
Lemma 5.1, extremely proximal by [6, Proposition 4.26] (see [6, Section 2.1] for terminology),
and thus strongly proximal by [14, Theorem 2.3 (3.3)]. Hence, ∂T is a G-boundary.

Theorem 5.9. Suppose that K0 or K1 is amenable. Then G is C ∗ -simple if and only if both
K0 and K1 are trivial.
Proof. Let x ∈ ∂T be represented by a sequence of vertices g0 G1 , g0 g1 G0 , etc., where
gi ∈ Si (mod 2) (of course, the argument is similar if it starts with G1 , g1 G0 , etc). Then Gox is
the direct limit of the sequence K(g0 ) ⊆ K(g0 g1 ) ⊆ · · · , that is, of
K0 ⊆ g0 K1 g0−1 ⊆ g0 g1 K0 g1−1 g0−1 ⊆ · · · .

16

NIKOLAY A. IVANOV AND TRON OMLAND

Clearly, K0 is amenable if and only if K1 is amenable, since either of them is a subgroup of a
conjugate of the other, see (5). Therefore, all K((g0 )g1 · · · gn ) are also amenable, since they
are conjugates of K0 or K1 , see (9). As the class of amenable groups is closed under direct
limits, we have that Gox is amenable.
Assume that G is C ∗ -simple. Since ∂T is a G-boundary by Lemma 5.8 and G is assumed to
be C ∗ -simple, we may use [7, Corollary 7.5] to say that C(∂T ) or G is simple. Then it follows
from [27, Theorem 14 (2)] that G y ∂T is topologically free, so G y ∂T is topologically free
by Lemma 5.1, that is, int G = {e}. Hence, Proposition 5.3 gives that both K0 and K1 are
trivial.
Conversely, if K0 = K1 = {e}, then G is C ∗ -simple by Theorem 3.2.

A similar argument shows that Gox is nonamenable for all x ∈ ∂T if K0 or K1 is nonamenable,
and it seems likely that this implies C ∗ -simplicity of G.
Remark 5.10. Any amalgamated free product where K0 and K1 are nontrivial, amenable,
and K0 ∩K1 = {e} is not C ∗ -simple, but has the unique trace property. As noted in Remark 4.7,
the group Γ of Section 4 is isomorphic to one of Le Boudec’s examples from [5, Section 5].
However, if the groups G0 and G1 are nonisomorphic, then such an amalgamated product will
not be covered by [5, Section 5].
6. Radical and residual classes of groups
In this section, by a class of groups, we will always mean a class X of groups that contains
∼ G, then H ∈ X.
the trivial group and is closed under isomorphisms, i.e., if G ∈ X and H =
In [29], this is called a group theoretical class.
Let X be a class of groups and let G be any group. Define ρ(G) as the normal subgroup of
G generated by all normal subgroups of G that belong to X, and ρ∗ (G) as the intersection of
all normal subgroups of G with quotient belonging to X, i.e.,
Y
ρ(G) =
{N : N / G and N ∈ X},
\
∗
ρ (G) = {N : N / G and G/N ∈ X}.
These are both normal subgroups of G, called join and meet of the respective families.
Whenever more than one class is around, we will often write ρX and ρ∗X .
Definition 6.1. A class of groups X is called a radical class if it is closed under quotients
(i.e., closed under homomorphic images), and if for any group G we have
(i) ρ(G) ∈ X,
(ii) ρ(G/ρ(G)) = {e}.
A class of groups X is called a residual (or coradical or semisimple) class if it is closed under
normal subgroups, and if for any group G we have
(i*) G/ρ∗ (G) ∈ X,
(ii*) ρ∗ (ρ∗ (G)) = ρ∗ (G).
Clearly, if X is radical, then for any G we have ρ(ρ(G)) = ρ(G), and G ∈ X if and only if
ρ(G) = G. Moreover, if X is residual, then for any G we have ρ∗ (G/ρ∗ (G)) = {e}, and G ∈ X
if and only if ρ∗ (G) = {e}.
The above definitions are not completely consistent within references; some say that a class
is radical if it is closed under quotients and (i) holds, and strict radical if (ii) holds as well
(similarly for residual), and there are possibly other variations.
Proposition 6.2. A class of groups is radical if and only if it is closed under quotients,
extensions, and satisfies (i). Moreover, a class of groups is residual if and only if it is closed
under normal subgroups, extensions, and satisfies (i*).

C ∗ -SIMPLICITY, AMALGAMS, AND RADICAL CLASSES

17

Proof. This is explained in [29, Theorems 1.32 and 1.35], where (i) and (i*) are equivalent to
the properties N X = X and RX = X of [29, p. 20 and p. 23], respectively, see [29, p. 19]. 
Let X be a class of groups closed under quotients, and define X ∗ to be all groups satisfying
ρ(G) = {e}, that is, the class of groups with no nontrivial normal subgroups in X, i.e.,
X ∗ = {G : ρ(G) = {e}} = {G : N / G, N 6= {e} ⇒ N ∈
/ X}.
Similarly, if X is a class of groups closed under normal subgroups, define X∗ to be all groups
satisfying ρ∗ (G) = G, that is, the class of groups with no nontrivial quotients in X, i.e.,
X∗ = {G : ρ∗ (G) = G} = {G : N / G, N 6= G ⇒ G/N ∈
/ X}.
Proposition 6.3. Let X be a class of groups closed under quotients. Then X is radical if
and only if X = (X ∗ )∗ if and only if X = Y∗ for some class of groups Y that is closed under
normal subgroups.
Let X be a class of groups closed under normal subgroups. Then X is residual if and only
if X = (X∗ )∗ if and only if X = Y ∗ for some class of groups Y that is closed under quotients.
Proof. This follows from [29, Theorems 1.38 and 1.39], see [29, p. 6-7] for notation.



Example 6.4. Let X be the class of amenable groups, which is known to be a radical class.
Then [7, Theorem 1.3] shows that the class of groups with the unique trace property coincides
with X ∗ , and is therefore residual by Proposition 6.3. Thus, a group is amenable if and only
if it does not have any nontrivial quotient with the unique trace property.
Example 6.5. Let X be the class of Powers (resp. weak Powers, weak∗ Powers) groups,
which is not closed under extensions, so it is not a residual class. However, X is closed under
normal subgroups by Lemma 2.2, meaning that we can define the class X∗ of groups with no
nontrivial quotient which is a Powers (resp. weak Powers, weak∗ Powers) group. Moreover,
X∗ is a radical class, but ρX∗ (G) = {e} does not imply that G ∈ X.
If X is the class of all Powers groups, then P = (X∗ )∗ is the residual closure of X, that is,
the smallest residual class containing all Powers groups. In Section 7 we will see that the class
of C ∗ -simple groups is residual, and hence it contains P (it could possibly coincide with P ).
Example 6.6. Some radical classes of groups are e.g. locally finite groups, elementary
amenable groups, amenable groups, and groups that do not contain any nonabelian free
subgroup. We denote the latter class by N F , which gives rise to the residual class AF = (N F )∗ ,
consisting of all groups for which every nontrivial normal subgroup contains a free nonabelian
subgroup, and G ∈ N F if and only if ρ∗AF (G) = G. Since every amenable group belongs
to N F , every group in AF has the unique trace property. Moreover, (1) gives that every
amalgamated free product with trivial kernel belongs to AF .
Both the class of amenable groups and N F are closed under subgroups, but in general,
radical classes are not necessarily closed even under normal subgroups. A radical class that is
closed under normal subgroups is sometimes called hereditary.
Lemma 6.7. Let X be a class of groups satisfying (i). Then X is closed under normal
subgroups if and only if for any group G and normal subgroup N of G we have
ρ(N ) = ρ(G) ∩ N.
In particular, this implies that ρ(N ) is a normal subgroup of G.
Proof. If G ∈ X and N is normal in G, then ρ(N ) = ρ(G) ∩ N = G ∩ N = N , so N ∈ X.
The converse is explained in [29, Lemma 1.31, Corollaries 1 and 2].

NIKOLAY A. IVANOV AND TRON OMLAND

A direct proof in the special case of countable amenable groups is given in [31, Corollary B.4].
The result below is similar to [31, Corollary B.6], using Lemma 6.7.
For a group G and a subset N , we let ZG (N ) and Z(G) denote the centralizer of N in G,
and the center of G, respectively.
Lemma 6.8. Let X be a class of groups that satisfies (i) and is closed under normal subgroups.
Assume that G is any group and N is a normal subgroup of G such that ρ(N ) = {e}.
Then ρ(G) = ρ(ZG (N )).
Proof. Since {e} = ρ(N ) = ρ(G) ∩ N , the normal subgroups ρ(G) and N commute, so
ρ(G) ⊆ ZG (N ). Hence, ρ(ZG (N )) = ρ(G) ∩ ZG (N ) = ρ(G).

Lemma 6.9. Let X be a class of groups that satisfies (i), is closed under normal subgroups,
and contains all abelian groups. Assume that G is any group and N is a normal subgroup of
G such that both ρ(N ) and ρ(G/N ) are trivial. Then ρ(G) = {e}.
Proof. First, Z(N ) is normal in N , so Lemma 6.7 gives that ρ(Z(N )) ⊆ ρ(N ) = {e}, and since
Z(N ) ∈ X, we must have Z(N ) = {e}. Thus, the map ZG (N ) → G/N , x 7→ xN is injective,
and ρ(G/N ) = {e} implies ρ(ZG (N )) = {e}. By Lemma 6.8, we thus get ρ(G) = {e}.

Lemma 6.10. Let X be a residual class, and suppose that X∗ is closed under normal subgroups
and contains all abelian groups. Let G be any group and N a normal subgroup of G. Then G
belongs to X if and only if both N and ZG (N ) belong to X.
Proof. Clearly, X∗ satisfies the conditions of Lemmas 6.8 and 6.9, and by Proposition 6.3 we
know that G ∈ X if and only if ρX∗ (G) = {e}.

The above result is an analog of [7, Theorem 1.4], while the result below shows that when
X is a residual class and G is a group, then ρX∗ (G) is the smallest normal subgroup of G that
produces a quotient in X.
Lemma 6.11. Let X be a class of groups closed under normal subgroups and suppose that G
is a group with a normal subgroup N such that G/N ∈ X. Then ρX∗ (G) ⊆ N .
Proof. If G/N ∈ X, then ρX∗ (G/N ) = {e}. Suppose that ρX∗ (G) is not contained in N . Then
ρX∗ (G)/(ρX∗ (G) ∩ N ) is isomorphic to (ρX∗ (G)N )/N , which is a normal nontrivial subgroup
of G/N that belongs to X∗ . This is a contradiction.

Lemma 6.12. Let X be a class of groups that is closed under normal subgroups, extensions,
and contains all finite groups. Assume that G is any group and H is a subgroup of G of finite
index. Then G ∈ X if and only if H ∈ X.
Proof. Let N be the normal core of H in G, that is, the largest normal subgroup of G contained
in H. It is well-known that N also has finite index in G. Suppose first that G ∈ X. Then
N ∈ X and H/N is finite, so H/N ∈ X, and hence H ∈ X. The converse is similar; if H ∈ X,
then N ∈ X and G/N is finite, so G ∈ X.

7. Amenablish groups and the amenablish radical
Since the class of C ∗ -simple groups is closed under normal subgroups [7, Theorem 1.4], the
following definition makes sense in light of Proposition 6.3.
Definition 7.1. We call a group amenablish if it has no nontrivial C ∗ -simple quotients. The
class of all amenablish groups is radical, so every group G has a unique maximal normal
amenablish subgroup, which will be called the amenablish radical of G.

C ∗ -SIMPLICITY, AMALGAMS, AND RADICAL CLASSES

19

It is clear that every amenable group is amenablish, but not all amenablish groups are
amenable, as explained in Corollary 7.11 below.
We will now show that the class of C ∗ -simple groups is residual, which will imply that a
group is C ∗ -simple precisely when its amenablish radical is trivial. Since the class of C ∗ -simple
groups is known to be closed under normal subgroups and extensions by [7, Theorem 1.4], we
only have to prove that (i*) from Definition 6.1 holds.
Proposition 7.2. Suppose that G is a group and {Nα }α∈Λ is a family of normal subgroups
∗
of G such that
T G/Nα is C ∗-simple for all α.
Then G/ α∈Λ Nα is C -simple.
Proof. For any two indicies α and β, the group (Nα Nβ )/Nβ ∼
= Nα /(Nα ∩ Nβ ) is a normal
subgroup of G/Nβ , so it is C ∗ -simple again by [7, Theorem 1.4]. Moreover, G/(Nα ∩ Nβ ) →
G/Nα is surjective with kernel Nα /(Nα ∩ Nβ ). Hence, applying [7, Theorem 1.4] once more
gives that G/(Nα ∩ Nβ ) is C ∗ -simple. We may therefore assume that the family {Nα }α∈Λ is
closed under finite intersections.
It is easy to see, using transfinite induction and the Axiom of Choice, that we can obtain a
well-ordered set {Nβ }β∈I of normal subgroups of G with the property
\
\
def
Nβ =
Nα = N.
β∈I

α∈Λ

After factoring the whole family by N , we deduce the following equivalent reformulation of
the above statement: Suppose G is a group with a decreasing (transfinite) sequence
G = N0 ) N1 ) N2 ) · · · ) Nα ) · · · ) Nβ ) · · ·
that satisfies
(i) T
Nα is normal in G for all α ∈ I,
(ii) α∈I Nα = {e},
(iii) G/Nα is C ∗ -simple for all α ∈ I.
Then G is C ∗ -simple.
To prove the latter statement, set Xα = ∂F (Nα /Nα+1 ), where ∂F denotes the Furstenberg
boundary. Then Xα is a G-boundary for all α. Indeed, by [7, Lemma 5.2] and the normality
assumption, the action of Nα /Nα+1 on Xα extends uniquely to a boundary action of G/Nα+1
on Xα . Then, composition with the quotient map gives a boundary action of G on Xα
(compare with [7,QProof of Theorem 1.4]).
Now, set X = α Xα (with the usual product topology). We wish to show that the action
of G on X is a boundary action, that is, strongly proximal and minimal. First, [27, Lemma 3]
gives that the action of G on X is strongly proximal, since it is strongly proximal on eachQfactor.
Next, take an arbitrary point x = (xα ) ∈ X and an arbitrary basic open set U = α Uα ,
where we have Uα = Xα except for finitely many sets Uα1 , . . . , Uαn , with α1 < · · · < αn . Note
that for all α, the set (Nα \ Nα+1 )xα is dense in Xα and also that Nα acts minimally on
Xα , while Nα+1 acts trivially on Xα . Therefore there exists a group element g1 ∈ Nα1 , such
that g1 xα1 ∈ Uα1 . Also there exists g2 ∈ Nα2 , such that g2 g1 xα2 ∈ Uα2 . We continue the
argument and finally deduce that there exists gn ∈ Nαn with gn · · · g1 xαn ∈ Uαn . This shows
that gn · · · g1 x ∈ U . We conclude that Gx is dense in X, hence, X is a G-boundary. Note
that the last argument does not require the Axiom of Choice, since we just need the existence
of gi ’s and not their concrete choice.
We wish to show that this action is free, i.e., that for all nontrivial g ∈ G, the set
X g = {x : gx = x} is empty. So pick an arbitrary g ∈ G \ {e}. From the assumption it follows
that there must be a unique α such that g ∈ Nα \ Nα+1 . Clearly, Nα /Nα+1 is C ∗ -simple, since

20

NIKOLAY A. IVANOV AND TRON OMLAND

it is a normal subgroup of G/Nα+1 , which is C ∗ -simple by assumption, so [22, Theorem 6.2]
and [7, Lemma 3.3] imply that Nα /Nα+1 acts freely on ∂F (Nα /Nα+1 ), that is,
Xαg = ∂F (Nα /Nα+1 )gNα+1 = ∅
Hence, X g = α Xαg = ∅.
The result now follows from [22, Theorem 6.2].
Q



In Proposition 7.2 the use of the Axiom of Choice can be avoided for groups that are
concretely given, e.g. if G is given by a totally ordered set of generators and relations, or if G
is given by some concrete dynamical properties.
Corollary 7.3. The class of C ∗ -simple groups is a residual class.
Hence, a group G is C ∗ -simple if and only if its amenablish radical N is trivial, and N is
the smallest normal subgroup of G that produces a C ∗ -simple quotient.
We will now describe the amenablish radical in terms of the Furstenberg boundary.
Definition 7.4. Let G be any group. Set N0 = {e} and N1 = int(G y ∂F G), recall (8), and
moreover, for every ordinal α, define a normal subgroup Nα+1 of G by
Nα+1 /Nα = int(G/Nα y ∂F (G/Nα )),
S
and for every limit ordinal β, set Nβ = α<β Nα , which is clearly also normal in G. Then
{Nα }α is an
S ascending normal series of G which eventually stabilizes, and we finally set
AH(G) = α Nα .
Lemma 7.5. For any group G, the quotient G/AH(G) is C ∗ -simple.
Proof. Let {Nα }α be as in Definition 7.4. Then there exists some ordinal β such that
AH(G) = Nβ . If G/Nβ is not C ∗ -simple, then Nβ+1 /Nβ = (∂F (G/Nβ ))gNβ 6= ∅ is nontrivial.
Hence, Nβ ( Nβ+1 , contradicting the definition of AH(G).

Note that G/ int(G y ∂F G) is not necessarily C ∗ -simple, i.e., AH(G) is in general bigger
than int(G y ∂F G). Indeed, it was explained to us by Adrien Le Boudec that by applying
[6, Theorem 1.11], one can construct an example G = G(F, F 0 ) such that int(G y ∂F G) has
index two in G (the condition is that F 0 is generated by its point stabilizers). We refer to
[4, 5, 6] for more about this construction.
Lemma 7.6. Suppose that N is a normal subgroup of a group G such that G/N is C ∗ -simple.
Then AH(G) ⊆ N .
Proof. The action of G/N on X = ∂F (G/N ) is free by [22, Theorem 6.2]. Pick g ∈ int(G y
∂F G) such that (∂F G)g 6= ∅. By Lemma 5.7, we have X gN 6= ∅, which means that gN is
trivial in G/N , i.e., g ∈ N . Since the set of all g with (∂F G)g 6= ∅ generates int(G y ∂F G),
it follows that int(G y ∂F G) ⊆ N .
We continue by transfinite induction. Let {Nα }α be the series from Definition 7.4 associated
with G. We have shown that N1 ⊆ N . Assume next that Nα ⊆ N for some ordinal α and note
that there is a quotient map G/Nα → G/N . Choose g ∈ Nα+1 such that (∂F (G/Nα ))gNα 6= ∅.
Then the same argument as above gives that X gN 6= ∅, so g ∈ N . Hence, we conclude that
Nα+1 ⊆ N . Finally, if β is a limit ordinal and Nα ⊆ N for all α < β, then clearly Nβ ⊆ N . 
Lemma 7.7. Let N be a normal subgroup of G. Then AH(N ) = AH(G) ∩ N .
Proof. Pick g ∈ int(G y ∂F G) ∩ N such that (∂F G)g =
6 ∅. It follows from Lemma 5.7 that
(∂F N )g 6= ∅, so g ∈ int(N y ∂F N ). Since the set of all g with (∂F G)g =
6 ∅ generates
int(G y ∂F G), we get that int(G y ∂F G) ∩ N ⊆ int(N y ∂F N ).
We continue by transfinite induction. Let {Nα }α and {Hα }α be the series from Definition 7.4
associated with G and N , respectively. We have shown that N1 ∩ N ⊆ H1 . Let α be an ordinal

C ∗ -SIMPLICITY, AMALGAMS, AND RADICAL CLASSES

21

number and assume that Nα ∩ N ⊆ Hα . Note that N/(N ∩ Nα ) ∼
= (N Nα )/Nα is a normal
subgroup of G/Nα , and that N/Hα is a quotient of N/(N ∩ Nα ). Choose g ∈ Nα+1 ∩ N
such that ∂F (G/Nα )gNα 6= ∅. Then by Lemma 5.7 we have (∂F (N/Hα ))gHα 6= ∅. Hence,
gHα ∈ int(N/Hα y ∂F (N/Hα )) = Hα+1 /Hα , and it follows that Nα+1 ∩ N ⊆ Hα+1 . Finally,
if β is a limit ordinal and Nα ∩ N ⊆ Hα for all α < β, then clearly Nβ ∩ N ⊆ Hβ . Thus, we
have AH(G) ∩ N ⊆ AH(N ).
For the opposite inclusion, note that G/AH(G) is C ∗ -simple by Lemma 7.5, and that
(AH(G)N )/AH(G) is normal in G/AH(G), so N/(AH(G) ∩ N ) ∼
= (AH(G)N )/AH(G) is
C ∗ -simple by using [7, Theorem 1.4]. Hence, Lemma 7.6 gives that AH(N ) ⊆ AH(G) ∩ N . 
Proposition 7.8. For any group G, the amenablish radical of G coincides with AH(G).
Proof. We need to show that AH(G) is amenablish, and that it contains all normal amenablish
subgroups of G.
Set M = int(G y ∂F G). Suppose first that L is a normal subgroup of M such that L =
6 M.
Pick g ∈ M \ L so that (∂F G)g 6= ∅. It follows from Lemma 5.7 that (∂F (M/L))gL 6= ∅, so
M/L is not C ∗ -simple. Hence, M is amenablish.
Let {Nα }α be the series from Definition 7.4 associated with G. Then it follows that
Nα+1 /Nα is amenablish for every ordinal α, by using the same argument as above with G/Nα
in place of G. Since the class of amenablish groups is radical, it is closed under extensions
and under increasing unions of normal subgroups. Since N1 is amenablish, an argument
by transfinite induction gives that Nα is amenablish for every ordinal α. Hence, AH(G) is
amenablish.
Next, let L be an amenablish normal subgroup of G, and assume that L is not contained in
AH(G). Set K = L ∩ AH(G), then K 6= L and K = AH(L) by Lemma 7.7. Hence, L/K is
C ∗ -simple by Lemma 7.5.

Lemma 7.9. The class of amenablish groups is closed under normal subgroups.
Proof. This is a direct consequence of Lemma 6.7, Lemma 7.7, and Proposition 7.8.



Lemma 7.10. Let G be any group and H a subgroup of finite index. Then G is amenablish
if and only if H is amenablish.
Proof. The class of amenablish groups is closed under normal subgroups, extensions, and
contains all finite groups. Hence, Lemma 6.12 applies.

Corollary 7.11. The group Γ of Section 4 is amenablish, but not amenable (and has trivial
amenable radical).
Proof. By Theorem 4.4, the group Γ is not C ∗ -simple, but has the unique trace property, so
it has trivial amenable radical and is icc. The normal subgroup Γ0 from Proposition 4.5 is not
C ∗ -simple either, because it has finite index in Γ (see [18, Proposition 19 (iv)]). Since Γ0 is
simple and AH(Γ0 ) 6= {e}, we must have AH(Γ0 ) = Γ0 , that is, Γ0 is amenablish. Hence, it
follows from Lemma 7.10 that Γ is amenablish.

Remark 7.12. The class of amenablish groups is not closed under subgroups. Indeed, by
Corollary 7.11 the group Γ is amenablish, but it contains as subgroup a nonabelian free group,
which is C ∗ -simple, and thus not amenablish.
Moreover, AH(Γ) = Γ and N F (Γ) = {e}, while recent work by Olshanskii and Osin [26]
presents a group G with the property AH(G) = {e} and N F (G) = G. Hence, it seems to be
no relation between the class of amenablish groups and N F (except that both contain all
amenable groups).

Remark 7.13. Let G be a countable group, and let N be the subgroup of G generated by all
recurrent amenable subgroups in G (see [23, Definition 5.1]). Does N coincide with AH(G)?
It is mentioned in [23, Remark 5.4] that for every x ∈ ∂F G the subgroup Gx is recurrent
amenable in G, so int(G y ∂F G) = hGx : x ∈ ∂F Gi ⊆ N . Moreover, [23, Theorem 1.1] says
that N is trivial if and only if G is C ∗ -simple, that is, if and only if int(G y ∂F G) is trivial.
Note also that a recent paper [6, Section 4] introduces a unique maximal amenable uniformly
recurrent subgroup AG of G, and [6, Proposition 2.21 (ii)] states that hH : H ∈ AG i = int(G y
∂F G), which in general is smaller than AH(G), cf. comment after Lemma 7.5.
Example 7.14. If G is a simple group, then G is either C ∗ -simple or amenablish. E.g.
Thompson’s group T is known to be simple, so it follows directly from [6, 16] that T is
amenablish if and only if Thompson’s group F is amenable.

Update November 2017
This paper was published in Journal of Functional Analysis in 2017 (272(9):3712–3741).
After that, it was pointed out to us by Rasmus Sylvester Bryder that we had incorrectly
assumed that the boundary of the Bass-Serre tree is always compact, and therefore the
statement of Lemma 5.8 was incorrect. This did not cause any major problems, and the proof
of the only result that depended on it, Theorem 5.9, was easily fixable (it even turned out that
the result can be generalized, see [8, Theorem 3.9]). We still decided to reformulate certain
paragraphs of Section 5 to accomodate for this mistake, by inserting a new proposition and
modify Lemma 5.8 and the proof of Theorem 5.9. At the same time, we also inserted a new
lemma used to clarify the proof of Lemma 5.1, fixed an inaccuracy in the proof of Theorem 3.2,
corrected some typos, and updated the reference list.
