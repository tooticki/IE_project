Abstract
We introduce two tools, dynamical thickening and flow selectors, to
overcome the infamous discontinuity of the gradient flow endpoint map
near non-degenerate critical points. More precisely, we interpret the stable
fibrations of certain Conley pairs (N, L), established in [2], as a dynamical
thickening of the stable manifold. As a first application and to illustrate
efficiency of the concept we reprove a fundamental theorem of classical
Morse theory, Milnor’s homotopical cell attachment theorem [1]. Dynamical thickening leads to a conceptually simple and short proof.

Consider a connected smooth manifold M of finite dimension n. Suppose
f : M → R is a smooth function and x is a non-degenerate critical point of f
of Morse index k, that is dfx = 0 and in local coordinates the Hessian matrix
(∂ 2 f /∂xi ∂xj )i,j at x has precisely k negative eigenvalues, counting multiplicities, and zero is not an eigenvalue. Set c := f (x) and assume for simplicity that
the level set {f = c} carries no critical point other than x.
Morse theory studies how the topology of sublevel sets M a = {f ≤ a}
changes when a runs through a critical value c. A fundamental tool is the concept of a flow, also called a 1-parameter group of diffeomorphisms of M . A
common choice is the downward gradient flow {ϕs }s∈R , namely the one generd
ated by the initial value problems ds
ϕs = −(∇f ) ◦ ϕs with ϕ0 = idM . Existence
is guaranteed, for instance, if the vector field is of compact support. Here ∇f
denotes the gradient vector field of f on M . It is uniquely determined by the
identity df (·) = g(∇f, ·) after fixing an auxiliary Riemannian metric g on M .
Key properties of the downward gradient flow are that f decays along flow lines
s 7→ ϕs p, for p ∈ M , and that ∇f is orthogonal to level sets. Consequently sublevel sets are forward flow invariant. As dfx = 0 ⇔ (∇f )x = 0, any critical point
x is a fixed point of the flow and non-degeneracy translates into hyperbolicity.

are embedded open, respectively closed, disks in M of dimension k = ind(x); an
embedding Wεu ,→ M as a closed k-disk exists only for every sufficiently small
ε > 0 (use the Morse-Lemma). The boundary Sεu := ∂Wεu is called a descending
sphere. Consider instead the limit s → +∞ to get the stable manifold W s and
ascending disk Wεs = W s ∩ {f ≤ c + ε}. They have analogous properties except
that they are of codimension k.
In [2], see [3, Thm. 5.1] for details in the present finite dimensional case, we
implemented the structure of a disk bundle on the compact neighborhood
N = Nxε,τ := {p ∈ M | f (p) ≤ c + ε, f (ϕτ p) ≥ c − ε}connected component of x
of x whenever ε > 0 is small and τ > 0 is large. The fibers are codimensionk disks with boundaries in the upper level set {f = c + ε} and parametrized
by their unique point of intersection, say q T , with the unstable manifold. The
fiber over x is Wεs . Each point of a fiber N (q T ) reaches the lower level set
{f = c − ε} in time T under the downward gradient flow. Note that {f = c − ε}
intersects W u in the descending (k − 1)-sphere Sεu = ∂Wεu . Choose a tubular
neighborhood D of Sεu in {f = c − ε} to get a family of codimension-k disks Dq ,
one for each q ∈ Sεu . By [2, 3] we get a Lipschitz continuous (C 0,1 ) disk bundle

over ϕ−τ Wεu which is C 1,1 away from the ascending disk Wεs . It is a key fact
that the fibers are diffeomorphic to Wεs via C 1 maps GqT : Wεs → N (q T ) which
converge in C 1 to the identity on Wεs , as T → ∞. Furthermore, the fibration is
forward flow invariant in the sense that ϕs maps a fiber N (q T ) into N (ϕs q T ).
Figure 1 illustrates the fibration and the qualitative behavior of the forward
flow which is transverse to all fibers except the one over x which is invariant.

Conjugation by the diffeomorphism GqT provides on each fiber N (q T ) a copy θs
of the forward flow ϕs on Wεs . Now we reprove the cell attachment theorem.
Theorem (Milnor [1, I Thm. 3.2]). Let f : M → R be a smooth function, and
let x be a non-degenerate critical point with Morse index k. Setting f (x) = c,
suppose that f −1 [c − ε, c + ε] is compact and contains no critical point of f other
than x, for some ε > 0. Then, for all sufficiently small ε, the set M c+ε has the
homotopy type of M c−ε with a k-cell attached.
Proof. Fix a Riemannian metric on M . Without loss of generality assume that
−∇f is of compact support,1 so it generates a flow {ϕs }s∈R on M . Pick constants ε > 0 small and τ > 0 large in order to meet the assumptions in [3] of
Theorem 5.4 (existence of the invariant fibration N = Nxε,τ ) and Definition 5.6
(induced fiberwise semi-flow θ). Figure 2 illustrates the proof: First deform
N ⊂ M c+ε along θ towards the flow selector S + and Wεu , then deform along ϕ.
0. Definition of flow selector (hypersurface transverse to two flows): View
S + := {ϕ−s◦t− (p) p | p ∈ S − } ⊂ N
as graph of a function s ◦ t− over an open subset S − ⊂ f −1 (c − ε) where the
coordinate lines are backward flow lines of ϕ starting at S − with coordinate
the backward time. By the flow box theorem this makes sense, as there is no
singularity of ∇f on S − . By the graph property ϕ will be transverse to S + .
By [3, Thm. 1.2] there is a C 0 time label function t : N → [τ, ∞], of class C 1
as a function N× := N \ W s → [τ, ∞), which assigns to each point p the time
it takes to reach the lower level set f −1 (c − ε) under the gradient flow ϕ. The
hypersurface N + := {p ∈ N ∩ f −1 (c + ε) | t(p) < τ } is called the entrance set
+
of N and N×
:= N + \ W s its regularization; see Figure 1. As each point of

as an open subset of f −1 (c − ε); see Figure 2. Set t− = ∞ on Sεu . The function
s : (τ, ∞) → (τ, 2τ ),

t 7→ 2τ − τ 2 /t,

is smooth and extends continuously to [τ, ∞] such that s(τ ) = τ with s0 (τ ) = 1
and s(∞) = 2τ with s0 (∞) = 0; see Figure 2 for the corresponding graph S + .
Observe that critical points of s correspond precisely to tangencies of θ to the
+
hypersurface S×
:= S + \ W u . But s admits no critical points on (τ, ∞), so θ is
+
+
transverse to S× . This proves that S×
is a flow selector with respect to ϕ and θ.
1 Otherwise, substitute for −ρ∇f where ρ : M → R is a smooth compactly supported
cut-off function with ρ ≡ 1 on the compact set K := f −1 [c − ε, c + ε].

I. Strong deformation retraction r : M c+ε → M c−ε ∪ Wεu ∪ X via θ: Let
S be the region under the graph of S + , that is the region bounded by S − and S +
and the hypersurfaces indicated by dashed arrows in Figure 2. The arrows are
dashed to indicate that they do not belong to S, but to the closure S̄. Consider
the compact set X := f −1 [c − ε, c + ε] \ N ∪ S̄ whose boundary is given by
f −1 (c − ε) and f −1 (c + ε) \ N + ∪ S + . Deforming N \ S̄ along the flow lines of
θ until the flow line hits either the flow selector S + or the descending disk Wεu ,
while not moving the other points of M c+ε at all, defines the required strong

and
deformation retraction r. Continuity of r holds since θ is transverse to S×

S \ S× = S ∩ Wε is reached under θ in infinite time just as is Wε \ S.
II. Homotopy equivalence M c−ε ∪Wεu ∪X ∼ M c−ε ∪Wεu via ϕ: Given the
pair of closed sets A := M c−ε ⊂ (X ∪ A), consider the entrance time function
TA : X ∪ A → [0, ∞) which assigns to each point p ∈ X ∪ A the time it takes
to reach A under ϕ. To see that TA is well defined note that A and X ∪ A are
both forward flow invariant under ϕ. Indeed ∂A is a level set along which −∇f
is downward, hence
 inward, pointing. The (topological) boundary of X ∪ A is
f −1 (c + ε) \ N + ∪ S + and −∇f points inward along both pieces.
Given that ϕ is transverse to ∂X, the function TA is lower and upper semicontinuous, hence continuous, because the subset A of X ∪ A is closed and
forward flow invariant, respectively; cf. [2, Pf. of Thm. B]. Since X is compact
without critical points TA is bounded. The map h : [0, 1] × Z → Z given by


, p ∈ A = M c−ε ,
p
h(λ, p) = ϕλTA (p) p
, p ∈ X,


ϕλ4τ 2 /t(p) p , p ∈ Wεu \ S = ϕ−2τ Wεu .
is continuous as it is defined by three continuous parts which agree on overlaps:
TA = 0 on A ∩ X and TA = 4τ 2 /t = 2τ on ϕ−2τ Sεu . The inclusion ι : A ∪ Wεu =:
B ,→ Z := X ∪ A ∪ Wεu and h1 := h(1, ·) : Z → B are reciprocal homotopy
inverses. Indeed ι ◦ h1 = h1 ∼ h0 = idZ and h1 ◦ ι = h1 |B ∼ h0 |B = idB .
4

Part two of h1 unfortunately eliminates an outer piece of Wεu which we
recover by ϕ4τ 2 /t(·) (·) : ϕ−2τ Wεu → Wεu . So h1 does not restrict to the identity
on Wεu , hence h is not a deformation retraction of X ∪ A ∪ Wεu onto A ∪ Wεu .
Perspectives
In the history of Morse theory discontinuity of the flow trajectory end point
map ϕ∞ obstructed to carry out, in a simple fashion, various constructions
suggested by geometry, for instance, to extend continuously the inclusion map
of an unstable manifold towards the closure. It will be a future research project
to investigate the role of dynamical thickening and flow selectors in such cases.
By [2] dynamical thickening can be defined in infinite dimensional contexts.
Added in proof
Flow selector added to correct the discontinuity in previous version. Flow selectors arose in cooperation with Pietro Majer (2015) in two flavors - via Conley
blocks and via carving. Here we use a version of the Conley block technique.
