Abstract
We prove local existence of solutions for a class of suitably renormalised coupled
SPDE–ODE systems driven by space-time white noise, where the space dimension
is equal to 2 or 3. This class includes in particular the FitzHugh–Nagumo system
describing the evolution of action potentials of a large population of neurons, as well
as models with multidimensional gating variables. The proof relies on the theory of
regularity structures recently developed by M. Hairer, which is extended to include
situations with semigroups that are not regularising in space. We also provide explicit
expressions for the renormalisation constants, for a large class of cubic nonlinearities.

Introduction

Many spatially extended systems can be described by a reaction-diffusion equation coupled
to an ordinary differential equation, of the form
∂t u = D∆x u + F (u, v) ,
∂t v = G(u, v) ,

(1.1)

where u = u(t, x) and v = v(t, x) are functions of time t > 0 and space x ∈ Rd and take
values in Rm and Rn respectively, ∆x denotes the usual Laplacian, D ∈ Rm×m is a positive
definite matrix of diffusion coefficients, and F : Rm × Rn → Rm and G : Rm × Rn → Rn
are given sufficiently smooth functions. A well-studied situation of this kind arises in
neuroscience, where x ∈ R measures the position along a neuron’s axon, u(t, x) ∈ R is the
membrane potential at time t and position x, and the so-called gating variables v ∈ Rn
describe the number of open ion channels of n different types. Classical examples are the
Hodgkin–Huxley model [24] and its simplifications such as the Morris–Lecar model [32] and
the FitzHugh–Nagumo model [15, 33]. However, there are many more interesting situations
outside neuroscience that can be described by coupled systems of the form (1.1), for
instance in chemical kinetics [40], in population dynamics [8], and in pattern formation [2].
Furthermore, many other classical reaction-diffusion equations from mathematical biology,
such as the Keller-Segel [25] or the Gray-Scott model [16] are of the form (1.1) if one regards
the model parameters v not as constants via ∂t v = 0 but as (slowly-)changing parameters
e v) for some small parameter 0 < ε̃ ≪ 1 [28] and some smooth vector field
via ∂t v = ε̃G(u,

e In fact, the number of applications of systems of the form (1.1) goes far beyond the
G.
areas we mentioned here.
However, in some cases, a deterministic model of the form (1.1) is not sufficient to
describe the dynamics, and one has to add a stochastic term to capture the effect of thermal
fluctuations and other unresolved dynamical processes affecting the system. In the case
of neuron dynamics, see for instance the book and recent survey by Tuckwell [38, 37] and
the recent reviews by Bressloff [6, 7]. In particular, stochastic versions of the FitzHughNagumo PDE have attracted considerable recent attention [36, 39, 34] as well as related
models of stochastic neural fields [29, 27]. In the derivation of these models and in related
numerical studies, one frequently uses correlated [31] as well as space-time white noise [1]
stochastic forcing.
Before studying properties of solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation
(SPDE) with space-time white noise, one has to ensure that such an equation is welldefined, i.e., one has to attach a meaning of “solution” to a given SPDE. Depending on
the space dimension d, this problem may in fact be extremely hard. Consider the case of
a one-component system (m = 1, n = 0, D ≡ 1) of the form
∂t u = ∆x u + F (u) + ξ ,

(1.2)

where ξ denotes space-time white noise (precise mathematical definitions will be given
below). If d = 1, it is possible to define a notion of mild solution via the Duhamel
principle in a quite general setting (see for instance [11]). In higher space dimension, the
problem is much more difficult, owing to the fact that space-time white noise is extremely
singular.
Consider for instance the case of the Allen–Cahn equation given by (1.2) with F (u) =
au − u3 (if a = 0 this is also known in quantum field theory as the dynamical Φ4d model,
cf [13]). In the case d = 1, the proof of existence of a unique solution goes back to Faris
and Jona-Lasinio [12], and many quantitative properties of this solution are known (see
for instance [9, 4, 3]). The two-dimensional case was solved by Da Prato and Debussche
using a particular class of Besov spaces [10]. The case d = 3, however, was only solved very
recently by Hairer, using his theory of regularity structures [19]. One of the difficulties
is that a renormalisation procedure has to be used to properly define solutions. This
is achieved by replacing space-time white noise ξ by a mollified version ξ ε , solving the
resulting regularised equation, and passing to the limit of vanishing regularisation (for an
alternative approach, see [30]).
The theory of regularity structures provides a framework to study SPDEs with very
singular noise, including but not limited to parabolic equations of the form (1.2). The
basic idea is to construct an abstract space in which one can define algebraic operations
on distributions (in the sense of generalised functions), such as multiplication, composition
with a smooth function, and convolution with a kernel. The fixed-point equation obtained
by applying Duhamel’s principle to the SPDE with mollified noise is then lifted to the abstract space, solved in that space, and finally projected down to a distribution in “physical”
space. In addition, the theory allows to incorporate the renormalisation procedure that
is needed in most cases; see for instance [18] for an introduction. Furthermore, there are
already several recent applications of regularity structures, e.g., to large deviation theory
of the Allen-Cahn equation [23], to the dynamical sine-Gordon model [22], to Wong-Zakai
approximation of nonlinear parabolic SPDEs [21], to the parabolic Anderson model on
bounded [19] as well as unbounded [20] domains, and to the KPZ equation [19, 17].

2

The purpose of the present work is to extend the theory of regularity structures to
multicomponent systems of the form
∂t u = ∆x u + F (u, v) + ξ ,
∂t v = G(u, v) .

(1.3)

The main result is the proof of existence, in space dimensions d = 2 and 3, of local solutions
to the system (1.3) when F is a cubic polynomial and G is linear. This includes the case
of the standard FitzHugh–Nagumo model, but also other equations such as the Koper
model [26] with diffusion in the fast component, which features vectorial variables v. We
will mostly focus on the case d = 3, first because this is the physically relevant case in
many applications, but also because it is the technically more challenging case (the Allen–
Cahn equation is known not to be renormalisable for d > 4, so the same will hold a fortiori
for multicomponent systems with cubic nonlinearities).
The main technical difficulty that has to be overcome to obtain these results comes
from the fact that the semigroup associated with the second equation in (1.3) is not at
all regularising in space. Though one expects that this loss of regularisation is somehow
compensated by the fact that no singular noise term acts on the equation for v, the
general theory in [19] cannot be applied directly, because it uses in an essential way the
assumption that the heat kernel is smooth everywhere except at the origin. Therefore,
we have to extend the regularity structure constructed for the Allen–Cahn equation with
new abstract symbols representing integration with respect to a singular kernel, and to
prove suitable bounds involving these symbols. Furthermore, one has to analyse which
role new symbols play in the renormalisation. We find that certain terms involving the
singular kernel do not have to be renormalised, while on the other hand, general cubic
nonlinearities yield renormalisation terms which do not appear in the Allen–Cahn case.
The remainder of this work is organised as follows. Section 2 contains all main local
existence results. Section 3 gives a summary of the most important aspects of the theory of
regularity structures contained in [19], illustrated in the case of the Allen–Cahn equation.
In Section 4, we present our results allowing to represent the operation of integration with
respect to a singular kernel. Section 5 contains the fixed-point argument proving local
existence and uniqueness of solutions for the SPDE with mollified noise, and Section 6
deals with the renormalisation procedure which is necessary to pass to the limit of vanishing
mollification. Finally, in Section 7 we complete the proofs of the main results.
Notations: We write |x| to denote either the absolute value of x ∈ R or the ℓ1 -norm of
x ∈ Rd , while kxk denotes the Euclidean norm of x ∈ Rd . If a, b ∈ R we use a ∧ b :=
min{a, b} and a ∨ b := max{a, b}. If f, g are two real-valued functions depending on small
parameters ε, δ, . . . (which will be clear from the context), we write f . g to indicate that
there exists a constant C > 0 such that f 6 Cg holds uniformly in the small parameters.
We use the notation f ≍ g to indicate that we have both f . g and g . f .

Results

2.1

The standard FitzHugh–Nagumo equation

We start by considering the particular case of the standard FitzHugh–Nagumo SPDE,
given by
∂t u = ∆x u + u − u3 + v + ξ ,
∂t v = a1 u + a2 v .

(2.1)

P
Here ∆x = dj=1 ∂x2j is the usual Laplacian, u and v are functions of time t > 0 and space
x ∈ Td (the torus in dimension d = 2 or d = 3), ξ stands for space-time white noise on
R × Td , and a1 , a2 a real parameters. As such, the system (2.1) is not well-posed, and a
renormalisation procedure is required to define a notion of solution. To do this, we first
choose a rescaled mollifier

where ̺ : Rd+1 → R is a smooth compactly supported function of integral 1. We set
ξ ε = ̺ε ∗ ξ, where the star stands for space-time convolution, and consider the sequence

∂t uε = ∆x uε + 1 + C(ε) uε − (uε )3 + v ε + ξ ε ,
∂t v ε = a1 uε + a2 v ε ,

(2.3)

where C(ε) ∈ R. Then our first result is the following, which is close in spirit to [19,
Thm. 1.15].
Theorem 2.1 (Standard FitzHugh–Nagumo SPDE). Assume u0 belongs to the Hölder
space C η for some η > − 23 , and v0 belongs to the Hölder space C γ for some γ > 1. Then
there exists a choice of the constant C(ε) such that the system (2.3) with initial condition
(u0 , v0 ) admits a sequence of local solutions (uε , v ε ), converging in probability to a limit
(u, v) as ε → 0. This limit is independent of the choice of mollifier ̺.
The proof of this theorem and the two next ones is given in Section 7. For the precise
definition of Hölder spaces C η with negative index, we refer to Definition 3.3 below. By
local solution we mean that for any cut-off L > 0, the solution is defined up to the random
time when the C η -norm of (uε , v ε ) first reaches L. In other words, we cannot exclude the
possibility of finite-time blow-up.
The constant C(ε) admits an explicit expression in terms of the heat kernel1

Below, the renormalisation constants will rather be defined in terms of a truncated version of the heat
kernel. This does however not affect their singular parts (terms of order ε−1 and log(ε−1 )).

where Qε0 (z) = Gε (z1 )Gε (z1 − z) dz1 . In particular, it has been known since the works
of Feldman and Osterwalder [13, 14] that
C(ε) =

C1
+ C2 log(ε−1 ) + C3
ε

(2.6)

for some constants C1 , C2 , C3 ∈ R. The constants C1 and C3 depend on the choice of
mollifier ̺, while C2 is independent of ̺ (cf. [18, Rem. 6.2]).
In dimension d = 2, one can show (cf. [23, Rem. 2.14]) that the renormalisation
constant is given by

C(ε) = 3
ε (z) dz =

for some constant C3 ∈ R, depending again on the choice of ̺.
The proof of Theorem 2.1 will also provide some information on the structure of the
solutions. Indeed, we always have
uε (t, x) = χε (t, x) + ϕε (t, x) ,

(2.8)

where χε = G(d) ∗ξ ε is the stochastic convolution of heat kernel and noise, and ϕε converges
to a function (as opposed to a distribution). In other words, the only singular term in the
limit ε → 0 is given by limε→0 χε = G(d) ∗ ξ, which is independent of the nonlinear term
in the equation. The function v ε (t, x) has the same structure, as it can be represented in
terms of uε by solving a linear inhomogeneous equation.

2.2

More general cubic nonlinearities

We can now extend the above results to a more general class of systems, of the form
∂t u = ∆x u + F (u, v) + ξ ,
∂t v = a1 u + a2 v ,

(2.9)

where F is a cubic polynomial of the form
F (u, v) = α1 u + α2 v + β1 u2 + β2 uv + β3 v 2 + γ1 u3 + γ2 u2 v + γ3 uv 2 + γ4 v 3 .
In that case, the renormalised equations take the form


∂t uε = ∆x uε + F (uε , v ε ) + C0 (ε) + C1 (ε)uε + C2 (ε)v ε + ξ ε ,
∂t v ε = a1 uε + a2 v ε ,

(2.10)

(2.11)

where C0 (ε), C1 (ε), C2 (ε) ∈ R, and we have the following result:
Theorem 2.2 (General cubic nonlinearities). Assume u0 and v0 satisfy the same assumptions as in Theorem 2.1. Assume further that either d = 2, or d = 3 and γ2 = 0.
Then there exists a choice of constants C0 (ε), C1 (ε) and C2 (ε) such that the system (2.11)
with initial condition (u0 , v0 ) admits a sequence of local solutions (uε , v ε ), converging in
probability to a limit (u, v) as ε → 0. This limit is independent of the choice of mollifier ̺.

5

Note that in dimension d = 3, we assume that F contains no term of the form γ2 u2 v.
This is because the method we use does not yield a simple form for the renormalised
equation if such a term is present (see Section 6.3), which is an indirect consequence of
the fact that the equation for v is not regularising in space (cf. Section 4.2). It is not clear
at this stage whether this is just a technical artefact, or whether it has a deeper meaning.
The renormalisation constants can again be computed explicitly to leading order. They
are given by
1
C0 (ε) = − β1 C(ε) ,
3
C1 (ε) = −γ1 C(ε) ,
1
C2 (ε) = − γ2 C(ε) ,

for d = 3 and by (2.7) for d = 2. Note in particular that these constants depend only on
the coefficients of u2 , u2 v and u3 in F .

2.3

Vectorial gating variables

Another generalisation of interest is to systems with vectorial variables v, of the form
∂t u = ∆x u + F (u, v) + ξ ,
∂t v = uA1 + A2 v ,

(2.14)

where v(t, x) takes values in Rn . Here A1 ∈ Rn is a constant vector, and A2 ∈ Rn×n is a
square matrix, while F is again a cubic polynomial in u and the vi . This allows for instance
to consider the Koper model [26] with spatial diffusion and space-time white noise in the
fast variable; for the stochastic Koper model without the Laplacian representing spatial
diffusion see [5]. The reaction terms of one version of the Koper model can be written in
the form (2.14) with

(2.16)

for constants C0 (ε), C1 (ε), C2,i (ε) ∈ R. Indeed, we have the following result.
Theorem 2.3 (Vectorial variables v). Assume u0 and the components of v0 satisfy the
same assumptions as u0 and v0 in Theorem 2.1. Assume further that either d = 2, or
d = 3 and F (u, v) has no terms in u2 vi . Then there exists a choice of constants C0 (ε),
C1 (ε), C2,i (ε) such that the system (2.16) with initial condition (u0 , v0 ) admits a sequence
of local solutions (uε , v ε ), converging in probability to a limit (u, v) as ε → 0. This limit
is independent of the choice of mollifier ̺.

the initial equation (2.14). Writing

i = 1, . . . , n ,

where C(ε) is again the constant defined in (2.13) for d = 3 and in (2.7) for d = 2.
Note that in the particular case of the Koper model, C1 (ε) is equal to the constant C(ε)
obtained for the FitzHugh–Nagumo equation, while all other constants vanish. This is not
surprising, since both models have the same nonlinearity.
Remark 2.4. The notion of local subcriticality given in [19, Assumption 8.3] suggests that
the class of renormalisable SPDE–ODE models of the form (1.3) is larger than the one
considered here. More precisely, in dimension d = 3, one would expect models with quartic
F and linear G to be renormalisable, as well as models with F quartic in u and quadratic
in v and G quadratic in u and linear in v. The reason we did not include them in our
analysis is a technical one: quartic F would produce solutions whose singular component
is not homogeneous in space and time, as in (2.8). The way in which we lift the singular
kernel to the regularity structure is not able to deal with such situations (see Section 4.2
below). We plan to further investigate this issue in future work. ♦

Regularity structure for the Allen–Cahn equation

This section serves the double purpose of giving a very brief account of the theory of
regularity structures contained in [19], and of describing a regularity structure for the
Allen–Cahn equation
∂t u = ∆x u + u − u3 + ξ ,
(3.1)
Pd

where ∆x = j=1 ∂xj is the usual Laplacian, ξ = ξ(t, x) denotes space-time white noise
on R × Td where Td denotes the d-dimensional torus with d = 2 or d = 3, and we seek a
solution u : [0, T ] × Td → R for a given initial condition u0 = u(0, x) in a suitable function
space. The regularity structure for (3.1) will serve as our starting point to build a larger
structure allowing to represent the FitzHugh–Nagumo equation.
By Duhamel’s principle, one possible solution concept for (3.1) is to consider the following integral equation
Z t

et∆x

denotes the semigroup of the heat equation compatible with the boundwhere S(t) =
ary conditions and us := u(s, ·), ξs := ξ(s, ·). The purpose of a regularity structure is to
provide an abstract space in which one can construct a fixed point of (3.2) when ξ is
replaced by a mollified version ξ ε . Then the idea is to take the limit ε → 0, and to project
the solution to a distribution on [0, T ] × Td , where “distribution” is understood in the
sense of a “generalized function” representing a sample path.

3.1

Regularity structures

Definition 3.1 ([19, Def. 2.1]). A regularity structure is a triple (A, T, G) consisting of
(R1) an index set A ⊂ R, containing 0, which is bounded from below and locally finite;
L
(R2) a model space T , which is a graded vector space T = α∈A Tα , where each Tα is a
Banach space; the space T0 is isomorphic to R and its unit is denoted 1;
(R3) a structure group G of linear operators acting on T , such that
M
Γτ − τ ∈
Tβ =: Tα−
(3.3)
β<α

holds for every Γ ∈ G, every α ∈ A and every τ ∈ Tα ; furthermore, Γ1 = 1 for
every Γ ∈ G.
Example 3.2. A simple but important example of regularity structure is the polynomial
regularity structure for d variables. In that case, A = N0 is the set of non-negative integers.
For ℓ ∈ N0 , Tℓ is the space of homogeneous polynomials in d variables of degree ℓ. It is
spanned by the monomials X k = X1k1 . . . Xdkd for which |k| = k1 + · · · + kd = ℓ. Finally,
the structure group G is defined by
Γh (X k ) = (X − h)k ,

h ∈ Rd .

(3.4)

This group is isomorphic to Rd , and one easily sees that Γh satisfies the requirement (3.3).
The interpretation of G is that it allows to convert a Taylor expansion around a point
x ∈ Rd into the expansion around another point x + h. 
We will henceforth denote by T the polynomial regularity structure with d+1 variables
X0 , . . . , Xd , where X0 represents the time variable. Since the linear part of the Allen–Cahn
equation is given by a parabolic operator, it turns out to be useful to make the time variable
“count double”. This is done by defining the parabolic scaling
s = (2, 1, . . . , 1) ∈ Nd+1 ,

(3.5)

k
k
acting on Rd+1 and declaring that a monomial
Pd X has homogeneity |X |s = |k|s where
the scaled degree is defined by |k|s = 2k0 + i=1 ki .
The regularity structure of the Allen–Cahn equation (3.3) in Rd is built by enlarging
T , i.e., by adding new symbols other than the polynomial symbols X k to T (see [23]). The
noise is represented by a symbol Ξ. In order to account for the fact that space-time white
noise has Hölder regularity α for any α < −(d + 2)/2, we set

α0 = −

d+2
−κ
2

(3.6)

where κ > 0 will be chosen sufficiently small in the sequel, and declare that Ξ has homogeneity |Ξ|s = α0 .
The set of symbols is equipped by a product, which by definition is commutative
and associative with unit 1. The product of two elements τ, σ ∈ T has homogeneity
|τ σ|s := |τ |s + |σ|s . Furthermore, integration against the heat kernel is represented by a
map I : T → T , which by definition satisfies |I(τ )|s := |τ |s + 2, in order to account for
the regularizing effect of the heat kernel.
Let F be the set containing all possible products of symbols 1, Ξ, Xi and their images
by I, and denote by H = span(F) the vector space spanned by all these symbols. This is

be needed. Let U be the smallest set containing 1, Xi and I(Ξ), and such that
τ1 , τ2 , τ3 ∈ U

⇒

I(τ1 τ2 τ3 ) ∈ U .

(3.7)

We then set
FF = {Ξ} ∪ {τ1 τ2 τ3 : τi ∈ U } ,

(3.8)

and define the model space as being the vector space T = span(FF ) spanned by FF . The
index set is then defined as
	

(3.9)
A = |τ |s : τ ∈ FF .

The model space T admits a natural grading
M
T =
Tγ

(3.10)

γ∈A

obtained by letting Tγ be the vector space spanned by elements of homogeneity γ. We
equip each Tγ with a norm k·kγ ; the choice of norm is irrelevant since [19, Lemma 8.10]
shows the (nontrivial) fact that all Tγ are finite-dimensional.
9

Table 1 shows the elements in FF of lowest homogeneity, using a graphical representation introduced by Hairer. Each symbol Ξ is denoted by a dot, and integration with
respect to I is denoted by a vertical line pointing downwards. For instance, I(Ξ) = .
Multiplication of symbols is represented by joining them at the base, so for instance
I(Ξ)2 =
.
Finally, we have to extend the definition of the structure group G, which is the most
involved part of the construction. The first step is to introduce a set F+ ⊂ F, which
contains all formal expressions of the type
Y
J kj τj ,
(3.11)
Xk
j

where τj ∈ F and the multiindices kj are such that |τP
j |s + 2 − |kj |s > 0. By definition, an
expression of the form (3.11) has homogeneity |k|s + j (|τj |s + 2 − |kj |s ), which is always
strictly positive, except for the element 1, which has homogeneity 0. The set FF+ ⊂ F+ is
defined similarly, but with τj ∈ FF . We set H+ = span(F+ ) and T + = span(FF+ ).
The last ingredient is given by a bilinear map ∆ : H → H ⊗ H+ defined by setting
∆1 = 1 ⊗ 1 ,

∆Xi = Xi ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ Xi ,

∆Ξ = Ξ ⊗ 1 ,

while Jk τ is a new formal symbol otherwise. Table 1 also shows ∆(τ ) for the first few
elements of FF .

those satisfying hg, τ σi = hg, τ ihg, σi for all τ, σ ∈ H+ . Then G is obtained by identifying
elements of G⋆ acting the same way on T + . The action of G on T is defined by
(g, τ ) 7→ Γg τ = (Id ⊗g)∆τ .

(3.15)

The fact that (A, T, G) constructed in this way is indeed a regularity structure is proved
in [19, Thm. 8.24].

3.2

Models and reconstruction theorem

A regularity structure can be used to represent an SPDE as a fixed-point problem in an
abstract space. One also has to provide a connection between the abstract space and
the “physical” space the solution lives in. First, we need to introduce a version of the
classical Hölder spaces C α on Rd+1 . In order to take the parabolic scaling into account,
the Euclidean norm is replaced by
k(t, x)ks = |t|1/2 +

Denote
L by h1, ·i the element of the dual of T defined by h1, 1i = 1 and h1, τ i = 0 for all
τ ∈ γ6=0 Tγ . If α > 0, the space Csα is defined as the set of all functions ϕ : Rd+1 → R
such that there exists a function ϕ̂ : Rd+1 → Tα− such that h1, ϕ̂(z)i = ϕ(z) for every
z = (t, x) ∈ Rd+1 and such that for every compact set K ⊂ Rd+1 the estimate
|ϕ̂(z + h) − Γh ϕ̂(z)|β . |h|α−β
s

(3.17)

holds uniformly over β < α, |h|s 6 1 and z ∈ K (cf [19, Def. 2.14]). Lemma 2.12 in [19]
shows that in the case of the Euclidean scaling s = (1, . . . , 1), this definition coincides with
the usual definition of Hölder spaces.
If α < 0, Csα can be defined in a natural way as a subset of Schwarz distributions
′
r the space of functions of class C r which
S (Rd+1 ) as follows. Given r ∈ N, denote by Bs,0
are supported in the set {z ∈ Rd+1 : kzks 6 1}.
Definition 3.3 ([19, Def. 3.7]). Assume α < 0 and let r = −⌊α⌋. A Schwarz distribution
υ ∈ S ′ (Rd+1 ) belongs to Csα if it belongs to the dual of C0r and for every compact set
K ⊂ Rd+1 , there exists a constant C such that

(3.19)

Next we introduce the notion of a model associated with a regularity structure (A, T, G).
Definition 3.4 ([19, Def. 2.17]). A model for a regularity structure (A, T, G) with scaling s
is a pair (Π, Γ), defined by a collection {Πz : T → S ′ (Rd+1 )}z∈Rd+1 of continuous linear
maps and a map Γ : Rd+1 × Rd+1 → G with the following properties.
(M1) Γzz = Id is the identity of G and Γzz ′ Γz ′ z ′′ = Γzz ′′ for all z, z ′ , z ′′ ∈ Rd+1 .
(M2) Πz ′ = Πz Γzz ′ for all z, z ′ ∈ Rd+1 .

In the case of the Allen–Cahn equation with mollified noise ξ ε := ξ ∗ ̺ε , where ̺(t, x)
is a mollifier and ̺ε (t, x) = ε−(d+2) ̺(t/ε2 , x/ε), a canonical way of building a model
Z ε = (Πε , Γε ) proceeds as follows. First, we can just define
(Πεz Ξ)(z̄) = ξ ε (z̄) ,
(Πεz X k )(z̄) = (z̄ − z)k ,
(Πεz τ τ̄ )(z̄) = (Πεz τ )(z̄)(Πεz τ̄ )(z̄)

∀τ, τ̄ ∈ T .

(3.22)

To also include the integration map in the fixed point problem let G = G(t, x) be the heat
kernel defined as the fundamental solution associated to ∂t u = ∆x u. We split the heat
kernel G as
G = R+K ,
(3.23)
where K : (Rd+1 \{0}) → R is a singular part satisfying specific algebraic properties, while
R : Rd+1 → R is a smooth part. The properties of K are:
P
• K is supported in {|x|2 + |t| 6 1} where |x| = dj=1 |xj |;
• K(t, x) = 0 for t 6 0 and K(t, −x) = K(t, x) for all (t, x);
• we have

and K(t, x) is smooth for |x|2 + |t| > 12 ;
• furthermore, one has vanishing moments
Z
K(t, x)P (t, x) dx dt = 0

(3.25)

Rd+1

for all polynomials P of parabolic degree less or equal some fixed ζ > 2.
Lemma 5.5 in [19] shows that such a splitting indeed exists and also the vanishing
moments condition holds for K; both parts K, R then satisfy a number of derivative
bounds. Furthermore, it follows from Lemma 5.5 in [19] that there exists a decomposition
X
K(z − z ′ ) =
Kn (z − z ′ )
(3.26)

where n ∈ N0 and suitable derivative bounds and vanishing moment conditions hold for
each of the kernels Kn . With this construction, the abstract integration map is represented
by the Taylor-series-like expression

(3.28)

Note that in the more general kernel case K = K(z, z̄) one has to replace D ℓ by D1ℓ and
the subscript indicates derivative with respect to the first argument. The second term
in the definition (3.27) of Πεz Iτ may seem somewhat strange, and will be motivated in
the next section. Note that it should really be interpreted by applying both sides to test
functions, i.e., for all smooth compactly supported functions ψ and all τ ∈ Tα one requires

The group elements Γεz z̄ are then simply defined by
Γεz z̄ = (Fzε )−1 Fz̄ε

where Fzε = Γfzε

(3.31)

(recall that Fzε is invertible because fzε is grouplike). In this way, the algebraic property
(M1) of Definition 3.4 is automatically satisfied. Regarding the algebraic property (M2),
we can note the following relations. Using Sweedler’s notation [35], we write ∆τ = τ (1) ⊗
τ (2) , although ∆τ is usually a sum of such terms. Let further γzεz̄ denote the element of
the structure group such that Γεz z̄ = Γεγzεz̄ . Then we have by (3.15)
Πεz Γεz z̄ τ = Πεz (Id ⊗γzεz̄ )∆τ = Πεz τ (1) hγzεz̄ , τ (2) i .

(3.32)

Property (M2) thus amounts to the relation
Πz̄ε τ = Πεz τ (1) hγzεz̄ , τ (2) i ,

(3.33)

which provides some intuition for the meaning of ∆. It is easy to check that this relation
holds for elements τ of the polynomial regularity structure. In the general case, the fact
that Z ε = (Πε , Γε ) is indeed a model is a nontrivial fact, proved in [19, Prop. 8.27].
Remark 3.5. It is very important to realise that the canonical model just built is not the
only possible model for a given regularity structure. This freedom in the choice of model
will be used when introducing the renormalisation procedure. All models, however, will
share many properties with the canonical model. The only rule that will be modified is
the product rule Πεz (τ τ̄ ) = Πεz (τ )Πεz (τ̄ ).
We can now introduce the spaces D γ , which play an analogous role as the Csα on the
level of the regularity structure.
Definition 3.6 ([19, Def. 3.1]). Let γ ∈ R. Given a model Z = (Π, Γ), the space D γ =
D γ (Z) consists of all functions f : Rd+1 → Tγ− such that for every compact set K ⊂ Rd+1
one has
|||f |||γ;K := sup supkf (z)kβ +

(3.34)

In the particular case of the polynomial regularity structure, it is again quite straightforward to check that the requirement (3.34) is equivalent to f being the Taylor expansion
of an element of the Hölder space Csγ . The spaces D γ depend on the model via Γ, but not
on Π, cf [19, Remark 3.4]. In order to compare elements of D γ for different models, it is
useful to introduce
|||f ; f¯|||γ;K = kf − f¯kγ;K +

(which is in general not a function of f − f¯), where
kf − f¯kγ;K = sup sup kf (z) − f¯(z)kβ .

(3.36)

z∈K β<γ

The central result allowing to link elements in D γ and in Csα is the reconstruction
theorem [19, Thm 3.10]. It states that if α∗ = min A and given r > |α∗ | there exists, for
any γ ∈ R, a continuous linear map R : D γ → Csα∗ such that

holds uniformly over all test functions η ∈ Bs,0
The constant C > 0 depends only on γ and on the regularity structure, and the set K̄ is
the 1-fattening of K (i.e., the points at distance at most 1 from K). If γ > 0, then (3.37)
defines R uniquely. The reconstruction theorem also provides bounds on the dependence
of R on the model (Π, Γ). Heuristically, (3.37) states that Rf locally looks like Πz f (z)
near any point z ∈ Rd+1 , up to terms of order γ.

3.3

Lifting the convolution maps

We can now lift the operation of convolution with the heat kernel to the space D γ (Z).
The requirement (3.25) is for compatibility with the condition that I should define an
abstract integration map of order 2 in the sense of [19, Def. 5.7], namely
• I : Tα → Tα+2 for every α ∈ A;
• Iτ = 0 for every τ in T ;
• I Γτ − ΓIτ ∈ T for every τ ∈ T and every Γ ∈ G.
The central result is given by the so-called multilevel Schauder estimates [19, Thm 5.12],
which state in particular that for all γ ∈ R such that γ + 2 6∈ N, there exists a map
Kγ : D γ → D γ+2 such that
RKγ f = K ∗ Rf
(3.38)
holds for all f ∈ D γ . In other words, the following diagram commutes:
Kγ

Dγ

The map Kγ has the following expression. For any f ∈ D γ ,
(Kγ f )(z) = If (z) + J (z)f (z) + (Nγ f )(z) ,

(3.39)

where for each τ ∈ Tα ,

Note that the last two operators have values in T , the polynomial part of the regularity
structure, and that the only nonlocal operator is Nγ .
The rôle of the operators J and Nγ is to ensure that Kγ f has the properties required
to belong to D γ+2 , which would not be the case if one simply sets Kγ f = If . The maps
J are related to the coefficients Jkj appearing in (3.11); in fact, the Jkj τj play the rôle
of placeholders for the J (z)τ .
As for the smooth part R of the heat kernel, it can be lifted as in [19, (7.7)]. Namely,
with a smooth kernel R we associate maps Rγ : Csα∗ → D γ given by
X Xk
X Xk Z
D k R(z − z̄)υ(z̄) dz̄ :=
hυ, D k R(z − ·)i .
(Rγ υ)(z) =

|k|s <γ

|k|s <γ

It follows from [19, Prop 3.28] that for υ ∈ Csα∗ one has
(RRγ υ)(z) = hυ, R(z − ·)i ,
and thus
RRγ Rf = R ∗ Rf .

(3.43)

In other words, the following diagram commutes:
Dγ

Assume that for an appropriate choice of γ, one can find an element U ∈ D γ (Z ε )
satisfying the fixed-point equation
U = (Kγ̄ + Rγ R)R+ (Ξ + U − U 3 ) + Gu0 ,

(3.44)

for some γ̄ > γ − 2, where R+ (t, x) = 1{t>0} and Gu0 denotes a suitable lift of the
convolution in space of heat kernel and initial condition. Applying the reconstruction
operator R to both sides of this equation, one can show that u = RU satisfies
u = (K + R) ∗ (R+ [u − u3 + ξ ε ]) + Gu0 ,

(3.45)

which is equivalent to (3.2); in (3.45) we also use Gu0 as a notation for the usual convolution in space of heat kernel and initial condition. This is basically the strategy implemented
in Theorem 7.8 and Section 9.4 of [19], except that one has to deal with two additional
technical difficulties. The first one is that due to the singular behaviour of the heat kernel
as time goes to 0, the definition of the space D γ has to be modified. We will apply this
modification to our case in Section 4.3. The second difficulty is that although a fixed point
exists for every mollification parameter ε > 0, it cannot converge as ε → 0. This is why a
renormalisation procedure is needed, which we will adapt to our case in Section 6.

Extension of the regularity structure

Our aim is now to extend the regularity structure built for the Allen–Cahn equation, in
order to allow to represent a family of coupled SPDEs–ODEs of the form
∂t u = ∆x u + F (u, v) + ξ ε ,
∂t v = uA1 + A2 v ,

(4.1)

where F (u, v) is a cubic polynomial, and A1 ∈ Rn , A2 ∈ Rn×n are either scalars as for the
classical FitzHugh–Nagumo case with n = 1, or a vector and a matrix if v has multiple
components. Duhamel’s formula allows us to represent (mild) solutions of (4.1) as
Z t


S(t − s) ξsε + F (us , vs ) ds + S(t)u0 ,
ut =
0
Z t
us Q(t − s) ds + etA2 v0 ,
(4.2)
vt =
0

where Q(t) := etA2 A1 . We thus have to lift to the regularity structure the operation of
time-integration with respect to Q, which has no smoothing effect in space.
In the case where v has values in Rn with n > 1, the kernel Q(t) is in fact a vector
of dimension n. In what follows, we will mainly deal with the case of scalar Q, since the
generalisation to the vectorial case is rather straightforward.

4.1

Extension theorem

Let us fix a finite time horizon T . Then we can always assume that the kernel Q satisfies
the following properties:
• Q(t) is supported on [0, 2T ] and smooth for t > 0;
• Q(t) = etA2 A1 for all t ∈ [0, T ].
The reason why this is allowed is that we will be interested in showing existence of solutions
on a sufficiently small interval [0, T ], so that the behaviour of Q outside this interval is
not going to matter. Also, since Q is bounded, it will not be necessary to decompose it
as a sum of Qn concentrated in sets of radius 2−n , as in the case of the heat kernel in [19,
Section 5], cf (3.26).
In order to be able to represent the time-integration map, we will have to extend our
regularity structure and the associated model. We do this by adding to T new symbols
denoted E(τ ), τ ∈ T \ T , which we represent by an open blue dot. Thus for instance we
write E(I(Ξ)) = E( ) = . In practice, we will only need to apply E to elements τ of
homogeneity |τ |s ∈ (−2, 0). We thus set V = {τ ∈ T : − 2 < |τ |s < 0} (V is called a
sector of T ). If τ 6∈ V , we simply set E(τ ) = 0. We also postulate that for τ ∈ V , E(τ )
has the same homogeneity as τ , and we choose the norm on the vector space generated
by the new symbols in such a way that
kE(τ )kα = kτ kα

∀α ∈ V .

(4.3)

The operator E defined in this way is an abstract integration map of order 0 on V in the
sense of [19, Def. 5.7], i.e.,
• E : V ∩ Tα → Tα for every α ∈ A;
• Eτ = 0 for every τ ∈ V ∩ T ;
16

• EΓτ − ΓEτ ∈ T for every τ ∈ V and every Γ ∈ G.
The first two properties are obvious by definition of Eτ , in particular we have V ∩ T = ∅.
Regarding the third property, we first extend the structure group by setting
∆(Eτ ) = (E ⊗ Id)∆τ .

(4.4)

The third required property of E is indeed satisfied since
Γg Eτ = (Id ⊗g)∆(Eτ ) = (E ⊗ g)∆τ = EΓg τ ,

(4.5)

so that in fact Γg Eτ − EΓg τ = 0 for all τ ∈ T and all g ∈ G.
Since E is not regularity-increasing, there can be in principle infinitely many symbols of
given homogeneity. The trick, however, will be to build the fixed-point map in such a way
that only finitely many new symbols are needed. In practice, it will turn out that the only
required new symbols are , and those obtained by applying I to existing symbols and/or
multiplying them. However, since it is of independent interest, we are going to describe
the extension procedure in a more abstract, inductive way. Given a subset W ⊂ V , on
which the canonical model Z ε = (Πε , Γε ) is defined, we want to extend the model to a
c = W ∪ {E(τ ) : τ ∈ W }. We can then apply the usual extension theorem [19,
larger set W
c ∪ {I(τ ) : τ ∈ W
c }, and so on as often as needed.
Thm 5.14] to extend the model to W
c goes as follows. Assume that Z ε already satisfies

for all z, z ′ ∈ Rd+1 .

(4.9)

The new symbol J Q is needed to ensure the property (Πεt,x Eτ )(t, x) = 0 when |τ |s > 0,
which is necessary when lifting the fixed-point equation. While this defines an extended
model with the required properties, the fact that Q acts by convolution in time only limits
the regularity of its lift to the regularity structure (cf. Remark 4.7 below). We will see in
the next subsection why it is sufficient to introduce new symbols Eτ only when |τ |s < 0. ♦

c . The following lemma
We now have to check that (Πε , Γε ) indeed defines a model on W

that

(for brevity we shall call K the 2T -fattening of K, although strictly speaking it is only a
fattening in the time direction).

holds for |t − t̄ | . 1. By treating separately the cases t > t̄ and t < t̄, one sees that the
left-hand side is always bounded above by a constant times (|t − t̄ | + 2T )1+α/2 , which is
bounded above for α > −2. Since on the other hand, the right-hand side is bounded below
by a positive constant for α < 0, the result follows.
Note that [19, Prop. 8.27] shows in particular that the assumption (4.11) is satisfied
by any canonical model for mollified noise Πε built as in Section 3.2.
We can now state the main result of this subsection, which is an adaptation of the
extension theorem [19, Thm. 5.14] and of [19, Prop. 8.27] to our degenerate situation.
Proposition 4.4 (Extension theorem for E). Let Z ε = (Πε , Γε ) be a model for the regularity structure (A, W, G), where W ⊂ V , and such that z̄ 7→ Πεz τ (z̄) is continuous and
c = W ∪ {Eτ : τ ∈ W }. Then Zbε = (Π
b ε, Γ
bε ) obtained
satisfies (4.11) for any ε > 0. Let W
c , G), which satisfies (4.12) for any
by extending Z ε in the above way is a model for (A, W
ε > 0. Furthermore,
b ε kγ;K = kΓε kγ;K
kΓ
(4.13)
holds for any γ ∈ R and any compact K ⊂ Rd+1 .
18

bε satisfies the assumptions (M1)–(M4) of Definition 3.4.
Proof: We have to prove that Z
Property (M1) is automatically satisfied owing to (4.7). Regarding property (M2), it
is known [19, Sec. 8.3] that there exists a linear map Πε : T → S ′ (Rd+1 ) such that
Πε τ = Πεz (Fzε )−1 τ is independent of z for any τ ∈ T . Property (M2) holds if we can find
for any τ ∈ W a distribution Πε (Eτ ), independent of (t, x), such that
ε
Πεt,x (Eτ ) = Πε Ft,x
(Eτ )

∀z = (t, x) ∈ Rd+1 .

To achieve this, we simply define Πε on the extended structure by
ε

(Π Eτ )(t̄, x̄) =

Z

t̄

Q(t̄ − s)(Πε τ )(s, x̄) ds .

t̄−2T

Indeed, we have (writing as usual ∆τ = τ (1) ⊗ τ (2) )
(Πε Fzε Eτ )(t̄, x̄) = Πε (E ⊗ fzε )∆τ (t̄, x̄)
= (Πε Eτ (1) )(t̄, x̄)hfzε , τ (2) i

Z

t̄−2T

Q(t̄ − s)(Πεz τ )(s, x̄) ds

= (Πεz Eτ )(t̄, x̄) .
To obtain the fourth line, we have used the fact that Πεz = Πε Fzε holds for the original
model, and thus
(Πεz τ )(s, x̄) = (Πεz Fzε τ )(s, x̄) = (Πεz (Id ⊗fzε )∆τ )(s, x̄) = (Πε τ (1) )(s, x̄)hfzε , τ (2) i .
Property (M3) is a direct consequence of (4.12). Indeed, this bound implies that for any

as required by (3.20). Finally, in order to prove Property (M4), we recall from (4.5) that
Γεz z̄ Eτ = EΓεz z̄ τ .
If |τ |s > 0, there is nothing to prove. If β < α = |τ |s < 0, then
kΓεz z̄ Eτ kβ = kEΓεz z̄ τ kβ = kΓεz z̄ τ kβ 6 kΓε kγ;K kτ kkz − z̄kα−β

for all z, z̄ ∈ K. This completes the proof that Zbε is a model, and also proves (4.13).

4.2

Multilevel Schauder estimates

We now would like to construct an operator KγQ : D γ → D γ which lifts the operation of
integration against Q to the regularity structure. Formally, this means that we should
have
RKγQ f = Kv ∗ Rf ,
Kv (t, x, t̄, x̄) = Q(t − t̄ )δ(x − x̄)
(4.14)
for all f ∈ D γ . In fact, this should really be interpreted as
Z t
Q
Q(t − t̄ )(Rf )(t̄, x) dt̄ ,
(RKγ f )(t, x) =

(4.15)

t−2T

or in terms of test functions
hRKγQ f, ψi = hRf, ψ̂i ,

(4.16)

where ψ̂ is defined by
ψ̂(t̄, y) :=

Z

Q(s − t̄ )ψ(s, y) ds =

Z

t̄+2T

Q(s − t̄)ψ(s, y) ds .

(4.17)

t̄

R

The problem with such a plan is that the kernel Kv being singular in space, we cannot
apply an expansion as in (3.40) and (3.41). However, for the class of equations we are
interested in, we do not actually need to define KγQ on all of D γ . It will be quite sufficient
to define it on a subset of D γ , which is given by the functions whose components with
negative homogeneity do not depend on (t, x). This motivates the following definition.
Definition 4.5. Let Z = (Π, Γ) be a model. The space D0γ (Z) = D0γ (Γ) is the space of
functions f ∈ D γ (Γ) of the form
X
X
f (z) =
cτ τ +
ĉτ (z)τ =: f− + f+ (z) ,
(4.18)
τ ∈T : −2<|τ |s <0

τ ∈T : |τ |s >0

where the cτ do not depend on z.
Remark 4.6. Not all constant functions belong to D0γ , as they still have to satisfy the
analytical bound (3.34), which includes the requirement kf (z)−Γz z̄ f (z̄)kβ = O(kz−z̄kγ−β )
as z → z̄ for all β < γ. In fact, since Γz z̄ τ = (Id ⊗γz z̄ )∆τ , we see that a sufficient condition
for having Γz z̄ τ = τ is
∆τ = τ ⊗ 1 .
(4.19)
Thus the sum defining f− should involve only terms cτ τ such that ∆τ = τ ⊗ 1. As can be
,
, and will
seen in Table 1, in our case this property is satisfied by the symbols Ξ, ,
for instance. Note that owing to (3.15)
also hold e.g. for , but it does not hold for
and (3.33), (4.19) implies Πz̄ τ = Πz τ for all z, z̄ ∈ Rd+1 , i.e., the model does not depend
on the base point z for these τ . ♦
With this notation in place, we define the operator KγQ on D0γ by
(KγQ f )(z)

= Ef− +

Z

t

Q(t − s)f+ (s, x) ds .

(4.20)

t−2T

Note that this definition indeed requires E to be defined only on symbols τ of strictly
negative homogeneity.
20

Remark 4.7. An alternative definition of KγQ , closer in spirit to (3.39), would be to set
(KγQ f )(z) = Ef (z) + JˆQ (z)f+ (z) + (NγQ f+ )(z) ,
where E is defined for positive-homogeneous terms as in Remark 4.1 and
Z t

(ε)

Q(t − s)(Rf+ − Πt,x f+ (t, x))(s, x) ds 1 .

While it is easily checked that KγQ defined in this way indeed satisfies (4.15), the problem
′
is that it typically does not map D γ into itself, but only into some D γ with γ ′ < 1. This is
due to the fact that we cannot Taylor-expand the kernel Kv in space, preventing us from
subtracting higher-order polynomial terms as in (3.41).
The following lemma on translation invariance of the canonical model Z ε = (Πε , Γε )
will allow us to prove that KγQ given by (4.20) satisfies the required properties. We give
its proof in Appendix A.
Lemma 4.8. Let (Πε , Γε ) be the canonical model defined by (3.22), (3.27) and (4.6). For
all h, z, z̄ ∈ Rd+1 , all τ ∈ T , all τ̄ ∈ F+ and all ε > 0, one has
Πεz+h τ (z̄ + h) = Πεz τ (z̄) ,
Γεz+h,z̄+h τ = Γεz z̄ τ ,
ε

(4.21)

The following result shows that the multilevel Schauder estimates contained in [19,
Thm. 5.12] also hold in the case of E, in a similar form.
Proposition 4.9 (Multilevel Schauder estimates on KγQ ). If γ > 0, then the operator KγQ
maps D0γ into D0γ , and satisfies
|||KγQ f |||γ;K 6 (1 ∨ kQkL1 )|||f |||γ;K ,
where kQkL1 =

Z

R

|Q(t)| dt =

(4.23)

holds for all f ∈ D0γ . Furthermore, if (Π, Γ) is a second translation-invariant model
Q
satisfying (3.27) and (4.6), and Kγ is the associated lift, then
Q
|||KγQ f ; Kγ f¯|||γ;K 6 (1 ∨ kQkL1 )|||f ; f¯|||γ;K

holds for all f ∈ D0γ (Γ) and f¯ ∈ D0γ (Γ).

21

(4.24)

Proof: We start by showing that relation (4.23) holds, assuming f, KγQ f ∈ D0γ . It follows
from the reconstruction theorem and its corollary [19, Prop. 3.28] (see also (4.11)) that

Rf+ (z) = h1, f+ (z)i = Πεz f+ (z) (z)

for all z ∈ Rd+1 . Furthermore, let

b − )(z̄) := Πεz f− (z̄) =
(Rf

X

cτ (Πεz τ )(z̄)

−2<|τ |s <0

(where the right-hand side actually does not depend on z, cf. Remark 4.6). Then we
b − trivially satisfies the reconstruction theorem, so that by uniqueness of the
see that Rf
reconstruction operator if γ > 0 we have
b − = Πεz f−
Rf− = Rf

whenever f− ∈ D0γ . Thus in fact


Rf (z) = Πεz f (z) (z)

holds for all z ∈ Rd+1 . It follows by (4.5) and the same argument as the one yielding
Rf− = Πz f− that
(REf− )(t, x) = (Πεt,x Ef− )(t, x)

Next we check that KγQ indeed maps D0γ into itself. Since E preserves homogeneity, it is
in fact sufficient to show that KγQ maps D0γ into D γ . First we note that for any β < γ,

but never both). Regarding terms evaluated in different locations, note that (4.5) implies
that

Collecting the estimates obtained and using the definition (3.34) of ||| · |||, we see that
KγQ f ∈ D γ and that it satisfies (4.22).
Consider finally the case where we have a second function f¯ ∈ D0γ (Γ). Using again (4.5),
it is immediate to see that
|||Ef− ; E f¯− |||γ;K 6 |||f− ; f¯− |||γ;K .

Writing ḡ(z) = Kγ f¯+ (z), it follows in the same way as above that

Using translation invariance of Γε and Γ, we obtain for all β < γ

from which (4.24) follows easily.

4.3

Extension to the space D γ,η

As already mentioned at the end of Section 3.3, the definition of the spaces D γ has to be
modified in order to be able to deal with the time-zero singularity of the heat kernel. In
particular, we have to check that the estimates on KγQ established in Proposition 4.9 still
hold in these modified spaces.
We recall a few notations from [19, Section 6]. Let P = {(t, x) ∈ Rd+1 : t = 0} denote
the time-zero hyperplane, and introduce the scaled norms
kzkP = 1 ∧ |t|1/2 ,

kz, z̄kP = kzkP ∧ kz̄kP = 1 ∧ |t|1/2 ∧ |t̄ |1/2 .

For a compact K ⊂ Rd+1 , let

Finally, similarly to Definition 4.5, we define D0γ,η to be the set of f ∈ D γ,η whose components with negative homogeneity do not depend on z.
Most of the results in [19, Section 6] are directly applicable to the present setting. The
only result that has to be adapted is Proposition 6.16, which takes here the following form.
Proposition 4.11 (Multilevel Schauder estimates on D0γ,η ). Let f ∈ D0γ,η (Γε ) with
−2 < η < 0< γ < η+2 ,

(4.30)

and assume that f+ (t, x) = 0 whenever t < 0. Then KγQ f ∈ D0γ,η (Γε ), and there exists a
constant C1 , depending only on Q, such that


(4.31)
|||KγQ f |||γ,η;K 6 C1 1 + kΓε kγ;K |||f |||γ,η;K ,

where K is the 2T -fattening of K. Furthermore, let f¯ ∈ D0γ,η (Γ), where (Π, Γ) is another
translation-invariant model satisfying (3.27) and (4.6), and assume that f¯+ (t, x) = 0
whenever t < 0. Then there exists a constant C2 , depending only on Q, such that

|||KγQ f ; Kγ f¯|||γ,η;K 6 C1 1 + kΓε kγ;K |||f ; f¯|||γ,η;K + C2 kf kγ,η;K kΓ − Γε kγ;K .

(4.32)

Proof: It follows as in the proof of Proposition 4.9 that

|||Ef− ; E f¯− |||γ,η;K 6 |||f− ; f¯− |||γ,η;K ,

|||Ef− |||γ,η;K 6 |||f− |||γ,η;K ,

so that we only have to consider the positive-homogeneous part f+ of f . For convenience,
we again write g(z) instead of (KγQ f+ )(z). Note that
kf+ kγ,η;K = sup sup

Since β < γ < η + 2, the integral is convergent and we have
kgkγ,η;K 6 CQ kf+ kγ,η;K ,
where CQ depends only on Q. In order to estimate |||g|||γ,η;K , we also need to bound
differences of the form g(z) − Γεz z̄ g(z̄). From now on we assume that z = (t, x) and
z̄ = (t̄, x̄) with t 6 t̄, since the case t > t̄ follows by symmetry. Using the fact that f+ is
supported on {t > 0} and translation invariance, we get

|Q(s)|kf+ (t − s, x) − Γεt−s,x;t̄−s,x̄ f+ (t̄ − s, x̄)kβ ds .

However, there is a difficulty because (z, z̄) ∈ KP does not automatically imply that one
has ((t − s, x), (t̄ − s, x̄)) ∈ KP . In fact,
((t − s, x), (t̄ − s, x̄)) ∈ KP ⇔ (1 ∧ |t − s| ∧ |t̄ − s|)1/2 > k(t − s, x) − (t̄ − s, x̄)ks
⇔ 1 ∧ |t − s| ∧ |t̄ − s| > kz − z̄k2s .
By definition of KP , we can assume that kz − z̄ks 6 1, so that s 6 t − kz − z̄k2s is a
sufficient condition for having ((t − s, x), (t̄ − s, x̄)) ∈ KP . We split the integration interval
into [0, t − kz − z̄k2s ] and [t − kz − z̄k2s , 2T ∧ t̄ ], and treat each interval separately. For the
first interval, we use the definition of |||f+ ||| to get

and estimate the integral of each term separately, in the same way as above. Combining
the different bounds, we obtain (4.32).
Remark 4.12. Note that the condition (4.30) on η and γ excludes integer values for these
parameters, except that we may have either η = −1 or γ = 1. The reason while these
integer values are allowed is that owing to the parabolic scaling, the exponents such as
(γ − η)/2 occurring in integrals over time can never take integer values that could make
them divergent.

The fixed-point equation

In this section, we construct a fixed-point equation lifting (4.2) to an appropriate space
D γ,η , and prove that it admits a unique fixed point, depending Lipschitz-continuously on
the lifted initial data and noise. The procedure is very similar to the one for the Allen–
Cahn equation or the Φ43 model carried out in [19, Section 9], with only a few adjustments
required by the additional variable v.

5.1

The set-up

From now on, we assume that the space dimension is d = 3, since this is the most difficult
case which is still renormalisable. Consider the fixed-point equation on D γ,η × D γ,η given
by


U = (Kγ̄ + Rγ R)R+ Ξ + F (U, V ) + Gu0 ,
b 0,
V = KγQ R+ U + Qv
(5.1)

where R+ (t, x) = 1{t>0} and γ̄ > γ − 2 as before, and by definition, RR+ Ξ is given by
the distribution ξ ε 1{t>0} . Furthermore,
Z
G(t, x − y)u0 (y) dy ,
(Gu0 )(t, x) = (S(t)u0 )(x) =

b 0 )(t, x) = etA2 v0 (x)1{t>0} .

In fact, these distributions have to be lifted to D γ,η , which is always possible by construction, cf [19, Def. 2.14]. In order to understand the structure of the solution of the
fixed-point equation (5.1), let us rewrite it in the form

Assume F is a cubic polynomial of the form

b3 = β3 + ϕγ3 + 3ψγ4 ,
and âi τ = Q(ai τ ), b̂i τ = Q(bi τ ). In (5.6), ̺U , ̺V denote terms of homogeneity at least

Pthat ϕ and ψ are differentiable. The scalar product notation h∇ϕ, Xi

Proposition 5.1 (Equivalence of fixed-point equations). Assume that ε > 0 and that (5.1)
admits a fixed point (U, V ) where U, V ∈ D γ,η for some γ, η ∈ R. Then (u, v) = (RU, RV )
satisfies the fixed-point equation (4.2).
Proof: The first step is to note that (3.27) and (4.6) imply
Z
ε
(Πz̄ )(z) = K(z − z1 )ξ ε (z1 ) dz1 =: χε (z) ,
Z
ε
(Πz̄ )(z) = K Q (z − z1 )ξ ε (z1 ) dz1 =: χQ
ε (z) ,
independently of z̄, where we have used the notation
Z 2T
K(t − s, x)Q(s) ds .
K Q (t, x) =
0

Note that both in dimensions d = 3 and d = 2, the sum in (3.27) is empty, because in
both cases has strictly negative homogeneity, cf. Table 1. Applying the reconstruction
operator R to (5.6), since all functions are smooth for ε > 0, we obtain
u(z) = χε (z) + ϕ(z) ,
v(z) = χQ
ε (z) + ψ(z) .
Here we have used the fact that if f+ ∈ D γ,η has only components of strictly positive
homogeneity, one has Rf+ (z) = (Πεz f+ (z))(z) = 0 (cf. (4.11) as well as [19, Prop. 3.28]).
On the other hand, using (3.38) and (3.43), we obtain for all f ∈ D γ,η

R(Kγ̄ + Rγ R)f (z) = (G ∗ Rf )(z) .
Applying R to the equations (5.1) and using (4.23), we thus obtain


u(t, x) = G ∗ RR+ Ξ + F (U, V ) (t, x) + Gu0 (t, x) ,
Z t
b 0 (t, x) .
(RR+ U )(s, x)Q(t − s) ds + Qv
v(t, x) =
0

It is not difficult to check that R and R+ commute. Thus the result follows if we are able
to show that
RF (U, V ) = F (RU, RV ) .
Computing the part of nonpositive homogeneity of the difference RF (U, V ) = F (RU, RV ),
we see that it is a linear combination of terms of the form
(Πεz

(Πεz

(Πεz

and (Πεz )(z)2 h∇ϕ, (Πεz X)(z)i ,

and all possible terms obtained from these by substitutions of the form 7→ . It follows
directly from (3.22) that (Πεz X)(z) = 0. It thus remains to show that all terms of the
three other types vanish as well. Applying (3.27), (3.28), and recalling (3.14) we obtain

The expansion (5.6) shows in particular that both U and V have regularity − 12 − κ,
and that their components of negative homogeneity do not depend on (t, x). We will thus
look for a fixed point of (5.6) in a space D0γ,η for appropriate values of γ and η.

5.2

Local existence and uniqueness of the fixed point

In order to describe the effect of F , it will be useful to introduce the following slight
γ,η
generalisation of Definition 4.5. Given a model (Π, Γ), the space Dβ,α
(Γ) is the space of
functions f ∈ D γ,η (Γ) of the form
X

τ ∈T : α6|τ |s <β

τ ∈T : |τ |s >β

where the cτ do not depend on z.
The following result establishes the strong local Lipschitz continuity of F in the sense
of [19, Section 7.3].
Proposition 5.3 (Strong local Lipschitz continuity). Fix α < 0 < γ and set γ̄ = γ + 2α
γ,η
and η̄ = 3η ∧ (η + 2α). Let K ⊂ Rd+1 be compact, and assume U, V ∈ D0,α
(Γ) are such
that

Then F (U, V ) ∈ D2α,3α

Proof: Writing U (z) = U− + U+ (z) where U− contains all terms of negative homogeneity
and applying [19, Prop. 6.12], we see that

In order to proceed, it is convenient to rewrite the fixed-point equation (5.1) in a
slightly different form. First we set
W := (Kγ̄ + Rγ R)R+ Ξ .

(5.13)

γ,η
For the time being, let us assume that W ∈ D0,α
for some γ ∈ R and all η < α0 + 2

(recall that α0 = − 2 − κ in dimension d = 3); we come back to this point in Remark 5.6
below. Then we define the map

b 0 + W + Gu0 .
(5.14)
M : U 7→ (Kγ̄ + Rγ R)R+ F U, KγQ R+ U + Qv

b 0 then (U, V ) is a fixed point of (5.1).
If U is a fixed point of M and V = KγQ R+ U + Qv
Following [19, Section 7.1], we write O = [−1, 2] × R3 and OT = (−∞, T ] × R3 , and
introduce the shorthand ||| · |||γ,η;T for ||| · |||γ,η;OT , and define ||| · ; · |||γ,η;T similarly. Finally, we
use the notation |||Z ; Z̄|||γ;K = kΠ − Πkγ;K + kΓ − Γkγ;K to quantify the difference between
two models. The following result is an adaptation of [19, Thm. 7.8].

Proposition 5.5 (Existence and uniqueness of the fixed point). Assume − 23 < η < − 21
and α > −1 are such that η + 2α > −2, and assume γ > −2α. For any u0 , v0 , W such
b 0 ∈ D γ,η , there exists a time T > 0 such that M admits a unique fixed

point U ∗ ∈ D γ,η on (0, T ). Furthermore, the solution map ST : (u0 , v0 , W, Z) 7→ U ∗ is
jointly Lipschitz continuous in the sense that if Z and Z̄ are two models and (u0 , v0 , W )
and (ū0 , v̄0 , W ) are two sets of initial conditions and forcing terms such that

then one has

γ,η
Proof: Given R > 0 let B(R) = {f ∈ D0,α
: |||f |||γ,η;T 6 R} and pick U ∈ B(R). By
Proposition 4.11, we have

b 0 ∈ B(C1′ R + |||Qv
b 0 |||γ,η;T )
V := KγQ U + Qv

for a constant C1′ depending only on Q and on the model. Applying Proposition 5.3, we

see that F (U, V ) ∈ D2α,3α
and satisfies

b 0 |||γ,η;T .
|||F (U, V )|||γ̄,η̄;T 6 C R + C1′ R + |||Qv

The assumptions on γ, η and α guarantee that γ̄ > 0 and η̄ > −2. We can thus apply
Theorem 7.1 and Lemma 7.3 in [19] to obtain the existence of constants C2 , κ > 0 such
that

b 0 |||γ,η;T + |||W |||γ,η;T + |||Gu0 |||γ,η;T
|||M(U )|||γ,η;T 6 C2 T κ/2 C R + C1′ R + |||Qv

for every T ∈ (0, 1]. Choosing



R = 1 + |||W |||γ,η;T + |||Gu0 |||γ,η;T

and T sufficiently small, we see that M maps the set B(R) into itself.
30

Next we show that M is a contraction in B(R). For U, U ∈ B(R), V as above and
b 0 , we have
V = KγQ U + Qv


M(U ) − M(U ) = (Kγ̄ + Rγ R)R+ F (U, V ) − F (U , V ) .

Using
again Theorem

 7.1 and Lemma 7.3 in [19] and applying (5.12) to bound the term
F (U, V ) − F (U , V ) , we get
b 0 |||γ,η;T
|||M(U ) − M(U )|||γ,η;T 6 C2 T κ/2 C R + C1′ R + |||Qv




|||U − U |||γ,η;T .

Taking again T small enough, we obtain that M is indeed a contraction, and the existence
of a unique fixed point in a ball in D γ,η follows from Banach’s fixed-point theorem.
Finally, in order to prove the bound (5.16), we set U1 = (Kγ̄ + Rγ R)R+ F (U, V ) and
U 1 = (Kγ̄ + Rγ R)R+ F (U , V ). Using the inequality
|||f + g ; f¯ + ḡ|||γ,η;T 6 |||f ; f¯|||γ,η;T + |||g ; ḡ|||γ,η;T
we obtain
|||M(U ) ; M(U )|||γ,η;T 6 |||U1 ; U 1 |||γ,η;T + |||W ; W |||γ,η;T + |||Gu0 ; Gū0 |||γ,η;T ,
where the first term on the right-hand side can be estimated with the help of (5.11). The
required bound thus follows from [19, Thm. 7.1 and Lemma 7.3].
Remark 5.6. In fact, Proposition 5.5 can be applied as soon as we choose γ > 1. Indeed,
let α = − 12 − κ and assume γ = 1 + κ̄ for some κ̄ > 0.
1. The conditions on γ and η are satisfied provided κ < κ̄ and κ 6 61 .
2. Lemma 7.5 in [19] shows that if u0 ∈ C η (with the Euclidean scaling and recalling that
we take − 23 < η < − 12 ) then Gu0 ∈ D γ,η for any γ > (η ∨ 0).
3. Definition 2.14 in [19] shows that if v0 ∈ C γ , then it can be lifted to a an element
b 0 will belong to D γ,η as required.
v0 ∈ D γ , and then Qv
4. As discussed in Section 9.4 of [19] (see Equation (9.18) and below), the assumption

W ∈ D0,α
is indeed satisfied for γ, η as in Proposition 5.5, provided we define

RR Ξ as the distribution ξ ε 1{t>0} . ♦
Let Z ε = Ψ(ξ ε ) denote the canonical model for mollified noise ξ ε constructed in Sections 3.2 and 4.1. In exactly the same way as in [19, Prop. 9.8 and 9.10], we can now
extend the solution map ST to a maximal solution map S L , defined until the first time
k(RU )(t, ·)kη + k(RV )(t, ·)kη reaches a (large) cut-off value L. This map satisfies
RS L (u0 , v0 , Z ε ) = S̄ L (u0 , v0 , ξ ε ) ,

Renormalisation of the equation
The renormalisation group

Consider a general model Z = (Π, Γ) for our regularity structure, which is admissible in
the sense that is satisfies (3.27), the last identity in (3.28) and (4.6). The model may also
be specified by the pair (Π, f ) such that for all z, z̄ ∈ Rd+1 , one has
and

Πz = Π Γfz

Γz z̄ = (Γfz )−1 Γfz̄ =: Γγzz̄ .

(6.1)

To build a renormalisation transformation, one first needs to define sets F⋆ ⊂ F0 ⊂ FF
such that
• F0 contains all τ ∈ FF of strictly negative homogeneity;
• for all τ ∈ F0 , one has ∆τ ∈ span(F0 ) ⊗ span(F0+ ), where F0+ ⊂ FF+ contains all symbols of the form (3.11) with τj ∈ F⋆ and |Jkj τj |s > 0 (including the empty product).
See [19, Sect. 8.3], in particular Remark 8.37, for a proof that it is always possible to find
sets F⋆ and F0 satisfying these two properties. For the Allen–Cahn model, a possible
choice is
F⋆ = {

F0 = {Ξ,

(6.2)

For FitzHugh–Nagumo type equations, we choose the same sets, enriched by all symbols
obtained by substitutions → .
Let H0 = span(F0 ) and H0+ = span(F0+ ). By definition, a renormalisation transformation is a linear map M : H0 → H0 such that M X k = X k , M Iτ = IM τ for all τ ∈ F0
such that Iτ ∈ F0 and M Eτ = EM τ for all τ ∈ F0 . With M , we would like to associate
another admissible model (ΠM , f M ) by setting
ΠM τ = ΠM τ

∀τ ∈ F0 .

(6.3)

As shown in [19, Section 8.3], this is indeed possible if one is able to find linear maps
∆M : H0 → H0 ⊗ H0+ , and M̂ : H0+ → H0+ such that

The model (Π , f ) is admissible provided the conditions

also be a multiplicative morphism leaving the X k invariant, that is,
M̂ (τ1 τ2 ) = (M̂ τ1 )(M̂ τ2 ) ,

M̂ (X k ) = X k .

(6.6)

It is shown in [19, Prop. 8.36] that given a linear map M , there is a unique choice of maps
∆M and M̂ such that (6.5) and (6.6) hold, making (ΠM , f M ) an admissible model. In

Definition 6.1 ([19, Def. 8.41]). The renormalisation group R is the set of linear maps

It is shown in [19, Lemma 8.43] that R is indeed a group. The main result [19,
Thm. 8.44] states that given M ∈ R, and an admissible model (Π, f ), the model (ΠM , f M )
constructed as above is indeed an admissible model. In particular, it satisfies the required
analytic bounds and behaves well under the extension theorem [19, Thm. 5.14].
Let us now introduce a particular subgroup of R suited to our problem. In the case
of the Allen–Cahn equation (cf [19, Sections 9.2 and 10.5]), a two-parameter group of
transformations M = exp{−C1 L1 − C2 L2 } is sufficient, where the generators L1 and L2
are defined by the substitution rules
L1 :

7→ 1 ,

7→ 1 .

L2 :

More precisely, L1 τ is in general a sum of terms, where each term corresponds to one
occurrence of

, and replacing any of these pairs by 1 yields .
of picking a pair of in
In our case, we may a priori have to apply similar substitutions for all elements oband
by replacing one or several I(Ξ) by EI(Ξ). We thus introduce
tained from
the sets of symbols
F1 = {

},

F2 = {I(τ1 )τ2 : τ1 , τ2 ∈ F1 } .

(6.10)

Note that F2 has 9 elements. This leads us to define a 12-parameter subgroup of R given
by

where Lτ denotes the substitution τ 7→ 1, applied as often as possible. The exponential
is then defined by its formal series, which is always finite because any application of Lτ
strictly decreases the number of occurrences of I(Ξ) or E(I(Ξ)). In practice, however, we
will see that only 2 of these parameters are really needed to renormalise the model.
We introduce the shorthands C1 = C1 ( ), C1′ = C1 ( ) and C1′′ = C1 ( ). The
action of M on a few elements that will occur in the computations below is given in the
following list:

thus, via (6.4), the renormalised model ΠM . Again, we just list a few expressions that will

Convergence of the renormalised models

From now on, we assume that the driving noise ξ is Gaussian white noise on D = R × Td ,
where Td = Rd /Zd is the d-dimensional torus . This means that we are given a probability
space (Ω, F, P), the Hilbert space H = L2 (D), and a collection of centred jointly Gaussian
random variables {Wh }h∈H which are assumed to satisfy
E{Wh Wh̄ } = hh, h̄i

(6.14)

for all h, h̄ ∈ H. Then ξ is the distribution defined by hξ, ϕi = Wπϕ for every test function
ϕ, where π is the canonical projection from L2 (Rd+1 ) to L2 (D).
Let Z ε = (Πε , Γε ) be the canonical model built for mollified noise ξ ε . Our aim is now
to find a specific sequence of renormalisation maps Mε in R such that the sequence of
models Zbε = Mε Z ε defined by
ε Mε

The relevant result to achieve this is Theorem 10.7 in [19]. It states that if for all

In order to obtain such bounds for our system, we can to a large extent adapt the
proof of [19, Thm. 10.22]. As a matter of fact, it is immediate to see that this theorem
can be extended to our case, because the involved kernels have singularities which are not
worse than in the Allen–Cahn case. The aim of the discussion that follows is thus only
to determine which parameters of the renormalisation group introduced above are really
needed to ensure convergence.
The first step is to observe that if ̺ε is the mollifyer, i.e., if ξ ε = ̺ε ∗ ξ, noting
Kε = K ∗ ̺ε we have
Z

(6.21)
(Πz̄ )(z) = (Kε ∗ ξ)(z) = Kε (z − z1 )ξ(z1 ) dz1 =: χε (z) ,

b z̄ )(z) = χ0 (z) := (K ∗ ξ)(z) .

Due to translation invariance, it will henceforth be sufficient to evaluate models in z̄ = 0.
As already seen in the proof of Proposition 5.1, we have

which belongs to the second inhomogeneous Wiener chaos. Renormalisation is needed
because the right-hand side is known to diverge in the limit ε → 0. However, if one
introduces the Wick product
ξ(z1 ) ⋄ ξ(z2 ) = ξ(z1 )ξ(z2 ) − δ(z1 − z2 ) ,

(6.29)

then one obtains

Before being able to deal with terms such as

(6.38)

which follows from [19, Lemma 10.3] and the Wick rule Ik (f )⋄Iℓ (g) = Ik+ℓ (f ⊗g). It turns
out that the important term regarding renormalisation is the contribution to the zeroth

(6.39)

As shown in [19, Thm. 10.22], only the first integral on the right-hand side (which is
independent of z by translation invariance) diverges as ε → 0, which imposes a choice
for C2 (
). In order to represent this quantity and related ones appearing when dealing
with the other terms, we introduce the notations
Z
ε
Q0 (z) = Kε (z1 )Kε (z1 − z) dz1 ,
Z
Qε1 (z) = Kε (z1 )KεQ (z1 − z) dz1 ,

In particular, we have

(6.41)

Before proceeding to the convergence result, we collect a number of bounds on integrals
involving the kernels Kε and KεQ . In what follows we will sometimes write K0 in place
of K as well as K0Q in place of K Q , while |x| = |x1 | + |x2 | + |x3 | denotes the ℓ1 -norm of
x ∈ R3 , so that k(t, x)ks = |t|1/2 + |x|, cf (3.16). Note however that |x| and the Euclidean
norm kxk are equivalent.

Then I00 (ε) ≍ |log ε|, while all other Iij (ε) are bounded uniformly in ε.
The proof is given in Appendix B. It is important to emphasize that Lemma 6.2 is
the key result to show that certain terms do not have to be renormalised. For example,
consider the difference between the first bound in (6.43) and the second and third bounds.
This explains why certain symbols involving the E-operator do not have to be renormalised
while the same symbol without an additional E-operator has to be renormalised; see also
Appendix B for a detailed computation.

We give the proof in Appendix C.
We can now state the main result of this section, which is an adaptation of [19,
Thm. 10.22].
Proposition 6.4 (Convergence of the renormalised models). There exists a random model

degree less or equal ζ.
38

Proof: As already stated, the proof follows along the lines of [19, Thm. 10.22], with some
changes due to the presence of the additional integration operator E. Thus we will only
comment on those parts of the proof that need to be adapted.
The result will follow if we are able to choose the constants C1 (τ ) and C2 (τ ) in (6.11)
for each ε ∈ (0, 1] in such a way that the bounds (6.16) hold for all τ ∈ F− ; equivalently,
the bounds (6.20) should hold for all these τ . The limiting model Zb will be constructed
step by step during this process.
The first step is to set
b 0 Ξ)(z) = ξ(z) ,
(Π

and the fact that the required bounds are satisfied is a consequence of Proposition 9.5
in [19] (see also Lemma 10.2).
In the case of τ = , the limiting model is defined by (6.23), and the conclusion follows
as shown in [19, Thm. 10.22] by applying the bounds on convolutions in [19, Lemmas 10.14
and 10.17]. We thus turn to the case τ = . By (6.27), we have

to prove the second bound in (6.20), we use the bound (6.47) in Lemma 6.3, which yields

independent of z, as a consequence of translation invariance, so that we can drop the
argument z from the notation. The integral in the second line is equal to Qε1 (0), which
is bounded uniformly in ε by Lemma 6.2. We may thus simply choose C1′ (ε) = 0, which
amounts to setting

Indeed, the first bound in (6.20) for k = 0 is satisfied with λ = 0, provided κ̄ 6 −2| |s =

The first integral on the right-hand side does not depend on z, as can be seen by the
change of variables (z̄, z1 , z2 ) 7→ (z̄ + z, z1 + z, z2 + z). As a consequence, it is equal to

Computation of the renormalised equations

In order to complete the proof of the main results, it remains to derive the classical equation
with mollified noise that corresponds to the renormalised models. In other words, for a
L satisfying
given M = Mε ∈ R, we have to characterise the solution map S̄M

where RM is the reconstruction operator of the model ΠM (= Π

giving the fixed point of the renormalised equation in terms of initial data and forcing

In order to determine the classical equation, we will need the following algebraic result.
Lemma 6.5. For all τ ∈ F0 , one has
(ΠM
z τ )(z) = (Πz M τ )(z) .

(6.50)

Proof: The claim can be checked directly by comparing the expressions given in (6.12)
and (6.13). More generally, the first relation in (6.4) shows that (6.50) holds for all τ
such that ∆M (τ ) = M τ ⊗ 1, which happens to be the case for all symbols excepts those
of the families
,
and
. In the exceptional cases, the relation has to be checked
by an explicit computation; in general it holds only when the model is evaluated at the
base point, i.e. we may have (ΠM
z τ )(z̄) 6= (Πz M τ )(z̄) if z 6= z̄. For instance, in the case
, the action of the renormalisation map is given by
τ=

, (6.5) is satisfied by setting ∆M
= M ⊗1
One can then check that in the case τ =
and M̂ J ( ) = J (M ). Using this and the definition of the map ∆, a somewhat lengthy
computation shows that
∆M

=M

⊗ 1 + 2C1′ Xi ⊗ Ji ( ) + C1′′ Xi ⊗ Ji ( )

satisfies the second relation in (6.5) when τ =
ΠM

= (Πz ⊗ fz )∆M

= Πz M

. By (6.4), this implies

+ 2C1′ Πz ( Xi )hfz , Ji i + C1′′ Πz ( Xi )hfz , Ji i ,

where we used the fact that hfz , 1i = 1. Since (Πz Xi )(z̄) = (Πz )(z̄)(x̄i − xi ) by (3.22),
we see that the last two terms on the right-hand side indeed vanish when z̄ = z.
As a consequence of (6.50), when f is a function, as is the case for ε > 0, we have
(RM f )(z) = (ΠM
z f (z))(z) = (Πz M f (z))(z) = (RM f )(z) .

(6.51)

This directly implies the following result, which is the equivalent of Proposition 5.1 for
the renormalised equation.
Proposition 6.6 (Renormalised equation). Assume that ε > 0 and that (5.1) admits a
fixed point (U, V ) where U, V ∈ D γ,η for some γ, η ∈ R. Then (û, v̂) = (RM U, RM V )
satisfies the classical SPDE
∂t û = ∆û + Fb(û, v̂) + ξ ε ,
∂t v̂ = A1 û + A2 v̂ ,

provided Fb is such that

Fb(M U, M V ) = M F (U, V ) + ̺(U, V ) ,

with ̺ having only components of strictly positive homogeneity.
41

(6.52)

(6.53)

Proof: Applying M to the expansions of U and V given in (5.6), we see that M U differs
from U and M V differs from V only by components of homogeneity 23 −κ at least. Applying
R to M U and M V and using (6.51), we obtain that as in the proof of Proposition 5.1
û(z) = χε (z) + ϕ(z) ,
v̂(z) = χQ
ε (z) + ψ(z) .
On the other hand, applying M to the right-hand side of (5.3) and using the fact that M
commutes with I and E and leaves polynomials invariant, we get


b U, M V ) + Gu0 ,
M U = IR+ Ξ + M F (U, V ) + R(M
b 0.
M V = ER+ M U− + QR+ M U+ + Qv

Applying the reconstruction operator, we thus obtain


û(t, x) = G ∗ R+ ξ ε (t, x) + (RM F (U, V ))(t, x) + Gu0 (t, x) ,
Z t
b 0 (t, x) .
Q(t − s)v̂(s, x) ds + Qv
v̂(t, x) =
0

The claim then follows from the fact that (6.53) implies

(RM F (U, V ))(z) = (RFb(M U, M V ))(z) = Fb(û(z), v̂(z)) ,

where the last equality follows from the same argument as the one used in the proof of
Proposition 5.1.
Finally, we compute the expression of Fb. To simplify the computations, we assume that
) are the only non-zero renormalisation constants, which
C1 = C1 ( ) and C2 = C2 (
is a possible choice as seen in the proof of Proposition 6.4. This is also the place where
the assumption γ2 = 0 turns out to be necessary in order to obtain a simple renormalised
equation.
Proposition 6.7 (Expression for the renormalised F ). Let F be the cubic polynomial
given in (5.5) with either d = 2, or d = 3 and γ2 = 0, and let M be the renormalisation
transformation defined in (6.11), where the only nonzero constants are C1 = C1 ( ) and

− κ implies

where all components of ̺′ (U, V ) have strictly positive homogeneity. Thus we only have to
compute the difference M F (U, V ) − F (U, V ), which reduces to determining the terms of
42

F (U, V ) which are modified by the renormalisation map, or, more precisely, which terms
of homogeneity less or equal 0 appear when applying M .
The computation is straightforward, though somewhat lengthy. In practice, it suffices
to expand the quadratic terms of F (U, V ) up to order 21 − κ, and cubic terms up to order
0 − 2κ. To explain where the condition γ2 = 0 arises if d = 3, we allow for general γ2 ∈ R
for the time being.
Consider first the quadratic part F2 (U, V ) = β1 U 2 + β2 U V + β3 V 2 of F (U, V ). It turns
out that when the renormalisation map M is applied, only the term proportional to
of F2 (U, V ) yields a contribution of not strictly positive homogeneity. Namely, one has
M F2 (U, V ) − F2 (U, V ) = −β1 C1 1 + ̺2 (U, V ) ,
where ̺2 (U, V ) has strictly positive homogeneity. It remains to determine the contribution
of the cubic part F3 (U, V ) = γ1 U 3 + γ2 U 2 V + γ3 U V 2 + γ4 V 3 . Substituting U and V by
their expansion (5.6) and sorting terms by homogeneity yields an expression of the form
F3 (U, V ) = F3;− 3 (U, V ) + F3;−1 (U, V ) + F3;− 1 (U, V ) + F3;0 (U, V ) + ̺3 (U, V ) ,

where each F3;β contains only terms of homogeneity β − O(κ) and the remainder ̺3 has
strictly positive homogeneity. We treat all of these terms separately. For instance, we
+ γ2
+ γ3
+ γ4 , where the first two terms have to be

M F3;− 3 (U, V ) − F3;− 3 (U, V ) = −3γ1 C1 − γ2 C1 + ̺3;− 3 (U, V ) .

The term F3;−1 (U, V ) yields a contribution
M F3;−1 (U, V ) − F3;−1 (U, V ) = −3γ1 C1 ϕ1 − γ2 C1 ψ1 + ̺3;−1 (U, V )
. Consider next the term F3;0 (U, V ). It contains 2 terms

In the case γ2 = 0, using ai = γi and replacing the bi by their expressions (5.7), and adding
the last four expressions, we see that we can always factor out the expression ϕ1+ , which
coincides with U up to terms of strictly positive homogeneity. The result follows.
In case γ2 6= 0, there are additional terms such as γ2 C2 b̂1 1, which do not admit a
simple expression in terms of U and V , so that the renormalised equation has no simple
closed-form expression. However when d = 2, then we can choose C2 = 0 because the

we can also factor out the quantity ψ1 + , yielding the expression for c2 (ε) in (6.55).

Proof of the main results

Since Theorem 2.1 is a particular case of Theorem 2.2, we proceed directly to proving the
latter result.
Proof of Theorem 2.2. Consider first the situation on a fixed, sufficiently small time interval [0, T ]. Fix ε > 0 and let
(U ε , V ε ) = ST (u0 , v0 , Mε Z ε ) ,
b ,
(U, V ) = ST (u0 , v0 , Z)

where ST is the solution map given in Proposition 5.5 (we have suppressed the dependence
on W , which is the same for both fixed points). For any δ > 0, the bound (5.16), Markov’s
inequality and Proposition 6.4 imply

It follows that (U ε , V ε ) converges to (U, V ) in probability as ε → 0.
Next, let (u, v) = (RU, RV ) and (uε , v ε ) = (RU ε , RV ε ) (where we do not indicate the
model-dependence of the reconstruction operators R). The fact that (uε , v ε ) converges to
(u, v) in probability as ε → 0 is a consequence of the bound [19, (3.4)] in the reconstruction
theorem, combined with the definitions (3.20) of kΠkγ;K and (4.28) of ||| · |||γ,η;K .
The convergence result can be extended from a fixed time interval [0, T ] to the random
time interval up to the first exit from a ball of radius L in exactly the same way as in [19,
Section 7.3]. In particular, the required continuous dependence on the model is proved
in [19, Cor. 7.12].
Proposition 6.6 shows that (uε , v ε ) satisfies the system (2.11), where the explicit expression of Fb is a consequence of Proposition 6.7. The expressions (2.5) and (2.12) for the
renormalisation constants in dimension d = 3 follow from (6.55), where the only nonzero
terms are C1 (ε), defined in (6.33), and C2 (ε), defined in (6.41).
and
need to be
In the case d = 2, Table 1 shows that only the terms ,
renormalised, to that the expression (2.7) for the renormalisation constant follows by
taking C2 (ε) = 0 in (6.55).
Proof of Theorem 2.3. The only difference with the previous case is that we have to take
into account the presence of the n different operators Ei , i = 1, . . . , n, introduced in
Remark 4.2. This means that the fixed-point equation for V in (5.1) is replaced by n
different equations of the form
b i v0 ,
Vi = KγQi R+ U + Q

i = 1, . . . , n .

Since n is finite, it is straightforward to check that the proofs of Proposition 5.1 and
Proposition 5.5 carry over to this situation.
It remains to check the expressions (2.18) for the renormalisation constants. To compute the diverging part of Fb(U, V ) − F (U, V ), it is in fact sufficient to determine the

and
in F (U, V ), since these are the only ones that need to be
coefficients of
renormalised. These can only result from the terms β1 U 2 + γ1 U 3 in F (U, V ), since all

44

other terms will contain at least one of the Ei . It is now sufficient to check that U has the
same expansion as in (5.6), except that the first relation in (5.7) becomes
b1 = β1 + 3ϕγ1 +

ψi γ2,i ,

where ψi is the coefficient of 1 in Vi . The result then follows as in the proof of Proposition 6.7, taking into account the modified value of b1 .

A

Proof of Lemma 4.8

The proof is by induction on the size of the regularity structure, which is constructed
recursively, starting with Ξ, 1 and the Xi , and applying the operators I and E as well
as multiplication to already existing symbols. We show that the properties (4.21) hold
on the polynomial regularity structure and for τ = Ξ, and that they are stable under the
algebraic operations extending this structure.
1. The claim certainly holds on the polynomial part of the regularity structure, since
(Πεz+h X k )(z̄ + h) = (z̄ + h − z − h)k = (Πεz X k )(z̄) ,
Γεz+h,z̄+h X k = (X − z̄ − h + z + h)k = Γεz z̄ X k ,
and

Γεz,z̄ X k = (Id ⊗γz,z̄

2. Using the fact that ∆(Ξ) = Ξ ⊗ 1, it is also immediate to check that (4.21) holds for
τ = Ξ (this reflects translation invariance of the noise).
3. We show that if the relations (4.21) hold for τ , then they also hold with τ and τ̄
replaced by Iτ and Jk τ . Indeed,

right-hand side is equal to IΓz+h,z̄+h (τ ). The induction hypothesis implies that all
terms are equal to their value for h = 0, proving the required identity for Γεz z̄ (Iτ ).
The identity for γzεz̄ (Jk τ ) follows in a similar manner.
4. In a similar way, using the definition (4.6) of Πεz (Eτ ), it is straightforward to check
that if τ satisfies (4.21), then Eτ satisfies (4.21) as well.
5. If τ, σ satisfy (4.21), then

(Πεz+h τ σ)(z̄ + h) = (Πεz+h τ )(z̄ + h)(Πεz+h σ)(z̄ + h) = (Πεz τ )(z̄)(Πεz σ)(z̄) = (Πεz τ σ)(z̄) .
Furthermore,

)∆(τ σ) = (Id ⊗γzεz̄ )∆(τ σ) = Γεz z̄ (τ σ) .
Γεz+h,z̄+h (τ σ) = (Id ⊗γz+h,z̄+h

Here we have used the fact that the induction hypothesis applies because the second
component of ∆(τ ) always depends only on already computed quantities, cf. Table 1.
The translation invariance of γzεz̄ (τ σ) follows.

Proof of Lemma 6.2

It follows from the definition of K that it satisfies |K(z)| . kzk−3
s . Computing the
derivatives of K, one sees that it is singular of order −3 in the sense of [19, Def. 10.12].
Thus the first bound in (6.42) follows from [19, Lemma 10.17].
The second bound in (6.42) is a crucial estimate, which allows us to avoid renormalisation of certain symbols involving the operator E. Therefore, we provide additional details
in the proof of this bound. Recalling the definitions of K Q and Q we have
Z 2T ∧(t+ε2 )

since Kε (t, x) is supported on {t >

Z t
Q
Kε (s, x) ds,
K (t, x) ≍

where we recall that the notation f ≍ g indicates that we have both f . g and g . f .

Proof of Lemma 6.3

Let us recall Definition 10.12 in [19]. Given a scaling s, a smooth function K : Rd+1 \{0} →
R is said to be (singular) of order ζ if for every sufficiently small multiindex k, one has
ζ−|k|s

|D k K(z)| . kzks

∀z such that kzks 6 1 .

More precisely, we require that there exists m > 0 such that
|||K|||ζ;m :=

|k|s −ζ

sup kzks

|D k K(z)| < ∞ .

k : |k|s6m z∈Rd+1

Note that in [19, Def 10.12], the second supremum indeed runs over the whole space, but
in practice we will only apply it to compactly supported functions. Lemma 10.17 in [19]
states that if K is of order ζ ∈ (−|s|, 0), then Kε = K ∗ ̺ε has bounded derivatives of all
orders, satisfying
|D k Kε (z)| . (kzks + ε)ζ−|k|s |||K|||ζ;|k|s .
Furthermore, for all ζ̄ ∈ [ζ − 1, ζ) and m > 0, one has
|||K − Kε |||ζ̄;m . εζ−ζ̄ |||K|||ζ;m+max{si } .
