UPDATE: REMARKS ON COUNTABLE TIGHTNESS
MARION SCHEEPERS
Abstract. The proof of Theorem 11 of the paper [5] relies on Lemma 10
of that paper. The offered proof of Lemma 10 had shortcomings, and I was
recently asked for details. This note gives an alternative, complete proof of
[5], Lemma 10.

In [5] we considered the selection principle S1 (A, B) for specific instances of
families A and B of sets. Recall that S1 (A, B) denotes the statement that there
is for each sequence (On : n ∈ N) of elements of A a corresponding sequence
(xn : n ∈ N) such that for each n we have xn ∈ On , and {xn : n ∈ N} ∈ B.
There is a natural game, denoted G1 (A, B) associated with this selection principle: This two-player game is played as follows. There is an inning for each n < ω.
In inning n player ONE selects and On ∈ A, and then TWO responds by selecting
an xn ∈ On . A play (O0 , x0 , · · · , On , xn · · · ) is won by player TWO if the set
{xn : n < ω} is an element of the family B; else, the play is won by player ONE.
If player ONE does not have a winning strategy in the game G1 (A, B), then the
selection principle S1 (A, B) holds of the pair A, B. For many topological families A
and B it is the case that under appropriate circumstances also the converse holds:
The selection principle S1 (A, B) implies that ONE has no winning strategy in the
game G1 (A, B). Theorem 11 of [5] was intended to demonstrate an extreme case of
failure of this converse for well-studied examples of A and B.
More precisely: In [2] Sakai defined the notion of countable strong fan tightness
at the point x of a topological space (X, τ ). This notion is defined as follows: For
the point x ∈ X we define
Ωx = {A ⊆ X \ {x} : x is in the closure of A}.
Then (X, τ ) is said to have countable strong fan tightness at x if the selection
principle S1 (Ωx , Ωx ) holds.
In [3] it was shown that for certain “nice” spaces (X, τ ) it is true that S1 (Ωx , Ωx )
holds if, and only if, ONE has now winning strategy in the game G1 (Ωx , Ωx ). In
[3] also an ad hoc example of the failure of this equivalence was given. In Theorem
11 of [5] the following more extreme example is given, assuming the Continuum
Hypothesis (CH):
Theorem 1 (CH). There is a T3 space X that has countable strong fan tightness
at each x ∈ X, yet ONE has a winning strategy in G1 (Ωx , Ωx ) at each x ∈ X.

1. Lemma 10
For topological space (X, τ ) let D denote the set {A ⊆ X : A dense in X}. Also,
let ND denote the set {A ⊆ X : A is not discrete}. In [5] the proof of Theorem 1
made use of a lemma regarding the infinite game G1 (D, ND). This game is a dual
version of a game introduced in [1] by Berner and Juhasz. More details about this
game and construction of the dual game appear in the sources [1, 4, 5].
The claimed proof ot Lemma 10 of [5] is flawed. Here is a correct argument:
Lemma 2. Let (X, τ ) be a T1 -space with no isolated points. Assume that player
ONE has a winning strategy in the game G1 (D, ND) on X. Then at each x ∈ X
ONE has a winning strategy in the game G1 (Ωx , Ωx ).
Proof. Let σ be a winning strategy for ONE in the game G1 (D, ND). For each
x ∈ X, define a strategy σx as follows:
• σx (∅) = σ(∅) \ {x}, and
• for each finite sequence (w1 , · · · , wn ) of elements of X, σx (w1 , · · · , wn ) =
σ(w1 , · · · , wn ) \ {x}.
Since X has no isolated points, for each dense set D ⊂ X and each x ∈ X, the set
D\{x} is dense in X. Thus, σx is a strategy for player ONE in the game G1 (D, ND).
Each σx play of the game G1 (D, ND) is a σ-play during which TWO never picked
the element x. Thus, σx is also a winning strategy for ONE in G1 (D, ND).
Now we note that at each x ∈ X the strategy σx is a winning strategy for ONE
in the game G1 (Ωx , Ωx ): For consider a σx -play
O1 , w1 , O2 , w2 , · · · , On , wn , · · ·
For each n, On is a dense set not containing the point x, and thus is an element of
Ωx . The set {wn : 0 < n < ω} is a discrete subset of X and does not contain the
point x. Thus, let U be a neighborhood of x meeting the set of moves by TWO in
at most one point, say wn . Since x 6= wn and X is T1 , there is a neighborhood W
of x that does not contain wn . But then U ∩ W is a neighborhood of x disjoint from
{wn : 0 < n < ω}. It follows that {wn : 0 < n < ω} is not an element of Ωx .
