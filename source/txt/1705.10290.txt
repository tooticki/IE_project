Abstract. We establish an abstract local ergodic theorem, under suitable space-time scaling, for
the (boundary-driven) symmetric exclusion process on an increasing sequence of balls covering
an infinite weighted graph. The proofs are based on 1-block and 2-blocks estimates utilizing the
resistance structure of the graph; the moving particle lemma established recently by the author;
and discrete harmonic analysis. Our ergodic theorem applies to any infinite weighted graph upon
which random walk is strongly recurrent in the sense of Barlow, Delmotte, and Telcs; these include
many trees, fractal graphs, and random graphs arising from percolation.
The main results of this paper are used to prove the joint density-current hydrodynamic limit
of the boundary-driven exclusion process on the Sierpinski gasket, described in an upcoming paper
with M. Hinz and A. Teplyaev.

1. Introduction
A main topic in statistical mechanics is the study of the emergence of collective phenomena
arising from microscopic models. For instance, water is made out of ∼ 1023 water molecules, each
interacting with one another through intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces).
However, when one studies the macroscopic features of water, such as its density and the viscosity,
the molecular details are “averaged out” and become less important. This is very much in the
spirit of the law of large numbers in probability theory. In a nutshell, one would like to justify, in
a mathematically rigorous sense, how the hydrodynamics of water arises from interactions between
the water molecules.
To embark upon this challenging problem, we need to first understand how to average the microscopic variables to obtain their macroscopic counterparts. In the physics literature this procedure
often goes by the name “renormalization” or “coarse-graining.” If the underlying graph is the
Euclidean lattice Zd , which are invariant under lattice translations and rotations, then one can
use this symmetry to establish ergodicity (mixing of space-time averages), which then justifies the
aformentioned replacement by averages. In fact many existing proofs in the literature take direct
advantage of the ergodicity under spatial translations and rotations.
That said, in real-life applications there are uncountably many natural or artificial networks
which are not Euclidean lattices: some are trees, other have self-similar structures, and still others—
random graphs—have edges which may be present or absent with certain probabilities. On these
networks, translational or rotational invariance is broken, so in order to establish limit theorems
one is compelled to find alternative mechanisms which generate ergodicity.
The main goal of this paper is to establish an abstract local ergodic (or coarse graining) theorem for one of the most commonly studied interacting particle systems—the symmetric exclusion
process—on an infinite connected weighted graph. See §2.2 for the definition of the exclusion process, [5, 35, 56] for introductory accounts, [45, 49, 57] for technical backgrounds, and [1, 18] and
references therein for connections with non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Throughout the paper, no assumption is made about the spatial symmetries of the underlying graph. To effect the
coarse graining argument, we use inputs from (discrete) potential theory and harmonic analysis
(such as hitting estimates of random walks, harmonic functions, and Dirichlet energy). Upon establishing our main results, we will verify that our assumptions are satisfied on all (very) strongly
recurrent weighted graphs, in the sense of Barlow [10, 12], Delmotte [32], and Telcs [60, 61].
The present paper is the second of a four-part series establishing the hydrodynamic limit of the
(boundary-driven) exclusion process on fractals, which has been summarized as a short review in
[25]. The first part [24], on the moving particle lemma for the exclusion process on a weighted
graph, plays a crucial role in the proof of the local ergodic theorems in this paper. In turn, the
results of this paper are used to establish hydrodynamic limit theorems for the exclusion process
on the Sierpinski gasket in [26]. Since the scaling limit is a solution to a nonlinear PDE on a
singular space, it behooves us to address issues of its existence, uniqueness, and regularity. These
are described in [27].

2. Setup and main results
Throughout the paper we assume that the undirected graph G = (V, E) is connected and locally
finite. Connected means that for any x, y ∈ V , there exists a sequence {x0 = 1, x1 , · · · , xn−1 , xn =
y} in V such that xi−1 xi ∈ E for all i = 1, 2, · · · , n. Locally finite means that the degree of every
vertex is finite. When we endow a direction upon an edge e ∈ E, its tail vertex will be denoted e,
and the head vertex e.
In what follows, given a denumerable set Λ, P
|Λ| stands for the cardinality of Λ. We denote the
1
average of g : Λ → R over Λ by AvΛ [g] := |Λ|
z∈Λ g(z). For each α ∈ [0, 1] (resp. each function

Λ ) denote the product Bernoulli measure on {0, 1}Λ with marginal
γ : Λ → [0, 1]), let ναΛ (resp. νγ(·)
Λ ({η : η(x) = 1}) = γ(x)) for each x ∈ Λ.
ναΛ ({η : η(x) = 1}) = α (resp. νγ(·)
R
Given a Borel measure µ and a function h ∈ L1 (µ), we will adopt the shorthand µ[h] := h dµ .
Unless otherwise noted, the capitalized C denotes a positive constant which may change from
line to line. The dependence of the constants is indicated in subscripts, e.g. Cα1 ,α2 ,··· depends on
α1 , α2 , · · · .

2.1. Random walk on a weighted graph. Consider a locally finite connected graph Γ =
(V (Γ), E(Γ)) endowed with conductances c = P
(cxy )xy∈E(Γ) , where cxy > 0. The pair (Γ, c) is
called a weighted graph. For x ∈ V (Γ) let cx = y∼x cxy . The conductances induce a measure V
P
on V (Γ) given by V(A) = y∈A cx for A ⊂ V (Γ).
The symmetric random walk process on (Γ, c) is a Markov chain on V (Γ) with transition probability

p(x, y) =

else.
A standard fact is that this process is reversible w.r.t. the measure V. The corresponding Dirichlet
energy is

Let d be the graph metric on Γ, and for each x ∈ V (Γ) and each r ∈ N0 , let B(x, r) := {y ∈
V (Γ) : d(x, y) < r} be the open ball of radius r centered at x. We set the volume of the ball
centered at x by V(x, r) = V(B(x, r)). Next, the hitting time of a set A ⊂ V (Γ) by a random
walk is denoted TA := inf{t > 0 : Xt ∈ A}. We set the mean exit time from the ball centered at
x by T (x, r) = Ex TB(x,r)c . Finally, given two subsets A1 , A2 ⊂ V (Γ), the effective resistance
between A1 and A2 is

with the convention that inf ∅ = ∞.
2.2. Exclusion process on a weighted graph. The symmetric exclusion process (SEP) on (Γ, c)
is a continuous-time Markov chain (ηt )t≥0 on {0, 1}V (Γ) with infinitesimal generator

Informally speaking, one starts with a configuration ζ in which k vertices are occupied with a
particle, and the remaining vertices are empty. All particles are deemed indistinguishable. A
transition from ζ to ζ xy occurs with rate cxy if and only if one of the vertices {x, y} is occupied
and the other is empty.
There are two key properties of the SEP. First, the total number of particles is conserved in the
process. Second, the process is reversible with respect to any constant-density product Bernoulli
measure να on {0, 1}V (Γ) , α ∈ [0, 1], which has marginal να {ζ : ζ(x) = 1} = α for all x ∈ V (Γ).

Definition 2.1. We say that φ : V (Γ)×{0, 1}V (Γ) → R is a local function bundle for vertices if there
exists rφ ∈ (0, ∞) such that for any x ∈ V (Γ), φx := φ(x, ·) depends only on {η(z) : z ∈ B(x, rφ )}
Likewise, we say that φ : E(Γ) × {0, 1}V (Γ) → R is a local function bundle for edges if there exists
rφ ∈ (0, ∞) such that for any e = (e, e) ∈ E(Γ), φe := φ(e, ·) depends only on {η(z) : z ∈ B(e, rφ )}.
Example 2.2. We list three examples of local function bundles.
(1) φ(x, η) = η(x).
P
(2) φ(x, η) = y:xy∈E(Γ) bxy η(x)η(y), where bxy ∈ R. In practice, we consider the case bxy ≡ 1
or the case bxy = cxy .
(3) φ(e, η) = ce η(e)η(e), where ce is the conductance of the edge e.
The first example is rather trivial. The second and third examples are important for the proof of
hydrodynamic limit of the exclusion process [37, 45, 46].
Remark 2.3. The terminology local function bundle carries a similar notion as a cylinder function
on translation-invariant graphs. It is introduced in [59], although we do not assume that φ is
invariant under the action of some infinite group.
Given a local function bundle for vertices φ and an x ∈ V (Γ), we define the global average of φx
with respect to the product Bernoulli measure να on {0, 1}V (Γ) , α ∈ [0, 1], by
(2.4)

Φx (α) := να [φx ].

Since φx depends only on {η(x) : x ∈ B(x, rφ )}, and να is product Bernoulli, it is direct to verify
that α 7→ Φx (α) is a Lipschitz function.
Similarly, given a local function bundle for edges φ and an edge e ∈ E(Γ), we define the global
average of φe with respect to να by
(2.5)

Φe (α) := να [φe ].

The map α 7→ Φe (α) is Lipschitz by the same reasoning.
2.3. Local ergodicity in the exclusion process. Fix a vertex o ∈ V (Γ) (“origin”) and a monotone increasing sequence of radii (rN )N ≥1 with r1 = 1 and rN ↑ ∞. This allows us to define an
exhaustion of Γ by finite graphs (ΓN )N ≥1 , where V (ΓN ) = B(o, rN ) and E(ΓN ) = {xy ∈ E(Γ) :
x, y ∈ V (ΓN )}. The edge conductances on ΓN are inherited from those on the mother graph (Γ, c);
we denote the corresponding finite weighted graph (ΓN , c).
Next, we introduce two increasing sequences of positive real numbers, (VN )N ≥1 and (TN )N ≥1 .
For applications, they will stand for, respectively, the sequence of mass scales and time scales;
namely, VN may stand for either |B(o, rN )| or V(o, rN ), and TN may stand for the (extremal)
expected time for a random walk starting in B(o, rN ) to exit B(o, rN ). Since the designations of
these parameters vary with the weighted graph, we keep them as VN and TN for now, and defer
their interpretations to §6.
If φ : V (Γ) × {0, 1}V (Γ) → R is a local function bundle for vertices, we set

(2.6)
UN, (x, η) := φx (η) − Φx AvB(x,rN ) [η] ,
N ≥ 1,  ∈ [0, 1].
Likewise, if φ : E(Γ) × {0, 1}V (Γ) → R is a local function bundle for edges, we set

(2.7)
N ≥ 1,  ∈ [0, 1].
UN, (e, η) := φe (η) − Φe AvB(e,rN ) [η] ,
Here and in what follows, N is to be understood as the integer part of N .
For ease of notation, we will use p to represent a vertex x in the case of a local function bundle
for vertices, or the tail vertex e of an edge e in the case of a local function bundle for edges. So
for instance, B(p, r) stands for B(x, r) in the former case, and B(e, r) in the latter case. To abuse
notation a bit further, we write UN, (p, η) to denote (2.6) in the former case, and (2.7) in the latter
case.
We introduce the following assumptions.

where p stands for x (resp. e) in the case of a local function bundle for vertices (reps. for edges),
and the supremum runs over all x ∈ V (ΓN ) (resp. over all e ∈ E(ΓN )).
Assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied on the so-called (very) strongly recurrent weighted graphs,
which include Z; trees which support recurrent random walks; post-critically finite (p.c.f.) fractal
graphs, such as the Sierpinski gasket graph; Sierpinski carpet graphs; and random graphs arising
from percolation models. For the precise conditions and examples see §6.
As is known to experts in interacting particle systems, the proof of Theorem 1 relies upon the
one-block estimate and the two-blocks estimate. The one-block estimate involves replacing spins
by their averages over large microscopic blocks (of scale j), while the two-blocks estimate involves
replacing spin averages over large microscopic blocks by spin averages over small macroscopic blocks
(of scale N ). The claim is that both replacement costs vanish in the diffusive limit. We use a
local version of these estimates, introduced in [40], since our graphs generally lack translational
invariance.

a local function bundle for vertices (resp. for edges), and {Λj (p)}j≥1 be a sequence of increasing

The one-block estimate, proved in §3, is fairly standard. In contrast, the proof of the two-blocks
estimate in its present form is new. We use a version of the moving particle lemma, which appeared
in [24], valid on any finite weighted graph; see Proposition 4.2 below. This lemma then serves as
the starting point of a coarse-graining argument which goes through by virtue of the separation of
the two scales j and N . Our proof does not require precise geometric control on the averaging
blocks. See §4 for details.

2.4. Local ergodicity in the boundary-driven exclusion process. To make connections with
rigorous study of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics [1, 16–20], we also consider the boundarydriven version of the exclusion process on a weighted graph. Informally speaking, we modify the
symmetric exclusion process defined in §2.2 by introducing “boundary reservoirs” so that particles
can jump from the bulk to the edge and vice versa. See Figure 1. By introducing the reservoirs,
the stochastic process is generally no longer reversible, and therefore serves as a candidate model
for stochastic dynamics out of equilibrium.

Given a connected weighted graph (G, c), we declare a nonempty subset ∂V ⊂ V (G) to be
the boundary set. For simplicity and without loss of generality, we assume that caa0 = 0 for
all a, a0 ∈ ∂V . Let (ηt )t≥0 be a continuous-time Markov chain on {0, 1}V (G) whose infinitesimal
generator is

As before, let {(ΓN , c)}N be a sequence of finite weighted graphs exhausting (Γ, c). To each ΓN
we associate a boundary set ∂VN ⊂ V (ΓN ). (In practice one can take ∂VN = ∂B(o, rN ), though
our proofs do not depend crucially on this choice aside from satisfying Assumption 3 below.) Let
EX

(ΓN ,c) = L(ΓN ,c) + L∂VN denote the generator of the boundary-driven symmetric exclusion process
on (ΓN , c) with rates {λ± (a) : a ∈ ∂VN }. Let µN

bEX
N
generated by L(ΓN ,c) . Note that µinv is generally not a product measure, but one can compute its
one-site marginal ρN (x) := EµN [η(x)], x ∈ V (ΓN ). It is not hard to show that the function ρN

where γ is as in Condition (BR), and is harmonic (with respect to the
graph Laplacian) on V (ΓN ) \ ∂VN subject to a Robin boundary condition on ∂VN ; see §5.1 for
details.
To prove local ergodicity in the boundary-driven process, we need an additional assumption on
the boundary sets and the corresponding rates. This is stated in the language of random walks
(or electrical networks) following e.g. [33] or [50, Ch. 2]. Given a function h : V (G) → R which is
harmonic on V (G) \ ∂V , the (electric) flow of h out of a ∈ ∂V is given by
X
(2.21)
ih (a) =
cay [h(y) − h(a)].
y∈V (G)

In the sense of calculus on graphs, ih (a) can be also seen as the negative of the (discrete) normal
derivative of h at a.

This assumption says that the sum of the absolute values of the flows of ρN on the boundary
set, as well as the Dirichlet energy of ρN , remains finite in the scaling limit. It will be explained in
Remark 5.2 that

where {ĉa,b > 0 : a, b ∈ ∂VN } represent the (asymmetric) conductances in the trace of the symmetric
random walk process on (ΓN , c) to the boundary ∂VN . Thus (2.22) and (2.23) correspond to
finiteness of, respectively, the L1 - and L2 -gradient norm in the (rescaled) trace process.
Let us note that Assumption 3 is implied by the condition

Moreover,PAssumption 1 and the finite flow condition (2.22) of Assumption 3 together imply that
limN →∞ a∈∂VN |iρN (a)| = 0, whence limN →∞ supa∈∂VN |iρN (a)| = 0. In turn, by the boundary

This coincides with the original motivation for the boundary-driven process that in the scaling

the boundary hopping rates λ+ (a)/λ− (a).

In proving Theorem 4, we adapt the strategy of [16] by introducing a “mock” product measure
whose marginals are ρN (x), the one-site marginals of µN
inv , and run the one-block and two-blocks
estimates with respect to this mock measure. Details are described in §5.
The key outstanding question from our work is whether local ergodicity can be established
without Assumption 1, that is, on non-translationally-invariant graphs which support transient
random walks (analogs of Zd , d ≥ 3), or even weakly recurrent random walks (analogs of Z2 ). This
and other open questions are discussed in §7.

4. Two-blocks estimate: Proof of Theorem 3
Let N ∈ N,  ∈ [0, 1], and x ∈ B(o, rN ). Let {Λj (x)}j≥1 be a sequence of finite, connected
subsets of V (Γ) containing x, with Λj (x) ⊂ B(x, rj ) and |Λj (x)| ≤ |Λj+1 (x)| for each j ≥ 1. For
each j ≥ 1, take any subset Λj (y) of B(x, rN ) \ Λj (x) with |Λj (y)| = |Λj (x)|. (Here y indexes an
arbitrary vertex in Λj (y).) From these we define
(4.1)

(2)

Ũj,x,y (η) := AvΛj (x) [η] − AvΛj (y) [η] ,

η ∈ {0, 1}V (Γ) .

The “two blocks” in our setting refer to Λj (x) and Λj (y), which are disjoint by construction. In
what follows we use the shorthand Λ(2) (j, x, y) = Λj (x) ∪ Λj (y). Also, since we will take the limit
N → ∞ before all other limits, it suffices to consider all N ≥ Nj for an appropriate cutoff Nj ∈ N.

12

JOE P. CHEN

Remark 4.1. For the purpose of proving the one-block estimate, we took Λj (x) to be connected.
However, we do not insist that Λj (y) be connected. In the proof to follow, we will identify a nearly
exact cover of B(x, rN ) \ Λj (x) by {Λj (y) : y ∈ B(x, rN ) \ Λj (x)} without insisting on the Λj (y)
to be connected.
(2)

4.1. Spectral estimate. Our first task is to establish a spectral estimate involving Ũj,x,y (η),
analogous to Lemma 3.2. A notable difference here is that we need to capture the energy of
transporting a particle from Λj (x) to Λj (y) via the so-called moving particle lemma. This was
proved for any finite weighted graph in [24], based on the octopus inequality of [22].
Proposition 4.2 (Moving particle lemma [24, Theorem 1]). Let (G, c) be a finite weighted graph.

Observe that Ũj,x,y (η) depends only on {η(z) : z ∈ Λ(2) (j, x, y)}. Following the proof of Lemma
3.2, one would like to replace LEX
(ΓN ,c) in the variational functional by a generator which effectively
acts on {0, 1}Λ

where z0 ∈ Λj (x), B is the number of connected components of Λj (y), and for each i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , B},
zi is a vertex belonging to the ith connected component of Λj (y). (Our result is not sensitive to
the particular choices of the zi . Also note that B ≤ |Λj (y)| = |Λj (x)|.) Observe that the first two
(2)
terms in the generator Lj,x,y generates the exclusion processes in the individual blocks. In order to
make the state space irreducible w.r.t. the Markov chain to ensure ergodicity, we need to add the
third term to facilitate particle jumps between the connected components of Λ(2) (j, x, y).

We wish to apply this lemma to the setting where Λ1 = Λj (p) and Λ = B(p, rN ). To do this, we
provide a partition of B(p, rN ) consisting of many “blocks” and one “tail.” To be precise, a subset
Λ ⊂ B(p, rN ) \ Λj (p) is a ”block” if |Λ| = |Λj (p)|, and a “tail” if |Λ| < |Λj (p)|. No assumption on
the connectedness of the blocks is necessary.
Remark 4.7. The preceding paragraph may remind the reader of the graph partitioning problem in
theoretical computer science, namely, finding an optimal partition (which minimizes some predefined cost function) of a graph on n vertices into k subgraphs, each containing at most (1 + )b nk c
vertices. Given the assumptions imposed at the beginning of this paper, we do not need to exploit
the full complexity of the graph partitioning problem; rather, the separation of microscopic and
macroscopic scales (j vs. N ) is enough for our argument to go through. See (4.9), (4.10), and
the ensuing arguments for the key estimate. That said, it is possible to improve the estimates via
optimizing over all possible graph partitions.

We now have all the ingredients to prove the two-blocks estimate.
Proof of Theorem 3. Recall that Φp : [0, 1] → R is Lipschitz: there exists a positive constant CΦ
such that
|Φp (ρ1 ) − Φp (ρ2 )| ≤ CΦ |ρ1 − ρ2 |,

ρ1 , ρ2 ∈ [0, 1].

5. Local ergodicity in the boundary-driven exclusion process: Proof of Theorem 4
5.1. Dirichlet problem for the one-site marginal density. As mentioned in §2.4, the invariant
measure µinv of the boundary-driven exclusion process is not a product measure. However, it is
possible to compute the one-site marginals of µinv , denoted ρ(x) := Eµinv [η(x)], x ∈ V (G). Indeed,
using the fact that µinv is invariant, we see that Eµinv [(LbEX
(G,c) η)(x)] = 0 for all x ∈ V (G). Expanding
this equality yields the following linear system:

cxy [ρ(x) − ρ(y)] = 0

Observe that ρ is harmonic w.r.t. the graph Laplacian on V (G)\∂V , and satisfies a Robin boundary
condition on ∂V —the LHS of the second equation is −ia (ρ), the normal derivative of ρ at a ∈ ∂V ,
equivalently, the flow of ρ into a ∈ ∂V .
We may recast (5.1) into a pure Dirichlet problem.

JOE P. CHEN

Proof. It suffices to prove the bounds for all x ∈ ∂V . Since ρ is harmonic on V 0 , the bounds also
hold for all x ∈ V 0 as a consequence of the maximum principle for harmonic functions.
We begin with the boundary condition in (5.2), which can be rewritten as
(5.9)

P̃ ρ|∂V = (I + ΛΣ ) ρ|∂V − Λ+ ,

where P̃ is a |∂V | × |∂V | matrix with entries p̃(a, b), ΛΣ is a |∂V | × |∂V | diagonal matrix with
diagonal entries c−1
a (λ+ (a) + λ− (a)), and Λ+ is a |∂V |-dimensional column vector with entries

ca λ+ (a).

Let γ, γ 0 ∈ [1, ∞) be as in Condition (BR). We prove the lower bound ρ(a) ≥ 1+γ

Suppose, on the contrary, that inf a∈∂V ρ(a) = κ :=

− δ for some δ > 0. Since P̃ is a stochastic

matrix, each component of the vector P̃ ρ|∂V is a convex combination of {ρ(a) : a ∈ ∂V }, and thus
is ≥ κ. Hence

(κ + ) + γ 0 ((1 + γ)(κ + ) − 1) < κ + γ 0 (1 + γ) − γ 0 (1 + γ)δ.
Since  > 0 is arbitrary we deduce that

which leads to a contradiction in light of the identity (5.9).

The proof of the upper bound ρ(a) ≤ 1+γ



Following [16], we introduce a “mock” product Bernoulli measure νλ on {0, 1}V (G) whose marginal
is ρ, i.e., νλ {η : η(x) = 1} = ρ(x) for each x ∈ V (G). Corollary 5.3 implies that νλ is absolutely
continuous w.r.t. any constant-density product Bernoulli measure να , α ∈ (0, 1), on {0, 1}V (G) . As
a result, we can transfer the preceding theorems (the moving particle lemma and the one-block and
two-block estimates) from the measure να to νλ , modulo an issue of reversibility of νλ w.r.t. the
b
generators LEX
(G,c) and L∂V . This is addressed in the next subsection.
5.2. The moving particle lemma for the boundary-driven exclusion process. In this subsection we prove the boundary-driven version of of Proposition 4.2.
Proposition 5.4. Suppose condition (BR) holds. Then for all probability densities f w.r.t. νλ , all
α ∈ (0, 1), and all x, y ∈ V (G), we have

The key difference between Proposition 5.4 and Proposition 4.2 is as follows. While να is

By Condition (E), the second term on the RHS is asymptotically bounded above. From(5.28) and

6. Examples
In this section we comment in more detail on the assumptions, stated in §2, which underlie
our local ergodic theorems (both the conservative version and the boundary-driven version), and
provide examples where the assumptions apply.
Throughout this section, the notation f (·) ' g(·) means that there exist positive constants c ≤ C
such that cg(·) ≤ f (·) ≤ Cg(·) uniformly in the argument.
6.1. Comparison between mean exit time and mean commute time. As alluded to in §2.3,
for many applications we take VN to stand for |B(o, rN )| or V(o, rN ), and TN to be the (extremal)
mean exit time from B(o, rN ). In this situation, Assumption 1 amounts to the condition that
the random walk is strongly recurrent, a property carried by many a weighted graph whose spectral
dimension is less than (but not equal to) 2; this will be explained precisely in §6.2 below. Meanwhile,
Assumption 2 boils down to an asymptotic comparison between the mean exit time and the mean
commute time of the random walk.

28

JOE P. CHEN

Lemma 6.1. If VN = V(o, rN ), then Assumption 2 is equivalent to the following condition:
TN
lim inf lim inf
(6.1)
=∞
N →∞ τN (y, z)
↓0
for each x ∈ V (Γ) and each y, z ∈ B(x, rN ), where
τN (y, z) := Ey [Tz ] + Ez [Ty ]
is the mean commute time between y and z for the symmetric random walk on (ΓN , c).
Proof. We recall the mean commute time identity [23] (see also [48, Proposition 10.6]): given a
finite weighted graph (G, c), we have that for every y, z ∈ V (G),
(6.2)

(G,c)

Ey [Tz ] + Ez [Ty ] = V(G)Reff

(y, z).

Since we assumed Γ is locally finite, (6.2) applies to our setting with (G, c) = (ΓN , c). Thus we
can use (6.2) to reexpress (2.9) in Assumption 2 as (6.1).

It is generally difficult to infer the asymptotics of commute times from those of hitting times;
the analysis often proceeds on a case-by-case basis. For more discussions on this issue we refer the
reader to e.g. [48, Chapter 10] and [5, Chapters 4–5].
6.2. Strongly recurrent weighted graphs. For the next three subsections we always assume
Condition (p0 ). There exists a constant p0 > 0 such that
cxy
(6.3)
≥ p0 for all x ∈ V (Γ) and xy ∈ E(Γ).
p(x, y) :=
cx
Random walk on a connected weighted graph (Γ, c) is said to be recurrent if, for every x ∈ V (Γ),
< ∞] = 1. This is a notion familiar from the theory of Markov chains. Strong recurrence is
a slightly more restrictive notion than recurrence. From the existing literature we are aware of (at
least) two formulations of strong recurrence.
Px [Tx+

Definition 6.2 ([60, 61]). (Γ, c) is strongly recurrent (SR) if there exist c > 0 and M > 1 such
that

Definition 6.3 ([10, 32]). (Γ, c) is very strongly recurrent (VSR) if there exists p1 > 0 such
that
(6.5)

Px [Ty < T (x, 2r)] ≥ p1

for all x ∈ V (Γ), r ≥ 1, d(x, y) < r.

It is proved in [12, Lemma 3.6] that (VSR) implies (SR). See [12, §5, Example 5] for an example
of a weighted graph which satisfies (SR) but not (VSR). What distinguishes (VSR) from (SR) is
the addition of the elliptic Harnack inequality.
Definition 6.4. (Γ, c) satisfies the elliptic Harnack inequality (H) if there exists C > 0 such
that for all x ∈ V (Γ), all r > 1, and all nonnegative harmonic functions h on B(x, 2r),
(6.6)

max h ≤ C min h.

Proposition 6.5. Under (p0 ), (VSR) is equivalent to (SR) + (H).
Proof. We already mentioned that (VSR) implies (SR). That (VSR) implies (H) is proved in [10,
Lemma 1.6]. For the reverse direction see [62, §9.3.1].

Our main result of this section is that local ergodicity in the exclusion process holds under (p0 )
and (VSR).
Proposition 6.6. (p0 ) and (VSR) implies Assumptions 1 and 2.

Proof. Let A be any measurable subset of V (Γ). Using the Green’s function GA killed upon exiting

Assuming that random walks on (Γ, c) are recurrent, GA (x, x) → ∞ as A ↑ Γ. This verifies
Assumption 1.
Next we check Assumption 2. By Proposition 6.5, (p0 ) + (VSR) is equivalent to (p0 ) + (SR) +
(H). By [61, Corollary 4.6], (p0 ), (SR) and (H) implies that

Remark 6.7. (6.7) is reminiscent of the Einstein relation, which connects the expected exit time of
a random walk with the volume and the resistance of the graph. There is some variation in how
the Einstein relation is defined in the literature. In [43] the point-to-point effective resistance is
used:
(Γ,c)
T (x, r) ' V(B(x, r)) sup Reff (x, y) for all x ∈ V (Γ), r ≥ 1.
y∈B(x,r)

In [62] the volume of the ball is replaced by the volume of an annulus, cf. [62, (7.1)]:
(Γ,c)

T (x, 2r) ' V (B(x, 2r) \ B(x, r)) Reff

(B(x, r), B(x, 2r)c )

for all x ∈ V (Γ), r ≥ 1.

The next result concerns the range of the volume growth exponent α and of the time growth
exponent β of weighted graphs to which Assumptions 1 and 2 apply. We recall the conditions
(Vα )
(Eβ )

There exists C ≥ 1 such that C −1 rα ≤V(B(x, r)) ≤ Crα

There exists c ≥ 1 such that c

for all x ∈ V (Γ), r ≥ 1.

Proposition 6.8. Let α ≥ 1 and

β∈

[2, 1 + α], if α ∈ [1, 2),
(α, 1 + α], if α ∈ [2, ∞).

Then there exists an infinite connected locally finite graph which satisfies (Vα ), (Eβ ), (H), and
(VSR), and thus also satisfy Assumptions 1 and 2.
See Figure 2 for the range indicated by Proposition 6.8.

Proof. By [10, Theorem 2], if α ≥ 1 and 2 ≤ β ≤ 1 + α, then there exists an infinite connected
locally finite graph which satisfies (Vα ), (Eβ ), and (H). (In fact, the converse is also true: if an
infinite connected weighted graph satisfies (p0 ), (Vα ), and (Eβ ), then α ≥ 1 and 2 ≤ β ≤ 1 + α; cf.
[10, Theorem 1].) Furthermore, by [10, Proposition 3], if (Vα ), (Eβ ) and (H) hold, and β > α, then
Γ satisfies (VSR). Now use Proposition 6.6.

6.3. Euclidean lattices. We would be remiss not to mention the case of Zd , regarded as a weighted
graph with nearest neighbor edges with all conductances equal to 1. Clearly (p0 ) holds, and it is
a classical result that (H) holds. As for the type problem, it is very strongly recurrent when
d = 1, recurrent but not strongly recurrent when d = 2, and transient when d ≥ 3. Therefore
by Proposition 6.6, Assumptions 1 and 2 hold simultaneously on Z, but not on Zd , d ≥ 2. That
being said, local ergodicity has been proved on Zd for any dimension d using the invariance of the
Dirichlet form EZEX
d (f ) under lattice translations and rotations; see [37, 45, 46].
6.4. Examples of strongly recurrent graphs. In this subsection we discuss specific examples
of strongly recurrent graphs. This also allows us to check Assumption 3 on a case-by-case basis.
6.4.1. Sierpinski gasket (and other post-critically finite fractals). We quickly recall the construction
of the infinite Sierpinski gasket graph; see Fgure 3. Let a0 , a1 , a2 be the vertices of a nondegenerate
triangle in R2 , and G0 be the complete graph on the vertex set V0 = {a0 , a1 , a2 }, as shown on the left
in Figure 3. We declare V0 to be the (analytical but not topological) boundary of SG. Define the
contracting similitude Ψi : R2 → R2 , Ψi (x) = 21 (x − ai ) + ai for each i ∈ {0, 1, 2}. For each N ∈ N,
S
the N th-level SG graph GN is constructed inductively via the formula GN = 2i=0 Ψi (GN −1 ).

Figure 4. A portion of the infinite Sierpinski carpet (SC) graph.
Finally, set the conductance on every e ∈ EN to 1. We denote the corresponding weighted graph
(GN , 1).
For each m-letter word w = w1 w2 · · · wm ∈ {0, 1, 2}m , put Ψw = Ψw1 ◦ Ψw2 ◦ · · · ◦ Ψwm . Two
vertices x, y ∈ VN are said to be in the same level-j cell, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N }, if x, y ∈ Ψw (V0 ) for
some j-letter word w ∈ {0, 1, 2}j .
We now proceed to check Assumptions 1 and 2 on SG. An explicit approach is as follows. Set o
at the origin (the lower-left corner vertex) and take rN = 2N . It is well known that VN ' 3N and
TN ' 5N , and hence Assumption 1 is satisfied. Also, the effective resistance metric and the graph
(Γ,c)
metric on Γ satisfy the scaling Reff (y, z) ' d(y, z)β where β = log(5/3)
log 2 . So for all y, z ∈ B(x, rN ),

which tends to ∞ as N → ∞ for every  ∈ [0, 1). Thus Assumption 2 is satisfied. Altogether this
implies that Theorem 1 holds.
Alternatively, one can invoke the fact that SG is a (very) strongly recurrent graph in the sense
of Definition 6.2 or 6.3, and apply Proposition 6.6.
For the boundary-driven case, we fix for all N the rates λ± (ai ) = ρi ∈ (0, ∞) for i = 0, 1, 2. It
is straightforward to check conditions (E) and (BR), so the key remaining assumption to check is
Assumption 3. Let us note that for a ∈ V0 and u : V (ΓN ) → R, iu (a) coincides with (the negative
of) the normal derivative

By [41, Lemma 3.7.7] or [58, Theorem 2.3.2], if f ∈ dom(∆µ ), where ∆µ is the Laplacian on SG
Nf|
w.r.t. any suitable measure µ (cf. [41, Definition 3.7.1]), then the limit ( 35 )N (∂⊥
ΓN )(a) exists.
Since ρN is the restriction to ΓN of the harmonic function ρ, which belongs to dom(∆µ ) with µ
being the standard self-similar measure on SG, it follows that the limit limN →∞ ( 53 )N iρN (a) exists,
P
and thus limN →∞ ( 35 )N a∈∂VN |iρN (a)| < ∞ as ∂VN is a finite set. Also it is elementary to check

that E(Γ

N ,c)
The aforementioned arguments extend to a wider class of fractals called post-critically finite
(p.c.f.) fractals, see [41, Definition 1.3.13] for the definition. As p.c.f. fractals forms a subfamily
of strongly recurrent fractals, Assumptions 1 and 2 will apply. In the case of the boundary-driven
exclusion process, where the reservoirs are placed on the post-critical set in the construction of
the p.c.f. fractal (see [41, Definition 1.3.4]), Assumption 3 can be verified using [41, Lemma 3.7.7],
essentially a Gauss-Green formula.

Figure 5. The Vicsek tree.
6.4.2. Sierpinski carpets. An example of an infinitely ramified fractal is the Sierpinski carpet, which
can be realized as an infinite graph as shown in Figure 4. It is a strongly recurrent weighted
graph. As a result, Assumptions 1 and 2 hold there. The validity of these assumptions extend
to all generalized Sierpinski carpet graphs (for the precise definition see [11, §2.2]) whose spectral
dimension is less than 2.
Unfortunately, at this moment we are unable to verify Assumption 3, and in turn, establish a
local ergodic theorem in the boundary-driven exclusion process, on the Sierpinski carpet graph.
Unlike on p.c.f. fractals, the corresponding boundary theory on the Sierpinski carpet remains a
challenging problem; see [14, 38] for known results.
6.4.3. Trees. There are many examples of trees to which our Assumptions 1 and 2 are applicable.
On the other hand, there are also many other trees which do not satisfy our Assumptions, such as
d-regular trees with equal weights. Here we focus on two types of trees to which our Assumptions
apply. A more systematic analysis is possible by extending the calculations of [53].
Vicsek trees. These highly symmetric trees arising from the construction of the Vicsek set
are described in e.g. [10, §4]; see Figure 5 for an example of a Vicsek tree. By [10, Lemma 4.2],
Vicsek trees satisfy (Vα ), (Eα+1 ), (H), and (VSR). Thus they form the upper bound in the β values
possible for each given α ≥ 1, as indicated in Proposition 6.8 (see the top line in Figure 2).
The continuum random tree (CRT). The CRT was introduced by Aldous in [2–4]. Croydon
and Hambly [30] showed that the CRT can be realized as a random self-similar fractal represented by
the metric measure space (T , dT , µ). Specifically they proved the following result [30, Theorem 2.1]:
Almost surely there exists a local regular Dirichlet form (ET , FT ) on L2 (T , µ), which is associated
with the metric dT such that for every x 6= y,
dT (x, y)−1 = inf{ET (f, f ) : f ∈ FT , f (x) = 1, f (y) = 0}.
This indicates that dT is the resistance metric on the CRT, and on a tree, the resistance metric
is equal to the geodesic metric. It is proved in [34] that the CRT has Hausdorff dimension (w.r.t.
the resistance metric) equal to 2, although it is not uniformly volume doubling (due to logarithmic
fluctuations), see [28, Theorems 1.1∼1.3] for the relevant estimates in both the quenched and
annealed cases. From heat kernel estimates established in [28] or the Weyl spectral asymptotitcs
established in [30], one can infer that CRT has walk dimension 3.
Remark 6.9. The results above may also be obtained informally as follows. Many finitely ramified
fractals have the property that
(6.12)

dH
dS
=
,
2
dH + 1

where dH is the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal w.r.t. the resistance metric, and dS is the
spectral dimension. This is shown in [44, Theorem A.2]. On a tree, assuming that (Vα ), (Eβ ), and

LOCAL ERGODICITY IN THE EXCLUSION PROCESS ON AN INFINITE WEIGHTED GRAPH

33

the Einstein relation ( d2S = αβ ) hold, (6.12) implies that β = α + 1, which corresponds to the upper
bound for the admissible exponents in Proposition 6.8.
6.4.4. Random graphs arising from percolation. Over the past decade there has been significant
progress in the study of random walks on percolation clusters on Zd (the “ant in the labyrinth”
problem). Taking these clusters as our random graphs, one can obtain heat kernel estimates and
deduce the spectral dimensions (cf. the Alexander-Orbach conjecture). It turns out that many such
random graphs are strongly recurrent: for instance, the incipient infinite cluster (IIC) on a tree, as
well as a high-dimensional (oriented) percolation cluster, satisfies (with high probability) a volume
condition and a resistance condition amounting to a volume growth exponent 2 and time growth
exponent 3. Details are discussed in the monograph [47], in particular (3.22) and Theorem 4.1
therein.
7. Open questions
We conclude the paper with some outstanding questions and future directions.
Connections to scaling limits under the Gromov-Hausdorff-vague convergence. In
a recent preprint [31] Croydon, Hambly, and Kumagai established the convergence of diffusion
processes on a sequence of metric measure spaces (FN , RN , µN , ρN ) (ρN is a distinguished point in
FN ) which converges to (F, R, µ, ρ) in the Gromov-Hausdorff-vague topology (its distinction from the
Gromov-Hausdorff topology is explained in [7]) and satisfies a uniform volume doubling condition.
Croydon [29] then obtained the said convergence of diffusion processes without assuming uniform
volume doubling, rather replacing it with the simpler resistance condition, cf. [29, Assumption 1.1]:
(7.1)

lim lim sup RN (ρN , BN (ρN , r)c ) = ∞,

r→∞ N →∞

where BN (ρN , r) := {y ∈ FN : RN (ρN , y) < r}. We believe that our Assumptions 1 and 2 are
strongly related to Croydon’s condition (7.1), and may be unified via the language of Kigami’s resistance forms [42,43]. This may potentially lead to a unified treatment of convergence of stochastic
processes (both for the single-particle diffusion process and the multi-particle exclusion process) on
a resistance space (i.e., space endowed with a resistance form).
“Slowing” the boundary reservoirs. Take the 1D boundary-driven exclusion process on
{1, 2, · · · , N − 1} subject to rate-1 particle exchanges at the two reservoirs at 0 and N . One can
make the boundaries “slow” by allowing particles to be created or annihilated at a rate proportional
to N −θ at the boundary vertices, where θ is any positive real number. In [8] it is shown that
depending on θ, the scaling limit of the empirical density is the unique solutions to the heat
equation on the unit interval with one of these boundary condition: Dirichlet (θ ∈ (0, 1)), Robin
(θ = 1), or Neumann (θ ∈ (1, ∞)).
As a consequence of Assumption 3, our present work only addresses the Dirichlet boundary
condition. We believe that it is feasible to modify the argument presented in §5 so as to obtain
scaling limits with Robin or Neumann boundary conditions on a resistance space.
Local ergodicity on non-strongly-recurrent weighted graphs. A major outstanding problem is to establish the local ergodic theorem without Assumption 1, or more concretely, on weighted
graphs which support transient random walks. The same question is also open for spaces with spectral dimension equal to 2.
Exclusion processes on (self-similar) groups. Since random walks on groups [63] are predominantly of transient type, our methodology does not extend readily to symmetric exclusion
processes on groups. Nevertheless we would like to mention a potential connection.
Tanaka [59] recently proved a local ergodic theorem on Cayley graphs associated to a class of
infinite amenable groups which are quasi-transitive w.r.t some group actions. As an application,
his methods may be adapted to establish local ergodicity on a close analog of SG, the so-called
Hanoi-tower graph (or the stretched Sierpinski gasket, SSG [6]), which is the Schreier graph of a

34

JOE P. CHEN

self-similar group [51]. We believe that his methodology, in conjunction with the moving particle
lemma of [24, Theorem 1] (replacing √
[59, Lemma 3.1]), should allow one to obtain the two-blocks
estimate on SSG. (The condition tm ≤ 2 diamXm stated in [59, p. 5] is equivalent to the
condition that the random walks satisfy Gaussian or super -Gaussian space-time estimates. Hence
it does not apply to fractal graphs like SSG.) The connection between Tanaka’s work and analysis
on self-similar groups [52] is a subject of future study.
Generalization to the zero-range process. At the moment we do not know how to generalize
our machinery from the exclusion process to the zero-range process (which is defined in e.g. [45,
§2.3]). The biggest obstacle is the lack of a functional inequality (like the octopus inequality
[22, Theorem 2.3]) which would imply, for instance, an optimal spectral gap or a moving particle
lemma (like [24, Theorem 1]). So it remains elusive to establish a two-blocks estimate for the
zero-range process on an infinite weighted graph.
That said, if one is only interested in obtaining a law of large numbers for the empirical density,
then it is possible to bypass the two-blocks estimate. On SG Jara [39] combined the local oneblock estimate of [40], Yau’s H−1 method, and precise Green’s function estimates to prove the
convergence of the empirical density to the unique weak solution of a nonlinear heat equation.
