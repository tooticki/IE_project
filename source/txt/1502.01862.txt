Abstract
We prove that the integral cohomology ring modulo torsion H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor for the symmetric
product of a connected CW-complex X of finite homology type is a functor of H ∗ (X; Z)/Tor (see
Theorem 1). Moreover, we give an explicit description of this functor.
We also consider the important particular case when X is a compact Riemann surface Mg2 of genus
g. There is a famous theorem of Macdonald of 1962, which gives an explicit description of the integral
cohomology ring H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z). The analysis of the original proof by Macdonald shows that it
contains three gaps. All these gaps were filled in by Seroul in 1972, and, therefore, he obtained a
complete proof of Macdonald’s theorem.
Nevertheless, in the unstable case 2 ≤ n ≤ 2g − 2 Macdonald’s theorem has a subsection, that needs
a slight correction even over Q (see Theorem 2).

Introduction

The investigation of (co)homology of symmetric products Symn X := X n /Sn of CW-complexes X has long
history. The first and very deep result is the following theorem of Dold [3].
Theorem (Dold, 1958). Let X and Y be connected Hausdorff spaces homotopy equivalent to CWcomplexes. If H∗ (X; Z) ∼
= H∗ (Y ; Z) (as abelian groups), then H∗ (Symn X; Z) ∼
= H∗ (Symn Y ; Z) for all
n
n ≥ 2. Moreover, Hq (Sym X; Z), 1 ≤ q < ∞, depends only on groups Hi (X; Z), 1 ≤ i ≤ q, and the number
n.
Evidently, this Dold’s theorem implies the following
Corollary. Let X be a connected Hausdorff space homotopy equivalent to CW-complex. If abelian groups
Hq (X; Z) are finitely generated for all q ≥ 1, then Hq (Symn X; Z), 1 ≤ q < ∞, are also finitely generated
for any n ≥ 2.
We will say that a connected CW-complex X has finite homology type, if Hq (X; Z) are finitely generated
for all q ≥ 1.
Remark. The above result of Dold is just a theorem of existence. The rather complicated algorithm
for computing Hq (Symn X; Z), 1 ≤ q < ∞, from Hi (X; Z), 1 ≤ i ≤ q, was constructed by Milgram [8] in
1969 (for X of finite homology type).
The rational cohomology ring H ∗ (Symn X; Q) of connected CW-complexes X of finite homology type
can be easily derived from the following classical
Transfer Theorem. Let Z be an arbitrary simplicial comlex (finite or infinite). Suppose a finite
group G acts on Z simplicially, and K is a field, charK = 0 or p, (|G|, p) = 1. Then the projection map
π : Z → Z/G induces the isomorphism π ∗ : H ∗ (Z/G; K) ∼
= H ∗ (Z; K)G .
The Künneth formula for cohomology and simplicial approximation of CW-complexes taken with Transfer Theorem implies the following
Proposition. Let X be a connected Hausdorff space homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex of finite
homology type. Then the projection map πn : X n → Symn X induces the isomorphism
πn∗ : H ∗ (Symn X; Q) ∼
= H ∗ (X n ; Q)Sn = (H ∗ (X; Q)⊗n )Sn .

Let us denote the ring (H ∗ (X; Q)⊗n )Sn by S n H ∗ (X; Q). If we know some Q-basis γiq ∈ H q (X; Q), ∀q ≥ 1,
and rational multiplication table γiq γjr = ckq,i;r,j γkq+r , c∗∗ ∈ Q, it is not hard to construct some Q-basis of the
Q-algebra S n H ∗ (X; Q) and compute the rational multiplication table for this basis.
Therefore, the rational cohomology ring H ∗ (Symn X; Q) = S n H ∗ (X; Q) of the symmetric product
Symn X is a functor of H ∗ (X; Q). Moreover, this functor has an explicit form.
What about the integral cohomology ring H ∗ (Symn X; Z)? Is it a functor of H ∗ (X; Z)? And,
if it is, how can it be computed?
It is an open question. Actually, I think the answer is “NO”. But, even if the ring H ∗ (Symn X; Z) is
indeed a functor of H ∗ (X; Z), it will be a transcendental problem to describe this functor explicitly. The
main reason is that even for the very simple case X = S 4 the ring H ∗ (Symn X; Z) has very complicated
torsion when n grows up. Rings with complicated torsion have no good description.
The Künneth formula for cohomology gives that for any connected finite CW-complex X the ring
H ∗ (X 2 ; Z) has a natural subring H ∗ (X; Z) ⊗ H ∗ (X; Z) and an unnatural direct summand HT∗ (X 2 ; Z) such
that
M
j
i
HTor
(X; Z) ⊗ HTor
(X; Z).
HTq (X 2 ; Z) :=
i+j=q+1

But it is not known what will be the product α ⌣ β ∈ H ∗ (X 2 ; Z) when α, β ∈ HT∗ (X 2 ; Z), or α ∈ HT∗ (X 2 ; Z)
and β ∈ H ∗ (X; Z) ⊗ H ∗ (X; Z). Now, we want to pose the following
Conjecture 1. The integral cohomology ring H ∗ (X 2 ; Z) is not a functor of the ring H ∗ (X; Z) for
connected (even 1-connected) finite CW-complexes X. This means that there exist two connected finite
CW-complexes X and Y such that H ∗ (X; Z) ∼
= H ∗ (Y ; Z), but the rings H ∗ (X 2 ; Z) and H ∗ (Y 2 ; Z) are not
isomorphic.
The main result of this paper is that the ring H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor is a functor of H ∗ (X; Z)/Tor.
Moreover, we give an explicit description of this functor.
Why this result is not a consequence of the classical result over Q? The reason is the following phenomenon.
Fact α. There exist compact polyhedra (closed manifolds) L and M with torsion-free integral
(co)homology having equal rational cohomology rings H ∗ (L; Q) ∼
= H ∗ (M ; Q), but nonisomorphic integral
∗
∗
cohomology rings H (L; Z) ≇ H (M ; Z).
2
2
For the simplest example of such manifolds L and M take S 2 × S 2 and CP 2 #CP . Here by CP we
denote the complex projective plain CP 2 equipped with the opposite orientation.
These four-dimensional 1-connected manifolds have torsion-free integral cohomology, with the
 multiplicative structure described only by the intersection form. For S 2 × S 2 this form is b1 = 01 10 and for

2
0
CP 2 #CP the form is b2 = 10 −1
. The first form b1 is even, and the second form b2 is odd. So, they are
2

not isomorphic over Z. Thus, H ∗ (S 2 × S 2 ; Z) ≇ H ∗ (CP 2 #CP ; Z).
But, over Q these forms are isomorphic:
u = (x, y) ∈ Q2 ⇒ b1 (u, u) = 2xy = 2(

x′ + y ′
)(x′ − y ′ ) = x′2 − y ′2 .
2

2
Therefore, we get the isomorphism H ∗ (S 2 × S 2 ; Q) ∼
= H ∗ (CP 2 #CP ; Q).
Here is a series of examples of this phenomenon for compact polyhedra. Fix any m ≥ 1. Take S 2m and
4m−1
mappings f2k : ∂D4m
→ S 2m with Hopf invariant h(f2k ) = 2k, k = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Let us take the
S = S4m
4m
4m
2m
. The integral cohomology H ∗ (X2k
; Z) has the form
space X2k := S
f2k D

Z h1i ⊕ Z hui ⊕ Z hvi , |u| = 2m, |v| = 4m, u2 = 2kv.

4m
4m
It is evident, that for any k, l ≥ 1, k 6= l, the integral cohomology rings H ∗ (X2k
; Z) and H ∗ (X2l
; Z) are
∗
4m
not isomorphic. But, for all k ≥ 1, the rational cohomology ring H (X2k ; Q) is equal to the following ring

Q h1i ⊕ Q hui ⊕ Q hv ′ i , |u| = 2m, |v ′ | = 4m, u2 = v ′ .
Of course, for m = 1, 2, 4 one may take also the mappings with odd Hopf invariant.
It is clear, that if L and M are 2-dimensional connected closed orientable manifolds, then the isomorphism
H ∗ (L; Q) ∼
= H ∗ (M ; Q) implies H ∗ (L; Z) ∼
= H ∗ (M ; Z).
What about 3-dimensional manifolds? Let M 3 be an arbitrary closed connected orientable 3-manifold.
Then one has a skew Z-valued 3-form µM 3 : H 1 (M 3 ; Z) × H 1 (M 3 ; Z) × H 1 (M 3 ; Z) → Z given by the cupproduct µM 3 ha, b, ci := abc([M 3 ]). The Poincaré Duality implies that the ring H ∗ (M 3 ; Z)/Tor is completely
determined by the form µM 3 . The famous theorem of Sullivan [11] states that there are no restrictions on
the form µM 3 .
2

Theorem (Sullivan, 1975). Let H be an arbitrary free abelian group of finite rank, and µ : H × H ×
H → Z be an arbitrary skew 3-form. Then there is a closed connected orientable 3-manifold M 3 such that
H∼
= H 1 (M 3 ; Z) and µ ∼
= µM 3 .
Let us take H := Z hα1 , α3 , α3 i and µs : H × H × H → Z, µs hα1 , α3 , α3 i = s, s = 1, 2, 3, . . .. By
the result of Sullivan there exist 3-manifolds Ms3 , s = 1, 2, 3, . . ., with H ∼
= µMs3 .
= H 1 (Ms3 ; Z) and µs ∼
Evidently, one may take M13 = T 3 . It is easy to check that the rings H ∗ (Ms3 ; Z)/Tor, s ∈ N, are pairwise
nonisomorphic. But it is also clear that the rational cohomology rings of all these manifolds are the same.
Therefore, we have just proved the following
Fact β. There exists a series of closed connected orientable 3-manifolds M1 = T 3 , M2 , M3 , . . . having pairwise nonisomorphic integral cohomology rings mod torsion and having one and the same rational
cohomology ring.
For any connected Hausdorff space W of finite homology type we have a canonical inclusion:
H ∗ (W ; Z)/Tor ⊂ H ∗ (W ; Q) and H ∗ (W ; Q) = (H ∗ (W ; Z)/Tor) ⊗ Q.
The most crusual step in the proof of Theorem 1 below is the following Integrality Lemma of Nakaoka
[9] (see Theorem 2.7 and take m = 1, G = Z). It was rediscovered by the author in [5].
Integrality Lemma (Nakaoka, 1957). Let X be a connected Hausdorff space homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex of finite homology type. Then for any n ≥ 2 and any “integral rational” class
α ∈ H ∗ (X; Z)/Tor the following element χ(α) ∈ S n H ∗ (X; Q) lies in the “integral structure” subring
H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor :
χ(α) = α ⊗ 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ α ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 + . . . + 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ α ∈ H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor.
The statement of this Lemma is not evident. For instance, if you take any β ∈ H even(X; Z)/Tor, which is
not of the form mγ for m ≥ 2 and γ ∈ H even (X; Z)/Tor, then the following rather simple tensor β⊗β⊗. . .⊗β
is not integral (i.e. it does not belong to H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor). This tensor becomes integral only after being
multiplied by n!.
In section 2 we prove our main result — Theorem 1, which gives the explicit description of the
ring H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor as a functor of H ∗ (X; Z)/Tor. Recently and independently, in the preprint [2]
Boote and Ray computed the whole integral cohomology ring for symmetric squares of X = CP N and
X = HP N , N ≥ 1. And they obtained the same answer as we for the torsion free quotient.
Let us denote by Mg2 a compact Riemann surface of genus g. In section 3 we consider a famous
Macdonald’s theorem of 1962 (see [6]), which gives an explicit description of the integral cohomology ring
H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z). The analysis of the original proof by Macdonald gives that it contains three gaps. All
these gaps were filled in by Seroul in 1972 (see [10]). Therefore, Seroul in 1972 obtained a complete proof
of Macdonald’s theorem.
This correction in Seroul’s paper takes 31 pages. But, as we will show the Gap 1 can be filled in by
Nakaoka’s Integrality Lemma, and the Gap 2 — by our Theorem 1. The filling in of the Gap 3 takes 7
pages in Seroul’s paper. In section 3 we give a more direct 3 pages proof of the statement of the Gap 3.
Here is a more detailed exposition. At first, Macdonald proves that the ring H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z) has no
torsion. Then he computes the ring H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Q) = H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z) ⊗ Q. Namely, he constructs 2g
elements ξ1 , . . . , ξg , ξ1′ , . . . , ξg′ ∈ H 1 (Symn Mg2 ; Q) and an element η ∈ H 2 (Symn Mg2 ; Q) (all of the form χ(α)
for some elements α ∈ H ∗ (Mg2 ; Z)) such that the ring homomorphism



fQ : ΛQ x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g ⊗ Q[y] → H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Q),
xi 7→ ξi , x′i 7→ ξi′ , 1 ≤ i ≤ g, y 7→ η,

is an epimorphism (here, x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g are formal variables of degree 1, and y is a formal variable of
∗
degree 2). Further Macdonald proves that the ideal IMac,Q
:= KerfQ is generated by the following integral
polynomials:
(1)
xi1 . . . xia x′j1 . . . x′jb (y − xk1 x′k1 ) . . . (y − xkc x′kc )y q ,
where a + b + 2c + q = n + 1 and i1 , . . . , ia , j1 , . . . , jb , k1 , . . . , kc are distinct integers from 1 to g inclusive.
Then Macdonald implicitly claims that a torsion-free ring can be recovered from its tensor product by
Q, which is not always the case. Namely, he claims that the ring homomorphism



fZ : ΛZ x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g ⊗ Z[y] → H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z),
xi 7→ ξi , x′i 7→ ξi′ , 1 ≤ i ≤ g, y 7→ η,

∗
is an epimorphism, and the ideal IMac,Z
:= KerfZ is generated by the same polynomials:

xi1 . . . xia x′j1 . . . x′jb (y − xk1 x′k1 ) . . . (y − xkc x′kc )y q ,
where a + b + 2c + q = n + 1 and i1 , . . . , ia , j1 , . . . , jb , k1 , . . . , kc are distinct integers from 1 to g inclusive.
Here we have three consecutive gaps.
Gap 1. Why the elements ξ1 , . . . , ξg , ξ1′ , . . . , ξg′ , η ∈ H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Q) lie in the integral lattice
H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z)? This gap can be filled in by Integrality Lemma (in Macdonald’s paper [6] there is no
reference to Nakaoka’s paper).
Gap 2. Why the ring homomorphism fZ is an epimorphism? This gap was filled in by Seroul in [10].
It can be also filled in by our Theorem 1 below.
Gap 3. Why the integral polynomials of the form (1) generates the whole ideal KerfZ , but not its
cocompact sublattice? This gap was filled in by Seroul in [10]. In this paper we give a short proof of the
statement of the gap 3.

Hq (X; Z) are finitely generated for all q ≥ 1. Denote by Bm the m-th rational Betti number of X for all
P∞
P∞
m ≥ 0. Let Bodd := m=0 B2m+1 ∈ Z+ ∪ {∞} and B̃even := m=1 B2m ∈ Z+ ∪ {∞}.
Take arbitrary additive basises of H 2m+1 (X; Z)/Tor for all m ≥ 0 and denote by α1 , α2 , . . . the elements of
the union of these basises with the condition |αi | ≤ |αi+1 | ∀1 ≤ i ≤ Bodd − 1. Also take any additive basises
of H 2m (X; Z)/Tor for all m ≥ 1 and denote by β1 , β2 , . . . the elements of the union of these chosen basises
with the same condition |βi | ≤ |βi+1 | ∀1 ≤ i ≤ B̃even − 1.
Then for all n ≥ 2 the following statements hold:
(i) The elements
χ(αi ) = αi ⊗ 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ αi ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 + . . . + 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ αi ∈ H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor,
χ(βj ) = βj ⊗ 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ βj ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 + . . . + 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ βj ∈ H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor,
1 ≤ i ≤ Bodd , 1 ≤ j ≤ B̃even ,
are multiplicative generators of the ring H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor. It means that the minimal subring, which
contains χ(αi ) and χ(βj ), coincides with the whole ring H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor.

form an additive basis of H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor. The multiplier r!m1 !m12 !...ml ! inside big brackets kills the
repetitions of elementary tensors under the summation symbol.
Moreover, if we know the integral multiplication table for the basis {αi , βj }1≤i≤Bodd ,1≤j≤B̃even of
H ∗ (X; Z)/Tor, then there is a simple algorithm for computing the integral multiplication table for the considered basis (∗) of the ring H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor.
Corollary 1. Let X and Y be connected Hausdorff spaces homotopy equivalent to CW-complexes
and having finitely generated integral homology groups in all dimensions. If the rings H ∗ (X; Z)/Tor and
H ∗ (Y ; Z)/Tor are isomorphic, then the rings H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor and H ∗ (Symn Y ; Z)/Tor are also isomorphic for all n ≥ 2.
Proof.
We will use the following notations:
A∗Z := H ∗ (X; Z)/Tor, A∗ := A∗Z ⊗ Q = H ∗ (X; Q),

∗
One has canonical inclusions A∗Z ⊂ A∗ and DnZ
⊂ Dn∗ . The projection πn : X n → Symn X induces the
n
canonical isomorphism πn∗ : H ∗ (Sym X; Q) = Dn∗ → S n A∗ = (H ∗ (X n ; Q))Sn . We will identify the rings
Dn∗ and S n A∗ via this isomorphism πn∗ .
Let us write an explicit formula for the (right) action of the symmetric group Sn on A⊗n . For any
k, l ∈ N we set εkl = 1 if k > l, and εkl = 0 if k ≤ l. Then for any homogeneous a1 , a2 , . . . , an ∈ A∗ one has:

The inductive step: suppose that for all pairs (k, s), 1 ≤ k + s ≤ q < n, the statement holds true. Let us
show that for all pairs (k, s), k + s = q + 1, the statement also holds. Clearly, it is sufficient to derive the
statement for (k + 1, s) and (k, s + 1), where k + s = q, from the statements for all pairs (k, s), k + s = q.

χ(∅|η1 , . . . , ηs )χ(ξ1 |∅) = χ(η1 ξ1 |η2 , η3 , . . . , ηs ) + . . . + χ(ηs ξ1 |η1 , η2 , . . . , ηs−1 ) + χ(ξ1 |η1 , η2 , . . . , ηs ).
Suppose 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, s = 0. Then one has:
χ(ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξk |∅)χ(ξk+1 |∅) = (−1)k−1 χ(ξ2 , ξ3 , . . . , ξk |ξ1 ξk+1 )+
+(−1)k−2 χ(ξ1 , ξ3 , . . . , ξk |ξ2 ξk+1 ) + . . . + (−1)0 χ(ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξk−1 |ξk ξk+1 ) + χ(ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξk , ξk+1 |∅).
Therefore, in the current case the inductive step is proved.
Case (k, s + 1). Using the similar computation one can derive the following formula, which proves the
inductive step in this case:
χ(ξ1 , . . . , ξk |η1 , . . . , ηs )χ(∅|ηs+1 ) =
= χ(ξ1 ηs+1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξk |η1 , . . . , ηs ) + χ(ξ1 , ξ2 ηs+1 , ξ3 , . . . , ξk |η1 , . . . , ηs ) + . . . +
+χ(ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξk ηs+1 |η1 , . . . , ηs ) + χ(ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξk |η1 ηs+1 , η2 , . . . , ηs ) + . . . +
+χ(ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξk |η1 , η2 , . . . , ηs ηs+1 ) + χ(ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξk |η1 , η2 , . . . , ηs , ηs+1 ).

⊂ Dn∗ .
Therefore, we have just proved that the elements of the type (∗) lie in the subring DnZ
∗
It follows from the above induction reasoning, that the minimal subring Z[χ(αi ), χ(βj )] ⊂ DnZ
, generated
by χ(αi ), χ(βj ), 1 ≤ i ≤ Bodd , 1 ≤ j ≤ B̃even , contains all elements of the type (∗). Thus, the statement (ii)
of the theorem implies the statement (i). Let us prove the part (ii).
It is evident,
graded Q-vector space S n A∗ = Dn∗ could be linearly generated by the elements

elements

But, if is = is+1 for some 1 ≤ s ≤ k − 1, then the corresponding symmetric element is equal to zero. Thus,
we have proved that the elements of the type (∗) linearly generates S n A∗ = Dn∗ .
Moreover, it can be derived from Macdonald’s formula for Betti numbers of symmetric products (see
[7]), that these elements (∗) are Q-linear independent. But, we will show it independently, and at the same

Let c̄ = πn∗ (c) ∈ H∗ (Symn X; Q), where πn : X n → Symn X is a canonical projection. We will prove
now, that the element c̄ lies in “integral structure” H∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor ⊂ H∗ (Symn X; Q). This fact could
be easily derived from the following lemma.
Lemma 1. Let X be a connected Hausdorff space homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex and such
that Hq (X; Z) are finitely generated for all q ≥ 1. Suppose b ∈ H2p (X; Z)/Tor, p ≥ 1. Then for all

Remark. This lemma is a weaker version of the so called divided power operations for integral homology
of symmetric products. These operations are mentioned in the paper [4] by Dold (see pp. 15-16).
Proof of lemma 1. It is well known, that any integral homology class a ∈ Hq (X; Z), q ≥ 1, can be
represented as an image a = f∗ ([M q ]) of a fundamental class [M q ] of some connected oriented topologically
normal q-dimensional pseudomanifold M q , where f : M q → X is an appropriate map.
A pseudomanifold M q , which is always assumed to be a compact simplicial complex, is called topologically normal, if the subcomplex Z(M q ) ⊂ M q of singular points of M q does not locally disconnect the
pseudomanifold M q (the point x ∈ M q is called singular if there is no neibourhood x ∈ Ux which is homeomorphic to Rq ). If q = 1, 2 then any topologically normal pseudomanifold M q is a topological manifold.
For all q ≥ 3 there exist topologically normal pseudomanifolds M q with singular points.
It is easy to check that for all m ≥ 2 the symmetric product Symm M 1 of a 1-dimensional manifold
1
M is an m-dimensional topological manifold with boundary. The fundamental natural homeomorphism
Symm C ∼
= Cm , m ≥ 2, implies the fact that symmetric products Symm M 2 of 2-dimensional topological
manifolds are indeed 2m-dimensional topological (even smoothable) manifolds. If M 2 is closed and oriented,
then Symm M 2 is also closed and oriented.
If q ≥ 3, then symmetric products Symm Rq , m ≥ 2, all have singular points. Moreover, these spaces
are not even homology manifolds (there exist points x ∈ Symm Rq , in which local homology is not the
same as for Rmq ). But, it is not hard to check, that symmetric products Symm M q , m ≥ 2, q ≥ 3, of
connected topologically normal q-dimensional pseudomanifolds M q are also connected topologically normal
pseudomanifolds of dimension mq. It is also easy to prove, that pseudomanifold Symm M q , m ≥ 2, q ≥ 3, is
orientable iff q is even and M q is orientable.
Suppose b ∈ H2p (X; Z)/Tor, p ≥ 1. Then there exists a connected oriented topologically normal 2pdimensional pseudomanifold M 2p and a map f : M 2p → X such that b = f∗ ([M 2p ]). We have the following
commutative diagram:

which concludes the proof of the lemma.

Therefore, we have the above considered element c ∈ H∗ (X n ; Q) with the “integral” image c̄ = πn∗ (c) ∈
H∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor. Let γ̄ ∈ H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor be an arbitrary element of the type (∗). Denote also
γ = πn∗ (γ̄) ∈ H ∗ (X n ; Z)/Tor. We have hγ̄, c̄i = hγ, ci ∈ Z.
Now, let γ̄ ∈ H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor runs over all elements of type (∗), and c ∈ H∗ (X n ; Q) runs over all
elements of the type (2). It is easy to see, that the value hγ̄, c̄i = hγ, ci always belongs to the set {0, +1, −1}.
Moreover, hγ̄, c̄i 6= 0 iff the elements γ and c are constructed from the same combinatorial data, i.e.
k ′ = k, i′1 = i1 , . . . , i′k = i′k′ , l′ = l, m′1 = m1 , . . . , m′l′ = ml , j1′ = j1 , . . . , jl′′ = jl , r′ = r.
Let us fix any p ≥ 1. Then, by construction the elements γ̄ ∈ H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor of degree p forms a
Q-basis of H p (Symn X; Q) and the elements c̄ ∈ H∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor of degree p forms a ±-dual Q-basis of
Hp (Symn X; Q). But, as we take the elements γ̄ and c̄ from “integral” lattices, this fact implies that our
elements of the type (∗) with degree p forms a Z-basis of the lattice H p (Symn X; Z)/Tor.
The statement (ii) of the theorem is proved. As was mentioned above, (ii) implies (i), so the part (i)
is also proved. By product, we have shown that the elements of the type (2) with degree p forms a Z-basis
of the homology lattice Hp (Symn X; Z)/Tor, i.e. we have constructed also an explicit Z-basis in homology
modulo torsion.
Suppose we know the integral multiplication table for the considered Z-basis αi , βj , 1 ≤ i ≤ Bodd , 1 ≤
j ≤ B̃even , of the ring H ∗ (X; Z)/Tor:
αi αj = ckij βk , βi βj = dkij βk , αi βj = ekij αk , c∗∗∗ , d∗∗∗ , e∗∗∗ ∈ Z.
Let us denote by γ̄1 , γ̄2 , . . . the elements of the type (∗), which forms a Z-basis of our ring
H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor. Now, we will present a simple algorithm for computing the integral multiplication

γ̄1 , γ̄2 , . . . forms the Z-basis of the ring H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor. This fact implies that these rational structural

constants νij
are indeed integral.
So, we have just presented a simple algorithm for computing the integral multiplication table for the
constructed Z-basis (∗) of our ring H ∗ (Symn X; Z)/Tor. The theorem is completely proved.

Let us denote by RZ the following category. Objects of RZ are connected graded commutative rings
with identity A∗ = Z h1i ⊕ A1 ⊕ A2 ⊕ . . . such that all homogeneous components Ai , i ≥ 1, are free abelian
groups of finite rank. Morphisms of the category RZ are ring homomorphisms. Consider the following
functor SZn : RZ → RZ , n ≥ 2.
For any A∗ from RZ take S n A∗ := (A⊗n )Sn and define SZn A∗ to be the minimal subring of S n A∗ , that
contains elements χ(a) = a ⊗ 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 + . . . + 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ a for all a ∈ A∗ . For any two A∗ and B ∗ from
RZ and an arbitrary ring homomorphism f : A∗ → B ∗ we have ring homomorphisms f ⊗n : A⊗n → B ⊗n
and S n f := f ⊗n |S n A∗ ,S n B ∗ . Let us define the ring homomorphism SZn f := S n f |SZn A∗ ,SZn B ∗ . This ring
homomorphism is correct due to the fact that f ⊗n (χ(a)) = χ(f (a)) for all a ∈ A∗ . Therefore, we obtain a
correct functor SZn : RZ → RZ .
Lemma 2. Fix any ring A∗ from RZ . Let us denote by α1 , α2 , . . . an arbitrary Z-basis of the odddimensional part Aodd , and by β1 , β2 , . . . an arbitrary Z-basis of the even-dimensional part Aeven≥2 . Then

Macdonald’s theorem

The natural homeomorphism Symn C ∼
= Cn implies that for any 2-dimensional manifold M 2 its symmetric
n
2
product Sym M is a 2n-dimensional topological manifold. Actually, it is always smoothable and admits a
natural complex structure if M 2 is equipped with a structure of a Riemann surface.
It is well known that if M 2 is a compact Riemann surface then Symn M 2 is a smooth projective algebraic
variety. The standard fact is that Symn CP 1 ∼
= CP n . Let us denote by Mg2 an arbitrary compact Riemann
surface of genus g ≥ 1. There is a classical Abel map Ab : Symn Mg2 → Jac = T g , where Jac is a Jacobian
variety of Mg2 , which is a g-dimensional complex torus. The following famous theorem states the good
behavior of Abel map for stable n.
Theorem (Mattuck, 1961). If n ≥ 2g − 1, then Abel map Ab : Symn Mg2 → Jac = T g is an algebraic
projective bundle, with fiber CP n−g . Moreover, it is a projectivization of a canonically defined algebraic
complex vector bundle, with fiber Cn−g+1 .
The integral cohomology ring of Mg2 is well known:
H ∗ (Mg2 ; Z) = Z h1i ⊕ Z hα1 , . . . , α2g i ⊕ Z hβi ,
αi αi+g = −αi+g αi = β, 1 ≤ i ≤ g, the rest products are zero.
Let us denote
χ(αi ) = αi ⊗ 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 + . . . + 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ αi = ξi , 1 ≤ i ≤ g,
χ(αi+g ) = αi+g ⊗ 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 + . . . + 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ αi+g = ξi′ , 1 ≤ i ≤ g,
χ(β) = β ⊗ 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 + . . . + 1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ 1 ⊗ β = η.
Without Integrality Lemma we have
ξ1 , . . . , ξg , ξ1′ , . . . , ξg′ , η ∈ H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Q)
Consider the free graded commutative Q-algebra



ΛQ x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g ⊗ Q[y],

where x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g , y are formal variables, |xi | = |x′i | = 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ g, |y| = 2.
Here we state a famous theorem of Macdonald [6] (case Q).
Theorem α (Macdonald, 1962). Suppose Mg2 is an arbitrary compact Riemann surface of genus g ≥ 1,

Then the following statements hold:

Proof. We will deduce these statements from (i). It is evident that the 4-tuples (a, b, c, q) ∈ Z4+ from
(i) are the solutions of the following system
(
a + b + 2c + q = n + 1

a + b + c ≤ g.

Now, our goal is to deduce any polynomial from (i) with the 4-tuple (ã, b̃, c̃, q̃) from polynomials with
(a, b, c, q) such that q < q̃ (if it can be done). Consider the following 4 cases.
Case I. (q̃ ≥ 1, ã ≥ 1)
Set a = ã − 1, b = b̃, c = c̃ + 1, q = q̃ − 1. Take any distinct integers
{i1 , i2 , . . . , ia , iã=a+1 , j1 , . . . , jb̃=b , k1 , . . . , kc̃=c−1 } ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , g}.
We will deduce the polynomial

from the polynomial for the set of indices
{i1 , i2 , . . . , ia , j1 , . . . , jb , k1 , . . . , kc−1 , kc := ia+1 } ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , g},
and q = q̃ − 1. Here is the deduction:

⇒ xi1 . . . xiã x′j1 . . . x′jb̃ (y − xk1 x′k1 ) . . . (y − xkc̃ x′kc̃ )y q̃ ∈ IMac

Case II. (q̃ ≥ 1, b̃ ≥ 1)
Set a = ã, b = b̃ − 1, c = c̃ + 1, q = q̃ − 1. The reasoning in this case is absolutely similar and is left to the
reader.
Case III. (q̃ ≥ 2, ã = b̃ = 0, 0 ≤ c̃ ≤ g − 1)
Set a = b = 0, c = c̃ + 1, q = q̃ − 2. Take any distinct integers
{k1 , . . . , kc̃=c−1 } ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , g},
and add to them any kc ∈ {1, 2, . . . , g}\{k1 , . . . , kc̃=c−1 }. Here is the desired deduction:

Case IV. (ã = b̃ = 0, c̃ = g)
As we have ã + b̃ + 2c̃ + q̃ = 2g + q̃ = n + 1 and q̃ ≥ 0, this case can occur iff n ≥ 2g − 1 (stable dimension).
In this case there is only one polynomial:
∗
(y − x1 x′1 )(y − x2 x′2 ) . . . (y − xg x′g )y n−2g+1 ∈ IMac
.

Suppose first that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2g − 2. Then from above analysis of Cases I,II,III, we obtain the following
∗
fact: the ideal IMac
is generated by the polynomials from (i) with q = 0 and q = 1.
Consider any 4-tuple (ã, b̃, c̃, q̃ = 1). We have ã + b̃ + 2c̃ + 1 = n + 1. If n is an odd number, n =
3, 5, . . . , 2g − 3, then ã + b̃ is always odd. In particular, ã ≥ 1 or b̃ ≥ 1. So, we come to Case I or II. Thus,
any polynomial with a given (ã, b̃, c̃, q̃ = 1) is a consequence of polynomials with q = 0. The correction
fA ) is completely proved.
(iii
∗
Now, suppose that n = 2, 4, . . . , 2g − 2. It is easy to check, that in this case the ideal IMac
is generated
n
by the polynomials from (i) with q = 0 and (a, b, c, q) = (0, 0, 2 , 1). Any polynomial with 4-tuple (0, 0, n2 , 1)
has the form:

we have

By change i ↔ k we obtain

So, for any distinct integers i, k, k2 , k3 , . . . , k n2 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , g} we have
∗
y(xi x′i − xk x′k )(y − xk2 x′k2 ) . . . (y − xk n x′k n ) = 0 mod Ihq=0i

This formula can be rewritten in the way

Let us consider the stable case n ≥ 2g − 1. Take any 4-tuple (a, b, c, q). We have double inequality
a + b + 2c ≤ 2(a + b + c) ≤ 2g. We also have the identity a + b + 2c + q = n + 1. It follows that
q = n + 1 − (a + b + 2c) ≥ n + 1 − 2g = qmin ≥ 0. Thus, the minimal q that may occur in this case is
qmin = n − 2g + 1 and there is only one polynomial with this qmin :
∗
(y − x1 x′1 )(y − x2 x′2 ) . . . (y − xg x′g )y n−2g+1 ∈ IMac
.

Consider any 4-tuple (ã, b̃, c̃, q̃) with q̃ > qmin . If ã ≥ 1 or b̃ ≥ 1, then we get to Cases I or II, and,
therefore, any polynomial with this 4-tuple (ã, b̃, c̃, q̃) is a consequence of some polynomial with q < q̃. If
ã = b̃ = 0, then q̃ = n + 1 − 2c̃ > n + 1 − 2g. It follows that 0 ≤ c̃ ≤ g − 1 and q̃ ≥ 2, so, we get to Case III.
And again any polynomial with this 4-tuple (ã, b̃, c̃, q̃) is a consequence of some polynomial with q < q̃.

By finite descending induction we obtain, that in the stable case n ≥ 2g − 1 the ideal IMac

In the same paper [6] Macdonald proves that the integral cohomology ring H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z) has no
torsion. This fact can be derived more directly in the following way. Suppose X is a connected CWcomplex. Let us fix any base-point x0 ∈ X. This gives the series of inclusion mappings
X ֒→ Sym2 X ֒→ Sym3 X ֒→ . . . .
The prominent Steenrod Splitting Theorem states the isomorphism of abelian groups
Hq (Symn X; Z) ∼
=

M

Hq (Symk X/Symk−1 X; Z), q ≥ 1, n ≥ 1,

k=1

and also that Hq (Symn X; Z) is mapped isomorphically to a direct summand of Hq (Symn+1 X; Z), q, n ≥ 1.
This theorem implies that if X is a connected finite CW-complex and integral homology H∗ (SymN X; Z)
is torsion-free for all N greater than some N0 , then integral homology H∗ (Symn X; Z) is torsion-free for
all n ≥ 1. If we take X = Mg2 , then for N ≥ N0 := 2g − 1 the homology H∗ (SymN Mg2 ; Z) is torsionfree due to the above Mattuck’s theorem. Therefore, we get the result that the integral cohomology ring
H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z) has no torsion.
Let us take the following free graded commutative ring



ΛZ x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g ⊗ Z[y],
13

where x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g , y are formal variables, |xi | = |x′i | = 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ g, |y| = 2.
Here we formulate the famous theorem of Macdonald [6] (case Z).
Theorem β (Macdonald, 1962). Suppose Mg2 is an arbitrary compact Riemann surface of genus g ≥ 1,
and n ≥ 2. Take the graded ring homomorphism



fZ : ΛZ x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g ⊗ Z[y] → H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z),
xi 7→ ξi , x′i 7→ ξi′ , 1 ≤ i ≤ g, y 7→ η.

Then the following statements hold:
∗
(i) fZ is an epimorphism, and Ker(fZ ) = IMac
is generated by the following polynomials
xi1 . . . xia x′j1 . . . x′jb (y − xk1 x′k1 ) . . . (y − xkc x′kc )y q ,
where a + b + 2c + q = n + 1 and i1 , . . . , ia , j1 , . . . , jb , k1 , . . . , kc are distinct integers from 1 to g inclusive.

(when we derived above the relations of (i) from the corresponding relations of (ii), (iii
were no denominators: all constants were equal to 0 and ±1).
The original proof of Theorem β(i) was the following claim:
“We have proved Theorem α(i). The integral cohomology ring H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z) has no torsion. So, everything remains true, when we replace Q by Z throughout.”
But, as we have shown in the Introduction, there exist manifolds L, M with torsion-free cohomology,
having equal rational cohomology rings H ∗ (L; Q) ∼
= H ∗ (M ; Q) but nonisomorphic integral cohomology rings
∗
∗
H (L; Z) ≇ H (M ; Z).
More careful analysis for the deduction of the result over Z from the result over Q gives us the following
three gaps.
Gap 1. Why the considered elements
ξ1 , . . . , ξg , ξ1′ , . . . , ξg′ , η ∈ H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Q)
lie in the integral lattice H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z)? This Gap is filled in by Integrality Lemma.
Gap 2. Why the graded ring homomorphism



fZ : ΛZ x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g ⊗ Z[y] → H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z),
xi 7→ ξi , x′i 7→ ξi′ , 1 ≤ i ≤ g, y 7→ η,

is an epimorphism? Equivalently, why the elements ξ1 , . . . , ξg , ξ1′ , . . . , ξg′ , η are multiplicative generators of
the ring H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z)? This Gap was filled in by Seroul in [10]. It also can be filled in by Theorem 1.
Now, we have the epimorphism



fZ : ΛZ x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g ⊗ Z[y] → H ∗ (Symn Mg2 ; Z),

∗
∗
whose kernel contains IMac
(by IMac
we denote the ideal generated by the polynomials from (i)). Therefore,
the induced graded ring homomorphism



∗

f¯Z : ΛZ x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g ⊗ Z[y]/IMac

is also an epimorphism. Moreover, after ⊗Q it turns out to be an isomorphism (Theorem α(i)). It follows
that



∗
).
Ker(f¯Z ) = Tor(ΛZ x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g ⊗ Z[y]/IMac

Gap 3. Why Ker(f¯Z ) is zero? This Gap was filled in by Seroul in [10] (see Theorem 1.2.3, the proof
takes 7 pages). Here we present a shorter 3 pages proof of the statement.
Proposition 1. In the above notations
the kernel Ker(f¯Z) is zero.


∗
Proof. Let us denote the ring ΛZ x1 , . . . , xg , x′1 , . . . , x′g ⊗ Z[y] by Eg,n

Our aim is to prove that Tor(Eg,n

For any subset {i1 , . . . , ia , j1 , . . . , jb , k1 , . . . , kc } ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , g} and any q ≥ 0 let us consider the following

and S(P ) = xi1 . . . xia x′j1 . . . x′jb (y − xk1 x′k1 ) . . . (y − xkc x′kc )y q .
Clearly, deg P = deg S(P ) = a + b + 2c + 2q. Set w(P ) := a + b + 2c + q = the “weight” of P .
∗
∗
The ideal IMac

is generated by elements S(P ) for all monomials P with w(P ) = n + 1. For such

monomials P we have deg S(P ) = w(P ) + q = n + 1 + q ≥ n + 1. It follows that IMac

First, let us prove that elements S(P ) lie in IMac
for all monomials P with w(P ) ≥ n + 1. We will use
the induction on w(P ). The base w(P ) = n + 1 is correct.
The inductive step. Suppose that the statement is proved for w(P ) = n + t for some t ≥ 1. Let us prove
the statement for w(P ) = n + t + 1. Take an arbitrary monomial

P = xi1 . . . xia x′j1 . . . x′jb xk1 x′k1 . . . xkc x′kc y q ,
with w(P ) = a + b + 2c + q = n + t + 1.
(1) c ≥ 1. In this case the corresponding element S(P ) has the following decomposition:
S(P ) = xi1 . . . xia x′j1 . . . x′jb (y − xk1 x′k1 ) . . . (y − xkc x′kc )y q =
xi1 . . . xia x′j1 . . . x′jb (y − xk1 x′k1 ) . . . (y − xkc−1 x′kc−1 )y q+1 −

P1 = xi1 . . . xia x′j1 . . . x′jb xk1 x′k1 . . . xkc−1 x′kc−1 y q+1 and
P2 = xkc xi1 . . . xia x′j1 . . . x′jb xk1 x′k1 . . . xkc−1 x′kc−1 y q .
∗
Evidently, w(P1 ) = w(P2 ) = w(P ) − 1 = n + t. By induction hypothesis, we have S(P1 ), S(P2 ) ∈ IMac
. It
∗
follows that S(P ) also lies in IMac . The inductive step in the case (1) is proved.
(2.1) c = 0, a = b = 0. In this case P = y q = S(P ) and w(P ) = q = n + t + 1 ≥ n + 1. But, one has

(2.2) c = 0, a ≥ 1. In this case the corresponding element S(P ) has the following simple decomposition:

S(P ) = ±xia S(Q),

Clearly, w(Q) = w(P ) − 1 = n + t. So, one has S(Q) ∈ IMac
case is proved.
(2.3) c = 0, b ≥ 1. The reasoning here is an evident change of that in the previous case.
So, we have just proved the induction step in all cases.
∗
for all monomials P with w(P ) ≥ n + 1.
Therefore, we have proved, that S(P ) ∈ IMac
Let us call a monomial P “primitive”, if 1 ≤ w(P ) ≤ n. How many are primitive monomials P of degree
s = n + t, 1 ≤ t ≤ n − 1? We have two conditions for P :

1 ≤ w(P ) = a + b + 2c + q ≤ n,

have S(P ) ∈ IMac

Now, we also have two possibilities: (A) c = 0, here P = S(P ) ∈ IMac

the same decomposition of S(P ) as in the previous case (n + 1 ≤ s ≤ 2n − 1).

primitive P of the type (a, b, c, q). We have two conditions:

deg P = a + b + 2c + 2q = 2n,
w(P ) = a + b + 2c + q ≤ n.
Clearly, we get 0 ≤ q ≤ n. If q = n, then a = b = c = 0 and P = y n . If 0 ≤ q ≤ n − 1, then
w(P ) = 2n − q ≥ n + 1. Thus, we have just proved that the only primitive monomial in our last case is
P = yn.
