Abstract. Given a nontrivial homogeneous ideal I ⊆ k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xd ], a problem
of great recent interest has been the comparison of the rth ordinary power of I
and the mth symbolic power I (m) . This comparison has been undertaken directly
via an exploration of which exponents m and r guarantee the subset containment
I (m) ⊆ I r and asymptotically via a computation of the resurgence ρ(I), a number
for which any m/r > ρ(I) guarantees I (m) ⊆ I r . Recently, a third quantity, the
symbolic defect, was introduced; as I t ⊆ I (t) , the symbolic defect is the minimal
number of generators required to add to I t in order to get I (t) .
We consider these various means of comparison when I is the edge ideal of
certain graphs by describing an ideal J for which I (t) = I t + J. When I is the edge
ideal of an odd cycle, our description of the structure of I (t) yields solutions to both
the direct and asymptotic containment questions, as well as a partial computation
of the sequence of symbolic defects.

1. Introduction
Let k be an algebraically closed field, and I a nonzero proper homogeneous ideal
in S = k[x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ]. Recall that the mth symbolic power of I is the ideal


\
I (m) = S ∩ 
I m SP  .
P ∈Ass(I)

Over the last 10–15 years, the structure of I (m) has been an object of ongoing study;
see, e.g., the recent survey [5]. One avenue for this study has been the examination
of the relationship between I (m) and the well-understood algebraic structure of I r ,
the rth ordinary power of I. The naive context in which to examine this relationship
is via subset containments, i.e., for which m and r, s, and t do we have I (m) ⊆ I r
and I s ⊆ I (t) ? In fact, this line of inquiry has been extremely productive. It is
straightforward to see that I s ⊆ I (t) if and only if s > t, but determining which r
and m give I (m) ⊆ I r is more delicate.
Seminal results of Ein-Lazarsfeld-Smith and Hochster-Huneke [8, 10] established
that for such ideals, I (m) ⊆ I r if m/r > N. Additional information about the ideal
under consideration generally leads to tighter results (see, e.g., [1, 6, 7]). This phenomenon led to Bocci and Harbourne’s introduction of a quantity known
as the resur
	
gence of I, denoted ρ(I); it is the least upper bound of the set T = m/r | I (m) 6⊆ I r .
Thus, if m/r > ρ(I), we have I (m) ⊆ I r .
Recently, Galetto, Geramita, Shin, and Van Tuyl introduced a new measure of the
difference between I (m) and I m known as the symbolic defect. Since I m ⊆ I (m) , the
quotient I (m) /I m is a finite S-module; thus, we let sdefect(I, m) denote the number
1

of minimal generators of I (m) /I m as an S-module. This is known as the symbolic
defect, and the symbolic defect sequence is the sequence {sdefect(I, m)}m∈N . In [9],
the authors study the symbolic defect sequences of star configurations in Pnk and
homogeneous ideals of points in P2k .
Our work considers all these questions in the context of a class of edge ideals. Let
G = (V, E) be a (simple) graph on the vertex set V = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn } with edge set
E. The edge ideal of G, introduced in [13], is the ideal I(G) ⊆ R = k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]
given by
I(G) = ({xi xj | {xi , xj } ∈ E}).
That is, I(G) is generated by the products of pairs of those variables between which
are edges in G.
In [11], the authors establish that, for an edge ideal I = I(G), we have I (m) = I m
for all m > 1 if and only if G is bipartite. A natural question, then, is to explore the
relationship between I(G)(m) and I(G)r when G is not bipartite, which is equivalent
to G containing an odd cycle. Thus, [14] sought to explore this relationship when
G = C2n+1 is a cycle on 2n + 1 vertices.
We continue the problem of exploring the structure of the symbolic power I(G)(t)
for certain classes of graphs G, with a focus on when G is an odd cycle. The main
results of this work are Theorem 4.4 and Corollary 4.5, which together describe a
decomposition of the form I (t) = I t + J, where J is a well-understood ideal. We
are then able to use this decomposition to resolve [14, Conjecture 15], compute
ρ(I(C2n+1 )) in Theorem 5.11, and establish a partial symbolic defect sequence in
Theorem 5.13. We close by showing that our ideas in Theorem 4.4 apply for complete
graphs and graphs which consist of an odd cycle plus an additional vertex and edge.
Remark. As preparation of this manuscript was concluding in summer 2017, Dao
et. al posted the preprint [5]. In particular, their Theorem 4.13 bears a striking
resemblance to our Corollary 5.3. While these similarities are worth noting, in part
as evidence that interest in symbolic powers is high, it is also worth noting that the
aims of these two works are distinct and complementary. The aim of the relevant
sections of [5] is to investigate the packing property for edge ideals, while ours is
to more directly describe the difference between the ordinary and symbolic powers
by investigating the structure of a set of minimal generators for I (t) . We then use
information about these generators to compute invariants related to the containment
I (m) ⊆ I r .
2. Background results
Edge ideals are an important class of examples of squarefree monomial ideals,
i.e., an ideal generated by elements of the form xa11 xa22 · · · xann , where ai ∈ {0, 1} for
all i. When I is squarefree monomial, it is well-known that the minimal primary
decomposition is
I = P1 ∩ · · · ∩ Pr , with Pj = (xj1 , . . . , xjsj ) for j = 1, . . . , r.
When I = I(G) is an edge ideal, the variables in the Pj ’s are precisely the vertices
in the minimal vertex covers of G. Recall that, given a graph G = (V, E), a vertex

cover of G is a subset V ′ ⊆ V such that for all e ∈ E, e ∩ V ′ 6= ∅. A minimal vertex
cover is a vertex cover minimal with respect to inclusion.
Lemma 2.1 ([12], Corollary 3.35). Let G be a graph on the vertices {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn },
I = I(G) ⊆ k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ] be the edge ideal of G and V1 , V2 , . . . , Vr the minimal
vertex covers of G. Let Pj be the monomial prime ideal generated by the variables in
Vj . Then
I = P1 ∩ P2 ∩ · · · ∩ Pr
and
I (m) = P1m ∩ P2m ∩ · · · ∩ Prm .
Symbolic powers of squarefree monomial ideals (and, more specifically, edge ideals)
have enjoyed a great deal of recent interest (see, e.g., [4, 3]). In [3], a linear programming approach is used to compute invariants related to the containment question.
We adapt this technique in Lemma 5.8 for the edge ideals under consideration in this
paper. One result of [3] which will be of use is the following.
Lemma 2.2. Let I ⊆ R be a squarefree monomial ideal with minimal primary decomposition I = P1 ∩ P2 ∩ · · · ∩ Pr with Pj = (xj1 , . . . , xjsj ) for j = 1, . . . , r. Then
xa1 · · · xan ∈ I (m) if and only if aj1 + . . . + ajsj > m for j = 1, . . . , r.
Remark 2.3. Throughout this work, we will be exploring questions about ideals in
R = k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ] related to graphs on the vertex set {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn }. We will use
the xi ’s interchangeably to represent both vertices and variables. The specific use
should be clear from the context, and we see this as an opportunity to emphasize
the close connection between the graph and the ideal.
3. Factoring monomials along odd cycles
In this section, we introduce the main ideas of our approach to studying symbolic
powers of edge ideals. We define a means of writing a monomial in a power of an
edge ideal with respect to the minimal vertex covers of the graph and study the
properties of this representation. In what follows, let R = k[x1 , x2 , . . . , x2n+1 ] and
let I = I(C2n+1 ) be the edge ideal of the odd cycle C2n+1 .
Definition 3.1. Let m ∈ k[x1 , x2 , . . . , x2n+1 ] be a monomial. Let ej denote the
monomial representing the jth edge in the cycle, i.e., ej = xj xj+1 for 1 6 j 6 2n,
and e2n+1 = x2n+1 x1 . We may then write
a

e1 e2 · · · e2n+1
,

P
where b(m) := bj is as large as possible (observe 0 6 2b(m) 6 deg(m)) and ai > 0.
When m is written in this way, we will call this an optimal factorization of m, or say
that m is expressed in optimal form. In addition, each xai i with ai > 0 in this form
will be called an ancillary factor of the optimal factorization, or just an ancillary for
short.
Observe that the optimal form representation of m is not unique in the sense
that different edges may appear as factors of m; for example, in k[x1 , . . . , x5 ], if
m = x21 x22 x3 x4 x5 we may write m = x1 e1 e2 e4 = x2 e1 e3 e5 .

The next lemma describes a process that will be critical in the proof of Theorem
4.4. Intuitively, it says that if a monomial is factored along a path of an odd number
of consecutive edges with ancillaries on both ends of this path of edges, the monomial
is not written in optimal form, i.e., it can be rewritten as a product of strictly more
edges. Before stating and proving the lemma, we illustrate the process with an
example.

Example 3.3. Let G be a cycle with 111 vertices and consider m = x31 x42 x23 x34 x55 x36 x27 x28 ∈
I(G) with edge factorization:
m = x1 e21 e22 e34 e25 e6 e7 x8
where ei = xi xi+1 . Note that in this factorization, there is an ancillary at x1 and x8 .
We will show that m is not in optimal form.
We can graphically represent m by drawing an edge between xi and xi+1 for each
ei in m and creating a bold outline for each ancillary, as shown below:

Using a method described more fully in Lemma 3.4, we will “break” each of the
red (bolded) edges back into standard xi notation so that we create new ancillaries
at every vertex.

Note that if we define a new monomial p based on this graphical representation,
where p = x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 e21 e2 e24 e25 e7 , we have m = p because we are merely changing the factorization of the monomial m, not its value.
As one can see, there are now 8 consecutive ancillaries, which we can pair up in a
new way, as shown below. New edges are highlighted in green (bolded in the second
line).

Now we have a third possible representation q of this monomial. Note that q =
and q = p = m. As you can see, this monomial representation has one
more edge than our original representation, which means that m is not optimal.

4. Powers of edge ideals and their structures
We will now turn to a decomposition of I (t) in terms of I t and another ideal J so
that I (t) = I t + J. Our approach has numerous strengths, including the ability to
easily compute the symbolic defect of I for certain powers, as well as to determine
which additional elements are needed to generate I (t) from I t .
Although we will primarily focus on odd cycles in this section, we go on to show
that the same underlying principles can be extended to edge ideals of other types of
graphs; see Section 6 for more.
Definition 4.1. Let V ′ ⊆ V (G) = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xr } be a set of vertices. For a
monomial xa ∈ k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xr ] with exponent vector a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , ar ), define the
vertex weight wV ′ (xa ) to be

6

We will usually be interested in the case when V ′ is a minimal vertex cover.
Using the language of vertex weights, the definition of the symbolic power of an
edge ideal given in Lemma 2.2 becomes
I (t) = ({xa | for all minimal vertex covers V ′ , wV ′ (xa ) > t}).
Now define sets
L(t) = {xa | deg(xa ) > 2t and for all minimal vertex covers V ′ , wV ′ (xa ) > t}
and
D(t) = {xa | deg(xa ) < 2t and for all minimal vertex covers V ′ , wV ′ (xa ) > t},
and generate ideals (L(t)) and (D(t)), respectively. Note that I (t) = (L(t)) + (D(t)).
The main work of this section is to show, for the edge ideal I of an odd cycle, that
I t = (L(t)), which is the content of Theorem 4.4.
Lemma 4.2. Let S = k[x1 , . . . , xr ], G be a graph on {x1 , . . . , xr }, I = I(G), and
L(t) be as defined above. Then I t ⊆ (L(t)).
Q

Proof. Suppose m ∈ I t . Write m in optimal form as m = xa11 · · · xar r i<j eijij . We
know that given an arbitrary minimal vertex cover V ′ and edge eij = xi xj dividing
m, it must be true that xi ∈ V ′ or xj ∈ V ′ or both. Thus wV ′ (m) > b(m). Further,
since m ∈ I t , we know b(m) > t and deg(m) > 2t, which means that m ∈ (L(t)). 
Lemma 4.3. Let S = k[x1 , . . . , xr ], G be a graph on {x1 , . . . , xr }, I = I(G), and
L(t) be as defined above. For all m 6∈ I t , if m has no ancillaries or a single ancillary
of degree 1 then m 6∈ (L(t)).
Proof. If there are no ancillaries in m then deg(m) = 2b(m) < 2t. Thus, m cannot
be in L(t), which also means that it is not in (L(t)) as none of the divisors of m are
in L(t) for a similar reason. Furthermore, we reach the same conclusion if there is
only one ancillary in m and it has an exponent of 1, as deg(m) = 2b(m) + 1 < 2t + 1,
and since 2b(m) + 1 and 2t + 1 are both odd, 2b(m) + 1 < 2t.

For the remainder of this section, let I = I(C2n+1 ) ⊆ R = k[x1 , x2 , . . . , x2n+1 ] and
V ⊆ V (C2n+1 ) be a minimal vertex cover of C2n+1 .

Theorem 4.4. Given I and (L(t)) as defined above, I t = (L(t)).
Proof. By Lemma 4.2 we know that I t ⊆ (L(t)) so we must only show the reverse
containment. Let m 6∈ I t , which implies that b(m) < t; then we will show that
m 6∈ (L(t)). Lemma 4.3 allows us to consider only cases where m either has multiple
ancillaries or has a single ancillary of at least degree 2.

Our goal is to show that there exists some vertex cover with a weight equal to
b(m), and as b(m) < t, m cannot be in L(t). Since L(t) is the generating set of
(L(t)), this will be sufficient to claim that m 6∈ (L(t)) because neither m, nor any

generating set.
We will construct a minimal vertex cover S of C2n+1 out of a sequence of subsets

Hence, it does not matter whether VHq has an odd or even number of vertices
because wSq (mq ) = b(mq ) regardless.
Now, since each Sq covers its respective set of vertices, the union of all of these

is, we have constructed a vertex cover S such that wS (m) = b(m) < t. Thus,


Corollary 4.5. Given I and (D(t)) as above, I (t) = I t + (D(t)).
Proof. Apply Theorem 4.4 to the equation I (t) = (L(t)) + (D(t)).



Now that we have proved that I (t) = I t + (D(t)), we will use this result to carry
out various computations related to the interplay between ordinary and symbolic
powers.
We close this section with a brief remark on the proof of Theorem 4.4. Specifically,
it relies on the fact that C2n+1 is a cycle, but not that C2n+1 is an odd cycle. However,
we focus on the odd cycle case as even cycles are bipartite, and [11] showed that if
I is the edge ideal of a bipartite graph, then I t = I (t) for all t > 1.
5. Applications to Ideal Containment Questions
Given the edge ideal I of an odd cycle C2n+1 , Corollary 4.5 describes a structural
relationship between I (t) and I t given any t > 1. In this section, we will exploit this
relationship to establish the conjecture of [14]. We then will compute the resurgence
of I = I(C2n+1 ) and explore the symbolic defect of various powers of I.
We will begin by examining D(t).
Lemma 5.1. For a given monomial xa , if there exists some i such that ai = 0, then
xa 6∈ (D(t)).
Proof. Although all graphs have many different minimal vertex covers, odd cycles
have a vertex cover that includes any two adjacent vertices and alternating vertices
thereafter.

Without loss of generality, consider xa and suppose a1 = 0. Two such minimal
vertex covers that include x1 are {x1 , x2 , x4 , x6 , . . . , x2n } and {x1 , x3 , x5 , . . . , x2n+1 }.
In order for xa to be in D(t), it must be true that wV ′ (xa ) > t. This means that
a1 + a2 + a4 + · · · + a2n > t and a1 + a3 + · · · + a2n+1 > t. Adding the inequalities
2n+1
P
yields a1 + (a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + a2n+1 ) > 2t. As a1 = 0, we have
ai > 2t, which
i=1

contradicts the requirement that deg(xa ) < 2t. Hence, any monomial xa with at

Lemma 5.2. For a given monomial xa in D(t), if deg(xa ) = 2t − k, then xa is
divisible by (x1 x2 · · · x2n+1 )k .
Proof. Let xa ∈ D(t) such that deg(xa ) = 2t − k, and suppose that xa is not divisible
by (x1 x2 · · · x2n+1 )k . This means that there exists an i0 such that ai0 < k. Moreover,
since xa ∈ (D(t)), we must have aj > 0 for all j.
If i0 is odd, consider minimal vertex covers
V1 = {x1 , x3 , . . . , xi0 , xi0 +1 , xi0 +3 , . . . , x2n }
and
V2 = {x2 , x4 , . . . , xi0 −1 , xi0 , xi0 +2 , xi0 +4 , . . . , x2n+1 } .
If i0 is even, use
V1 = {x1 , x3 , . . . , xi0 −1 , xi0 , xi0 +2 , . . . , x2n }
and
V2 = {x2 , x4 , . . . , xi0 , xi0 +1 , xi0 +3 , . . . , x2n+1 } .
In order for x to be in D(t), it must be true that wVj (xa ) > t for j = 1, 2.
When i0 is odd, this means that a1 + a3 + · · · + ai0 + ai0 +1 + · · · + a2n > t and
a2 +a4 +· · ·+ai0 −1 +ai0 +ai0 +2 +· · ·+a2n+1 > t (and similarly if i0 is
even). Combining

these, we see 2t 6 ai0 +(a1 +a2 +a3 +· · ·+a2n+1 ) = ai0 +
s=1 as = 2t−k+ai0 < 2t,
a contradiction.

The following corollary partially answers [14, Conjecture 15] in the affirmative.
Note that this is a restatement of [5, Theorem 4.13].
Corollary 5.3. Let I = I(C2n+1 ). Then I (t) = I t for 1 6 t 6 n.
Proof. If m ∈ D(t), then deg(m) < 2t. Since there are 2n + 1 > 2t variables, at
least two of them must have exponents equal to 0, contradicting Lemma 5.1. Thus,
D(t) = ∅.

A recent paper of Galetto, Geramita, Shin, and Van Tuyl [9] introduced the notion
of symbolic defect to measure the difference between the symbolic power I (t) and ordinary power I t . For a given m, the symbolic defect sdefect(I, m) is the number µ(m)
of minimal generators F1 , F2 , . . . , Fµ(m) such that I (m) = I m + (F1 , F2 , . . . , Fµ(m) ).
Corollary 5.3 thus implies that sdefect(I(C2n+1 ), t) = 0 for all t satisfying 1 6 t 6 n.
Corollary 5.4. Let I = I(C2n+1 ). Then sdefect(I, n+1) = 1. In particular, I (n+1) =
I n+1 + (x1 x2 · · · x2n+1 ).

Proof. Let m ∈ D(n + 1). Then 2n + 1 6 deg(m) < 2n + 2, and by Lemma 5.1,
each of the 2n + 1 variables must divide m. Therefore, m = x1 x2 · · · x2n+1 . Thus,
I (n+1) = I n+1 + (x1 x2 · · · x2n+1 ).

Recall that, if 0 6= I ( S = k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xr ] is a homogenous ideal, the minimal
degree of I, denoted α(I), is the least degree of a nonzero polynomial in I. In
particular, if I is an edge ideal, α(I) = 2, and α(I s ) = 2s for any s > 1. In general,
if α(I (t) ) < α(I s ), we may conclude that I (t) 6⊆ I s , but the converse need not hold.
When I = I(C2n+1 ), however, it does, as the next lemma demonstrates.
Lemma 5.5. Let I be the edge ideal of an odd cycle. Then α(I (t) ) < α(I s ) if and
only if I (t) 6⊆ I s .
Proof. The forward direction is clear. For the converse, suppose that α(I (t) ) > α(I s ),
and recall
I (t) = (m | for all minimal vertex covers V ′ , wV ′ (m) > t).
As I t ⊆ I (t) , we note that 2t = α(I t ) > α(I (t) ) > α(I s ) = 2s. Thus, if m ∈ I (t) ,
wV ′ (m) > t > s and deg(m) > α(I (t) ) > α(I s ) = 2s, and we observe
I (t) ⊆ (m | deg(m) > 2s and for all minimal vertex covers V ′ , wV ′ (m) > s)
= (L(s))
= I s,
which completes the proof.



Despite providing a condition which guarantees containments of the form I (t) ⊆ I s ,
Lemma 5.5 does not actually compute α(I (t) ), which is more delicate to compute than
computing α(I s ). We next adapt Lemma 2.2 and the linear programming approach
of [3] to compute it. In order to do so, we make the following definition.
Definition 5.6. Fix a list of minimal vertex covers V1 , V2 , . . . , Vr for C2n+1 such that
|Vi | 6 |Vi+1 |. We define the minimal vertex cover matrix A = (aij ) to be the matrix
of 0’s and 1’s defined by:
(
0 if xj ∈
/ Vi
(1)
aij =
1 if xj ∈ Vi .
Remark 5.7. Note the minimum cardinality for a minimal vertex cover of C2n+1 is
n + 1; in fact, there are 2n + 1 minimal vertex covers of size n + 1. As we have seen,
there do exist minimal vertex covers of size greater than n + 1. These covers will be
accounted for in rows 2n + 2 and higher of the minimal vertex cover matrix A.
We first seek a lower bound of α(I (t) ) using linear programming. Let
t = s(n + 1) + d, where 0 6 d 6 n.

Consider the following partition of A: let A′ be the submatrix of A consisting of
the first 2n + 1 rows (and thus corresponding to the 2n + 1 minimal vertex covers
which contain exactly n + 1 vertices) and B the matrix consisting of the remaining
rows of A. We thus create the following sub-program of (†),

Recall that Corollaries 5.3 and 5.4 imply, for I = I(C2n+1 ), that
(
0 if t 6 n
sdefect(I, t) =
1 if t = n + 1.
Next, we explore additional terms in the symbolic defect sequence. Our general
approach is to rely on the decomposition described in Corollary 4.5. In the parlance
of our work, the symbolic defect is the size of a minimal generating set for the ideal
(D(t)). When n + 2 6 t 6 2n + 1, the elements of D(t) have degree equal to 2t − 1
by Proposition 5.10, so it suffices to count them.
Lemma 5.12. Let t satisfy n+2 6 t 6 2n+1. Then if m ∈ D(t), m/(x1 x2 · · · x2n+1 )
is the product of exactly t − n − 1 edge monomials.
Proof. Let m ∈ D(t), Thus, m is divisible by the product of at most t − 1 edge
monomials. Since deg(m) = 2t − 1 and α(I (t) ) = 2t − 1 > 2(t − 1) = α(I t−1 ) by
Lemma 5.5, m ∈ I t−1 , and therefore m is divisible by exactly t − 1 edge monomials.
Thus, an optimal factorization of m is

That is, m has a single ancillary with exponent 1.

appropriate permutation of the indices and exponents can be applied to make it x1 ).

Proof. As stated above, we wish to compute the size of a minimal generating set of
(D(t)). For n + 2 6 t 6 2n + 1, this means counting the number of monomials of
degree 2t − 1 in D(t).
By Lemma 5.12, the monomial p = m/x1 x2 · · · x2n+1 is the product of exactly
(t−1)−n edge monomials. Thus, we may factor any m ∈ D(t) as m = x1 x2 · · · x2n+1 p,
where p is the product of exactly t − n − 1 edge monomials.
Conversely, suppose that m = x1 x2 · · · x2n+1 p, where p is the product of exactly
t−n−1 edge monomials. Since deg(m) = 2t−1 and, if V is any minimal vertex cover
of C2n+1 , we have wV (m) = wV (x1 x2 · · · x2n+1 ) + wV (p) > n + 1 + t − n − 1 = t, where
wV (p) > t − n − 1 follows from the fact that p ∈ I t−n−1 by definition; thus, m ∈ D(t).
Therefore, to count the monomials in D(t), it suffices to count all monomials p that
are products of t − n − 1 edge monomials.
We can visualize this problem by counting the number of ways to place these
t−n−1 ‘edges’ around the cycle, assuming that we can place multiple edges between
the same two vertices. By definition, this is

6. An additional containment question
Our proof that I (t) = I t + (D(t)) does not hold for any graph other than a cycle,
as it relies on the fact that each path between ancillaries is disjoint from every other
path. This is not true in general. This leads naturally to the following question.
Question 6.1. Let G be a graph on the vertices V = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xd } containing an
odd cycle. Suppose I = I(G) is the edge ideal of G in R = k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xd ], and let
L(t) and D(t) retain their usual definitions with respect to G. Does I (t) = I t +(D(t))
for all t > 1?
The following example answers Question 6.1 in the negative.
Example 6.2. Consider the graph G defined by V (G) = {x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , x6 , x7 }
and E(G) = {x1 x2 , x2 x3 , x3 x4 , x4 x5 , x5 x1 , x1 x6 , x6 x7 }, and let m = x21 x22 x23 x24 x25 x27 .
Observe that m ∈
/ I 6 , but as every minimal vertex cover V of G contains three of
x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , we have wV (m) > 2 · 3 = 6. Thus, I 6 6= (L(6)).
However, we observe in the following two theorems that I t = (L(t)) for certain
classes of graphs.
One case in which Question 6.1 holds is the case in which G is an odd cycle with
one additional vertex connected to exactly one vertex of the cycle.
Theorem 6.3. Let G be a graph consisting of 2n + 2 vertices and 2n + 2 edges such
that 2n+1 of them form a cycle and the remaining edge connects the remaining vertex

COMPARING POWERS OF EDGE IDEALS

15

to any existing vertex of the cycle. Further, let I be the edge ideal of G and let L(t)
and D(t) retain their usual definitions with respect to G. Then I (t) = I t + (D(t)).
Proof. Without loss of generality, consider the cycle formed by x1 , . . . , x2n+1 with
e2n+2 = x1 x2n+2 being the newly added edge.

and recall that b(m) =
bi . As with the cycle, if I = (L(t)), it will follow that
I (t) = I t + (D(t)).
By Lemma 4.2 we know that I t ⊆ (L(t)) so we must only show the reverse containment. Let m 6∈ I t (which implies that b(m) < t). Lemma 4.3 allows us to
consider only cases where m either has multiple ancillaries or has a single ancillary
of degree at least 2. We will construct a minimal vertex cover V ′ of G such that
wV ′ (m) = b(m) < t.
First, assume that x2n+2 is the only ancillary of m, and observe that a2n+2 > 2.
b2n+2 a2n+2 −1
We may write m as m = x2n+2 eb11 eb22 · · · e2n+2
x2n+2 . It cannot be true that bi > 1
for all i ∈ {1, 3, 5, . . . , 2n+ 1}, because it would then be possible to divide m by some
monomial p = x2n+2 e1 e3 · · · e2n+1 x2n+2 which must be in optimal form by Lemma 3.2;
however, in this case, p = e2n+2 e2 e4 · · · e2n e2n+2 , contradicting that p was in optimal
form. Thus, at least one b2j+1 is 0. Then construct V ′ as follows:
(1) If b1 = 0, let
V ′ = {x1 , x2 , x4 , . . . , x2n } .
Then wV ′ (m) = (b2n+1 + b2n+2 + b1 ) + (b1 + b2 ) + (b3 + b4 ) + · · ·+ (b2n−1 + b2n ) =
P2n+2
P
b1 + 2n+2
i=1 bi = b(m) < t.
i=1 bi = 0 +
(2) If b2j+1 = 0 for some j > 0, let
V ′ = {x1 , x3 , x5 , . . . , x2j+1 , x2j+2 , x2j+4 , x2j+6 , . . . , x2n } .

Then wV ′ (m) = (b2n+1 + b2n+2 + b1 ) + (b2 + b3 ) + · · · + (x2j + x2j+1 ) + (x2j+1 +

bi = 0 + 2n+2
x2j+2 ) + · · · + (b2n−1 + b2n ) = b2j+1 + i=1
i=1 bi = b(m) < t.
Now suppose that all ancillaries of m are among the set {x1 , x2 , . . . , x2n+1 }. By
adapting the argument from Theorem 4.4, we may assume that there is either
one ancillary with exponent at least 2, or that there are multiple ancillaries. Use
the construction in the proof of Theorem 4.4 to decompose the subgraph C2n+1
a2n+1 b1
b2n+1
of G as H1 , H2 , . . . , Hr . Define mC2n+1 = xa11 · · · x2n+1

a2n+2 b2n+2
m/(x2n+2 e2n+2 ). The proof of Theorem 4.4 provides minimal subcovers S1 , S2 , . . . , Sr

such that S = ∪Sq and wS (mC2n+1 ) = 2n+1

P2n+2
bi = b(m) <
If x1 ∈ S, then S covers G and wS (m) = wS (mC2n+1 ) + b2n+2 = i=1

On the other hand, if x1 ∈
/ S, let V ′ = S ∪ {x2n+2 }. Then wV ′ (m) = wS (m) +
P2n+2
b2n+2 = i=1 bi = b(m) < t.
Next, assume that the ancillaries of m are x2n+2 and at least one xj in the cycle
(where j 6= 1; if j = 1, we may write x2n+2 x1 = e2n+2 , contradicting the assumption
that m is in optimal form). Use the construction of Theorem 4.4 to decompose the
cycle into subgraphs H1 , H2 , . . . , Hr and note that x1 is a vertex in Hr . Observe
that since x1 is not ancillary, x1 ∈
/ Hi for any i 6= r. Let the vertices of Hi be

represented by xℓi , xℓi +1 , . . . , xℓi+1 , where xℓ1 , . . . , xℓr are ancillaries, and we wrap
around with xℓr+1 representing xℓ1 . For all i 6= r, the proof of Theorem 4.4 gives
a construction of a minimal vertex subcover Si with the required properties. Now
construct a subgraph Hr′ of G as follows: V (Hr′ ) = V (Hr ) ∪ {x2n+2 } and E(Hr′ ) =
EHr ∪ {{x1 , x2n+2 }}. Decompose Hr′ as two induced subgraphs Hr′ a and Hr′ b of G on
the vertices {xℓr , . . . , x1 , x2n+2 } and {x2n+2 , x1 , . . . , xℓ1 }. We observe that we may
now use the construction in the proof of Theorem 4.4 to build minimal covers of Hr′ a
and Hr′ b containing x1 (and not x2n+2 ) whose union gives a cover Sr of Hr′ . Given

In all cases, m ∈

We also verify that the answer to Question 6.1 is positive when G is a complete
graph. Thus, additional study is needed to identify the precise graph-theoretic property for which Question 6.1 has an affirmative answer.
Theorem 6.4. Let R = k[x1 , . . . , xn ] and let Kn denote the complete graph on
{x1 , . . . , xn }. Further, let I = I(Kn ) and L(t) and D(t) maintain their definitions
as above. Then I (t) = I t + (D(t))
Proof. Let ei,j denote the edge between xi and xj such that i < j. We will show
that I t = (L(t)). By Lemma 4.2, we must only show (L(t)) ⊆ I t . Let m 6∈ I t (which
implies that b(m) < t), and recall that Lemma 4.3 allows us to consider only cases

Thus m has exactly 1 ancillary and it must have a degree of at least 2.
Without loss of generality, let xa11 be the ancillary of m. Note that bi,j = 0 if
i, j 6= 1. If this was not the case, m could be expressed in a more optimal form as

Thus wv′ (m) = b(m) < t, so m 6∈ L(t) and by the same argument, no divisor of m is
in L(t), which means m 6∈ (L(t)).
Therefore, I t = (L(t)). Because I (t) = (L(t)) + (D(t)) by Corollary 4.5, this leads
to the desired result that I (t) = I t + (D(t)).
