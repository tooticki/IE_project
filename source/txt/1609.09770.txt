Shidlovsky’s multiplicity estimate and Irrationality of
zeta values
Stéphane Fischler
January 5, 2018
Abstract
In this paper we follow the approach of Bertrand-Beukers (and of later work of
Bertrand), based on differential Galois theory, to prove a very general version of
Shidlovsky’s lemma that applies to Padé approximation problems at several points,
both at functional and numerical levels (i.e., before and after evaluating at a specific
point). This allows us to obtain a new proof of the Ball-Rivoal theorem on irrationality of infinitely many values of Riemann zeta function at odd integers, inspired by the
proof of the Siegel-Shidlovsky theorem on values of E-functions: Shidlovsky’s lemma
is used to replace Nesterenko’s linear independence criterion with Siegel’s, so that no
lower bound is needed on the linear forms in zeta values. The same strategy provides
a new proof, and a refinement, of Nishimoto’s theorem on values of L-functions of
Dirichlet characters.

Introduction

The motivation of this paper comes from the Ball-Rivoal theorem: ζ(s) is irrational for
infinitely many odd integers s ≥ 3. Its proof is based on explicit Padé approximation
to polylogarithms. In order to try to generalize this result to other functions, it would
be natural to use non-explicit Padé approximation instead, for instance through Siegel’s
lemma. Several difficulties arise; the first one is the need for a lower bound on the linear
forms in zeta values, in order to apply Nesterenko’s linear independence criterion: such a
lower bound cannot be obtained from a non-explicit construction.
In this paper we overcome this difficulty by giving a new proof of the Ball-Rivoal
theorem in which no lower bound on the linear forms is used. Indeed Nesterenko’s linear
independence criterion is replaced with Siegel’s combined with a multiplicity estimate,
namely a new generalization of Shidlovsky’s lemma. We combine an explicit construction
of the linear forms with the strategy used to prove the Siegel-Shidlovsky theorem on values
of E-functions (see for instance [21, Chapter 3]).

Let q be a positive integer, and A ∈ Mq (C(z)). We fix P1 , . . . , Pq ∈ C[z] and n ∈ N =
{0, 1, 2, . . .} such that deg Pi ≤ n for any i. Then with any solution Y = t (y1, . . . , yq ) of
the differential system Y ′ = AY is associated a remainder R(Y ) defined by
R(Y )(z) =

Let Σ be a finite subset of C ∪ {∞}. For each σ ∈ Σ, let (Yj )j∈Jσ be a family of
solutions of Y ′ = AY such that the functions R(Yj ), j ∈ Jσ , are C-linearly independent
and holomorphic at σ; here σ ∈ C ∪ {∞} might be a singularity of the differential system
Y ′ = AY . We agree that Jσ = ∅ if σ 6∈ Σ, and let M(z) = [Pk,i (z)]1≤i,k≤q ∈ Mq (C(z))
where the rational functions Pk,i ∈ C(z) are defined for k ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ i ≤ q by

Obviously the poles of the coefficients Pk,i of M are among those of A.
The following multiplicity estimate appears essentially (see below) in [3, Théorème 2].
Theorem 1. There exists a positive constant c1 , which depends only on A and Σ, such
that if
XX
ordσ (R(Yj )) ≥ (n + 1)q − n#J∞ − τ
(1.2)
σ∈Σ j∈Jσ

with 0 ≤ τ ≤ n − c1 , then det M(z) is not identically zero.
The special case where Σ = {0}, #J0 = 1, and Yj is analytic at 0 is essentially
Shidlovsky’s lemma (see [22, Chapter 3, Lemma 8]). When Σ ⊂ C, #Jσ = 1 for any
σ, and all functions Yj are obtained by analytic continuation from a single one, analytic at
all σ ∈ Σ, this result was proved by Bertand-Beukers [4] with more details on the constant
c1 . Then Bertrand has allowed [3, Théorème 2] an arbitrary number of solutions at each
σ, proving Theorem 1 under the additional assumptions that ∞ 6∈ Σ and the functions Yj ,
j ∈ Jσ , are analytic at σ.
Our proof of Theorem 1 (like that of [3, Théorème 2]) follows the strategy of [4],
based on differential Galois theory. The point is that we allow Σ to contain ∞, and/or
singularities of the differential system Y ′ = AY : only the remainders R(Yj ) are assumed to
be holomorphic at σ (but not the functions Yj , and not at points σ ′ ∈ Σ distinct from σ).
These features make Theorem 1 general enough to cover essentially all Padé approximation
problems related to polylogarithms we have found in the literature, for instance the ones
of Beukers [5, 6], Sorokin [23, 24, 25], and those of [9]. In such a setting, τ in Eq. (1.2)
appears as the difference between the number of unknowns and the number of equations.

Then we evaluate at a point α, going from functional to numerical linear forms (see
[22, Chapter 3, Lemma 10] for the classical setting). The point here is that we allow α to
be a singularity of the differential system Y ′ = AY , and/or an element of Σ (in our proof
of the Ball-Rivoal theorem, α is both).
Theorem 2. There exists a positive constant c2 , which depends only on A and Σ, with the
following property. Assume that, for some α ∈ C:
(i) The differential system Y ′ = AY has a basis of local solutions at α in C[log(z − α)][[z − α]].
(ii) All rational functions Pk,i , with 1 ≤ i ≤ q and 1 ≤ k ≤ τ + c2 , are holomorphic at
z = α.
(iii) Eq. (1.2) holds for some τ with 0 ≤ τ ≤ n − c1 .
Then the matrix [Pk,i (α)]1≤i≤q,1≤k≤c2 ∈ Mq,c2 (C) has rank at least q − #Jα .
If α is a singularity, assertion (i) means it is regular and all exponents at α are integers.
As far as we know, this result is the first general one in which α is allowed to be a singularity.
The case where α is not a singularity is much easier, and assumptions (i) and (ii) are then
trivially satisfied.
If α 6∈ Σ then Jα = ∅ so that we obtain a matrix of maximal rank q. On the opposite,
if α ∈ Σ then #Jα linearly independent linear combinations of the rows of the matrix
[Pk,i (z)]i,k are holomorphic at α and (probably) vanish at α: the lower bound q − #Jα is
best possible.
Using a zero estimate such as Theorem 2 is the key point in the classical proof of
the Siegel-Shidlovsky theorem on values of E-functions. Following a different but similar
strategy, Nikishin constructed explicitly [16] linearly independent linear forms in 1, Li1 (α),
. . . , Lia (α) to prove that these numbers are linearly independent over Q when α = u/v
is a rational number with v sufficiently large in terms of |u|. His approach was used by
several authors, including Marcovecchio [12] to bound from below the dimension of the
Q-vector space spanned by these numbers, for any fixed algebraic number α with |α| < 1
(thereby generalizing to non-real numbers α Rivoal’s result [19] based on Nesterenko’s linear
independence criterion). The zero estimate used by Marcovecchio is similar to Theorem 2
but deals only with a specific situation in which (essentially) τ = 1 in Eq. (1.2), α 6∈ Σ,
and α is not a singularity. Moreover he does not define Pk,i for k ≥ 2 using Eq. (1.1) (i.e.,
differentiating the linear forms as in the proof of the Siegel-Shidlovsky theorem): following
Nikishin he uses an additional parameter instead.
In this paper we use Theorem 2 to obtain a new proof,
a refinement, of the following
P∞andχ(n)
result of Nishimoto [17] on L-functions L(χ, s) =
n=1 ns associated with Dirichlet
characters χ. He proved it with d instead of N in the lower bound (1.3); see §4.1 for this
easy improvement.

3

Theorem 3. Let χ be a Dirichlet character modulo d, of conductor N. Let p ∈ {0, 1} and
a ≥ 2. Denote by δχ,p,a the dimension of the Q-vector space spanned by 1 and the numbers
L(χ, s) with 2 ≤ s ≤ a and s ≡ p mod 2. Then
δχ,p,a ≥

1 + o(1)
log a
N + log 2

(1.3)

where o(1) is a sequence that depends on N and a, and tends to 0 as a → ∞ (for any N).
If p and χ have the same parity then L(χ, s)π −s is a non-zero algebraic number for
any s ≥ 2 such that s ≡ p mod 2 (see for instance [15, Chapter VII, §2]): this result is
interesting when p and χ have opposite parities.
Nishimoto’s proof is similar to Ball-Rivoal’s, except that obtaining the lower bound
necessary to apply Nesterenko’s criterion is very technical: the saddle point method has to
be used because cancellations take place (see [14]). In this paper we present an alternative
proof of Theorem 3, based on the zero estimate stated above. It makes it unnecessary to
use the saddle point method, since Siegel’s criterion is applied instead of Nesterenko’s. In
the special case d = N = 1 (so that χ(n) = 1 for any n, and L(χ, s) = ζ(s)) this is exactly
the proof of the Ball-Rivoal theorem mentioned above.
We also obtain the following refinement of Theorem 3, by improving the arithmetic
estimates.
Theorem 4. In the setting of Theorem 3, if N is a multiple of 4 then Eq. (1.3) can be
replaced with
1 + o(1)
δχ,p,a ≥
log a.
(N/2) + log 2
When χ is the non-principal character mod d = 4, so that N = 4, this result was proved
by Rivoal-Zudilin [20] as a first step towards the (conjectural) irrationality of Catalan’s
P
(−1)k
constant L(χ, 2) = ∞
k=0 (2k+1)2 .

The structure of this paper is as follows. We first sketch in §2 our proof of the BallRivoal theorem. Then §3 is devoted to Shidlovsky’s lemma: we prove Theorems 1 and 2.
At last, in §4 we prove in details a general result which contains Theorem 3, Theorem 4,
and the Ball-Rivoal theorem.

A new proof of the Ball-Rivoal theorem

We sketch in this section the new proof of the Ball-Rivoal theorem obtained as a special
case of the proof of Theorem 6 in §4 below (namely N = 1, f (n) = 1 for any n, p = 1,
z0 = 1, i0 = 2, ξ1 = 0, and ξj = ζ(j) for any j ≥ 2). Of course we refer to §4 for more
details.

Let a, r, r ′, n be such that a is odd and r, r ′ < a/2. It turns out that the best estimates
come from the case where r and r ′ have essentially the same size, so we shall restrict in
§4 to the case r ′ = r; however the proof works in the same way if r ′ 6= r. Consider the
rational function
′ (t − rn)rn (t + n + 1)r ′ n
F (t) = n!a−r−r
(t)an+1
where (α)k = α(α + 1) . . . (α + k − 1) is Pochhammer’s symbol, and let

where S (k−1) is the (k − 1)-th derivative of S. We shall use a symmetry phenomenon
to get rid of even zeta values, but it does not appear exactly as in the original proof of

(k−1)
Ball-Rivoal. Indeed, even if r ′ = r, S0
(1) and S∞ (1) involve both odd and even zeta
values when k ≥ 2: they are values at z = 1 of hypergeometric series which are no more
well-poised. The cancellation of even zeta values comes at a different stage, by considering
Λk in Eq. (2.1). Indeed there exist integers sk,i , 2 ≤ i ≤ a, and uk , vk such that for any
k ≤ (a − r − r ′ )n + a − 1, we have both

with sk,a+1 = uk − vk . Using Theorem 2 we prove that the matrix [sk,i ]2≤i≤a+1,1≤k≤c2 has
maximal rank, equal to a (see below). This enables one to apply Siegel’s linear independence criterion (see §4.6) instead of Nesterenko’s: no lower bound on |Λk | is needed. The
upper bounds on |sk,j | and |Λk | are essentially the same as in the proof of Ball-Rivoal, so
that we obtain the same lower bound:

Let us focus now on the functional aspects of this proof, which play an important role
(whereas the proof of Ball-Rivoal can be written with z = 1 throughout). For simplicity
we restrict ourselves to the case r ′ = r. The functions S0 (z) and S∞ (z) are solutions of the
following Padé approximation problem: find polynomials P1 , . . . , Pa+2 of degree at most
n such that:

This is exactly the Padé approximation problem of [9, Théorème 1]: it has a unique
solution up to proportionality, (n + 1)(a + 2) unknowns and (n + 1)(a + 2) − 1 equations.
Let A ∈ Ma+2 (C(z)) denote the following matrix:

Let Σ = {0, 1, ∞} and J0 = {0}, J1 = {1}, J∞ = {∞}. Then with the notation of the
introduction, we have R(Y0 ) = S0 (z), R(Y∞ ) = S∞ (z), and R(Y1 ) is the left hand side
of the third equation of (2.2); Eq. (1.2) stated in the introduction holds with τ = 1
as a consequence of the Padé approximation problem (2.2). In general, τ corresponds in
Eq. (1.2) to the difference between the number of unknowns and the number of equations.
To apply Theorem 2 it is not useful to prove that the problem has a unique solution up
to proportionality: the upper bound τ ≤ n/2, for instance, would be sufficient since n is
taken arbitrarily large.
Defining Pk,i as in the introduction by Eq. (1.1), it is well-known (see [22, Chapter 3,
§4]) that for any k ≥ 1,

Moreover Pk,i is a rational function of which 0 is the only possible pole if i ≤ a. If i = a + 1
or i = a + 2, both 0 and 1 may be poles of Pk,i ; but if k ≤ (a − 2r)n + a − 1, the functions
(k−1)
(k−1)
S0
(z) and S∞ (z) have finite limits as z → 1 so that 1 is not a pole.
Finally Theorem 2 applies at α = 1: the matrix [Pk,i (1)]1≤i≤a+2,1≤k≤c2 has rank at
least a + 1. Actually Pk,1(1) = 0 for any k ≤ (a − 2r)n + a − 1 (which can be seen by
letting z tend to 1 in Eq. (2.3)) so that the first row of this matrix is zero (provided n is
large enough) and its rank is exactly a + 1. Since the coefficients sk,i defined above are
given by sk,i = dan Pk,i (1) for 2 ≤ i ≤ a and sk,a+1 = dan (Pk,a+1 (1) − Pk,a+2 (1)), the matrix
[sk,i ]2≤i≤a+1,1≤k≤c2 has rank a: Siegel’s criterion (stated and proved in §4.6) applies.

Zero estimates

In this section we prove Theorems 1 and 2. We start with the functional part of the proof
(§3.1), in which we follow the approach of Bertrand-Beukers [4] to generalize Shidlovsky’s
lemma (see Theorem 5). Then we deduce in §3.2 Theorems 1 and 2 stated in the introduction: the important point is to evaluate at α which may be a singularity and/or an
element of Σ.

3.1

Functional zero estimate

Throughout this section we consider a positive integer q and a matrix A ∈ Mq (C(X)). We
let P1 , . . . , Pq ∈ C[X] with deg Pi ≤ n for any i. We also denote by Ω a simply connected
open subset of C in which A has no pole. We assume that Ω is obtained from C by
removing finitely many half-lines, so that Ω is dense in C, and denote by H the space of
functions holomorphic on Ω. A solution Y of the differential system Y ′ = AY will always
be a column matrix in Mq,1 (H), identified with the corresponding element (y1 , . . . , yq ) of
Hq . Since P1 , . . . , Pq are fixed, to such a solution is associated a remainder R(Y ) defined
on Ω by
q
X
Pi (z)yi (z).
R(Y )(z) =
i=1

Let Σ be a finite subset of P (C) = C ∪ {∞}. For each σ ∈ Σ, let (Yj )j∈Jσ be a family
of solutions of Y ′ = AY such that:
• For any j ∈ Jσ , the function R(Yj ) is holomorphic at σ.
• The functions R(Yj ), for j ∈ Jσ , are linearly independent over C.
Here we do not assume that σ ∈ Ω: in the case σ 6∈ Ω (for instance if σ = ∞), by
R(Yj ) is holomorphic at σ we mean that R(Yj ) can be continued analytically to a function
holomorphic at σ. Moreover, we denote by ordσ (R(Yj )) its order of vanishing at z = σ.
The point is that we do not assume any relation (or lack of relation) between the
families (Yj )j∈Jσ at distinct points σ, except of course that all are solutions of the same
differential system.
7

At last, we let Jσ = ∅ when σ 6∈ Σ.
Defining M(z) and Pk,i as in the introduction, our functional multiplicity estimate is
the following generalization of Bertrand-Beukers’ version of Shidlovsky’s lemma; if ∞ 6∈ Σ
and the functions Yj , j ∈ Jσ , are analytic at σ it is due to Bertrand [3, Théorème 2]. The
constant c1 is the same as in Theorem 1 (that we shall deduce from Theorem 5 at the
beginning of §3.2).

where c1 is a constant that depends only on A and Σ.
In the special case where Σ ⊂ C, Jσ consists of a single element jσ , and the function
Yjσ is the same for all σ, this is exactly [4, Théorème 2] except that we did not try to make
the constant c1 explicit (we refer to [4], and to [1, Appendix of Chapter III] in the Fuchsian
case, for discussions on effectivity which are not relevant to our purposes). Indeed we have
fixed a simply connected open subset Ω only for convenience: analytic continuation from
a point of Σ to another could be performed along any fixed path.
Let us prove Theorem 5 now, following the strategy of [4].
Given σ ∈ P1 (C), we let Aσ denote the set of all finite sums
J
XXX

uα,Q,j (z − σ)(z − σ)α (log(z − σ))j exp(Q((z − σ)−1/q! ))

(3.2)

α∈E Q∈P j=0

where E ⊂ C and P ⊂ C[X] are finite subsets, J ≥ 0, and uα,Q,j (z − σ) ∈ C[[(z −
σ)1/q! ]] for any α, Q, j. Here and below, we agree that z − σ stands for 1/z si σ = ∞.
Then the differential system Y ′ = AY has a complete system of formal solutions in Aqσ .
Moreover we let Kσ denote the fraction field of Aσ , and Fσ denote the differential subfield
of Kσ generated over C(z) by all components of all solutions of Y ′ = AY in Kσq . Then
the differential extension Fσ /C(z) is Picard-Vessiot, and we denote by Gσ its group of
differential automorphisms.
To prove Theorem 5 we may assume that 0 ∈ Σ, that µ is the minimal order of a
non-zero differential operator that annihilates R(Yj ) for any j ∈ Jσ and any σ ∈ Σ, and
d µ
that the coefficient of ( dz
) in L is 1.
Given σ ∈ Σ and j ∈ Jσ , all components of Yj are holomorphic on the cut plane Ω, and
can be seen as elements of A0 . Indeed, if 0 is a regular singularity (or an ordinary point)
of the system Y ′ = AY then all components of Yj have a generalized Taylor expansion at
the origin in A0 (of the form (3.2) with P = {0}). In the general case, we identify each
8

component of Yj with its asymptotic expansion at 0 in a fixed large sector (see [18]). By
definition of F0 , all components of Yj (seen in A0 ) belong to F0 so that R(Yj ) ∈ F0 . We
consider the C-vector space V ⊂ F0 spanned by the images γ(R(Yj )) of all R(Yj ), j ∈ Jσ ,
σ ∈ Σ, under all γ ∈ G0 . Since the kernel of L : F0 → F0 is stable under G0 , we have
V ⊂ ker L so that m ≤ µ, where m = dimC V . Let (R1 , . . . , Rm ) be a basis of V , such that
Ri = γi (R(Yji )) with γi ∈ G0 and ji ∈ Jσi for any i ∈ {1, . . . , m}.
Arguing as in the proof of [4, Proposition 3], we have

Now we claim that for any σ ∈ P1 (C) there exist µ solutions Y [σ,j] = (y1 , . . . , yq ) of
Y ′ = AY in Fσq , with 1 ≤ j ≤ µ, such that R(Y [σ,1] ), . . . , R(Y [σ,µ] ) span the C-vector space
of solutions of Ly = 0 in Fσ . Indeed, as in [4, Corollaire], using a differential isomorphism
F0 → Fσ we may assume σ = 0. Then for any i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, γi (Yji ) ∈ F0q is a solution of
Y ′ = AY and π0 (γi (Yji )) = R(γi (Yji )) = γi (R(Yji )) = Ri so that the claim is proved since
(R1 , . . . , Rm ) is a basis of V = ker L.
Let us recall the following terminology from [4]: an element of Aσ has rank ≤ κ ∈ q!1 N
and generalized order ≥ r if it is of the form (3.2) with deg Q ≤ q!κ for any Q ∈ P and
Re α ≥ r for any α ∈ E. The differential operator L has rank ≤ κ at σ and (r1 , . . . , rµ ) ∈ Rµ
is an admissible system of exponents of L at σ if the differential equation Ly = 0 has
a complete system of solutions (y1 , . . . , yµ ) in Aµσ such that each yi has rank ≤ κ and
generalized order ≥ ri .
[σ,j]
Given σ ∈ P1 (C) all functions yi
with 1 ≤ i ≤ q and 1 ≤ j ≤ µ have rank ≤ κσ
and generalized order ≥ rσ for some κσ ∈ q!1 N and rσ ∈ R which depend only on A and
P
[σ,j]
σ (see [4, Proposition 1]). If σ 6= ∞, R(Y [σ,j] ) = qi=1 Pi (z)yi (z) has rank ≤ κσ and
generalized order ≥ rσ ; these functions make up a complete system of solutions of L (using
the claim above). Moreover, if σ ∈ Σ \ {∞} then for any j ∈ Jσ the function R(Yj ) is
holomorphic at σ, so it can be seen as an element of Aσ with rank ≤ 0 and generalized
order ≥ ordσ (R(Yj )). Combining these C-linearly independent solutions of Ly = 0 with
suitable functions R(Y [σ,j] ), we obtain that L has rank ≤ κσ at σ and an admissible system
of exponents of L at σ consists in rσ repeated µ − #Jσ times, and ordσ (R(Yj )) for each
j ∈ Jσ . In the same way, at infinity, for any j ∈ J∞ the function R(Yj ) ∈ A∞ has rank ≤ 0
and generalized order ≥ ord∞ (R(Yj )). To obtain a complete system of solutions of Ly = 0
in A∞ we use also µ − #J∞ functions R(Y [∞,j]), which have rank ≤ κσ and generalized
order ≥ r∞ − n since deg Pi (z) ≤ n for any i ∈ {1, . . . , q}. Therefore L has rank ≤ κ∞ at
9

∞ and an admissible system of exponents of L at ∞ consists in r∞ − n repeated µ − #J∞
times, and ord∞ (R(Yj )) for each j ∈ J∞ .
So far we have found an upper bound on the rank of L, and an admissible system of
exponents of L, at any σ ∈ Σ. Enlarging Σ if necessary, we may assume that it contains
∞ and all poles of A. Then for any σ ∈ P1 (C) \ Σ the differential system Y ′ = AY has
a complete system of solutions holomorphic at σ, and therefore the same property holds
for the differential equation Ly = 0 using the claim above. Accordingly Σ contains ∞ and
all non-apparent singularities of L, so that the Corollary of [4, Théorème 3] provides an
inequality involving upper bounds on the ranks of L and admissible systems of exponents
of L at all points of Σ, namely:

Numerical zero estimate

In this section we prove Theorems 1 and 2 stated in the introduction. The proof falls into
3 steps; the first one is Theorem 1.
Step 1: M(z) ∈ Mq (C(z)) is an invertible matrix.
As in [22], if M is singular in Mq (C(z)) then there is a non-trivial linear relation with
coefficients in C(z) between the rk(M) + 1 first columns of M; this provides a differential
operator L of order µ = rk(M) to which Theorem 5 applies, in contradiction with Eq. (1.2)
since τ ≤ n − c1 . Indeed, for any solution Y of the differential system Y ′ = AY we have


t
Y M = R(Y ) R(Y )′ . . . R(Y )(q−1) .
Step 2: Determination of det M(z) up to factors of bounded degree.
Let S denote the set of finite singularities of the differential system Y ′ = AY , i.e. poles
of coefficients of A. For any s ∈ S, let Ns denote the maximal order of s as a pole of a
coefficient of A; let Ns = 0 for s ∈ C \ S. Then Eq. (1.1) shows that (z − s)(k−1)NsQ
Pk,i (z) is
holomorphic at z = s for any k ≥ 1 and any i ∈ {1, . . . , q}. Therefore det M(z) · s∈S (z −
s)q(q−1)Ns has no pole: is it a polynomial.
10

Now let σ ∈ Σ, and denote by Tσ ∈ M#Jσ ,q (H) the matrix with rows t Yj , j ∈ Jσ .
The vector-valued functions Yj , j ∈ Jσ , are linearly independent over C because the functions R(Yj ) are; therefore they are the #Jσ first elements of a basis of solutions B of the
differential system Y ′ = AY . The wronskian determinant of B may vanish at σ if σ is a
singularity, but even in this case it cannot have generalized order ≥ c0 (σ) at σ (with the
terminology of §3.1) where c0 (σ) is a constant depending only on A and σ (not on B). On
the other hand, all components of all elements of B have generalized order ≥ rσ at σ (as in
§3.1). Therefore there exists a subset Iσ of {1, . . . , q}, with #Iσ = q − #Jσ , such that the
determinant of the submatrix of Tσ corresponding to the columns indexed by {1, . . . , q}\Iσ
cannot have generalized order ≥ c(σ) at σ, where c(σ) = c0 (σ) − rσ #Iσ depends only on
A and σ.
Let Pσ ∈ Mq (H) denote the matrix of which the #Jσ first rows are that of Tσ , and the
other rows are the t ei , i ∈ Iσ , where (e1 , . . . , eq ) is the canonical basis of Mq,1 (C). Then

Pσ M has its first
with j ∈ Jσ , and its last
 rows equal to R(Yj ) R(Yj ) . . . R(Yj )
rows equal to P1,i . . . Pq,i with i ∈ Iσ . Therefore all coefficients in the row corresponding
to j ∈ Jσ vanish at σ with order at least ordσ R(Yj ) − q + 1, and (if σ 6= ∞) all coefficients
in the row corresponding to i ∈ Iσ are either holomorphic at σ, or have a pole of order at
most (q − 1)Nσ is σ ∈ S. Since Nσ = 0 if σ 6∈ S, we have for any σ ∈ Σ \ {∞}:

so that

as above if ∞ ∈ Σ, and let P∞ denote the identity matrix (and J∞ = ∅) otherwise. Then
we have R(Yj )(k−1) = O(z −ord∞ R(Yj ) ) as |z| → ∞ for any j ∈ J∞ and any k ≥ 1, and
Pk,i (z) = O(z n+(q−1)d ) for any i ∈ I∞ and any k ∈ {1, . . . , q} (where d is greater than
or equal to the degree of all coefficients of A). Therefore we have det M(z) = O(z u ) as

Step 3: Evaluation at α.
Let qα = #Jα and qα′ = q − qα , where Jα = ∅ if α 6∈ Σ; for simplicity we assume that
Jα = {1, . . . , qα }. Since the solutions Y1 , . . . , Yqα of the differential system Y ′ = AY are
linearly independent over C, there exist solutions Yqα+1 , . . . , Yq such that (Y1 , . . . , Yq ) is
a local basis of solutions at α. Let Y ∈ Mq (Lα ) be the matrix with columns Y1 , . . . , Yq ,
where Lα = C[log(z − α)][[z − α]]. Then t YM is the matrix [R(Yi )(k−1) ]1≤i,k≤q .
For any subset E of {1, . . . , q} of cardinality qα′ = q − qα , we denote by ∆E the determinant of the submatrix of [R(Yi )(k−1) ] obtained by considering only the rows with index
e E the one obtained by removing
i ≥ qα + 1 and the columns with index k ∈ E, and by ∆
these rows and columns. Then Laplace expansion by complementary minors yields
X
e E (z)
εE ∆E (z)∆
(3.3)
det Y(z) · det M(z) =
E⊂{1,...,q}
′
#E=qα

with εE ∈ {−1, 1}. Now det Y is the wronskian of Y1 , . . . , Yq : it is a solution of the first
order differential equation
w ′(z) = w(z)trace(A(z)).
(3.4)
Moreover it is non-zero, and belongs to Lα . Therefore we have det Y(z) ∼ γ1 (z − α)̟1 as
z → α, for some γ1 ∈ C∗ and ̟1 ∈ N. On the other hand we have det M(z) ∼ γ2 (z − α)̟2
with γ2 ∈ C∗ and ̟2 ∈ N using Step 1 and the assumption that all entries of M(z) are
holomorphic at α. Now for f ∈ Lα \{0} let ordα f denote its generalized order at α, namely
the maximal integer N such that f ∈ (z − α)N Lα . Then Eq. (3.3) shows that, for some
subset E,
e E (z) and ∆E (z) ∼ γ3 (z − α)̟3 with γ3 ∈ C∗ . (3.5)
̟3 := ordα ∆E (z) ≤ ̟1 + ̟2 − ordα ∆
P
Now letting ωα = j∈Jα ordα R(Yj ) if α ∈ Σ and ωα = 0 otherwise, Step 2 shows that
̟2 ≤ ωα + τ + c1 . Moreover the order of vanishing at α of any non-zero solution of Eq.
(3.4), and in particular ̟1 , can be bounded from above in terms of A only. At last, for
any i ∈ Jα = {1, . . . , qα } and any k ∈ {1, . . . , q} the function R(Yi )(k−1) vanishes at α with
e E (z) ≥ ωα − qα (q − 1). Therefore Eq. (3.5)
order at least ordα R(Yi ) − (q − 1) so that ordα ∆
yields ̟3 ≤ τ + c3 for some constant c3 depending only on A and Σ.
(̟ )
Now let us consider the ̟3 -th derivative ∆E 3 (z): it has a finite non-zero limit (equal
to γ3 ̟3 !) as z → α. Moreover this derivative is a Z-linear combination of determinants of
matrices of the form
Nk1 ,...,kq′ = [R(Yqα+i )(kj −1) ]1≤i,j≤qα′
α

12

with 1 ≤ k1 < . . . < kqα′ ≤ q + ̟3 ≤ τ + c2 ; this constant c2 (which depends only on A
and Σ) is the one in the statement of assertion (ii) of Theorem 2. Now Pk,i is assumed
to be holomorphic at α for any i and any k ≤ τ + c2 , so that R(Yi )(k−1) ∈ Lα since
(̟ )
Yi ∈ Mq,1 (Lα ). Therefore det Nk1 ,...,kq′ ∈ Lα ; since ∆A 3 (z) has a finite non-zero limit

as z → α, there exists at least one term det Nk1 ,...,kq′ in the above-mentioned Z-linear

Diophantine part of the proof

In this section we prove Theorem 4 stated in the introduction, and give in details new proofs
of the Ball-Rivoal theorem and Nishimoto’s Theorem 3. To provide a unified treatment,
we state a general result (namely Theorem 6) and deduce these results from it in §4.1. In
order to help the reader, we first sketch the proof of Theorem 6 in §4.2, then construct
the linear forms (§4.3), apply the zero estimate (namely Theorem 2) to obtain in invertible
matrx (§4.4), and study the arithmetic and asymptotic properties (§4.5). At last we state
and prove Siegel’s linear independence criterion in §4.6.

Statement of the main theorem and consequences

Theorem 6. Let N ≥ 1, and f : N → C be such that f (n + N) = f (n) for any n. Let
p ∈ {0, 1}, a ≥ 2, and z0 ∈ {1, eiπ/N }; put
ξj =

1 + o(1)
log a.
N + log 2

We refer to §2 for the special case of the Ball-Rivoal theorem.
Let us deduce Theorems 3 and 4 stated in the introduction from this result. Let χ be
a Dirichlet character mod d. Its conductor is the smallest divisor e of d for which there
exists a character χ′ mod e such that χ(n) = χ′ (n) for any n coprime to d. Comparing the
L-functions of χ and χ′ (see for instance [11, §§3.2 and 3.3]) yields
Y
L(χ, s) = L(χ′ , s) (1 − χ′ (p)p−s )
p|d
p6|e

so that δχ,p,a = δχ′ ,p,a for any p, a (with the notation of Theorem 3). Therefore we may
assume that e = d, i.e. χ is primitive. Then Theorem 3 follows from Theorem 6 by letting
z0 = 1 and f = χ.
To prove Theorem 4, we first prove that for any primitive Dirichlet character χ modulo
a multiple e of 4,
e
χ(n + ) = −χ(n) for any n ∈ Z.
(4.1)
2
Indeed we have n( 2e + 1) ≡ n + 2e mod e if n is odd, so that χ(n + 2e ) = χ(n)χ( 2e + 1)
for any n ∈ Z (since both sides vanish if n is even). Moreover (χ( 2e + 1))2 = 1 since
( 2e + 1)2 ≡ 1 mod e, and χ( 2e + 1) 6= 1 because χ is primitive (so that χ(n + 2e ) 6= χ(n) for
some n). Therefore χ( 2e + 1) = −1: this concludes the proof of (4.1).
Now let N = e/2 and define f : N → C by f (r) = χ(r)z0−r for any r ∈ {1, . . . , N},
where z0 = eiπ/N . Then Eq. (4.1) yields

as follows:

and N divides n. We define ξ1′ ,

for j ∈ {1, . . . , a} such that j ≡ p mod 2
for j ∈ {1, . . . , a} such that j ≡
6 p mod 2
for any λ ∈ {0, . . . , N − 1}.

(4.2)

We also let

δn = (Ndn )a N an/N ,
and define i0 to be equal to 1 if z0 = eiπ/N , and equal to 2 otherwise (i.e., if z0 = 1).
In §4.3 (see (4.16)) we shall construct integers sk,i , i0 ≤ i ≤ a + N, such that as
n → +∞:

 a+N

(4.3)
sk,i ξi′ ≤ αn(1+o(1))

i=i0

where

α = ea 4a/N −r (N + 1)2r+2 r −a/N +4r+2 and β = (2eN )a/N (rN + 1)2r+2 .
Then Lemma 1 (that will be stated and proved in §4.4 using Theorem 2) provides a positive
constant c2 (which depends only on a and N) and integers 1 ≤ ki0 < ki0 +1 < . . . < ka+N ≤
c2 (which depend on a, N, r, and n) such that the matrix [skj ,i ]i0 ≤i,j≤a+N is invertible.
Since kj ≤ c2 for any j, the symbols o(1) in (4.3) with k = kj can be made uniform with
respect to k. Therefore Siegel’s linear independence criterion applies (see §4.6). Taking
a
a very large, N fixed, and r equal to the integer part of (log(a))
2 concludes the proof of

Moreover Eqns. (4.6), (4.7) and (4.8) show that the rational functions Pk,j with 1 ≤

Let us assume that k − 1 ≤ d0 − 2, where d0 = − deg F is defined by Eq. (4.4); then these
formulas hold also when |z| = 1 and we may let z tend to 1 in Eqns. (4.9) and (4.10).
Since Pk,j is holomorphic at z = 1 for any k ≥ 1 and any j, a possible divergence may
come only from poles of Uk or Vk at z = 1, or from the logarithmic term involving Li1 (z) or
(k−1)
Li1 (1/z). Since a pole and a logarithmic term cannot cancel each other out, and S0
(z)
(k−1)
and S∞ (z) have finite limits as z → 1, we obtain:
For any k ≤ d0 − 1,

Pk,1(1) = 0 and Uk , Vk do not have a pole at z = 1.

(4.11)

Now let k ≤ d0 − 1, and z ∈ C be such that |z| = 1. Then Eqns. (4.9) and (4.10)
hold, upon agreeing that the sums start at j = 2 if z = 1; the same remark applies in what
follows. Since Pj (z) ∈ Q[z N ] for any j ∈ {1, . . . , a}, Eq. (4.6) yields Pk,j ∈ z 1−k Q[z N ] (see
the proof of Proposition 1 in §4.5 for details). On the other hand, since Uk , Vk ∈ Q[z, z −1 ]

Application of the zero estimate

In this section we deduce from Theorem 2 the following lemma, used at the end of §4.2.
It provides an invertible matrix which enables us to apply Siegel’s linear independance
criterion (see §4.6).
Lemma 1. In the setting of §4.2, let i0 = 1 if z0 = eiπ/N and i0 = 2 if z0 = 1; let sk,i be
defined by Eq. (4.16). Then there exist a positive constant c2 (which depends only on a
and N) and integers 1 ≤ ki0 < ki0 +1 < . . . < ka+N ≤ c2 (which depend on a, N, r, and n)
such that the matrix [skj ,i ]i0 ≤i,j≤a+N is invertible.
To begin with, let us recall from §4.2 that ω = e2iπ/N , a, r, N, n are positive integers
a
, n is a multiple of N, and
such that 1 ≤ r < 2N
F (t) = (n/N)!a−2rN

Since Pj ∈ C[z N ] for any j ∈ {1, . . . , a}, we have Pj (ω ℓ z) = Pj (z) for any ℓ ∈ Z. Therefore
letting
R0,ℓ (z) = S0 (ω ℓ z),

R∞,ℓ (z) = S∞ (ω ℓ z),

P 0,ℓ (z) = U(ω ℓ z),

P ∞,ℓ (z) = V (ω ℓ z)
(4.17)

for any ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , N}, we have
R0,ℓ (z) = P 0,ℓ (z) +

(4.20)

Combining Eqns. (4.18), (4.19), and (4.20) with 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ N, we have solved a simultaneous
Padé approximation problem. The (n + 1)(a + 2N) unknowns are the coefficients of P1 ,
. . . , Pa , P 0,1 , . . . , P 0,N , P ∞,1 , . . . , P ∞,N , which are polynomials of degree less than or
equal to n. There are
2N((r + 1)n + 1) + N(d0 − 1) = n(a + 2N) + (a + 1)N
linear equations, since a priori we have R∞,ℓ (z) = O(z n ) as z → ∞. The difference between
the number of unknowns and the number of equations is equal to N − a(N − 1). If N = 1
this is equal to 1: the Padé approximation problem is exactly (2.2), i.e. the one of [9,
Théorème 1], which has a unique solution up to proportionality. Whenever N ≥ 2 we have
N − a(N − 1) < 0: the problem we have solved has more equations than unknowns. This
is due to the fact that we always assume n to be an integer multiple of N. Anyway to
complete the proof, it is sufficient to bound from above the difference between the number
of unknowns and the number of equations by a constant independent from n; we do not
need to study whether the Padé approximation problem has a unique solution or not.
Let q = a + 2N, and A ∈ Mq (C(z)) be the matrix of which the coefficients Ai,j are
given by:


where the coefficient 1 in Y0,ℓ (z) (resp. Y∞,ℓ (z)) is in position a + ℓ (resp. a + N + ℓ).
We let J0 = {(0, 1), (0, 2), . . . , (0, N)}, J∞ = {(∞, 1), (∞, 2), . . . , (∞, N)}, Jωℓ = {ω ℓ }
for 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ N, and Σ = {0, ∞} ∪ {ω ℓ, 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ N}. We also let Pa+ℓ (z) = P 0,ℓ (z) = U(ω ℓ z)
and Pa+N +ℓ = P ∞,ℓ (z) = V (ω ℓ z) for any ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , N}. Then with the notation of the
introduction we have R(Y0,ℓ ) = R0,ℓ (z), R(Y∞,ℓ ) = R∞,ℓ (z), and R(Yωℓ ) = Rωℓ (z) for any
ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , N}.
Since Pa is not the zero polynomial, we have Rωℓ (z) 6= 0 for any ℓ; the C-linear independence of R0,1 (z), . . . , R0,N (z) (resp. of R∞,1 (z), . . . , R∞,N (z)) follows directly (resp.
up to changing z to 1/z) from the following lemma, which is not difficult to prove using
monodromy (see [26]).

20

Lemma 2. The functions 1 and Lij (ω ℓ z), for j ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ N, are linearly independent over C(z).
Eqns. (4.18), (4.19), and (4.20) yield ord0 (R0,ℓ (z)) ≥ (r + 1)n + 1, ord∞ (R∞,ℓ (z)) ≥
rn + 1, and ordωℓ (Rωℓ (z)) ≥ d0 − 1 for any ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , N}, so that
XX
ordσ Rj (z) ≥ (2r + 1)Nn + N(d0 + 1) = (n + 1)q − nN − τ with τ = N − a(N − 1);
σ∈Σ j∈Jσ

here q = a + 2N, and we recall that d0 = − deg F = a( Nn + 1) − 2rn. This number τ
is exactly the difference between the number of unknowns and the number of equations
computed after Eq. (4.20).
Now for any k ≥ 1 and any ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , N} we let
P k,0,ℓ = ω ℓ(k−1) Uk (ω ℓ z) and P k,∞,ℓ = ω ℓ(k−1) Vk (ω ℓ z),

Provided n is large enough, we have checked all assumptions of Theorem 2 (using,
among others, Eq. (4.11)). We apply this result with α = z0 ; recall that z0 ∈ {1, eiπ/N }.
In the case z0 = 1, we obtain positive integers k2 < . . . < kq ≤ c2 such that the matrix
21

with columns Pk2 (1), . . . , Pkq (1) has rank q − 1. Now Pk,1(1) = 0 for any k ≤ c2 (using
Eq. (4.11) since n is large enough) so that the first row of this matrix is identically zero.
Removing this row yields the following invertible matrix (with z0 = 1 and i0 = 2):


If z0 = eiπ/N 6∈ Σ then Theorem 2 provides directly k1 < . . . < kq ≤ c2 such that the matrix
(4.22) with i0 = 1 is invertible.
Now Eq. (4.12) with z = ω ℓ z0 yields, since Uk,λ ∈ Q[z N , z −N ]:

δn z0k−1 Pk,i (z0 ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ a,
= δn (Uk,λ (z0 ) + (−1)p Vk,N −λ(z0 )) for 0 ≤ λ ≤ N − 1.

exactly the matrix [skj ,i ]i0 ≤i,j≤a+N . This concludes the proof of Lemma 1.

Arithmetic and Asymptotic Properties

In this section we prove the following result, used in the proof of Theorem 6; see §4.2 for
the notation.
Proposition 1. Let
α = ea 4a/N −r (N + 1)2r+2 r −a/N +4r+2 and β = (2eN )a/N (rN + 1)2r+2 .

In this proposition and throughout this section, we denote by o(1) any sequence that
tends to 0 as n → ∞; it usually depends also on a, r, N, and k. When Proposition 1 is
applied in the proof of Theorem 6 (see §4.2), this dependence is not a problem since a, r,
N are fixed parameters and k is bounded from above by c2 . At last we recall that dn is
the least common multiple of 1, 2, . . . , n, and that
δn = (Ndn )a N an/N .

fraction expansions of F0 , Gi , Hi (which belong to N −n/N Z, so that N an/N accounts for
this contribution). This concludes the proof of (4.25).

This concludes the proof of Lemma 3.

than Hn for some Hn ≤ (2/N)a/N (rN + 1)2r+2
. Now let Pek,j = z k−1 Pk,j for any
k, j. Then the recurrence relation (4.6) yields

′
Pek,j = z Pek−1,j
− (k − 2)Pek−1,j − Pek−1,j+1

where Pek−1,j+1 = 0 if j = a, so that Pek,j is a polynomial of degree at most n, with
coefficients in δn−1 Z and height H(Pek,j ) ≤ (n + 1)k−1Hn , by induction on k.
ek = z k−1 Uk , Eq. (4.7) yields

so that Qk−1 is a polynomial and H(Qk−1) ≤ nH(Pk−1,1) ≤ (n)k−1 Hn . By induction on

a polynomial in z), coefficients in δn−1 Z and height H(Uk,λ) ≤ k(n)k−1 Hn .
Proceeding in the same way, it is not difficult to prove that the same properties hold
for Vk,λ. Assertion (i) follows at once, since dn = en(1+o(1)) .

Siegel’s linear independence criterion

The proofs of all linear independence results in this paper rely on the following criterion,
which is based on Siegel’s ideas (see for instance [8, p. 81–82 and 215–216], [13, §3] or [12,
Proposition 4.1]).

Proposition 2. Let θ1 , . . . , θp be real numbers, not all zero. Let τ > 0, and (Qn ) be a
sequence of real numbers with limit +∞. Let N be an infinite subset of N, and for any

linear form ℓ1,j X1 + . . .+ ℓp,j Xp on Rp . Up to reordering L1 , . . . , Lp , we may assume the

restrictions of L1 , . . . , Ld to F to be linearly independent linear forms on F . Denoting
(n)
by (u1 , . . . , ud ) an R-basis of F consisting in vectors of Zp , the matrix [Lj (ut )]1≤j,t≤d has
a non-zero integer determinant. Now (θ1 , . . . , θp ) is a linear combination of u1 , . . . , ud ;
−τ +o(1)
the same linear combination of the columns has coefficients less than Qn
in absolute
d−1−τ +o(1)
value. Therefore Qn
is an upper bound on this non-zero integer determinant: this
concludes the proof of Proposition 2.
