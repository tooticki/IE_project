Abstract. In this note, we use some of the tensor categorial machinery developed by
the quantum algebra community to study algebraic objects which appear in representation
stability. In [SS16], Sam and Snowden prove that the twisted commutative algebra Sym is
Morita equivalent to the horizontal strip category. Their proof relies on a lemma proved by
Olver in [Olv87]. We give a self contained proof that replaces Olver’s lemma with information
about the associator in the underlying category of polynomial GL(∞)-representations. In
fact, we prove a quantum analogue of the theorem. The classical version follows by letting
the parameter converge to 1.

1. Introduction
Let S be the category of polynomial GL(∞)-representations studied by Sam and Snowden
in [SS16]. This category contains the algebra Sym = C[x1 , x2 , . . . ] which is Morita equivalent
to FI, the category of finite sets with injections. A proof can be found in [SS17]. In Section 3
of [SS16], Sam and Snowden prove that Sym is Morita equivalent to HS, the category whose
objects are partitions and whose morphisms are defined by
(
C{µ\λ} λ ⊆ µ , µ\λ ∈ HS
HS(λ, µ) =
0
otherwise
Composition is defined as follows: Assume that µ\λ and ν\µ are horizontal strips. If ν\λ is
a horizontal strip, then
(ν\µ)(µ\λ) = ν\λ.
If ν\λ is not a horizontal strip, then the composition is zero. Now let H be the category of
polynomial type 1 representations of Ua (gl∞ ) defined in Definition 6. Inside H, we have the
quantum symmetric algebra QSym. In this chapter, we prove the following:
Theorem 1. The quantum symmetric algebra QSym is Morita equivalent to HS for generic
a.
Theorem 1 implies that many of the results in [SS16] which hold for Sym are also true for
QSym.

Tosteson for many useful conversations and their support.

2. Preliminaries
Definition 2. Let X be a semi-simple tensor category. Index the simple objects with a set
Λ. Choose a basis for each X(µ, λ ⊗ ν) denoted by
ν

be the dual basis of X(λ ⊗ ν, µ). We call these diagrams trivalent vertices. It is important
to notice that trivalent vertices are not canonically defined.
Definition 3. Pick a distinguished simple object X ∈ X. The fusion graph of X has
vertices Λ and the edges from λ to µ are the distinguished basis vectors in X(µ, λ ⊗ X).
Proposition 4. Fix λ ∈ Λ. Then X(λ, X ⊗n ) has dimension the number of paths from the
tensor unit to λ in the fusion graph for X of length n. Moreover, an explicit basis is given
by string diagrams of the form

In this diagram, each fi is a trivalent vertex of the form

we call such string diagrams trivalent basis vectors
Proof. Decompose X ⊗n using the fusion graph for X.



Definition 5. If X is a semi-simple tensor category over C with finite dimensional morphism
spaces, the Artin-Wedderburn Theorem implies that End(X ⊗n ) is a product of matrix algebras. Proposition 4 implies that in the trivalent basis, the matrix units in End(X ⊗n ) look
like
e1

e2
en
λ

fn
f2
f1

Equivalently, the irreducible representations of End(X ⊗n ) are parameterized by the simple
objects in X which have a length n path from the tensor unit in the fusion graph for X. The
string diagrams defined in Proposition 4 form a basis for the corresponding representation.
Definition 6. The Iwahori-Hecke algebra, denoted by Hm , is the algebra generated over
C(a) by 1, g1, . . . , gm−1 subject to the relations
gi gi+1 gi = gi+1 gi gi+1
gi gj = gj gi

if

|i − j|≥ 2

gi2 = (a − a−1 )gi + 1.
We define the category H which has objects the natural numbers and morphisms
(
Hm m = n
H(m, n) =
0
otherwise.
The inclusion Hm ⊗Hn → Hm+n defined by gi ⊗gj 7→ gi gm+j equips H with a tensor structure.
We define H ⊆ [H op , Vec] to be the idempotent completion of H. The monoidal structure
on H extends to H via Day convolution. Morally, the category H can be described as finite
dimensional type 1 representations of the quantum group Ua (gl∞ ). The Grothendieck ring
for H has basis given by partitions and multiplication given by the Littlewood-Richardson

rule. A special case of the Littlewood-Richardson rule is the Pieri rule:
X

λ⊂µ⊢n+1

This implies that the fusion graph for

is Young’s graph:

Paths in the Young graph are in bijection with standard partition fillings. It follows that the
trivalent basis vectors

are in bijection (up to scaling) with standard skew tableaux of shape µ\λ. We abuse notation
and identify these tree basis vectors with the corresponding standard skew tableaux. In
[LR97], Ram and Leduc computed semi-normal forms for the Iwahori-Hecke algebras. More
precisely, suppose that λ ⊆ µ ⊢ n + 2 are partitions such that µ\λ is not contained in a single
row or column. Then there are exactly two partitions which satisfy λ ⊆ ν ⊆ µ. Call them ν
and ν ′ . The multiplicity space H(µ, λ ⊗ ⊗ ) is 2-dimensional with basis

More formally, if µ\λ contains the boxes (a1 , b1 ), (a2 , b2 ), then the axial distance is defined
by d = |a1 − a2 |+|b1 − b2 |. These formulas are quantum analogues of the well known Young
semi-normal form for the representation theory of the symmetric group [JK81]. Indeed, when
a → 1, they recover they classical Young semi-normal formulas.
3. Morita Theory
In this section, we prove a very mild generalization of classical Morita theory. In classical
Morita theory, we replace an object with its presentation with respect to a single projective.
We are going to replace an object with its presentation with respect to a family of projectives.
For the remainder of this section, X is an abelian category enriched over Veck , closed under
colimits, D is a category enriched over Veck and D : Dop → X is a functor.
Theorem 7. If X has enough projectives, then X is equivalent to the category of representations of D where Dop is a full subcategory of X whose objects are compact, projective and
generate X.
We can prove this in a very clean
Suppose that A is a k-algebra, M is

way using coends. They can be motivated as follows:
a left A-module and N is a right A-module. Then we
which is a vector space. It is built by taking the tensor
the relations

am ⊗ n = m ⊗ na.
We can generalize the second step in the following way. Suppose that F : D ⊗k Dop → Veck
is a bifunctor. Then we can form the vector space
Z d∈D
M
F =
F (d, d) / f v = vf
v ∈ F (d, d′), f : d′ → d.
d∈D

This vector space is called the coend of F . We can use coends to generalize tensor products
from modules to functors. Suppose that F : D → Vec and G : Dop → Vec are functors.
Then we define
Z
d∈D

F ⊗D G =

F (d) ⊗ G(d).

6

DANIEL BARTER

A clear exposition of the theory of coends can be found in [Rie14]. Let D a category enriched
over Vec. Suppose that we have a functor D : Dop → X. Then we get a functor
X → [D, Vec]
X 7→ X(D(−), X)
This functor has a left adjoint given by
[D, Vec] → X
V 7→ V ⊗D D =

Z

d

Vd ⊗ D d

The following computation demonstrates why these functors are adjoint:

Vd ⊗ D , X
Z

= [D, Vec](V, X(D(−), X))

Definition 8. We call X ∈ X a compact object if X(X, −) commutes with filtered colimits.
Proposition 9. Assume that D is fully faithful and each D(d) is projective and compact.
Then [D, Vec] → X is fully faithful.
Proof. We need to prove that the unit
V → X(D(−), V ⊗D D)
is an isomorphism. It suffices to prove this pointwise, so we need to prove that the linear
map
V (d) → X(D(d), V ⊗D D)
is an isomorphism. Since D(d) is projective and compact, it follows that X(D(d), −) commutes with all colimits. Therefore

V (x) ⊗ D(x) =
V (x) ⊗ X(D(d), D(x))

The second equality is true because D is fully faithful.



Proposition 10. In addition
L to the hypotheses of proposition 9, assume that every X ∈
X admits an epimorphism
i D(di ) → X for some family {di }. Then [D, Vec] → X is
essentially surjective.
Proof. By assumption, it follows that for every X ∈ X, the counit
X(D(−), X) ⊗D D → X

COMPUTING THE MINIMAL MODEL FOR THE QUANTUM SYMMETRIC ALGEBRA

is an epimorphism. Then we have an exact sequence
0 → K → X(D(−), X) ⊗D D → X → 0
This gives us an exact sequence
X(D(−), K) ⊗D D → X(D(−), X) ⊗D D → X → 0
Since − ⊗D D is fully faithful, we can write the first map as f ⊗D D for some map f :
X(D(−), K) → X(D(−), X). Since − ⊗D D is right exact, it follows that X = coker f ⊗D D.
This proves essential surjectivity.

Proof of theorem 7. Let Dop be a full subcategory of X whose objects are compact, projective
and generate X. Let D : Dop → X be the embedding. By proposition, 9, the functor
− ⊗D D : [D, Vec] → X if fully faithful. By Proposition 10, the functor is essentially
surjective.

Definition 11. If X is an abelian category with enough compact projectives, define M(X) to
be the opposite of the full subcategory with objects the indecomposable compact projectives.
We call M(X) the minimal model for X. By theorem 7, the functor category [M(X), Vec]
is equivalent to X.
4. Modules over Tensor Algebras
In this section, we work inside a fixed semi-simple tensor category C. We use Morita theory
to study the category of modules over an algebra internal to C. Choose a distinguished simple
object X ∈ C. Define
M
T =
X ⊗n
n≥0

This is the tensor algebra generated by X. Define Rep(T ) to be the category of right modules
over T internal to C. The forgetful functor F : Rep(T ) → C has left adjoint L : C → Rep(T )
defined by V 7→ V ⊗ T . Since the right adjoint F is exact, it follows that L preserves
projectives. Define
M
T+ =
X ⊗n
n≥1

Lemma 12. If V ∈ C is irreducible, then V ⊗ T is an indecomposable projective in Rep(T ).
Proof. Since V ⊗ T = L(V ), the module is projective. Suppose that V ⊗ T = A ⊕ B as
T -modules. When we tensor with T /T + , we get
V = A/AT + ⊕ B/BT +
in C. Since V is irreducible in C, we can assume without loss of generality that A/AT + = 0.
Suppose that A =
6 0. Choose 0 6= Y ⊆ A ⊆ V ⊗ T irreducible in C. This implies that
Y ⊆

for some large N. Since A = A (T )

, it follows that

Y ⊆ A T+

This implies that Y = 0, which is a contradiction. Therefore we must have A = 0.

Proposition 13. Let G be the fusion graph for X considered as a category where the objects
are vertices and the morphisms are paths. Then Rep(T ) is Morita equivalent to [G, Vec].
Proof. The indecomposable compact projectives λ⊗T , where λ is an irreducible in C, generate
Rep(T ). Using the adjunction (L, F ) : Rep(T ) → C, we have
homT (µ ⊗ T, λ ⊗ T ) = C(µ, λ ⊗ T ).
The right hand side has a basis consisting of vectors of the form
λ

XX X

µ
which is exactly a path in the fusion graph for X from λ to µ. Post composing with the
corresponding morphism in homT (µ ⊗ T, λ ⊗ T ) is the map

This implies that composition of basis vectors is exactly concatenation of paths in the fusion
graph for X. This completes the proof.

Example 14. Let C = H, which was defined in Example 6, and let X = . The fusion graph
for X has objects partitions and the edges G(λ, µ) are the standard skew tableaux of shape
µ\λ.

In this section, we work inside the category H defined in Example 6. Define T =

where λ is a partition with two or more rows. The grading on the Grothendieck ring implies
that I is a 2-sided ideal in T , so we can form the quotient algebra S = T /I. We have

S =∅⊕

⊕

⊕

⊕···

Define Rep(S) to be category of right modules over S internal to the category H. Just like
the tensor algebra, every projective S-module is free and the indecomposable projectives are
of the form λ ⊗ S where λ is a partition. Define F to be the fusion graph for inside H
interpreted as a category. Define M to be the category whose objects are partitions and
whose morphisms are defined by

M(λ, µ) = homS (µ ⊗ S, λ ⊗ S).

Then we have the functor Q = − ⊗T S : F → M. By definition, this functor is the identity
on objects. Since all the projectives involved are free, it follows that Q is full. We can
describe Q more concretely as follows. Each hom space in F is a skew representation of some
Iwahori-Hecke algebra. We have:
Lemma 15. On morphisms, Q projects onto the Hecke algebra invariants.

Proposition 16. Suppose that λ ⊆ µ are partitions. Then H(µ, λ ⊗ ⊗n ) has Hecke algebra invariants if and only if µ\λ is a horizontal strip. In this case, the invariants are
1-dimensional and any skew tableaux projects onto a nonzero invariant.
Proof. The invariants in H(µ, λ ⊗

⊗n

) are the same as maps
µ → λ ⊗ | {z }

By Pieri’s rule, H(µ, λ ⊗ ⊗n ) has invariants if and only if µ\λ is a horizontal strip. Suppose
that µ\λ is a horizontal strip and P is a skew tableaux of shape µ\λ. Then from the seminormal form, we know that P generates H(µ, λ ⊗ ⊗n ). This implies that H(µ, λ ⊗ ⊗n ) has
a 1-dimensional space of invariants and P projects onto a nonzero invariant.

Proof of Theorem 1. The minimal model for S is M. From Lemma 15, Q : F → M is a full
functor which is projection onto the Hecke algebra invariants. From Proposition 16, we have
M(µ, λ) = F (µ, λ)Hn = H(µ, λ ⊗ )Hn = HS(µ, λ).
