Abstract
This article contains a proof of the basic lemma, which yields a
motivic proof of the Andreotti Frankel theorem for affine varieties.
Next, it is shown that the triangulated category of “Cohomologically
Constructible Sheaves” (as it is referred to in the Riemann-Hilbert
correspondence) coincides with the derived category of bounded complexes of constructible sheaves. It is also shown that higher direct
images and the sheaf-Ext groups are effaceable in the category of
constructible sheaves.

Introduction
The Andreotti-Frankel theorem asserts that a closed complex manifold X of
CN of dimension n has the homotopy type of a cell complex of dimension
at most n (see [AF] or [Mil]). This is achieved by constructing a Morse
function f : X → R with critical points of index at most n. Put
Xa = {x ∈ X : f (x) ≤ a}.
The cohomology of the pair (Xa , Xb ) when b < a now enters the picture.
But the cohomology of these pairs do not inherit the rich structure (Galois
action , mixed Hodge structure, for instance) that the cohomology of X
carries when X is an algebraic variety. This is the reason for formulating
the basic lemma below.
Basic Lemma – first form (A. Beilinson) Let k be a subfield of C.
Let W be Zariski closed in an affine variety X defined over k. Assume
dim(W ) < dim(X). Then there is a Zariski closed Z in X so that dim(Z) < n
with W ⊂ Z, and Hq (X, Z) = 0 whenever q 6= dim(X).
In the above lemma, Hq (X, Z) denotes the singular cohomology of the
pair (X(C), Z(C)). The cohomological version of the Andreotti-Frankel
theorem for affine varieties is of course an immediate consequence. Indeed
if X is affine of dimension n, from the above lemma, we deduce an increasing sequence of Zariski closed sets Xi of dimension at most i so that
Hj (Xi , Xi−1 ) = 0 whenever j 6= i. Consequently, the j-th cohomology of
the complex D• , where Di = Hi (Xi , Xi−1 ) coincides with the j-th cohomology of X, which therefore vanishes whenever j > n. Furthermore D•

may be regarded as a complex of “motives”. See also [Be1] and [Be2] for
such statements for mixed Hodge structures and Galois representations.
The proof given here of the basic lemma is geometric. It is not hard to
see that for our choice of Z in the basic lemma, (X(C), Z(C)) is in fact,
upto homotopy, a relative CW pair obtained by attaching cells of dimension
n. Furthermore, the same method gives a triangulation of real affine semialgebraic sets.
Our proof is valid only in characteristic zero. The proof of the intermediate Proposition 1.3 is not valid in positive characteristic due to the
presence of wild ramification.
The only proof of the basic lemma in positive characteristic is that of
Beilinson ([Be2, Lemma 3.3]). In fact, Beilinson’s Lemma 3.3 is a vast
generalisation of the basic lemma to perverse sheaves, in the sense that it
produces plenty of perverse sheaves with at most one nonvanishing hypercohomology. With X and W as in the basic lemma, the proof of Lemma 3.3,
[Be2], as Beilinson explained to the author, yields Z in the following shape:
first enlargen W so that its complement V = X − W is affine and smooth of
pure dimension n, where n = dim(X). Next, embed X as a Zariski locally
closed set in projective space, and let H be a general hyperplane section of
X. Then Hq (X, W ∪ H) = 0 for q 6= n, and thus we may take Z = W ∪ H
in the basic lemma. Beilinson’s Lemma 3.3 also includes a very general
cohomological (rather than homotopy theoretic) version of the “Lefschetz
hyperplane section theorem for complements”: with V = X − W and H as
above, his result shows that Hq (V, V ∩ H) = 0 for q 6= n. However, Beilinson relies on M. Artin’s sheaf-theoretic version of the Andreotti-Frankel
theorem, whereas we deduce M. Artin’s theorem (in characteristic zero).
We now turn to constructible sheaves. A ring R will be fixed once and
for all. All sheaves considered are sheaves of left R-modules. A subfield k of
the complex numbers will remain fixed throughout the paper. All varieties
and morphisms considered are defined over this field k. By a “sheaf on
X” we mean a sheaf of R-modules on the set X(C) of C-rational points
equipped with the usual topology. A sheaf F on a variety X is said to be
weakly constructible if X is the disjoint union of a finite collection of locally
closed subschemes Yi so that the restrictions F |Yi are all locally constant
sheaves. We also fix a full Abelian subcategory N of the category of all Rmodules so that every R-module M that is isomorphic to an object of N is
actually an object of N . We call F constructible if, in addition, all the stalks
of F are objects of N . We warn the reader that, in the literature (e.g., [KS,
Chapter VIII]), when constructible sheaves are discussed, N is the category
of all Noetherian modules. But we do not place such restrictions on N .
For constructible or weakly constructible sheaves F , the sheaf cohomology Hq (X(C), F ) will be denoted simply by Hq (X, F ). To compute sheaf

cohomology, one takes a resolution K • of the given sheaf F and considers
the cohomology of the complex: Γ(X, K • ). If K • is an injective, or even a
flasque, resolution (e.g., the Godement resolution), we get:
Hq (Γ(X, K • )) = Hq (X, F ).
Constructible sheaves are rarely flasque (if so, they are supported on a
finite set). Nevertheless, it is true that every constructible sheaf F on An
has a constructible resolution K • so that Hq (Γ(An , K • )) = Hq (An , F ) for
all q ≥ 0. Furthermore, we may assume that K q = 0 for all q > n. This
is a consequence of Theorem 1 below. The comparison theorem of ArtinGrothendieck for etale cohomology (see [SGA4, Expose XI]) is the special
case of Theorem 2 for R = Z/nZ.
Theorem 1 Every constructible sheaf F on affine n-space An is a subsheaf
of a constructible G so that Hq (An , G) = 0 for all q > 0.
Theorem 2 For every constructible sheaf F on a variety X, there is a
monomorphism a : F → G with G constructible so that
Hq (X, a) : Hq (X, F ) → Hq (X, G)
is zero, for all q > 0.
Further effaceability results and their consequences are formulated below. We shall denote by Sh(X) the category of sheaves of R-modules on X
and by C(X) the full subcategory of Sh(X) with Obj C(X)= constructible
sheaves. An additive functor T : C(X) → A, where A is an Abelian category is effaceable, if for all objects F of C(X), there is a monomorphism
a : F → G in C(X) so that T a : T F → T G is the zero morphism.
Theorem 3 (a) Assume that R is commutative. For every weakly constructible sheaf P on X such that all the stalks of P are finitely generated projective modules, and for every q > 0, the functor
ExtqSh(X) (P, ·)|C(X)
is effaceable.
(b) Let R be a field, and let N be the category of all finite dimensional
vector spaces over R. Let F, G be constructible sheaves on X. Then
ExtqC(X) (F, G) → ExtqSh(X) (F, G) is an isomorphism for all q ≥ 0.

Throughout the paper, ExtqA (F, G) denotes the Yoneda Ext group for
objects F and G of an Abelian category A. That Theorem 3(a) implies Theorem 3(b) is the standard application of effaceability (see [Toh,
Prop. 2.2.1, page 141] ). Theorem 3(b) implies (see e.g., [Be2, Lemma 1.4])
that the derived category Db (C(X)), with R = k = C and N =finite
dimensional vector spaces, is equivalent to the triangulated category of
“cohomologically constructible sheaves” as it is referred to in the RiemannHilbert correspondence. In view of Beilinson’s result ([Be2, Main theorem 1.3, page 29]), one may re-state the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence
([Bo, Thm. 14.4]) as follows:
The derived category of bounded complexes of regular holonomic modules
is equivalent to the derived category of bounded complexes of constructible
sheaves of complex vector spaces.
Theorem 4 Assume that R is a field, and that N =all finite dimensional
vector spaces. Let f : X → Y be a morphism. Then the functors Rq f∗ |C(X)
are effaceable for all q > 0.
For the next theorem, assume that R is commutative and recall that
for sheaves F, G on X, we have the sheaf (of R-modules) Hom(F, G) on X
and the derived functors Rq Hom(F, ·) = Extq (F, ·).
Theorem 5 With R and N as in Theorem 4 above, the functors
Extq (P, ·)|C(X) are effaceable for all q > 0 and for all constructible sheaves
P on X.
The minimal hypotheses on R and N under which Theorems 3(b), 4
and 5 are valid remain unclear. It is hoped that Theorems 1–5, or at
least the method of proof, will help in constructing a category of motivic
sheaves. The reader will observe that the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2
require nothing more than the formal properties of the operations f ∗ and
Rq f∗ while Theorems 3, 4 and 5 require the internal Hom. That the
analogues of Theorems 1–5 hold for Q l - sheaves (see [SGA4 12 , page 84]) is
immediate from the proofs given here.
The Noether normalisation lemma plays a major role in the proofs of
the sheaf-theoretic version of the basic lemma and Theorem 1. These proofs
appear in the first two sections. Some care has been taken to keep these sections self-contained and elementary (modulo the use of the Leray spectral
sequence and the proper base change theorem). For this purpose, direct
proofs of weak constructibility appear in these sections. In the third section,
the remaining theorems are essentially deduced from Theorem 1, Whitney

stratifications, devissage, and a reduction from [SGA4], [SGA4 12 ] (embedding a sheaf F on X in i∗ i∗ F ⊕ j∗ j ∗ F when the images of i and j cover
X.
The first proof of Theorem 3(b), not the one given here, was found
with some aid in homological algebra from P. Deligne. The version of
Lemma 3.2(b) given here is based on a remark of V. Srinivas. The author
thanks both P. Deligne and V. Srinivas for useful discussions, and most of
all, A. Beilinson for taking the trouble to explain in detail the very first
consequences of his far-reaching Lemma 3.3.

The basic lemma for sheaves

A subfield k ⊂ C remains fixed throughout the paper. The phrases “sheaf
on X”, “weakly constructible sheaf”, etc. are as in the introduction. All
varieties and morphisms considered are defined over k. All sheaves considered are sheaves of R-modules. The cohomology group Hq (X(C), F ) will
always be denoted simply by Hq (X, F ). The lemma below evidently implies
the theorem of M. Artin : “Hq (X, F ) = 0 for q > dim(X), where X is
affine ” (see [SGA4, Expose XIV, Corollary 3.2]) and the analogous results
of Hamm and Le (see [HL1] and [HL2]) for weakly constructible sheaves.
It is unclear whether or not the powerful relative version, due to M. Artin
([SGA4, Thm. 3.1, Expose XIV]), can also be obtained directly.
Beilinson’s Lemma 3.3 of [Be2] covers (at least) the case F constructible,
R commutative Noetherian, N = all finitely generated modules, in the
lemma below. Beilinson works in fields of all characteristics. Remark 1.1
below holds for his proof as well. It would be nice to get a proof of this special case of Beilinson’s very general lemma via Morse theory or the method
of pencils. This would have the double advantage of covering the general
case and proving the theorems of M. Artin and Andreotti-Frankel as well.
Basic Lemma – second form (A. Beilinson) Let F be a weakly constructible sheaf on an affine variety X. Let n = dim(X). Then there is a
Zariski open U ⊂ X with the properties below, where j : U → X denotes
the inclusion, and F ′ = j! j ∗ F ⊂ F .
(1) dim(Y ) < n, where Y is the complement of U in X,
(2) Hq (X, F ′ ) = 0 for q 6= n.
(3) There is a finite subset E ⊂ U (C) and an R-module isomorphism of
Hn (X, F ′ ) with ⊕{Fx : x ∈ E}.

Remark 1.1 With F on X as in the lemma above, let X ′ be the largest
Zariski open subset of X so that X ′ is smooth and F |X ′ is locally constant.
The open U in the statement of the lemma depends only on X ′ and not on
F , as can be seen from the proof.
The proof given uses the Noether normalisation lemma twice. If in both
these places, one uses general linear projections instead, one sees that the
U in the lemma can be chosen to contain any given finite subset of X ′ (C).
In particular, the U for which the lemma holds cover X, if F is locally
constant and if X is smooth.
Remark 1.2 The first form of the basic lemma, as given in the introduction, is an immediate consequence. If RX denotes the constant sheaf on X
and v : V → X is a Zariski open immersion with W as its complement,
then the sheaf cohomology Hq (X, F ), where F = v! v ∗ RX coincides with
the singular cohomology Hq (X, W ; R). So, the above lemma applied to F
and R = Z yields Y with dim(Y ) < n and Hq (X, Y ∪ W ) = 0 for q 6= n,
and Hn (X, Y ∪ W ) = 0 is a free Abelian group. The universal coefficient
theorem gives the same result for all R and for homology as well.
Proof (of the basic lemma (second form)) Because the direct image
of a locally constant sheaf under a covering projection is locally constant, it
follows easily that the direct image of a weakly constructible sheaf under a
finite morphism is weakly constructible. With X and F as in the lemma, by
Noether normalisation, we have a finite morphism π : X → An . Assuming
the lemma for the sheaf π∗ F on An , we get a non-empty Zariski open
V ⊂ An with the desired properties.
Putting U = π −1 V and denoting the inclusions of U in X and V in
n
A by j and v respectively, we see that π∗ j! j ∗ F = v! v ∗ π∗ F . Consequently
Hq (X, j! j ∗ F ) = Hq (An , v! v ∗ π∗ F ), and by the very choice of V , the latter
vanishes for q 6= n. This proves part (2) of the lemma. Part (3) follows
because (π∗ F )y is the direct sum of Fx taken over x ∈ π −1 y.
It remains to prove the lemma for affine space. We will proceed by induction on dimension. Given a weakly constructible sheaf F on An , choose
a nonconstant f in the co-ordinate ring of An so that the restriction F |D(f )
is locally constant, where D(f ) and V(f ), are, as usual, {x| f (x) 6= 0} and
{x| f (x) = 0} in An respectively. Clearly, F may be replaced by its subsheaf
d! d∗ F where d denotes the inclusion of D(f ) in An . Thus we will assume
that F |V(f ) = 0. Next, after a linear change of variables, we may assume
that f is monic in the last variable. Denote by π : An → An−1 the projection (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) 7→ (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn−1 ). The restriction π|V(f ) is now
both finite and surjective. For y ∈ An−1 (C), we consider the cohomology
groups Hq (π −1 y, F |π −1 y). That this vanishes for q > 1 is standard (e.g.,

Constructible Sheaves

Remark 1.4 below). Because V(f ) ∩ π −1 y is non-empty and the restriction of F to this intersection is zero, we see that H0 (π −1 y, F |π −1 y) = 0 as
well. Because π|V(f ) is a finite morphism, we may apply VPBC (Proposition 1.3A below) to conclude that Rq π∗ F = 0 for all q 6= 1. For a nonempty Zariski open U ′ ⊂ An−1 (that will be chosen later), let U = π −1 U ′ .
Let j ′ : U ′ → An−1 and j : U → An denote the given inclusions. Put
∗
G = R1 π∗ F . Let G′ = j!′ j ′ G and let F ′ = j! j ∗ F . From Corollary 1.3C
q
below, it follows that R π∗ F ′ = 0 for q 6= 1 and also that G′ → R1 π∗ F ′
is an isomorphism. From the Leray spectral sequence, we deduce that
Hq (An−1 , G′ ) is isomorphic to Hq+1 (An , F ′ ) for all q. Checking easily that
G is weakly constructible (see Remark 1.5), apply the basic lemma to the
pair (An−1 , G) to get a non-empty U ′ ⊂ An−1 with the desired properties.
It follows that Hq (An , F ′ ) vanishes for all q 6= n. Finally, for part (3) of
the lemma, Hn (An , F ′ ) = Hn−1 (An−1 , G′ ) is isomorphic to a finite direct
sum of stalks Gy for y ∈ U ′ (C) by the induction hypothesis. But each
such Gy = H1 (π −1 y, F |π −1 y) is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of stalks
of F |π −1 y from Remark 1.4 below. This completes the proof of the basic
lemma (modulo 1.3–1.5).

The statements 1.3A–C below are for topological spaces and for sheaves
of Abelian groups. In (H3) below, a topological space Z is “simply connected” if every locally constant sheaf F on Z is a constant sheaf. This is
weaker than demanding that Z is path-connected and has trivial fundamental group. If f : L → M is a fiber bundle(this is so in all applications),
then (H2) holds locally on M .
Proposition 1.3A (Variation of proper base-change) Let f : L → M
be a proper continuous map, where L and M are second countable locally
compact Hausdorff spaces. Let L ⊂ L be open and let A be a sheaf on L.
Put f = f |L. Assume (H1), (H2) and (H3) below.
(H1) There is a closed subset L1 ⊂ L so that f |L1 is proper and A|L − L1
is a locally constant sheaf.
(H2) For every point x ∈ L − L there is a neighbourhood U of x in L so
that f (U ) is open and f |(U, U ∩ L) → f (U ) is a fiber bundle pair.
(H3) Every point m ∈ M has a fundamental system of simply connected
neighbourhoods.
Then Rq f∗ Am → Hq (f −1 m, A|f −1 m) is an isomorphism for all m ∈ M .

above, let g : M ′ → M be continuous with M ′ second countable locally

compact Hausdorff. Put L′ = M ′ ×M L. Let f ′ : L′ → M ′ and g ′ : L′ → L
denote the projections. Then g ∗ Rq f∗ A → Rq f∗′ g ′ ∗ A is an isomorphism.
Corollary 1.3C With notation and assumptions as in Proposition 1.3A
above, the homomorphism B⊗Rq f∗ A → Rq (A⊗f ∗ B) is an isomorphism for
all sheaves B on M of the type j! j∗(ZM ) for an open immersion j : V → M .
Proof (of Proposition 1.3A) Let Lm and Lm be the fibers over m ∈ M
in L and L respectively. Let j : L → L and jm : Lm → Lm denote the
inclusions. We have the spectral sequences:
p
q

Ep,q

2 = (R f ∗ R j∗ A)m ⇒ (R
q
p+q
p
(Lm , A|Lm )
Ep,q
2 = H (Lm , R (jm )∗ A|Lm ) ⇒ H

and a homomorphism from the first to the second. The second is the
Leray spectral sequence for the sheaf A|Lm and the inclusion jm . The
first is obtained by taking stalks at m of the Leray spectral sequence for
the composite L → L → M and the sheaf A. By the proper base-change
theorem, we see that the Ep,q
2 terms of the first spectral sequence coincide
with Hp (Lm , Rq j∗ A|Lm ). To prove the proposition, it suffices to check that
Rq j∗ A|Lm → Rq (jm )∗ (A|Lm ) is an isomorphism. This arrow evidently
induces an isomorphism of stalks at x ∈ Lm . For the rest, one observes that
(H1), (H2) and (H3) imply (H4) below and then notes that for x ∈ Lm −Lm
the required isomorphism on stalks is a consequence. In any “geometric
situation” where M is triangulable, this is immediate. That (H4) and our
assumptions on the topology of L and M are adequate to draw the same
conclusion is left to the reader. This may be seen, for instance, by using
the Kunneth formula.
(H4): Every x ∈ L − L has a neighbourhood U ⊂ L with a continuous
h : (U, U ∩ L) → (V, W ) so that
(i) f (U ) is open in M ,
(ii) (h, f |U ) induce a homeomorphism (U, U ∩ L) → (V, W ) × f (U ), and
(iii) there is a sheaf C on W and an isomorphism (h|U ∩ L)∗ C → A|U ∩ L.

Proof (of Corollary 1.3B) Once it is noted that the hypothesis (H4) in
the proof of Proposition 1.3A is stable under base-change, we see that stalks
of both sheaves at m′ ∈ M ′ are compatibly isomorphic to Hq (f −1 m, A|f −1 m)
where g(m′ ) = m (this argument is standard, see e.g., the proof of the operation Rq f! being stable under base change in [SGA4 21 , page 49]).

Constructible Sheaves

Proof (of Corollary 1.3C) Denote by S q B the natural homomorphism
B ⊗ Rq f∗ A → Rq (A ⊗ f ∗ B). Let i : F → M be the the inclusion of the
complement of the given open subset V . Now S q ZM is tautologically an
isomorphism. Putting g = i in Corollary 1.3B, we see that S q i∗ ZF is an
isomorphism. That S q j! ZV is an isomorphism follows from the long exact
sequence of S q obtained from the short exact sequence:

Remark 1.4 Consider a weakly constructible sheaf F on A1 whose restriction to the complement of a non-empty finite subset S ⊂ C is locally
constant. Let T be a tree embedded in C with S as its set of vertices, and
E as its set of edges. Let b(e) denote the barycenter of an edge e ∈ E. One
checks easily that
(a) Hq (A1 , F ) → Hq (T, F |T ) is an isomorphism, and
(b) the open covering {st(v) : v ∈ S} of T give a Leray covering for F |T
(see e.g., [KS, Chapter VIII, Prop. 8.1.4.(ii), page 323]), for a more
general statement).
The Cech complex for this covering is the arrow ⊕s∈S Fs → ⊕e∈E Fb(e) .
Thus, if F |S = 0, then ⊕e∈E Fb(e) → H1 (T, F |T ) is an isomorphism. This
gives part (3) of the basic lemma for the affine line.
Remark 1.5 Let π : X × A1 → X denote the projection. Let V ⊂ X × A1
be a Zariski closed subset so that π|V is a finite surjective morphism. Let
A be a sheaf on X × A1 so that A|V = 0 and the restriction of A to the
complement V is locally constant. We sketch briefly a proof that R1 π∗ A is
weakly constructible.
If π|V is a finite etale morphism, then (X × A1 , V ) → X is a fiber bundle pair. Consequently R1 π∗ A is a locally constant sheaf. For the general
case, express X as a finite disjoint union of Zariski locally closed smooth
subvarieties Xi so that (π −1 Xi ∩ V )red → Xi is a finite etale morphism.
By Corollary 1.3B, we see that R1 π∗ A|Xi maps isomorphically to the locally constant sheaf R1 (π|Xi × A1 )∗ A|Xi × A1 ). This proves the weak
constructibility of R1 π∗ A.
Proposition 1.6 Let F be a constructible sheaf on a variety X. Then
Hq (X, F ) is an object of N for all q ≥ 0.

Proof Part (3) of the second form of the basic lemma, combined with
induction on dimension, proves the proposition when X is affine. The
general case now follows by induction on the number n of affine open sets
required to cover X, and the Mayer-Vietoris sequence (the same technique
is used in the proof of Proposition 3.6).

The cohomology of affine space

This section begins with the proof of Theorem 1 as stated in the introduction. The conventions and notation are as in the previous section. The
proof is by induction on n, the inductive step relying crucially on a canonical proof for the case n = 1 that works with parameters (Proposition 2.2
below). We then deduce the effaceability of cohomology for affine varieties
(Corollary 2.4).
We recall the statement of the theorem.
Theorem 1 Every constructible F on affine space is a subsheaf of a constructible G so that Hq (An , G) = 0 for all q > 0.
Proof We begin as in the proof of the basic lemma. Given a constructible
sheaf F on An , choose a nonconstant f in the co-ordinate ring of An so
that the restriction F |D(f ) is locally constant, where D(f ) and V(f ), are,
as before, {x| f (x) 6= 0} and {x| f (x) = 0} in An . The projection π : An →
An−1 is, once again, arranged so that π|V(f ) is a finite (and surjective)
morphism. Denote by j : D(f ) → An and i : V(f ) → An the inclusions.
From Proposition 2.2 below (with X = An−1 and A = j! j ∗ F ) we see
that j! j ∗ F is a subsheaf of a constructible H ′ on An so that Rq π∗ H ′ = 0
for all q ≥ 0. Taking push-outs, we obtain the commutative diagram of
exact sequences below:

We will say that a homorphism P → Q of sheaves on An is a π-isomorphism
if Rq π∗ P → Rq π∗ Q is an isomorphism for all q ≥ 0. We shall see that all

481

arrows in the commutative diagram below are π-isomorphisms.
π ∗ π∗ H

/H


π ∗ π∗ H ′′



We have the implications:
Rq π∗ H ′ = 0 for all q ≥ 0
⇒ H → H ′′ is a π-isomorphism
⇒ π∗ H → π∗ H ′′ is an isomorphism
⇒ π ∗ π∗ H → π ∗ π∗ H ′′ is an isomorphism.
Next, because π|V(f ) is a finite morphism, we see that H ′′ is constructible
and that Rq π∗ H ′′ vanishes for q > 0. For any sheaf K on An−1 , Rq π∗ π ∗ K
vanishes for q > 0. Putting K = π∗ H ′′ , we deduce that π ∗ π∗ H ′′ → H ′′ is a
π-isomorphism. We conclude that the only remaining arrow in the square
π ∗ π∗ H → H is itself a π-isomorphism.
Now let π∗ H ⊂ J with J a sheaf on An−1 . Taking push-outs once again
yields the commutative diagram of exact sequences below:

The vertical arrows on the sides being π-isomorphisms, it follows that
π ∗ J → G is a π-isomorphism as well. It follows that
Hq (An−1 , J)

/ Hq (An , π ∗ J)

/ Hq (An , G)

are isomorphisms, for all q ≥ 0. By the induction hypothesis, we may
choose J satisfying Hq (An−1 , J) = 0 for all q > 0 with J constructible.
We now have F ⊂ H ⊂ G with G constructible and Hq (An , G) = 0 for all
q > 0. The proof of the theorem is now complete modulo Proposition 2.2.

For any sheaf A on A1X , we define B on A2X by the exact sequence:
0

/B

/ p∗ A
1

/ ∆∗ A

/ 0.

Applying Rq (p2 )∗ to the above exact sequence gives the arrow:
δ : A = (p2 )∗ ∆∗ A → C = R1 (p2 )∗ B.
Proposition 2.2 Let V ⊂ A1X be a Zariski closed subset so that π|V is a
finite surjective morphism. Let A be a sheaf on A1X so that A|V = 0 and
the restriction of A to the complement A1X − V is locally constant. With
δ : A → C as above, we have:
(1) the above δ : A → C is a monomorphism,
(2) Rq π∗ C = 0 for all q ≥ 0,
(3) C is weakly constructible. If A is constructible, so is C.
Proof Applying Rq (p1 )∗ to the short exact sequence that defines B, we
see that Rq (p1 )∗ B = 0 for all q. From the Leray spectral sequence applied
to Π = π ◦ p1 we see that Rq Π∗ B = 0 for all q.
Put Y = ∆(A1X ) ∪ p−1
1 V . Then B|Y = 0 and B is locally constant
on the complement of Y . Now p2 |Y is a finite surjective morphism. So,
substituting (A2X , A1X , p2 , B) for (L, M, f, A) in Proposition 1.3A, we get
Rq (p2 )∗ B = 0 for q 6= 1. By the Leray spectral sequence for Π = π ◦ p2
we deduce that Rq π∗ C = Rq+1 Π∗ B = 0. This proves part (2) of the
proposition. That C is weakly constructible follows from Remark 1.5. By
Proposition 1.3A and Remark 1.4, any stalk of C, being isomorphic to a
finite direct sum of stalks of B, is indeed an object of N if A is constructible.
This proves part (3). Finally, π ∗ Rq π∗ A → Rq (p2 )∗ p∗1 A is an isomorphism
by Corollary 1.3B, because V → X is a finite morphism. Furthermore,
V → X being surjective, the stalks of these sheaves vanish for q = 0, and
this proves part (1) of the proposition.

Remark 2.3 From the above proof, we see that A 7→ C is, in fact, an
exact functor for A as in the proposition. Furthermore Rq p2 ∗ gives the
short exact sequence:
0

/A

/C

/ π ∗ R1 π∗ A

/ 0.

Corollary 2.4 Every constructible sheaf F on an affine variety X is a
subsheaf of a constructible sheaf G on X so that the induced homomorphism
Hq (X, F ) → Hq (X, G) is zero for all q > 0.

Proof Let i : X → An be a closed immersion. From Theorem 1, we have
i∗ F ⊂ T with T constructible so that Hq (An , T ) = 0 for all q > 0. The
commutative diagram:
Hq (An , i∗ F )

/ Hq (An , T )


Hq (X, i∗ i∗ F )


/ Hq (X, i∗ T ).

shows that G = i∗ T is the desired sheaf.

Definition and notation 3.1: Admissibility, F [U ] and RX .
An object F of Sh(X) is admissible if the functor ExtqSh(X) (F, ·))|C(X)
is effaceable for every q > 0.
Let F be a sheaf on X and let U be Zariski open in X. If j : U → X
denotes the inclusion, then F [U ] = j! j ∗ F .
RX always denotes the constant sheaf on X with all stalks equal to R.
Lemma 3.2 Let
0

/F′

/ F ′′

/F

/0

be an exact sequence in Sh(X).
(a) Assume F ′′ is admissible and at least one of F ′ , F is admissible. Then
all three are admissible.
(b) Assume F and F ′ are admissible, and also that
coker(HomSh(X) (F, ·) → HomSh(X) (F ′ , ·))|C(X)
is effaceable. Then F ′′ is admissible.
Proof Consider the long exact sequence of Ext:
q−1
ExtSh(X)
(F ′ , ·)

′′
/ Extq
Sh(X) (F , ·)

/ Extq
Sh(X) (F, ·)

′
/ Extq
Sh(X) (F , ·).

Let P be a constructible sheaf on X and let q > 0. For part (b), there is a
monomorphism P → Q with Q constructible that effaces ExtqSh(X) (F, P ).
Next choose a monomorphism Q → S with S constructible that effaces

484

q−1
ExtSh(X)
(F ′ , Q) if q > 1. If q = 1, then Q → S is chosen so as to efface the
cokernel of HomSh(X) (F, Q) → HomSh(X) (F ′ , Q). The long exact sequence
of Ext shows that P → S effaces ExtqSh(X) (F ′′ , P ). Part (a) follows in the
same manner.


Corollary 3.3 below is an immediate consequence of Lemma 3.2(a).
Corollary 3.3 If 0 = F n ⊂ F n−1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ F 1 ⊂ F 0 = F and if all the
F i /F i+1 are admissible, then F is admissible.
Proposition 3.4 If F is constructible on X and f : X → Y is a morphism,
then Rq f∗ F is constructible for all q ≥ 0.
Proof This proposition is by now well known; the conventional assumption “N = all Noetherian R-modules” plays no role in the proof. It suffices
to prove the assertion in the two cases:(i) f is proper, and (ii) f is an open
immersion.
When f is proper, the proper base-change theorem, the existence of
Whitney stratifications, and Thom’s isotopy lemma (see [GM, page 41])
together show that Rq f∗ F is weakly constructible. By proper base-change,
the stalk of this sheaf at y ∈ Y (C) coincides with Hq (f −1 y, F |f −1 y), which
is an object of N , by Proposition 1.6. Thus Rq f∗ F is constructible.
When f is an open immersion, one chooses a Whitney stratification:
Y = finite disjoint union of Yi so that f! F |Yi is locally constant for all i.
It follows that Rq f∗ F |Yi is locally constant, because we are in a “product situation”. The links L(p) (see [GM, page 41]) being finite simplicial
complexes, we’re assured (e.g., by [KS, Prop. 8.1.4(ii)]) that the stalks of
Rq f∗ F |Yi are objects of N . This completes the proof.

Lemma 3.5 Let F be an object of Sh(X).
(a) If F and F [U ] are both admissible where U ⊂ X is Zariski open, then
so is F/F [U ].
(b) Let V and W be Zariski open in X. Assume that F [V ], F [W ] and
F [V ∩ W ] are admissible. Then F [V ∪ W ] is also admissible (see 3.1
for notation).
Proof Both parts follow from Lemma 3.2(b). For (a), it is sufficient to
show that every constructible P is contained in a constructible Q with
HomSh(X) (F, Q) → HomSh(X) (F [U ], Q) surjective. Denoting by j and i

485

Constructible Sheaves

the inclusions of U and its complement Y in X respectively, the natural
arrow P → Q = j∗ j ∗ P ⊕ i∗ i∗ P is a monomorphism that has the desired
property because HomSh(X) (F [U ], i∗ i∗ P ) = 0 and
HomSh(X) (F [U ], j∗ j ∗ P ) = HomSh(X) (F, j∗ j ∗ P ) = HomSh(U) (j ∗ F, j ∗ P ).
That Q is constructible has been shown in Proposition 3.4 above.
For (b), consider the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence:
0

/ F [V ∩ W ]

/ F [V ] ⊕ F [W ]

/ F [V ∪ W ]

/ 0.

We obtain Q from P as in the proof of part (a) by putting U = V ∩ W .
The surjectivity of HomSh(X) (F, Q) → HomSh(X) (F [V ∩ W ], Q) certainly
implies the surjectivity of
HomSh(X) (F [V ], Q) ⊕ HomSh(X) (F [W ], Q) → HomSh(X) (F [V ∩ W ], Q).
This completes the proof of the lemma.

Proposition 3.6 Let U ⊂ X be Zariski open. Then RX [U ] is admissible
(see 3.1 for notation).
Proof We proceed by induction on the number n of affine open subsets
required to cover U . Now assume that U is affine (the case: n = 1).
Corollary 2.4 says that RU is admissible in Sh(U ). It follows that RX [U ] is
admissible in Sh(X) (see e.g., Remark 3.8(a)). For the general case, write
U = V ∪ W where V is covered by n − 1 affine opens and W is affine open.
Because X is separated, by Chevalley, V ∩ W is covered by n − 1 affine
open subsets in X, so we may assume the result for V, W and V ∩ W . The
admissibility of RX [U ] follows from Lemma 3.5(b).

Proof (of Theorem 2) The proof of the admissibility of RX in Proposition 3.6 above actually proves Theorem 2. In any case, the admissibility
plus the vanishing of Hq (X, F ) for q > 2 dim .(X) implies the theorem.

Remark 3.7 Let F be a constructible sheaf on X with the additional
property that X is the union of a finite collection of Zariski locally closed
subsets Yi so that for each i, F |Yi is a constant sheaf. Assume that R is
Noetherian and that N is the category of all finitely generated R-modules.
In this case, one can check that F is admissible. We will not use this
however in the sequel.

Remark 3.8 (Avoiding the use of injective objects) Let F : A → B
and G : B → A be adjoint functors, viz.,
φ(A, B) : Hom(F A, B) → Hom(A, GB)
for all objects A of A and B of B, is an isomorphism functorial in A and
B (see [Mac, Chapter IV, page 80]). Assume that A and B are Abelian
categories, and that F is left exact. Then it is standard (see [Toh]) that G
takes injectives to injectives. We will not assume that B possesses injective
objects. We will observe instead that the left exactness of F ensures:
For every monomorphism u : GB → A, there is a monomorphism
v : B → B ′ so that Gv : GB → GB ′ factors through u, i.e. there is
w : A → GB ′ so that Gv = w ◦ u. In particular, if H : A → C is effaceable,
then H ◦ G is also effaceable. The v : B → B ′ is obtained simply as the
push-out of the natural arrow ǫ(B) : F GB → B with the monomorphism
F u : F GB → F A. Denote by t : F A → B ′ the resulting arrow. The w is
then obtained as Gt ◦ η(A) where η(A) : A → GF A is the natural arrow.
For the dfns of ǫ(B) and η(A) see [Mac, Thm. 1, page 82]. The (F, G) we
are concerned with are:
(a) (j! ,j ∗ ) where j : U → X is an open immersion and A = C(U ) and
B = C(X). In particular, the admissibility of Q on U implies the
admissibility of j! Q on X.
(b) (f ∗ ,f∗ ) where f : X → Y is a morphism and A = C(Y ) and
B = C(X).
(c) (P ⊗ · , Hom(P, ·)). Here R is assumed to be commutative, and P is
weakly constructible on X with all stalks finitely generated projective
modules and A = B = C(X).
Definition 3.9 (elementary, projectively elementary) A sheaf F on
X is elementary if there are Zariski open V ⊂ U ⊂ X and a locally constant
sheaf L on U so that F is isomorphic to j! (L/L[V ]), where j : U → X
denotes the inclusion.
If all the stalks of L are finitely generated projective R-modules, then F
will be called projectively elementary.
Proposition 3.10 Every weakly constructible sheaf F on X has a finite
filtration
0 = F n ⊂ F n−1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ F 1 ⊂ F 0 = F
so that F r /F r+1 is a direct summand of an elementary sheaf T r on X for
all r. Every stalk of T r is a finite direct sum of stalks of F . In particular,

Constructible Sheaves

487

if all the stalks of F are finitely generated projective R-modules, then the
T r above are projectively elementary.
We will assume the above proposition and proceed. Proposition 3.10 is
proved at the end of this section.
Proof (of Theorem 3) We first assume that F is projectively elementary.
Let L, U, V, F, j be as in the dfn of “projectively elementary”. Because
L is a locally constant sheaf on a variety U with all stalks finitely generated projective, we see that Extq (L, D) = 0 for all q > 0 and for
all D on U . The spectral sequence (see [Toh, Thm. 4.2.1, page 188])
shows that ExtqSh(U) (L, D) = Hq (U, Hom(L, D)). From Theorem 2 and
Remark 3.8(c), it follows that L is admissible on U . Replacing (L, U )
by (L|V, V ) we see that that L|V is admissible on V as well. From Remark 3.8(a), we see that L[V ] is admissible on U . By Lemma 3.5(a), L/L[V ]
is admissible on U . By Remark 3.8(a) once again, F = j! (L/L[V ]) is also
admissible on X.
Evidently, any direct summand of an admissible is admissible. The
admissibility of P as in Theorem 3(a) now follows from Proposition 3.10
and Corollary 3.3.

Theorem 3.11 Assume that A′ , A, B ′ , B, F and G satisfy the properties
(1),(2),(3) and (4) below. It then follows that the functors Re G|B ′ are
effaceable for all e > 0.
(1) A′ is a full Abelian subcategory of an Abelian category A. Every
object of A that is isomorphic to an object of A′ is an object of A′ .
The category A possesses enough injectives. For every object A′ of
A′ and for every q > 0, the functor ExtqA (A′ , ·)|A′ is effaceable.
(2) B ′ is a full Abelian subcategory of an Abelian category B. All the
properties in (1) above hold for B ′ and B.
(3) G : B → A is a left exact functor so that Rq GB ′ is an object of A′
for all objects B ′ of B ′ and for all q ≥ 0.
(4) F : A → B is a left adjoint of G. In addition, F is left exact.
Furthermore, F A′ is an object of B ′ for all objects A′ of A′ .
Proof Proceeding by induction on e, we assume the effaceability of Rq G|B ′
for all q such that 0 < q < e. Let f : A′ → Re GB ′ be a homomorphism in

A, where A′ and B ′ are objects of A′ and B ′ respectively. We will find a
′
monomorphism B ′ → Be+1
in B ′ so that the composite

is zero. Consider the functor Hom(A′ , ·) : A → Ab where Ab is the category
of Abelian groups. By (4) above, note that Hom(A′ , ·) ◦ G = Hom(F A′ , ·)
and that G takes injectives to injectives. From [Toh], for every object B of
B, we get the spectral sequence below, functorial in B:
p

′
Ep,q
2 (B) = ExtA (A , R GB) ⇒ ExtB (F A , B).
′
We put f = f0 and B ′ = B0′ . The given f0 belongs to E0,e
2 (B0 ). Its
2,e−1
′
differential δf0 belongs to E2
(B0 ). By the induction hypothesis, there
is a a monomorphism B0′ → B1′ in B ′ that effaces Re−1 GB0′ . Thus B0′ → B1′
induces zero on E2,e−1
. It follows that δf0 7→ 0 under B0′ → B1′ . Denoting
2
0,e
0,e
′
′
the image of f0 in E2 (B1′ ) by f1 we see that f1 ∈ E0,e
3 (B1 ) ⊂ E2 (B1 ).
Continuing in this manner, using the induction hypothesis alone, we obtain
′
a chain of elements fi ∈ E0,e
i+2 (Bi ) for 0 ≤ i < e and monomorphisms

Bi → Bi+1 in B for 0 ≤ i < e − 1 that take fi to fi+1 . Note that this is

there is a monomorphism Be → Be+1 in B ′ that effaces ExteB (F A′ , Be′ ). Bee

Now let f be the identity homomorphism of Re GB ′ . The theorem follows.

Proof (of Theorem 4) Given a morphism f : X → Y , we substitute
(f ∗ , f∗ , Sh(Y ), C(Y ), Sh(X), C(X)) = (F, G, A, A′ , B, B ′)
in Theorem 3.11. The assumptions (1) and (2) of Theorem 3.11 are valid by
Theorem 3(b); assumption (3) is valid by Proposition 3.4, and assumption
(4) is evident. So Theorem 4 is a consequence of Theorem 3.11.

Proof (of Theorem 5) Once again, we apply Theorem 3.11 to
A = B = Sh(X), A′ = B ′ = C(X), and (F, G) = (P ⊗ · , Hom(P, ·)),
for any constructible sheaf P on X. To check that the assumptions of
Theorem 3.11 are valid, it remains to show that Extq (P, Q) is constructible
if both P and Q are constructible. By Proposition 3.10, it suffices to check
this for P = j! L where L is locally constant on U and j : U → X denotes the
inclusion. But Extq (j! L, Q) = Rq j∗ Hom(L, j ∗ Q) which is constructible by
Proposition 3.4. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.

Proof (of Proposition 3.10) Let F be a weakly constructible sheaf on
a quasi-projective variety X. Let dim.supp.F = d. We will first find Zariski
open V ⊂ U ⊂ X, a locally constant sheaf L on U , and an isomorphism of
F |U with a direct summand of L/L[V ] (see 3.1 and 3.9 for notation).
Let Z1 be the support of F . Let Z2 be the union of all the d-dimensional
irreducible components of Z1 . Let Z3 be the largest Zariski open subset
of Z2 so that F |Z3 is locally constant. Let U ′ ⊂ X be an affine open
subset so that U ′ ∩ Z1 = U ′ ∩ Z3 and U ′ ∩ Z3 is Zariski dense in Z3 .
Choose a finite surjective morphism U ′ ∩ Z1 → Ad and extend it to a
morphism h′ : U ′ → Ad . Let W ⊂ Ad be non-empty Zariski open. Put
−1
U = h′ W , Z = U ∩ Z1 and V = U − Z. Denote the restriction of h′
to U by h : U → W . Put f = h|Z : Z → W . The sheaf G = F |Z is
locally constant by assumption. The W is chosen so that f : Z → W is an
etale morphism (note that f is already assumed to be a finite morphism);
this ensures that f∗ G is locally constant. It follows that L = h∗ f∗ G is
also a locally constant sheaf. Note that f ∗ f∗ G = L|Z has G as a direct
summand because f is etale. Denoting by i : Z → U the inclusion, we see
that i∗ G = F |U is a direct summand of i∗ (L|Z) = L/L[V ].
From the above, we see that F [U ] is a direct summand of an elementary sheaf. Put QF = F/F [U ]. Because dim.supp.QF < d, induction on
dim.supp.F proves the proposition with the length of the desired filtration
bounded above by 1+dim.supp.F , when X is quasi-projective. In the general case, one proceeds by Noetherian induction, replacing the hypothesis
“ U ′ ∩ Z3 is Zariski dense in Z3 ” by “ U ′ ∩ Z3 is non-empty”.
