Abstract. The minimal spanning forest on Zd is known to consist of a single tree for
d ≤ 2 and is conjectured to consist of infinitely many trees for large d. In this paper, we
d−2
prove that there is a single tree for quasi-planar graphs such as Z2 × {0, . . . , k} . Our
method relies on generalizations of the “Gluing Lemma” of [DST15a]. A related result is
that critical Bernoulli percolation on a slab satisfies the box-crossing property. Its proof
is based on a new Russo-Seymour-Welsh type theorem for quasi-planar graphs. Thus, at
criticality, the probability of an open path from 0 of diameter n decays polynomially in
n. This strengthens the result of [DST15a], where the absence of an infinite cluster at
criticality was first established.

1. Introduction
There are two standard models of random spanning trees on finite graphs: the uniform
spanning tree and the minimal spanning tree. One can define these, by taking a limit, on
infinite graphs, such as Zd with nearest-neighbor edges, but then the single finite spanning
tree may become a forest of many disjoint trees. Because the uniform spanning tree is
closely related to random walks and potential theory ([Wil96], see also [BLPS01]), it is
known [Pem91] that the critical dimension is exactly dc = 4, only above which is there
more than a single tree.
In the case of the minimal spanning tree, where random walks and potential theory are
replaced by invasion percolation and critical Bernoulli percolation, very little is known
rigorously. As we will discuss in more detail below, it is known that there is a single
tree in Z2 ([CCN85], see also [AM94]) and there are conjectures that for large d there
are infinitely many trees. The main purpose of this paper is to make progress toward a
proof that at least for some low dimensions above d = 2, there is a single tree by showing
that this is the case for the approximation of, say, Z3 by a thick slab Z2 × {0, . . . , k}.
In the process, we also obtain a new result for critical percolation on such slabs, where
it was only recently proved that there is no infinite cluster [DST15a]; the new result is
inverse power law decay for the probability of large diameter finite clusters at criticality
(see Corollary 3.2 in Section 3).
Date: August 16, 2018.
Bibliographic note: After the current paper was finished, we learned that an alternate proof of the
lower bound in the box-crossing property of Theorem 3.1 (existence of open crossings in long rectangles
with positive probability) was obtained independently in the very recent paper [BS15], using a different
argument.

To define the minimal spanning tree (MST) on a finite connected graph G = (V, E),
assign random weights {ω (e) : e ∈ E}, that are i.i.d. uniform [0, 1] random variables, to
its edges. The MST is the spanning tree that minimizes the total weight. Equivalently,
it can be obtained from G by deleting every edge whose weight is maximal in some cycle.
When G is an infinite graph, two natural infinite volume limits can be taken, which lead to
the notion of free and wired minimal spanning forests. See [Ale95], [Häg95] and [LPS06]
for basic properties of minimal spanning forests on infinite graphs.
On Zd , it is known that the free and wired minimal spanning forests coincide (see
Proposition 2.2). Therefore, in this framework, we can talk about the minimal spanning
forest without ambiguity. Although it arises as the weak limit of minimal spanning trees
on finite graphs, the minimal spanning forest may no longer be a single tree, and can
even have infinitely many components. A natural question is, for which d is the minimal
spanning forest in Zd almost surely a single tree? This question is largely open except for
d = 2 (and trivially for d = 1), where the minimal spanning forest is known to be a single
tree ([CCN85], [AM94]); the argument there crucially relies on the planarity, and does
not apply to d ≥ 3. A much more modest question, whether the number of components in
minimal spanning forest in Zd is either 1 or ∞ almost surely, also remains open. Besides
its own interest, the number of connected components of minimal spanning forests is also
closely related to the ground state structure of nearest-neighbor spin glasses and other
disordered Ising models [NS96]. It is believed that there is a finite upper critical dimension
dc , below which the minimal spanning forest is a single tree a.s., and above which it
has infinitely many components a.s. Based on a combination of rigorous and heuristic
arguments, there have been interesting competing conjectures that dc = 8 [NS96] (see also
[NS94]) or dc = 6 [Jac10]. But it has not even been proved that there are multiple trees
for very large d.
Another natural random forest measure on infinite graphs is the uniform spanning forest, defined as the weak limit of uniform spanning trees on finite subgraphs. As mentioned
earlier, the geometry of uniform spanning forests is much better understood, because of
the connections to random walks and potential theory ([Wil96], see also [BLPS01]). Its
upper critical dimension is thus closely related to the intersection probability of random
walks. It was shown in [Pem91] that here dc = 4.
Minimal spanning forests are closely related to critical Bernoulli percolation and invasion percolation. Just as (wired) uniform spanning forests can be constructed by piecing
together loop erased random walks by Wilson’s algorithm [Wil96], (wired) minimal spanning forests can be constructed using invasion trees (see Proposition 2.3 below). On
the two dimensional triangular lattice, Garban, Pete and Schramm [GPS14] proved that
the minimal spanning tree on this graph has a scaling limit, based on fine knowledge of
near-critical Bernoulli percolation.
In this paper, we study the minimal spanning forests on a class of non-planar infinite
graphs, namely two dimensional slabs, whose vertex set is of the form Z2 × {0, ..., k}d−2 ,
for k ∈ N. Although d > 2 can be arbitrary here, these graphs are all quasi-planar.

CRITICAL PERCOLATION AND THE MINIMAL SPANNING TREE IN SLABS

A main result of this paper is Theorem 2.4, which states that on any two dimensional
slab, the minimal spanning forest is a single tree a.s. The argument also applies to other
quasi-planar graphs, such as Z2 with non-nearest neighbor edges up to a finite distance
— see the remark after Theorem 2.4.
An important ingredient in the proof is the box-crossing property for critical Bernoulli
percolation on slabs, stated as Theorem 3.1. Its proof is based on a Russo-SeymourWelsh type theorem, and extends to a larger class of models — e.g., Bernoulli percolation
on quasi-planar graphs invariant under a non trivial rotation, or short-range Bernoulli
percolation on Z2 invariant under π/2-rotations.
Because of the relation between the minimal spanning forest and critical Bernoulli
percolation, it is not surprising that we adapt tools from the percolation literature. Indeed,
a major open question in Bernoulli percolation is to prove in Zd , 3 ≤ d ≤ 6, that there is
no percolation at the critical point. Although this question is still beyond reach, it was
recently proved in [DST15a] that non-percolation at criticality is valid for two-dimensional
slabs. A key technical ingredient in that proof is a gluing lemma for open paths (see
Theorem 3.7 below for a more general version). In this paper we use a related gluing
lemma (Lemma 4.1) that applies to invasion trees and minimal spanning trees.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we collect definitions and basic properties for minimal spanning forests and invasion percolation, describe their connections,
state the main result (Theorem 2.4) for minimal spanning forests on slabs and sketch
our proof. Section 3 is devoted to the proof of Russo-Seymour-Welsh type box-crossing
theorems on slabs, which are used in our argument and are also of interest in their own
right (see especially Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.2). Finally, in Section 4, we collect all
the ingredients to prove our gluing lemma for invasion clusters, and thus conclude the
proof of Theorem 2.4. We note that one ingredient, Lemma 4.2, is an extension of the
combinatorial lemma of [DST15a]. The extension is needed for the invasion setting where
continuous edge variables replace Bernoulli ones.
2. Background and First Main Result
2.1. Minimal Spanning Forests. Let G = (V, E) be a finite graph. A subgraph H
of G is spanning if H contains all vertices of G. A labeling is an injective function
ω : E → [0, 1]. The number ωe =ω
˙ (e) will be referred to as the label of e. Note that the
labeling induces a total ordering on E, where e ≺ e0 if ω (e) < ω (e0 ).
Define T ω to be a spanning subgraph of G whose edge set consists of all e ∈ E whose
endpoints cannot be joined by a path whose edges are all strictly smaller than e. It is easy
to see that T ω is a spanning tree, and in fact, among all spanning trees T , T ω minimizes
P
e∈T ω (e) ([LPS06]).
Definition 2.1. When {ω (e) : e ∈ E} are i.i.d. uniform [0, 1] random variables, the law
of the corresponding spanning tree T ω is called the minimal spanning tree (MST). The
law of T ω defines a probability measure on 2E (where we identify the tree T ω with its set
of edges).

When passing to infinite graphs, two natural definitions of minimal spanning forests
can be made, that arise as weak limits of minimal spanning trees on finite graphs.
Let G = (V, E) be an infinite graph, and ω : E → [0, 1] be a labeling function. Let Ffω
be the set of edges e ∈ E, such that in every path in G connecting the endpoints of e,
there is at least one edge e0 with ω (e0 ) > ω (e). When {ω (e) : e ∈ E} are i.i.d. uniform
[0, 1] random variables, the law of Ffω is called the free minimal spanning forest (FMSF)
on G.
An extended path joining two vertices a, b ∈ V is either a simple path in G joining
them, or the disjoint union of two simple semi-infinite paths, starting at a, b respectively.
Let Fwω be the set of edges e ∈ E, such that in every extended path in G connecting
the endpoints of e, there is at least one edge e0 with ω (e0 ) > ω (e). Analogously, when
{ω (e) : e ∈ E} are i.i.d. uniform [0, 1] random variables, the law of Fwω is called the wired
minimal spanning forest (WMSF) on G.
It is clear that Ffω and Fwω are indeed forests. In addition, all the connected components
in Ffω and Fwω are infinite. In fact, the smallest label edge joining any finite vertex set to
its complement belongs to both forests.
We now describe how Ffω and Fwω arise as weak limits of minimal spanning trees on
finite graphs. Consider an increasing sequence of finite, connected induced subgraphs
Gn ⊂ G, such that ∪n≥1 Gn = G. For n ∈ N, let Gw
n be the graph obtained from G by
identifying the vertices in G\Gn to a single vertex.
ω

Proposition 2.1 ([Ale95][LPS06]). Let Tnω , T n denote the minimal spanning tree on Gn
and Gw
n , respectively, that are induced by the labeling ω. Then for any labeling function
ω,
ω
Ffω = n→∞
lim Tnω , and Fwω = n→∞
lim T n .
This means for every e ∈ Ffω , we have e ∈ Tnω for all sufficiently large n, and similarly
for Fwω .

One natural question on a given connected graph is whether the free and wired minimal
spanning forests coincide. To answer this question, we need to explain the relation to
critical Bernoulli percolation.
Proposition 2.2 ([LPS06],[Ale95]). On any connected graph G, we have Ffω = Fwω if and
only if for almost every p ∈ (0, 1), Bernoulli percolation on G with parameter p has at
most one infinite cluster a.s.
Let [k] := {0, ..., k} and Sk := Z2 × [k] be the slab of thickness k. It follows from
[AKN87] and [BK89] that the infinite cluster on Sk , if it exists, is a.s. unique. Therefore
on Sk , WMSF and FMSF coincide. This justifies referring to the minimal spanning forest
on Sk without ambiguity.
2.2. Invasion Percolation. We now define invasion percolation, an object closely related
to WMSF and critical Bernoulli percolation. Let {ω(e) : e ∈ E} be i.i.d. uniform [0, 1]
random variables. The invasion cluster Iv of a vertex v is defined as a union of subgraphs

CRITICAL PERCOLATION AND THE MINIMAL SPANNING TREE IN SLABS

Iv (k), where Iv (0) = {v}, and Iv (k + 1) is Iv (k) together with the lowest labeled edge
(and its vertices) not in Iv (k) but incident to some vertex in Iv (k).
We also define the invasion tree, Tv of a vertex v, as the increasing union of trees Tv (k),
where Tv (0) = {v}, and Tv (k + 1) is Tv (k) together with the lowest edge (and its vertices)
joining Tv (k) to a vertex not in Tv (k). Notice that Iv has the same vertices as Tv , but
may have additional edges.
The following proposition in [LPS06] (see also [NS96]) describes the relation between
invasion trees and WMSF.
Proposition 2.3. Let G = (V, E) be a locally finite graph. Then
Fwω = ∪v∈V Tv

a.s.

Therefore, to show Fwω is a single tree, it suffices to prove for any v ∈ V , I0 ∩ Iv 6= ∅.
We now describe the connection between invasion percolation and critical Bernoulli
percolation. An edge e ∈ E is said to be p-open if its weight satisfies ω(e) < p. The
connected components of the graph induced by the p-open edges are called p-open clusters.
Notice that the set of p-open edges is a Bernoulli bond percolation process on G with edge
density p.
Let pc (G) be the critical probability for Bernoulli bond percolation on G. For any
p > pc (G), there exists almost surely an infinite p-open cluster. Suppose that for some k,
Iv (k) contains a vertex of this cluster. Then all edges invaded after time k remain in this
cluster.
To make another observation, denote by Cpc (v) the pc -open cluster of a vertex v ∈ G,
and write θv (pc ) for the probability that Cpc (v) is infinite. If θv (pc ) = 0, then of course
the pc -open cluster Cpc (v) is finite a.s. This implies that once v is reached by an invasion,
then (with probability 1) all edges in Cpc (v) will be invaded before any edges with label
≥ pc are invaded. In particular, when θv (pc ) = 0, the pc -cluster of v satisfies Cpc (v) ⊂ Iv .
2.3. Notation, conventions. We consider the space of configurations (Ω, F, P), where
Ω = [0, 1]E (E denotes the edge set of the slab Sk , given by the pairs of points at Euclidean
distance 1 from each other), F is the Borel σ-field on Ω, and P is the underlying (product
of uniforms) probability measure. Given the labelling function ω ∈ Ω, and S ⊂ E, we use
ω|S to denote the restriction of ω to S.
Given a, b ∈ Z, a < b, let [a, b] = {a, a + 1, ..., b}, and we simply denote by [k] the
set [0, k]. For any subset S ⊂ Z2 , we denote by S the set S × [k] ⊂ Sk , for z ∈ Z2 ,
we denote by z the set {z} × [k], and for S ⊂ Sk , we denote by S the set π(S) × [k],
where π(S) is the projection of S onto Z2 . For x ∈ Sk and U, V ⊂ Sk , we denote by |x|
the Euclidean norm of x, and dist(U, V )=
˙ minu∈U,v∈V |u − v|. For x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ), y =
(y1 , y2 , y3 ) ∈ Sk and U, V ⊂ Sk , we define dist∗ (x, y) = max{|x1 − x2 |, |y1 − y2 |}, and
dist∗ (U, V ) = minx∈U,y∈V dist∗ (x, y). The vertex-boundary of a set U ⊂ Sk is denoted by
∂U (it is defined as the set of vertices in U with a neighbor in Sk \ U ). Given m > n > 0,
define Bn (x) = x + [−n, n]2 and An,m (x) = Bm (x)\Bn (x). When x is the origin, we will

6

omit the dependence on x. If z ∈ Sk , we write Bn (z) for the ball Bn (π(z)), where π(z) is
the projection of z onto Z2 .
2.4. Single Tree Result.
Theorem 2.4. For any k ∈ N, the minimal spanning forest on Sk is a single tree a.s.
Remark. As we will see from the proof below, the same argument applies to Z2 × F ,
where F is any finite connected graph. This includes F = {0, ..., k}d−2 , for d ≥ 3.
Similar arguments also apply to the finite range extensions Z2K = (Z2 , EK ) of Z2 , where
EK = {(x, y) : |x − y| ≤ K}.
A sketch of the proof is as follows; the complete proof is in Sections 3 and 4 below. By
Proposition 2.3, it suffices to prove that for any x ∈ Sk , I0 ∩ Ix 6= ∅. This is shown in two
steps.
1. We first prove that with bounded away from zero probability, there is a pc -open
circuit in the annulus An,2n . This follows from the box-crossing property for critical
Bernoulli percolation on Sk which we will prove in Section 3 — see Theorem 3.1. The
proof uses a new Russo-Seymour-Welsh type theorem, based on gluing lemmas given in
Section 3 below (like those first established in [DST15a]).
2. It follows from Step 1 that infinitely many disjoint pc -open circuits in Sk “surround”
the origin. In particular, the projections of I0 and Ix on Z2 intersect the projections of pc open circuits infinitely many times. In Section 4, we prove a version of the gluing lemma
adapted to invasion clusters, which says, roughly speaking, that each time the invasion
cluster I0 crosses an annulus An,2n , it “glues” to a pc -open circuit Cn in this annulus with
probability larger than a constant c > 0 (independent of n). The same argument applies
to the invasion cluster Ix . Therefore, with probability 1, I0 and Ix eventually are glued
to the same pc -open circuit, which implies that I0 ∩ Ix 6= ∅.
3. RSW Theory and Power Law Decay on Slabs
In this section, we consider Bernoulli bond percolation with density p on the slab Sk :
each edge is declared independently open with probability p and closed otherwise. Write
Pp for the resulting probability measure on the configuration space {0, 1}E . Let R =
[x, x0 ] × [y, y 0 ] be a rectangle in Sk . We say that R is crossed horizontally if there exists
an open path from {x} × [y, y 0 ] to {x0 } × [y, y 0 ] inside R. We denote this event by H(R).
For m, n ≥ 1, we define for p ∈ [0, 1],
î

f (m, n) = fp (m, n) := Pp H [0, m] × [0, n] .
In this section, we prove the following result, that the box-crossing property holds for
critical Bernoulli percolation on the slab Sk , for every fixed k ≥ 1.

Theorem 3.1 (Box-crossing property). Let p = pc (Sk ). For every ρ > 0, there exists a
constant cρ such that for every n ≥ 1/ρ,
cρ ≤ f (n, bρnc) ≤ 1 − cρ .
Remark. In our proof, the bound cρ we obtain depends on the thickness k of the slab.
Due to our use of the gluing lemma, the bounds we obtain get worse when the thickness
of the slab increases. More precisely, for fixed ρ > 0 and for the slab with thickness k, our
proof provides us with a constant cρ = cρ (k), and the sequence (cρ (k)) converges quickly
to 0 as the thickness k tends to infinity. Getting better bounds would be very interesting
to help understand critical behavior on Z3 (which corresponds to k = ∞).
The box-crossing property was established by Kesten (see [Kes82]) for critical Bernoulli
percolation on two dimensional lattices under a symmetry assumption. The proof relies
on a result of Russo, Seymour and Welsh ([Rus78, SW78]) which relates crossing probabilities for rectangles with different aspect ratios. Recently, the box-crossing property has
been extended to planar percolation processes with spatial dependencies, e.g. continuum
percolation [Tas15, ATT] or the random-cluster model [DST15b].
The box-crossing property has been instrumental in many works on Bernoulli percolation, and has numerous applications. These include Kesten’s scaling relations [Kes87],
bounds on critical exponents (e.g. polynomial bounds on the one arm event), computation
of universal exponents and tightness arguments in the study of the scaling limit [Smi01],
to name a few. We expect that similar results can be derived from the box-crossing property of Theorem 3.1. Next, we state some direct useful consequences of the box-crossing
property (these are proved in Section 3.8).
Corollary 3.2. For critical Bernoulli percolation on the slab Sk , we have:
1. [Existence of circuits with positive probability] There exists c > 0 such that for every
n ≥ 1,
Pp [there exists an open circuit in An,2n surrounding Bn ] ≥ c.
2. [Existence of blocking surfaces with positive probability] There exists c > 0 such that
for every n ≥ 1,
Pp [there exists an open path from Bn to ∂B 2n ] ≤ 1 − c.
3. [Polynomial decay of the 1-arm event] There exists δ > 0, such that for n > m ≥ 1,
Pp [there exists an open path from B m to ∂B n ] ≤ (m/n)δ .
Remarks.
1. Item 2 can be interpreted geometrically via duality: there is no open path from B n to
∂B 2n if and only if there exists a blocking closed surface in the annulus An,2n , made up
of the plaquettes in the dual lattice perpendicular to the closed edges in Sk . Therefore,

8

CHARLES M. NEWMAN, VINCENT TASSION, AND WEI WU

Item 2 can be understood as the existence with probability at least c of such a blocking
surface in the annulus An,2n .
2. Item 3 implies in particular that critical percolation on the slab Sk does not have an
infinite cluster. It strengthens the previous result of [DST15a]. Moreover, our proof
leads to the bound δ ≥ C −k for some C < ∞. Strengthening the lower bound of δ(k)
would also be very interesting.
Planar geometry is a key ingredient for the proofs of the existing box-crossing results
on planar graphs. In the case of non-planar graphs, one side of the inequality can still
be proved by standard renormalization arguments. Namely, the crossing probability of
the short side of the rectangle is bounded from below. This is sketched as Lemma 3.12 in
Section 3.4. The more difficult part is to carry out a renormalization argument to prove
the crossing probability of the long side is bounded from above (this is done in Lemma
3.11), and to relate the crossing probability of the long side to that of the short side (done
in Section 3.5). This is where the quasi-planarity of the slabs comes into play. For planar
graphs such relations can be obtained by repeated use of the Harris-FKG inequality and
one of its consequence known as the square root trick. For non-planar graphs, two paths
may not intersect even if their projections on the plane do intersect. In Sections 3.2 we
prove versions of gluing lemmas for open paths and circuits in Sk . In Section 3.3 we apply
the gluing lemmas to bound the crossing probability for rectangles with different aspect
ratio. Finally, we put these ingredients together and complete the proof of RSW type
theorems in Section 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.
3.1. Positive correlation and the square-root trick. In this section we recall the
Harris-FKG inequality about positive correlation of increasing events, and an important
consequence called the square-root trick. We refer to [Gri99] for more details. A percolation event A ⊂ {0, 1}E is said to be increasing if


∀e ∈ E, ω(e) ≤ η(e) 
It is decreasing if Ac is increasing.
Theorem 3.3 (Harris-FKG inequality). Let p ∈ [0, 1]. Let A, B be two increasing events
(or two decreasing events), then
Pp [A ∩ B] ≥ Pp [A] Pp [B] .
The following straightforward consequence, called the square-root trick, will be very
useful.
Corollary 3.4 (Square-root trick). Let A1 , . . . , Aj be j increasing events, then
max{Pp [A1 ] , . . . , Pp [Aj ]} ≥ 1 − (1 − Pp [A1 ∪ · · · ∪ Aj ])1/j .

3.2. Gluing Lemmas. Define H to be the set of continuous and strictly increasing functions h : [0, 1] → [0, 1]. Clearly, given h1 , h2 ∈ H, we have h1 h2 ∈ H, h−1
∈ H, and
1
−1
1 − h1 (1 − ·) ∈ H. We sometimes denote by h a function in H that may change from
line to line.
In order to state the gluing lemmas we need to fix an ordering ≺ on the vertices of
Sk . The choice of the ordering is flexible; ours is the following. Given x, y ∈ Sk , we write
x ≺ y iff
• |x| < |y|, or
• |x| = |y|, and there exists k such that xi = yi for i < k, and xk < yk .

We order directed edges and more generally, site self-avoiding paths of Sk by taking the
corresponding lexicographical order, as in Section 2.3 of [DST15a]. Let S be a connected
S
subset of Sk . For A, B, S ⊂ Sk , the event A ←→ B denotes the existence of a path of
open edges in S connecting A ∩ S to B ∩ S. If this event occurs, define ΓSmin (A, B) to
be the minimal (for the order defined above) open self-avoiding path in S from A to B.
Set ΓSmin (A, B) = ∅ if there is no open path from A to B in S. Note that ΓSmin (A, B) is
defined relative to a fixed S. Sometimes we will also use the definitions above with A and
B random sets (they may depend on the configuration ω).
We will repeatedly use the following combinatorial lemma stated in [DST15a].
Lemma 3.5. Let s, t > 0. Consider two events A and B and a map Φ from A into the
set P(B) of subevents of B. We assume that:

(1) for all ω ∈ A, |Φ(ω)| ≥ t,
(2) for all ω 0 ∈ B, there exists a set S with less than s edges such that {ω : ω 0 ∈
Φ(ω)} ⊂ {ω : ω|Sc = ω|0Sc }.

Then,

We now state two gluing lemmas for open paths crossing subsets of rectangular regions
of the form R × [k], with R a topological rectangle. The first, Theorem 3.6, has the
simplest geometry and will be proved as a consequence of essentially the same arguments
used for Theorem 3.7, which has a more complicated geometry.
As in [DST15a], the proof of these gluing lemmas uses local modifications of percolation
configurations, which rely on the following definition.
Definition 3.1. Define an integer r ≥ 3 such that for every s ≥ r and every z ∈
L=Z
˙ 2+ × [k] \ {(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, k)}, the following holds. For any three distinct neighbors
u, v, w of z, and any three distinct sites u0 , v 0 , w0 (that are also distinct from u, v, w) on
the boundary of Bs (z) ∩ L, there exist three disjoint self-avoiding paths in Bs (z) ∩ L\ {z}
connecting u to u0 , v to v 0 and w to w0 .
In the case of slabs with k ≥ 1, it suffices to take r = 3. We will present the proof with
general r, since that can be adapted to the more general quasi-planar graphs Z2 × F , with
F a finite connected graph.

1. We note that in the simpler case of the plane (when k = 0), the FKG inequality implies
that the left hand side of (1) is greater than or equal to

and thus (1) is valid with h0 (x) = x2 .
2. For better readability of the proof we have not presented Theorem 3.7 in the highest
level of generality. In particular the sets R and S in the statements of Theorem 3.6
and Theorem 3.7 do not need to be rectangles. The proof also applies if the sets R and
S are of the form T , where T ⊂ Z2 is a rectilinear domain such that ∂T is a simple
circuit made of vertical/horizontal segments of length at least r + 2, and such that any
two disjoint segments are at least sup-norm distance r + 2 apart from each other.
3. In the proof we will see that the function h0 ∈ H can be chosen in such a way that
h0 (x) ≥ c0 x, where c0 is a constant that depends only on ε and k. This remark will be
important in the proof of Theorem 3.10.
Proof of Theorem 3.7. The proof consists of two parts. In the first part, we prove that for
some δ > 0, there is an h1 : [0, 1] → [0, 1] that is continuous on [0, 1], strictly increasing on
[1 − δ, 1], and with h1 (1) = 1, such that (2) is valid with h0 replaced by h1 . In the second
part, we show that (2) is valid with h0 replaced by h2 (x) = c0 x, x ∈ [0, 1], for some c0 > 0
(which depends only on ε and k). Therefore one can take h0 (x) = max {h1 (x) , c0 x},

which is indeed in H. The proof of the first part is very similar to the argument in Section
2.3 of [DST15a], and we next outline those arguments, with details supplied to show that
h1 is continuous and strictly increasing.
For the proof below we will slightly abuse notation and use Bs (z) to denote Bs (z) ∩ S.
Following Section 2.3 of [DST15a], we define U (ω), ω ∈ [0, 1]Sk to be the set of vertices
z ∈ S such that
• z ∈ Γ, and
• Br+1 (z) is connected to C in R by an open path π, such that dist∗ (π, Γ) = r + 1.

We discuss two different cases below, depending on the cardinality of U (ω). We will
use the following two events:

such that for any ω 0 in the image of Φ, the cardinality of its pre-image is bounded by a

We define Φ(ω) by closing for every z ∈ U (ω), all the edges adjacent to a vertex in
Br (z) which are not in Γ. Observe that Φ(ω) cannot contain any open path from C to
N (Γ, r). Let |Br+1 | denote the number of edges in Br+1 . Lemma 3.5 can be applied with

and we can conclude the proof of Fact 1 with C1 = (2/ε)2|Br+1 | .

Pp [X ∩ {|U | > t}] ≤

We prove Fact 2 by constructing a map
Φ : X ∩ {|U | > t} → P(X 0 ),
such that for any ω 0 ∈ X 0 , the ω’s with ω 0 ∈ Φ(ω) agree on all but at most s specified
edges, with s a constant depending only on k.
The construction of Φ is similar to that in [DST15a], as we now describe. For any
z ∈ U (ω) that is not one of the eight corners of S, we will construct a new configuration

12

CHARLES M. NEWMAN, VINCENT TASSION, AND WEI WU

ω (z) and define Φ(ω) = {ω (z) : z ∈ U (ω), z is not a corner of S}. The new configuration
ω (z) is constructed by the following three steps.
(1) Define u0 , v 0 to be respectively the first and last vertices (when going from A to B)
of Γ(ω) which are in Br+1 (z). Choose w0 on the boundary of Br+1 (z), such that
there exists an open self-avoiding path π (which could be a singleton) from w0 to
C. By the definition of U (ω) and X , w0 is distinct from u0 , z and v 0 . Choose u, v, w
such that (z, u) , (z, v) and (z, w) are three distinct edges with v ≺ w. If z = u
or z is a neighbor of u, we simply take u = u0 , and if z = v, we take v = v 0 = z.
Otherwise, u, v, w are chosen to be distinct sites from u0 , v 0 , w0 . (Note that this is
possible because for z that is not a corner of S, the degree of z is at least 4. And
since A, B, C are at least distance r + 2 apart, at most one of u0 , v 0 , w0 can be a
neighbor of z).
(2) Close all edges of ω in Br+2 (z) except the edges of Br+2 (z)\Br+1 (z) which are in
Γ(ω) or π.
(3) Open the edges (z, u) , (z, v) , (z, w), together with three disjoint self-avoiding paths
γu , γv , γw inside Br+1 (z) connecting u to u0 , v to v 0 and w to w0 .
By construction, ω (z) ∈ X 0 . Now given ω 0 in the image of Φ, by the same argument
as in [DST15a], z is the only site in the new minimal path Γ(ω (z) ) (from A to B) that is
R
connected to C without using any edge in Γ(ω (z) ). Since C ←→
X
A, the path Γ(ω (z) ) agrees
with Γ(ω) up to u0 . Then, because v is minimal among u, v, w, x, Γ(ω (z) ) still goes through
v 0 , and then agrees with Γ(ω) from v 0 to the end. Therefore ω 0 = ω (z) for some z that can
be uniquely determined by ω 0 . Thus, the number of edges in {ω : such that ω 0 ∈ Φ(ω)}
that can vary is bounded by the number of edges in Br+2 (z). This shows that Φ satisfies
the conditions of Lemma 3.5, with s = |Br+2 |. This provesh Fact 2 with C2i = (2/ε)|Br+2 | .
R
To complete the first part of the proof, we set x = Pp C ←→ N (Γ, r) , and combine
Facts 1 and 2 to construct h1 . Notice that
Pp [X ] + Pp [X 0 ] = x,

(3)

and Fact 1 implies Pp [X ∩ {|U | ≤ t}] ≤ (C1 )t (1 − x). Together with Fact 2, this implies
that
x − (C1 )t (1 − x)
Pp [X 0 ] ≥
.
1 + C2 /(t − 8)

Setting t = log |log(1 − x)| in the equation above, one can easily construct δ > 0 and a
function h1 : [1 − δ, 1] → [0, 1] that is continuous, strictly increasing on [1 − δ, 1], with
h1 (1 − δ) = 0 and h1 (1) = 1. Set then h1 (x) = 0, for x < 1 − δ. This ends the first part
of the proof.
For the second part, we claim that for all x ∈ [0, 1], one can take h2 (x) = c0 x. Indeed,
we can construct a map Φ : X → P(X 0 ) by repeating the same construction as in the
proof of Fact 2 but without needing to consider the cardinality of U . Since for any ω 0 ∈ X 0 ,
the number of edges in {ω : ω 0 ∈ Φ(ω)} that can vary is bounded, this gives Pp [X ] ≤
C3 Pp [X 0 ]. Together with (3), we conclude that we can take h2 (x) = (1 + C3 )−1 x.

Proof of Theorem 3.6. Set Γ = ΓSmin (A, B). To see how the proof of Theorem 3.7 implies
Theorem 3.6, we first note that the assumption in Theorem 3.7 that the projections of
A, B, C on Z2 are at least sup-norm distance r + 1 apart is used to deal with the issue of
the r-neighborhood of Γ in (2). Indeed, as long as their projections on Z2 are disjoint, by
essentially the same proof as the one used for Theorem 3.7, we have

Finally we conclude with a last gluing lemma, that will allow us to glue together circuits.
As we will see in the proof, it will be easier to glue a circuit with a path than gluing two
paths. This is due to the fact that the local modification performed in this case does not
create a new circuit, and the reconstruction step is easier.
We now define a total ordering on circuits. The specific choice of the ordering is
not important, ours is the following. A circuit is basically a path (Γ(i))ri=1 in Sk , such
that Γ(1) = Γ(r), and (Γ(i))r−1
i=1 is a self avoiding path. Since we will identify circuits
that differ by cyclic permutations or reverse orderings of their indices, we will assume
that the representative self avoiding path (Γ(i))r−1
i=1 has Γ(1) ≺ Γ(i) for i > 1 and has
r1
2
Γ(2) ≺ Γ(r − 1). Given two circuits Γ = (Γ(i))i=1 , Γ0 = (Γ(i)0 )ri=1
in Aa,b that surround
2
the origin (i.e., their projections on Z have nonzero winding number around the origin),
we set Γ ≺ Γ0 by using the same lexicographical ordering as we defined before for selfavoiding paths.
The following statement will be used in the renormalization argument to prove Lemma
3.11.
Theorem 3.8. Fix ε > 0 and k ≥ 1. There exists h1 ∈ H such that for every p ∈ [ε, 1 − ε]
and n ≥ m ≥ 3,
h

Pp Γ1 ←→ Γ2 ≥ h1 (f (3n, 2m)a(m, n)2 ),
where R = [0, 3n] × [−m, m], Γ1 is the minimal open circuit in Am,n surrounding Bm
(Γ1 = ∅ if there is no such circuit), Γ2 is the minimal open circuit in Am,n ((3n, 0))
surrounding Bm ((3n, 0)), and a(m, n) denotes the probability under Pp that Γ1 exists and
is not empty.
Proof. We proceed in two steps. First, we prove

We finish the proof by using the FKG inequality, which implies

Pp Γ1 ←→ Γ2 ≥ f (3n, 2m)a(m, n)2 .
Let us begin with the proof for (5). Given a configuration ω, we define U (ω) as the set
of points z ∈ R such that
• z ∈ Γ1 (ω), and
• z is connected to Γ2 (ω) by a self-avoiding path γz in R.

Let x = f (3n, 2m)a(m, n)2 , then by the same argument as used for Fact 1 in the proof
of Theorem 3.7, we can show that there is some C1 < ∞, such that

ω ∈ {Γ1 ←→ Γ2 } is constructed as follows.
(1) Close all the edges in B1 (z) except those in Γ1 (ω) and γz .
(2) Let u ∈ z∩Γ1 (ω) and v ∈ z∩γz , such that no vertex (except u and v) in the vertical
segment between u and v belongs to Γ1 (ω) or γz . Then open all the vertical edges
between u and v.
Denote by ω (z) the resulting configuration. Observe that the local modification above
does not create any new circuit in Am,n . Otherwise, the new circuit would contain all
the vertical edges between u and v, which would imply some site on Γ1 (ω) is connected
R
(through γz (ω)) to Γ2 (ω), which contradicts ω ∈ {Γ1 ←→

Γ2 }. Therefore one can re(z)
construct ω by noting that u ∈ z is the only site on Γ1 (ω ) = Γ1 (ω) that connects to
Γ2 (ω (z) ) = Γ2 (ω) without using any other edges in Γ1 . Applying Lemma 3.5 leads to (8)
with C2 = (2/ε)|B1 | .
From (7) and (8) we can conclude (5) by using the same argument as in the proof of
Theorem 3.7.
Similarly, we can prove (6) by defining U (ω) as the set of points z ∈ R such that
• z ∈ Γ2 (ω), and
• z is connected to Γ1 (ω) by a self-avoiding path γz in R.

3.3. Crossing estimates. Let R = [u, v] × [w, t] be a rectangular region in Sk . Let L(R),
R(R), T(R) and B(R) be respectively the left, right, top and bottom sides of R.
The following proposition extends to slabs some standard estimates in planar percolation.
Proposition 3.9. Let r be as in Definition 3.1. Fix ε > 0 and k ≥ 1. There exists
h2 ∈ H such that for every p ∈ [ε, 1 − ε], for every κ > 0, j ≥ 2, and every n ≥ r + 2,
1. fp (n + jκn, n) ≥ hj−1

2. fp (n, n + κn) ≥ h2 (fp (n, n + jκn)),

where hj = h

Proof. Let us begin with Item 1. We only prove the j = 2 case,
fp (n + 2κn, n) ≥ h2 (fp (n + κn, n)).

(9)

The more general statement (in fact a stronger result) follows by induction. For simplicity
we assume that κn and n/2 are integers. Let R = [0, n + κn] × [0, n], S = [0, n]2 . and
X = [0, n/2] × {0}. Invariance under reflection and the square root trick imply

which gives exactly the statement of Eq. (9) with h2 = h0 ◦ h.
We now prove the second item. As we did for the first item we only prove
fp (n, n + κn) ≥ h2 (fp (n, n + 2κn)),
and the general statement follows by induction. Consider the event that there exists a
top-down open crossing in R0 . Then it is not hard to see that at least one of the following
three events must occur:
• The rectangular region [−κn, n] × [0, n] is crossed from top to bottom;
• the rectangular region R is crossed from top to bottom;
• the square region S is crossed from left to right.

The maximum probability of these three events is at least fp (n, n + κn), and the square
root trick (Corollary 3.4) then gives
fp (n, n + κn) ≥ 1 − (1 − Pp [U ])1/3 ≥ 1 − (1 − fp (n, n + 2κn))1/3 ,
where U denotes the union of the three events.



The next theorem allows us to create an open circuit in an annulus with positive
probability. Before stating the theorem, we note that by elementary arguments (e.g., by
bounding the expected number of open self-avoiding paths of length m starting from a
given vertex), it is easy to see that there is some ε > 0 (depending only on k) such that
supn≥2 (fε (2n, n − 1)) < 1/2.
Theorem 3.10. Let r ≥ 3 be as in Definition 3.1. Fix k ≥ 1, and ε > 0 such that
supn≥2 (fε (2n, n − 1)) < 1/2. For every c > 0, there exists λ = λ(c) ≥ 1 and c0 > 0 such
that the following holds. For every p ∈ [ε, 1 − ε] and every n ≥ 4r,
fp (2n, n − 1) ≥ c =⇒ Pp [Aλn,2λn ] ≥ c0 .
where A`,2` is the event that there exists inside A`,2` an open circuit surrounding B` .
Proof. Fix p ∈ [ε, 1 − ε], n ≥ 4r and assume that
fp (2n, n − 1) ≥ c.

(10)

We may also add the restriction that
fp (2n, n − 1) ≤ 1/2.

(11)

CRITICAL PERCOLATION AND THE MINIMAL SPANNING TREE IN SLABS

17

Indeed, if (11) does not hold, one can lower the value of p in such a way that both (10)
and (11) hold. The full conclusion then follows from the monotonicity of Pp [Aλn,2λn ] in p.

S20 =[−λn − n, λn + n] × [−λn − n, −λn) ∪ (λn, λn + n] × [−λn − n, λn + n].

as the images of S1 and S10 under the π-rotation around the origin.
Define then B(S1 ) = [−λn − n, −λn) × {−λn}, B(S10 ) = [−λn − n, −λn) × {−λn − n},
R(S1 ) = {λn} × (λn, λn + n], R(S10 ) = {λn + n} × (λn, λn + n],
and similarly, L(S2 ) = {−λn} × [−λn − n, −λn), L(S20 ) = {−λn − n} × [−λn − n, −λn),
T(S2 ) = (λn, λn + n] × {λn}, T(S20 ) = (λn, λn + n] × {λn + n}.
The general idea in the proof is to use that with positive probability there exists a unique
cluster crossing the L-shape S1 , and a unique cluster crossing S2 . Then we connect these
two clusters at two diffferent places in order to create an open circuit inside the annulus
Aλn,λn+n . These two connections will be obtained by two local modifications in the topright and bottom-left corners of the annulus Aλn,λn+n . The uniqueness of the two clusters

18

crossing S1 and S2 will be important to avoid that the two local modifications interact.
In other words, the uniqueness requirements will prevent the second local modification
from cutting the connection created by the first local modification.
We first claim that for every λ > 0 there exists a constant c1 = c1 (c) > 0, such that

used in the proof of Proposition 3.9, and for these gluing procedures we use Remark 3
after Theorem 3.7.
Fix λ > 0 large enough such that
2−λ ≤ c21 /4.

(13)

(The value of λ depends on c through the constant c1 but does not depend on n.)
Now, we need to make precise what we mean by a unique cluster crossing Si . For
i = 1, 2, let Ui be the event that there exists a unique cluster in the configuration restricted
to Si that intersects both ends of Si (i.e., the bottom and right ends of S1 or respectively
the left and top ends of S2 ). We define

E0 = {B(S10 ) ←→

E = E0 ∩ U 1 ∩ U 2 .
We wish to show that the event E occurs with probability larger than some some positive
constant. First, by the union bound we have
Pp [E] ≥ Pp [E0 ] − Pp [E0 \ U1 ] − Pp [E0 \ U2 ]
= Pp [E0 ] − 2Pp [E0 \ U1 ] .

• an open path from L(S2 ) to T(S2 ) inside S2 .

Using first independence and then the BK inequality (see [Gri99] for the definition of

will then finish the proof. To show this, we now perform a two step gluing procedure in
the square regions R1 =(λn,

λn + n]2 and R2 =[−λn

− n, −λn)2 to create an open circuit.
When E occurs, we denote by Γ1 the minimal open self-avoiding path from B(S1 ) to R(S10 )
inside
[−λn − n, λn + n] × (λn, λn + n] ∪ [−λn − n, −λn) × [−λn, λn + n].

where the configuration ω (z) is defined as follows. Given ω ∈ {Γ1 ←→

choose the minimal point z ∈ R1 such that
• z ∈ Γ1 (ω), and
• z is connected to L(S20 ) by an open self-avoiding path in S20 .

Then we construct the configuration ω (z) by the following three steps:
(1) Define u0 , v 0 to be respectively the first and last vertices (when going from B(S1 ) to
R(S10 )) of Γ1 (ω) which are in Br (z)∩R1 . Choose w0 on the boundary of Br (z)∩R1 ,
such that there exists an open self-avoiding path π from w0 to L(S20 ) inside S20 . The
points u0 , v 0 and w0 are all distinct, and by Definition 3.1, we can choose u, v, w
such that (z, u) , (z, v) and (z, w) are three distinct edges with v ≺ w.
(2) Close all the edges of ω in Br+1 (z)∩[λn, λn + n]2 except the edges of Br+1 (z)\Br (z)∩
[λn, λn + n]2 which are in Γ1 and π.
(3) Open the edges (z, u) , (z, v) , (z, w), together with three disjoint self-avoiding paths
γu , γv , γw inside Br (z) ∩ R1 connecting u to u0 , v to v 0 and w to w0 .

By construction, ω (z) ∈ {Γ1 ←→
L(S20 ), E}. The uniqueness of the cluster crossing S1
implies that the path Γ1 (ω (z) ) agrees with Γ1 (ω) from B(S1 ) to u0 , and we can reconstruct
the point z by noting that z is the only site in Γ1 (ω (z) ) that is connected to L(S20 ) without
using any edge in Γ1 (ω (z) ). Therefore Φ satisfies the conditions of Lemma 3.5, with
s = |Br+1 |. Applying Lemma 3.5 then yields (17).
We next move to the proof of (18). We define Γ2 as the minimal open crossing from
T(S2 ) to L(S20 ) in

[−λn − n, λn + n] × [−λn − n, −λn) ∪ (λn, λn + n] × [−λn − n, λn].

Let ω ∈ {Acλn,λn+n , Γ1 ←→
L(S20 ), E}. We choose a point z ∈ Γ2 (ω) which is connected
to R(S1 ) inside S10 . We construct the configuration ω (z) by essentially the same three
steps as we did in proving (17), the only difference is now we do local modifications in
Br+1 (z) ∩ [−λn − n, −λn]2 , and u0 , v 0 are defined respectively to be the first and last
vertices (when going from from T(S2 ) to L(S20 )) of Γ2 (ω) which are in Br (z) ∩ R2 , and w0
is connected by a self-avoiding path to R(S1 ) inside S10 .
To see that ω (z) ∈ Aλn,λn+n , we first note that the local modification above does not
change the ’unique clusters’ inside S1 and S2 (they are measurable with respect to the edge
variables in S1 and S2 ). Then, since ω ∈ Acλn,λn+n , the path Γ2 (ω) cannot be connected

S0

2
to R(S1 ). Otherwise, the fact that Γ1 ←→
L(S20 ) and the uniqueness of the cluster in S1
would imply the existence of a circuit in Aλn,λn+n . Therefore Γ2 (ω (z) ) agrees with Γ2 (ω)
up to u0 , and it must go through z and exit Br (z) through v 0 . Then it agrees with Γ2 (ω)
from v 0 to the end. Thus ω (z) ∈ Aλn,λn+n , and one can reconstruct the point z by noting
that z is the only site in Γ2 (ω (z) ) that is connected to R(S1 ) without using any edge in
Γ2 (ω (z) ). Therefore Φ satisfies the conditions of Lemma 3.5, with s = |Br+1 |. Applying
Lemma 3.5 then yields (18), and thus concludes the proof.

3.4. Renormalization inputs.
Lemma 3.11 (Finite criterion for θ(p) > 0). Fix k ≥ 0 and ε > 0 such that ε < pc (Sk ) <

Proof. Fix k ≥ 0 and ε > 0 as in the statement of the lemma. We first prove the following
claim, which isolates the renormalization argument we are using.

(19)

Proof of Claim. Fix p0 < 1 to be such that any 1-dependent bond percolation measure
on Z2 with marginals larger than p0 produces an infinite cluster. (This is well defined by
standard stochastic domination arguments [LSS97] or a Peierls argument [BBW05]). Let
G = (V, E) be the graph with vertex set V := 3nZ2 , and edge set E := {{v, w} : |v − w| =
3n}. It is a rescaled version of the standard two-dimensional grid Z2 .
We define a percolation process X on G follows. Consider a Bernoulli percolation
process with density p on the slab Sk . Let e = {u, v} ∈ E be a horizontal edge with
v = u + (3n, 0). Set X(e) = 1 if
• There exists an open circuit in Am,n (u) surrounding Bm (u), and an open circuit
in Am,n (v) surrounding Bm (v).
• the minimal open self-avoiding circuit inside Am,n (u) is connected to the minimal open self-avoiding circuit inside Am,n (v) by an open path that lies inside
u + ([0, 3n] × [−m, m]).

Set X(e) = 0 otherwise. Define X(e) analogously when e is a vertical edge.
By Theorem 3.8, the condition on the left hand side of (19) implies
Pp [X(e) = 1] ≥ h1 (fp (3n, 2m)Pp [Am,n ]2 ) ≥ h1 ((1 − η)3 ).

If we choose η small enough, the above probability is larger than p0 . Since the percolation
process X is 1-dependent, there exists with positive probability an infinite self avoiding
path
of edges e satisfying X(e) = 1. This implies that in the slab, we have
ï in G made

Pp 0 ←→
∞ > 0. This ends the proof of the claim.



We now prove the lemma. By Theorem 3.10 one can first choose two constants λ > 0
and c0 > 0 such that for every p ∈ [ε, 1 − ε] and every n ≥ 4r
fp (2n, n − 1) ≥ 1/4 =⇒ Pp [Aλn,2λn ] ≥ c0 .

(20)

Then we choose a constant ` < ∞ such that (1 − c0 )` < η. By Item 1 of Proposition 3.9,
we can finally choose c1 > 0 small enough such that
fp (2m, m − 1) > 1 − c1 =⇒ fp (2` λm, m − 1) ≥ 1 − η ≥ 1/4.

(21)

One can easily check that this choice of c1 > 0 concludes the proof. Assume that for
some m ≥ 4r, fp (2m, m − 1) > 1 − c1 . Eq. (21) and (20) give for every 0 ≤ i ≤ ` − 1,

Pp 0 ←→

Proof. This result is standard and can be proved in various ways. We present here a
renormalization argument of Kesten [Kes82]. Let n ≥ 1. If the rectangle [0, 2n] × [0, 4n]
is crossed horizontally, then both rectangles [0, n] × [0, 4n] and [n, 2n] × [0, 4n] must be
crossed horizontally. Using translation invariance and independence, we obtain
fp (2n, 4n) ≤ fp (n, 4n)2 .

(22)

Now consider the covering of [0, n] × [0, 4n] by the five n times 2n rectangles R1 , . . . , R5
illustrated on Fig. 2. If [0, n] × [0, 4n] is crossed horizontally then at least one of the five
rectangles R1 , . . . , R5 must be crossed in the easy direction. Using translation invariance
and the union bound, we find
fp (n, 4n) ≤ 5fp (n, 2n).
Together with Eq. (22) we obtain for every n ≥ 1,
fp (2n, 4n) ≤ 25fp (n, 2n)2 .

(23)

If fp (n0 , 2n0 ) < 1 for some n0 ≥ 1, Eq. (23) implies by induction that the sequence
fp (n, 2n) decays exponentially fast in n, which easily implies that the probability for 0 to

be connected to ∂Bn decays exponentially.
Lemma 3.13. For critical Bernoulli percolation on Sk (i.e., p = pc (Sk )) we have fp (2n, n−
1) ≤ 1 − c1 and fp (n, 2n) ≥ c2 for every n ≥ 4r.
Proof. Take ε > 0 such that pc ∈ (ε, 1 − ε). Consider the set
{p ∈ (ε, 1 − ε) : there exists n ≥ 4r s.t. fp (2n, n − 1) > 1 − c1 }. It is open and does not
intersect [0, pc (Sk )) (by Lemma 3.11). Thus, pc does not belong to this set, and therefore
fp (2n, n − 1) ≤ 1 − c1 for every n ≥ 4r and p ≤ pc . Similarly, the inequality fp (n, 2n) ≥ c2
at p = pc follows from Lemma 3.12.

All this section is devoted to the proof of this theorem. Under the assumption of the
theorem, we can choose a constant c0 > 0 such that for every n ≥ 1,
f (n, 2n) ≥ c0 .

(24)

We will use several gluing lemmas presented in Section 3.2. To this end, we fix a number
r ≥ 3 as in Definition 3.1. In the proof below we use various constants denoted cj , each
is independent of n.
Define S = [0, 7n] × [0, 8n], R = [−7n, 7n] × [0, 13n], X = {7n} × [0, 4n] and Y =
{7n} × [5n, 13n] (see Fig. 3 for an illustration). Let A be the event that there exist
• an open path in S from its left side to X and
• an open path in R from its bottom side to Y .

Lemma 3.15. Assume that Eq. (24) holds. Then there exists a constant c4 > 0 independent of n ≥ 4r such that

Proof. We will prove that there exist constants c1 , c3 > 0 such that

Lemma 3.15 then follows by the Harris-FKG inequality with c4 = c1 c3 .
By Eq. (24), we have f (7n, 14n) ≥ c0 . Therefore, by Item 2 of Proposition 3.9 (with
κ = 1/7 and j = 7), we have f (7n, 8n) ≥ h62 (c0 ) > 0. In other words, the rectangle

24

S is crossed horizontally by an open path with probability larger than h62 (c0 ). Using a
symmetry and the union bound, we obtain Eq. (25) with c1 = h62 (c0 )/2.
Let us now prove Eq. (26). Since f (14n, 28n) and f (13n, 26n) are at least c0 , Item 2 of
Proposition 3.9 implies
f (14n, 16n) ≥ h62 (c0 ) ≥ c2 , and
f (13n, 14n) ≥ h12
2 (c0 ) ≥ c2 ,

(27)
(28)

where c2 = min{h62 (c0 ), h12
2 (c0 )}. Consider the event that there exists inside
K = [−7n, 7n] × [−3n, 13n] an open path Π from L(K) to Y . Note that Y is the top half
of R(K). By (27) and a symmetry, this occurs with probability larger than c2 /2. When
the path Π exists, either it touches the bottom side of R, or it remains inside R. Hence,
by the union bound, at least one of the following two cases holds:
h

R

• Pp B(R) ←→ Y ≥ c2 /4;

• Pp L (R) ←→ Y ≥ c2 /4.

The first case gives exactly (26). In the second case we can conclude the proof by using
the Theorem 3.6 gluing lemma inside R. We would know that R is crossed from left to
right by an open path with probability larger than c2 /4, and from top to bottom with
probability larger than c2 (by Eq. (28)). Theorem 3.6 would then imply Eq. (26) with
c3 = h0 (c2 /4).

We now investigate a possible geometry of connecting paths when A occurs, which
will be used near the end of the proof of Theorem 3.14. Let γ be a deterministic path
from X to L(S) in S such that γ ∩ Y = ∅. Write γ 0 for the symmetric reflection of γ
through the plane {0} × R2 . Notice that the set γ ∪ γ 0 disconnects the top side T(R) of
R from its bottom side B(R), in the sense that any path from top to bottom in R must
intersect γ ∪ γ 0 . Let K0 (γ) be the connected component of T(R) in R \ γ ∪ γ 0 . Then, set
K(γ) = (K0 (γ) ∪ ∂K0 (γ)) \ N (γ, 3r), where we note that every edge in the boundary,
∂K0 (γ), of K0 (γ) is between a vertex in K0 (γ) and one in γ ∪ γ 0 . We recall that r is given
by Definition 3.1, and N (γ, 3r) is the set of vertices within sup-norm distance 3r of γ.
Define Cγ as the event that there exists an open path in K(γ) from Y to γ 0 . (See Fig. 4.)
Lemma 3.16. There exists c7 > 0 such that for every n ≥ 6r,

(P [Cγ ]) ≥ c4 /3 =⇒ f (14n, 13n) ≥ c7 .

Proof of Theorem 3.14. Assume that Eq. (24) holds. By Lemma 3.15 we have Pp [A] ≥ c4 .
Let Γ = ΓSmin (X, L(S)) be the minimal open path from X to L(S) inside S. (Recall that
A does not occur if there is no such path.) Let B1 be the event that there exists an open
path from Y to X inside R and B2 be the event that there exists an open path from Y
to N (Γ, 3r) inside R (see Fig. 5).
By the union bound, we have
c4 ≤ Pp [B1 ] + Pp [B2 ] + Pp [A ∩ B1c ∩ B2c ] .
At least one of the three terms on the right hand side must be larger than c4 /3, and we
distinguish between these three cases. The argument for the third case will use Lemma
3.16.
Case 1: Pp [B1 ] ≥ c4 /3.
Let Zi = {7n} × [in, (i + 1)n) for i ∈ N. Since X = Z0 ∪ · · · ∪ Z3 and Y = Z5 ∪ · · · ∪ Z12 ,

When A ∩ B1c ∩ B2c holds the open path from B(R) to Y must be at distance at least
3r + 1 from the minimal path Γ = ΓSmin (X, L(S)). Define C to be the set of vertices
that are either connected to X inside R or connected to a point z whose distance from Γ
satisfies dist∗ (z, Γ) ≤ 3r. Alternatively, the set C can be defined by the following two-step
exploration. First, explore all the open clusters touching X and notice that the minimal
path Γ is already determined after this first exploration. In a second step, explore the
open clusters of all the vertices in the 3r-neighborhood of Γ (that have not been explored
yet). We make two observations:
(a) If the event A∩B1c ∩B2c occurs, then there exists an open path from Y to B(R) and the
random set C does not intersect Y (otherwise B1 or B2 occurs). Therefore, the open
R\C

path from Y to B(R) must lie in R \ C . Therefore, the event Y ←→ B(R) occurs.
(b) If C is an admissible value for C , the event C = C is measurable with respect to the
status of the edges adjacent to the set C. In particular, the status of the edges in
R \ C is independent of the event C = C.

Summing over the admissible realizations for the pair (C , Γ) which allow the event
A ∩ B1c ∩ B2c to occur, we obtain

A = {1} × [y + n/2 + n, y + n/2 + c1 n] and B = {−1} × [y + n/2 + n, y + n/2 + c1 n].
The key feature of these subsets (see Fig. 6) is that the existence of an open circuit in
An,c1 n (z) with z = (0, y + n/2) surrounding Bn (z) implies that there is an open path from
A to B inside S.
Set Γ = ΓSmin (A, B). Using Equations (33) and (34), and an adaptation of the Theorem 3.6
gluing lemma (where S is replaced by R∗ = [−3c1 n, 3c1 n] × [−2c1 n, 3c1 n] \ ({0} × [y, ∞))
here), one has

Eqs. (35) and (36) together with Items 1 and 2 of Proposition 3.9 conclude the proof.
3.8. Proof of Corollary 3.2. The proofs of these items are standard. The first item
follows from the RSW theorem and Theorem 3.10. For the second item, note that crossing
the aspect ratio 2 annulus requires crossing an aspect ratio 4 rectangle, and then using
the square root trick and Theorem 3.1 completes the proof. For the third item, write

arm probability is bounded by the probability of all successes in log2 m
i.i.d. trials.
4. Proof of Theorem 2.4
Denote Ca,b (and Da,b ) the event that there exists a pc -open circuit (and pc -closed dual
surface, respectively) in B b \B a that surrounds the origin. By using Corollary 3.2, it is

easy to see that we can choose two alternating sequences {ni } , {mi }, such that for each
i, 2ni < mi < ni+1 , and
Ppc [Cni ,2ni ] ≥ c0 ,
Ppc [D2ni ,mi ] ≥ 1 − c0 /2.
We use the total order on circuits defined before the proof of Theorem 3.8. Given ω ∈

Cni ,2ni , we define Γmin (ω) to be the minimal pc -open circuit in B 2ni \B ni that surrounds
the origin. We will omit the superscript i when it is clear from the context.

4.1. Proof of Lemma 4.1. In order to prove Lemma 4.1, we start with the following
extension of the combinatorial Lemma 7 of [DST15a]. It concerns maps Φ on the edge
labels ω = {ω(e), e ∈ E} such that Φ decreases (respectively, increases) finitely many
ω(e)’s in an affine way in order to make those edges open (respectively, closed).

Lemma 4.2. Consider A, B ⊂ F, a, b ∈ (0, 1), and a measurable map Φ : A → B. If for
any ω 0 ∈ Φ (A), there exists S (ω 0 ) ⊂ E with less than or equal to s edges, such that

Roughly speaking, this lemma says that if one can obtain B by modifying a small
number of edges in A, in a way that given any element in B, the number of its pre-images
is bounded, then P [A] can be bounded from above by a constant times P [B].
Remarks.
1. An equivalent way of stating the hypotheses on Φ is that Φ leaves all but at most s
of the ω(e)’s unchanged, with the others either lowered (by ω(e) 7→ aω(e)), or raised
(by ω(e) 7→ b + (1 − b)ω(e)) and the set S of changed edges is uniquely determined by
ω 0 = Φ(ω).
2. In Lemma 4.2, all the edges in S have their edge labels either decreased or increased.
Although it is not needed in this paper, we note that the lemma can be extended to
allow for some of the edges in S to be unchanged.

Proof of Lemma 4.2. First observe that for any ω 0 ∈ Φ (A), Card(Φ−1 (ω 0 )) ≤ 2|S(ω )| ≤ 2s .
s
Therefore one can take a disjoint partition {Ai }2i=1 (some of which may be empty) of A,
such that Φ|Ai is a bijection. Indeed, there is an Li (ω) for ω ∈ Ai , such that

Then one can bound its Jacobian Ji (ω) from below by

Proof of Lemma 4.1. We now prove (39) by explicitly constructing a map Φ : (B0mi )c ∩
Bxmi ∩ YAi → B0mi ∩ Bxmi ∩ YAi that satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 4.2. The proof of
(40) follows from the same argument, and the proof of (41) will be described at the end
of this proof. Given ω ∈ (B0mi )c ∩ Bxmi ∩ Cni ,2ni ∩ D2ni ,mi with i > i0 , let R (ω) denote

32

CHARLES M. NEWMAN, VINCENT TASSION, AND WEI WU

the connected component containing 0 in {w ∈ Sk : dist (w, Γmin (ω)) ≥ 1}. In particular,
∂R ⊂ {w ∈ Sk : dist (w, Γmin (ω)) = 1}. Let τi = min {j : I0 [j] ∈ ∂R} and z(ω) = I0 [τi ]
be the first landing point of I0 on ∂R. By definition, there exists z 0 ∈ Γmin such that
Ä
ä
Ä
ä
dist z, z 0 = 1. If there exists more than one z 0 satisfy dist z, z 0 = 1, choose the minimal
one.
Recall that Cpc (Γmin (ω)) denotes the pc -open cluster containing Γmin (ω). Notice that
ω ∈ (B0mi )c implies
z (ω) ∈
/ Cpc (Γmin (ω)) .

(42)

Otherwise, by the observation in Section 2.2, we would have Γmin (ω) ⊂ I0mi (ω). To
complete the proof, we will use B1# (z) for z ∈ Sk to denote
#
z + {(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (−1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, −1, 0)}; as usual, B 1 (z) denotes the cylinder
#
in Sk generated by the five-point set B1# (z). There exists a self avoiding path Γz in B 1 (z 0 )
#
connecting z (ω) to Γmin (ω) without touching any other vertices in Γmin (ω) ∪ ∂B 1 (z 0 ).
In particular one can construct Γz by taking one edge from z to z 0 and then move in z 0
until reaching the first vertex in Γmin .
We now construct ω 0 = Φ (ω) as follows.
(1) Open all the edges in Γz (that is, take ω (e) 7→ pc ω (e)).
#
B 1 (z 0 ), then proceed
as follows; otherwise go to Step 3. Define
(2) If Ixmi touches
n
o
#
#
0
x
τi = min j : Ix [j] ∈ ∂B 1 (z ) and w = Ix [τi ] to be the first vertex in ∂B 1 (z 0 )
reached by the invasion cluster starting from x. If w ∈ Cpc (z), go to Step 3. If
#
w∈
/ Cpc (z), then there exists a self avoiding path Γw in B 1 (z 0 ) connecting w (ω)
#
to Γmin (ω) ∪ Γz without touching any other vertices in Γmin (ω) ∪ Γz ∪ ∂B 1 (z 0 ).
Open all the edges in Γw .
#
(3) Close all the edges in B 1 (z 0 ) (that is, map ω (e) 7→ b + (1 − b) ω (e) with b > pc )
except for the edges of Γmin (ω) ∪ Γz ∪ Γw .

By construction, ω 0 ∈ B0mi ∩ Bxmi ∩ YAi . To see this, note that when D2ni ,mi occurs, I0mi
(or Ixmi ) touching any vertex v ∈ B 2ni (0) implies it also contains all of Cpc (v). To apply
Lemma 4.2, we need to bound the number of pre-images of ω 0 by 2s for some s. For this,
we first note the important feature that
Γmin (ω 0 ) = Γmin (ω) .

(43)

This will help show that the set S of changed edges is uniquely determined by ω 0 .
Indeed, the construction will not create any new pc -open circuits. If the construction
skips Step 2, then any new pc -open circuit would contain a subset of Γz , and then it
would contain all of Γz because of Step 3. Therefore if the construction created some
new pc -open circuit, we would have z (ω) ∈ Cpc (Γmin (ω)), which would contradict (42).
If the construction uses Step 2, by the same argument, we would have either z (ω) ∈
Cpc (Γmin (ω)), or w (ω) ∈ Cpc (Γmin (ω)), or w (ω) ∈ Cpc (z (ω)), any of which would lead to
a contradiction.
Now, given ω 0 = Φ(ω), one can determine S(ω) = S(ω 0 ) as follows.

CRITICAL PERCOLATION AND THE MINIMAL SPANNING TREE IN SLABS

(1) Thanks to (43), R(ω 0 ) = R (ω), and ω|R(ω) = ω 0 |R(ω0 ) (where ω|R here means the
set of edge labels with both vertices in R). This implies z (ω) = z (ω 0 ). Therefore
one can explore I0mi (ω 0 ) until it contains z, without any change from I0mi (ω).
(2) z 0 (ω 0 ) = z 0 (ω). In fact, z 0 ∈ Γmin (ω 0 ) = Γmin (ω) is uniquely characterized by
Ä
ä
dist z, z 0 = 1 and the minimality of z 0 .
#

(3) Taking S (ω 0 ) = B 1 (z 0 ) \ Γmin (ω 0 ), we see that ω|S c = ω 0 |S c , and that the map Φ
#
satisfies the conditions of Lemma 4.2 with s equal to the number of edges in B 1 .
Applying Lemma 4.2 we obtain that

constructing ω 0 ). Lemma 4.2 then implies
