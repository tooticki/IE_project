COMMUTATORS OF TRACE ZERO MATRICES OVER
PRINCIPAL IDEAL RINGS
ALEXANDER STASINSKI
Abstract. We prove that for every trace zero square matrix A of size at least
3 over a principal ideal ring R, there exist trace zero matrices X, Y over R such
that XY − Y X = A. Moreover, we show that X can be taken to be regular
mod every maximal ideal of R. This strengthens our earlier result that A is
a commutator of two matrices (not necessarily of trace zero), and in addition,
the present proof is simpler than the earlier one.
Shalev has conjectured an analogous statement for group commutators in
SLn over p-adic integers. We prove Shalev’s conjecture for n = 2.

1. Introduction
Let R be a principal ideal ring, which we will always take to be commutative
with identity (e.g., R could be a field). We let gln (R) denote the Lie algebra of
n × n matrices over R with Lie bracket [X, Y ] = XY − Y X, and sln (R) the sub
Lie algebra of trace zero matrices. In case R = K is a field, a theorem of Albert
and Muckenhoupt [1] says that every A ∈ sln (K) is a commutator in gln (K), that
is, there exist X, Y ∈ gln (K) such that [X, Y ] = A. To go beyond the field case
requires new ideas and the first major step was taken by Laffey and Reams [4] who
proved the analogous result for R = Z, solving a problem posed by Vaserstein [11,
Section 5]. Whether every element in sln (R) is a commutator in gln (R) for a PIR
R, was an open problem going back implicitly at least to Lissner [5], and was settled
in the affirmative in [9].
In light of the above results, a natural question is whether X and Y can be taken
in sln (R), rather than just gln (R). When R = K is a field, it is known by work of
Thompson [10, Theorems 1-4] that any A ∈ sln (K) can be written as A = [X, Y ]
for some X, Y ∈ sln (K), except when char K = 2 and n = 2. A generalisation of
Thompson’s result, allowing X and Y to lie in an arbitrary hyperplane in gln (K)
(but assuming n > 2 and |K| > 3), was recently obtained by de Seguins Pazzis [6].
On the other hand, it does not seem possible to modify our proof in [9] to yield the
stronger assertion that every A ∈ sln (R), with n ≥ 3, is a commutator of matrices
in sln (R), even in the case where R is a field.
The main result of the present paper is that for any principal ideal domain
(henceforth PID) R and A ∈ sln (R), with n ≥ 3, there exist X, Y ∈ sln (R) such
that A = [X, Y ]. It is also easy to see that when 2 is invertible in R, the same
conclusion holds for A ∈ sl2 (R). Moreover, it follows from our proof that X can
be chosen to be regular mod every maximal ideal of R (this was stated as an open
problem in [9]). Our proof is significantly simpler than the proof of the main result

where x = (x1 , . . . , xn−1 )T ∈ Rn−1 and a ∈ R; see Section 3. These matrices have
some remarkable properties which let us carry through the proof. More precisely,
we show that for a given non-scalar A ∈ sln (R) in Laffey–Reams form (see [9,
Theorem 5.6]), we can find x and a such that
tr(X(x, a)r A) = 0,

for r = 1, . . . , n − 1,

and at the same time ensure that X(x, a) mod p is regular in gln (R/p), for every
maximal ideal p of R, as well as regular in sln (R/p), for any p for which A is nonscalar mod p. We note that the condition on the vanishing of traces above is rather
delicate, given that we also want X(x, a) to have the above regularity property and
trace zero, and depends on the existence of a solution of a system of polynomial
equations over R, which in most cases is hopelessly complicated. Nevertheless, for
the matrices X(x, a) the system of equations becomes atypically simple, and we
are able to show that a solution exists. We then use the well known local-global
principle for systems of linear equations over rings, applied to the system defined
by [X(x, a), Y ] = A, Y ∈ sln (R). Working over the localisation Rp at a maximal
ideal p of R, we use a variant of the criterion of Laffey and Reams (see Section 2,
Proposition 2.4) to show that the system has a solution if A is non-scalar mod p.
Here we use that A mod p is not merely regular in gln (R/p) but also regular in
sln (R/p). The existence of a solution over Rp when p is such that A mod p is scalar
is more subtle and requires a separate argument. The existence of a local solution
for every maximal ideal p then implies the existence of global solution, and since
any non-scalar matrix is GLn (R)-conjugate to one in Laffey-Reams form, our main
result follows (the case when A is scalar requires a separate discussion, but is easy).
Once the main result has been established for a PID, it is easy to deduce it for
an arbitrary principal ideal ring (not necessary and integral domain).
In [7, Conjecture 1.3] and [8, Conjecture 8.10] Shalev conjectured that if either
n ≥ 3 or n = 2 and p > 3, then any element in SLn (Zp ) is a commutator of
elements in SLn (Zp ) (here Zp denotes the p-adic integers). The main result of the
present paper, in the case where R = Zp , is therefore a Lie algebra analogue of this
conjecture. In [2] some results towards this conjecture were obtained. In Section 6
we give a proof of Shalev’s conjecture for n = 2.
We end this introduction with a word on notation. A ring (without further
specification) will mean a commutative ring with identity. Throughout, we will
use 1n to denote the identity matrix in gln (S), where S is a ring with identity. If
X ∈ gln (S), S[X] will denote the unital S-algebra generated by X.
2. The criterion of Laffey and Reams
In this section, K denotes an arbitrary field. We will prove an analogue of the
Laffey–Reams criterion (see [4, Section 3] and [9, Proposition 3.3]) for a matrix in

sln (R), R a local PID, to be a commutator of matrices in sln (R). This criterion
plays a key role in our proof of the main theorem.
We need a couple of remarks about regular elements in sln (K). It is well known
that an element X ∈ gln (K) is regular if and only if
Cgln (K) (X) = K[X],
that is, if and only if the centraliser of X in gln (K) has dimension n. In this
situation, we will say that X is gln (K)-regular. Similarly, if X ∈ sln (K) we define
X to be sln (K)-regular if
dim Csln (K) (X) = n − 1.
For X ∈ sln (K) it may happen that X is gln (K)-regular but not sln (K)-regular:
take for example ( 01 00 ) ∈ sln (F2 ).
The following result describes the precise relationship between the properties
sln -regular and gln -regular over a field.
Lemma 2.1. Let X ∈ sln (K). Then the following holds:
(i) If X is sln (K)-regular, then X is gln (K)-regular.
(ii) X is sln (K)-regular if and only if it is gln (K)-regular and tr(K[X]) 6= 0.
(iii) If char K does not divide n, then an element X is sln (K)-regular if and
only if it is gln (K)-regular.
Proof. For the first part, note that Csln (K) (X) is either equal to Cgln (K) (X) or
is a hypersurface in Cgln (K) (X), so Csln (K) (X) has codimension at most one in
Cgln (K) (X). Thus X being sln (K)-regular implies that dim Cgln (K) (X) ≤ n. But
it is well-known that the dimension of a centraliser in gln (K) is always at least n,
so X is gln (K)-regular.
For the second part, first note that Csln (K) (X) is the kernel of the trace map
tr : Cgln (K) (X) → K. Now, if X is sln (K)-regular, then by the previous part, X is
gln (K)-regular, so Cgln (K) (X) = K[X]. Thus dim Csln (K) (X) = n − 1 implies that
this trace map is surjective, that is, that tr(K[X]) 6= 0. Conversely, if X is gln (K)regular and tr(K[X]) 6= 0, then then dim Cgln (K) (X) = n and tr : Cgln (K) (X) → K
is surjective, so the kernel has dimension n − 1.
Finally, when char K does not divide n and X is gln (K)-regular, then tr(1n ) =
n 6= 0, so the previous part implies that X is sln (K)-regular.

Proposition 2.2. Let X ∈ sln (K) be sln (K)-regular and let A ∈ sln (K). Then
A = [X, Y ] for some Y ∈ sln (K) if and only if tr(X r A) = 0 for all r = 1, . . . , n − 1.
Proof. Since X is gln (K)-regular by Lemma 2.1, the set {1n , X, . . . , X n−1 } is linearly independent over K, so the subspace
V = {B ∈ sln (K) | tr(X r B) = 0 for r = 1, . . . , n − 1}
has dimension n2 − n. The kernel of the linear map sln (K) → sln (K), Y 7→ [X, Y ]
is equal to the centraliser Csln (K) (X), which has dimension n − 1 since X is sln (K)regular. Thus the image [X, sln (K)] of the map Y 7→ [X, Y ] has dimension n2 − n.
But if A ∈ [X, sln (K)], there exists a Y ∈ sln (K) such that for every r = 1, . . . , n−1
we have
tr(X r A) = tr(X r (XY − Y X)) = tr(X r+1 Y ) − tr(X r Y X) = 0.
Thus [X, sln (K)] ⊆ V . Since dim V = dim[X, sln (K)] we conclude that V =
[X, sln (K)].

If S is a ring, I ⊆ S an ideal and X ∈ gln (S), we denote by XI the image of X
under the canonical map gln (S) → gln (S/I).
Lemma 2.3. Let S be a local commutative ring (with identity) with maximal ideal
m. Let X ∈ sln (S) be such that Xm is sln (S/m)-regular. Then the canonical map
Csln (S) (X) −→ Csln (S/m) (Xm )
is surjective.
Proof. As Csln (S/m) (Xm ) has dimension n − 1 and is the kernel of the trace map
tr : Cgln (S/m) (Xm ) → S/m, this map must be surjective. Thus, there exists an
a ∈ Cgln (S/m) (Xm ) such that tr(a) = 1. Since Xm is sln (S/m)-regular, it is also
gln (S/m)-regular, so
Cgln (S/m) (Xm ) = (S/m)[Xp ].
Let â ∈ S[X] be any lift of a. Then tr(â) ∈ 1 + m, so tr(â) is a unit since S is a local
ring. Since S[X] ⊆ Cgln (S) (X), we conclude that the trace map tr : Cgln (S) (X) → S
is surjective. The surjectivity of the map in the lemma is now a formal consequence.
Indeed, let b ∈ Csln (S/m) (Xm ) ⊆ (S/m)[X], and take a lift b̂ ∈ S[X] of b. Then
tr(b̂) ∈ m, so there exists a c ∈ mCgln (S) (X) such that tr(c) = tr(b̂) (namely let
c = tr(b̂)c′ , where tr(c′ ) = 1). Then b̂ − c ∈ Csln (S) (X), and the image of b̂ − c in
Csln (S/m) (Xm ) is b.

The following result is a local version of the criterion of Laffey and Reams ([9,
Proposition 3.3]), with the difference that we need Xp to be sln (R/p)-regular to
ensure that Y ∈ sln (R) rather than just in gln (R).
Proposition 2.4. Assume that R is a local PID with maximal ideal p, let A ∈
sln (R) and let X ∈ sln (R) be such that Xp is sln (R/p)-regular. Then A = [X, Y ]
for some Y ∈ sln (R) if and only if tr(X r A) = 0 for r = 1, . . . , n − 1.
Proof. Clearly the condition tr(X r A) = 0 for all r ≥ 1 is necessary for A to be
of the form [X, Y ] with Y ∈ sln (R). Conversely, suppose that tr(X r A) = 0 for
r = 1, . . . , n − 1. We claim that X is sln (F )-regular, considered as an element
of sln (F ). Indeed, by [9, Proposition 2.6] X is gln (F )-regular, and since Xp is
sln (R/p)-regular, there exists an element a ∈ R[X] such that tr(a) 6= 0. Thus
tr(F [X]) 6= 0, and so X is sln (F )-regular by Lemma 2.1.
Now, by Proposition 2.2 we have A = [X, M ] for some M ∈ sln (F ). Let p be a
generator of p. Then there exists a non-negative integer m such that pm M ∈ sln (R),
and we have [X, pm M ] = pm [X, M ] = pm A. Choose m to be minimal with respect
to the property that [X, C] = pm A for some C ∈ sln (R). Assume that m > 0.
Then [Xp , Cp ] = 0, so Xp commutes with Cp . Since Xp is sln (R/p)-regular, there
exists a Ĉ ∈ Csln (R) (X) such that Ĉp = Cp , by Lemma 2.3. Thus C = Ĉ + pD, for
some D ∈ sln (R), so
[X, C] = [X, pD] = p[X, D] = pm A.
Cancelling a factor of p, we obtain a contradiction to the minimality of m. Thus
m = 0, and the result is proved.

3. The matrices X(x, a)
Let S be a ring (commutative with identity), n ≥ 3, x = (x1 , . . . , xn−1 )T ∈ S n−1
and a ∈ S. The key to our main result is to consider the following matrices:

pi,i+1 = 1 for i = 1, . . . , n − 2, pn−1,1 = a and pij = 0 otherwise. Thus, P is the
(row-wise) companion matrix of the polynomial xn−1 − a.
Lemma 3.1. Let P ∈ sln−1 (S) be as above, and let y = (y1 , . . . , yn−1 )T ∈ S n−1 .
Then, for any z ∈ S, and r = 1, . . . , n − 1, we have
tr(P r−1 y(z, 0, . . . , 0)) = zyr .
(r−1)

Proof. Write P r−1 = (pij ), for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n−1. Since each column in y(z, 0, . . . , 0),
except for the first one, is zero, we have

tr(P r−1 y(z, 0, . . . , 0)) = (p11

Proof. The expression for X(x, a)r follows easily, using block-multiplication of matrices. The assertion about the trace of X(x, a)r for r = 1, . . . , n − 2 follows from
a simple induction argument, proving that for each r = 1, . . . , n − 2, we have
(r)

P r = (pij ), where pi,i+r = 1 for i = 1, . . . , n − 1 − r and pn−1−r+j,j = a for
(r)

j = 1, . . . , r, and pij = 0 otherwise. Finally, the relation tr(X(x, a)n−1 ) = (n − 1)a
follows from the fact that the characteristic polynomial of P is xn−1 − a.

Lemma 3.3. Let K be a field, x1 , . . . , xn−1 ∈ K n−1 and a ∈ K. If either xn−1 6= 0
or a 6= 0, then X(x, a) is gln (K)-regular. If a 6= 0, then X(x, a) is sln (K)-regular.
Proof. For simplicity, write X = X(x, a). We will show that if xn−1 6= 0 or a 6= 0,
then X is gln (K)-regular, by showing that {1n , X, . . . , X n−1 } is linearly independent. Lemma 3.2 implies that {1n , X, . . . , X n−2 } is linearly independent because P
is regular, so {1n−1 , P, . . . , P n−2 } is linearly independent. Moreover, by Lemma 3.2
and its proof, we have


where

Thus, since P i has zero diagonal for all r = 1, . . . , n−2 (see the proof of Lemma 3.2),
we conclude that X n−1 is not a linear combination of 1n , X, . . . , X n−2 if a 6= 0. On
the other hand, if a = 0 and xn−1 6= 0, then X n−1 is the matrix whose (2, 1)-entry
is xn−1 and all other entries are zero. Since each matrix in {1n , X, . . . , X n−2 } has a
non-zero (i, j)-entry for some (i, j) 6= (2, 1), we conclude that X n−1 is not a linear
combination of 1n , X, . . . , X n−2 if a = 0 and xn−1 6= 0.
Suppose now that a 6= 0; then X is gln (K)-regular. If char K ∤ n, Lemma 2.1
implies that X is sln (K)-regular. On the other hand, if char K | n, then
tr(X n−1 ) = (n − 1)a = −a,
by Lemma 3.2, so tr(K[X]) 6= 0 and Lemma 2.1 implies that X is sln (K)-regular.

4. The field case
In this section we give a proof of our main result in the case where R = K is a
field. We give a separate proof in this case, as it is simpler than for a general PID.
The result over a field was first proved by Thompson [10], who also showed that,
apart for some small exceptions, one of the matrices X can in fact be taken to be
nilpotent. We give a new proof of Thompson’s result, but instead of showing that
X can be chosen to be nilpotent, we show that it can be taken to be gln (K)-regular
(and often sln (K)-regular).
First let n = 2. For x, y, z, s, t, u ∈ K we have

Thus, if char K = 2, a matrix in sl2 (K) is of the form [X, Y ] for X, Y ∈ sl2 (K) if
and only if it is scalar. On the other hand, if char K ≥ 3 and a, b, c ∈ K, then

Note that all of the matrices involved in the above commutators are gln (K)-regular.
Lemma 4.1. Let S be a ring (commutative with identity) such that n = 1+· · ·+1 =
0 in S. Then, for every λ ∈ S there exist X, Y ∈ sln (S) such that X is gln (S)regular and [X, Y ] = λ1n .
Proof. Take X = (xij ), where xi,i+1 = 1 for i = 1, . . . , n − 1 and xij = 0 otherwise,
and Y = (yij ), where yj+1,j = j, for j = 1, . . . , n−1 and yij = 0 otherwise. Then X
is a companion matrix, hence regular as an element of gln (S). A direct computation
shows that [X, Y ] = 1n , because −(n − 1) = 1 in S, and thus [X, λY ] = λ1n .

Remark 4.2. If S = K is a field, Lemma 4.1 does not hold if X is required to
be sln (K)-regular; in fact, the X in the lemma is necessarily not sln (K)-regular,
unless λ = 0. The author was alerted to the following simple argument by a
referee: Suppose that [X, Y ] = λ1n where λ 6= 0 and X is gln (K)-regular. Then
tr(X i λ1n ) = λ tr(X i ) = 0, hence tr(X i ) = 0, for all i = 0, . . . , n − 1. Thus X is not
sln (K)-regular, by Lemma 2.1.
Theorem 4.3. Let K be a field and A ∈ sln (K), with n ≥ 3. Then there exist
X, Y ∈ sln (K) such that [X, Y ] = A. Moreover, if A is scalar, X can be chosen to
be gln (K)-regular and if A is non-scalar, X can be chosen to be sln (K)-regular.
Proof. Assume first that A is scalar. By [9, Proposition 4.1], there exist X, Y ∈
gln (K) with X gln (K)-regular, such that [X, Y ] = A. If char K does not divide n,
tr(Y )
tr(X)
tr(Y )
then [X − tr(X)

n 1n ] = [X, Y ] = A, where X −

n 1n ∈
tr(X)
sln (K) and X − n 1n is gln (K)-regular. On the other hand, if char K divides n,
then the desired assertion follows from Lemma 4.1.
Assume now that A is not scalar and let A = (aij ). Then the rational canonical
form implies that after a possible GLn (K)-conjugation, we can assume that a11 = 0,
a12 = 1 and aij = 0 whenever j ≥ i + 2. We will show that x1 , . . . , xn−1 ∈ K can
be chosen such that tr(X(x, 1)r A) = 0 for each r = 1, . . . , n − 1. By Lemma 3.2 we

for each r = 1, . . . , n − 1. Put xr = − tr(P r Q), so that tr(X(x, 1)r A) = 0, for
r = 1, . . . , n − 1. By Lemma 3.3 X(x, 1) is sln (K)-regular, so Proposition 2.2
implies that there exists a Y ∈ sln (K) such that
[X(x, 1), Y ] = A.

Remark 4.4. Our approach cannot be modified to yield Thompson’s result that X
can be taken to be nilpotent. The reason for this is that X(x, a) is nilpotent if and
only if P is nilpotent if and only if a = 0. Therefore, even if X(x, a) is nilpotent
and gln (K)-regular, it cannot be sln (K)-regular, because tr(X(x, 0)r ) = 0 for every
r = 1, . . . , n − 1.
5. Proof of the Main Theorem
Throughout this section, R is an arbitrary PID with fraction field F . Note that
we consider fields as special types of PIDs.
Before proving our main result (Theorem 5.3 below), we give a new and simplified
proof of the main result in [9] that any A ∈ sln (R) is a commutator of matrices in
gln (R). The proof of our main result is a bit harder, as it involves a special analysis
for certain prime ideals. Both proofs makek essential use of the Laffey-Reams form
and rely on the following key result:
Lemma 5.1. Suppose that A = (aij ) ∈ sln (R) is in Laffey-Reams form, that is,
aij = 0 for j ≥ i + 2 and A ≡ a11 1n mod (a12 ). Then there exists an x =
(x1 , . . . , xn−1 )T ∈ Rn−1 , with xn−1 = a11 , such that
tr(X(x, a12 )r A) = 0,
for each r = 1, . . . , n − 1.

tr(X(x, a12 )r A) = tr(Q′ ) = a12 xr + tr(P r Q),
for each r = 1, . . . , n − 1. We have tr(P r ) ≡ 0 mod (a12 ), for r = 1, . . . , n − 1, and
since A ≡ a11 1n mod (a12 ) it follows that Q ≡ a11 1n−1 mod (a12 ). Thus
tr(P r Q) ≡ a11 tr(P r ) ≡ 0 mod (a12 ),

so there exist mr ∈ R such that tr(P r Q) = a12 mr , for each r = 1, . . . , n − 1. Put
xr = −mr , so that
tr(X(x, a12 )r A) = 0,
for r = 1, . . . , n − 1.
Finally, we claim that tr(P n−1 Q) = −a11 a12 , so that
xn−1 = a11 .
Indeed, since P is gln−1 (R)-regular with characteristic polynomial xn−1 − a12 , we
have P n−1 = a12 1n−1 , so tr(P n−1 Q) = a12 tr(Q) = a12 (−a11 ), as claimed.

The following result is essentially [9, Theorem 6.3], but the result here is stronger
in that it says that X can be taken in sln (R) and such that it is gln (R/p)-regular
mod any maximal ideal p of R.
Theorem 5.2. Let A ∈ sln (R) with n ≥ 2. Then there exist matrices X ∈ sln (R)
and Y ∈ gln (R) such that [X, Y ] = A, where X can be chosen such that Xp is
gln (R/p)-regular for every maximal ideal p of R.
Proof. For n = 2 this is proved separately (see the proof of [9, Theorem 6.3]).
Assume from now on that n ≥ 3. First, if A is scalar, then A ∈ sln (R) implies that
either A = 0 or n = 0 in R. The former case is trivial, while the latter follows from
Lemma 4.1.
Assume now that A is not scalar and let A = (aij ). After a possible GLn (R)conjugation, we can assume that A is in Laffey–Reams form; see [9, Theorem 5.6].
Moreover, we may assume that (a11 , a12 ) = (1), because if d is a common divisor of
a11 and a12 , we can write A = dA′ for A′ in Laffey–Reams form and if A′ = [X, Y ]
with X, Y as in the theorem, then A = [X, dY ].
By Lemma 5.1, there exists an x = (x1 , . . . , xn−1 )T ∈ Rn−1 , with xn−1 = a11 ,
such that
tr(X(x, a12 )r A) = 0,
for each r = 1, . . . , n − 1. Since xn−1 = a11 and (a11 , a12 ) = (1), we have, for
every maximal ideal p of R, that either xn−1 ∈
/ p or a12 ∈
/ p, and therefore Xp
is gln (R/p)-regular, by Lemma 3.3. Thus, by [9, Proposition 3.3], there exists a
Y ∈ gln (R) such that
[X(x, a12 ), Y ] = A.

We now come to the proof of our main theorem. Just like the proof of the above
theorem, our proof uses Lemma 5.1, but since here X(x, a12 )p cannot in general
be sln (R/p)-regular for all maximal ideals (cf. Remark 4.2), we need to treat the
exceptional primes separately, and this requires us to pass to the localisations Rp ,
for various prime ideals p ∈ Spec(R). For an element X ∈ gln (R) we will write
X(p) for its canonical image in gln (Rp ), not to be confused with Xp ∈ gln (R/p).
For any element x ∈ R, we will use the same symbol x to denote the image of x
under the canonical injection R ֒→ Rp , and the context will make it clear in which
ring we are working. Similarly, we will denote the maximal ideal of Rp by p and
will identify Xp ∈ gln (R/p) with the image of X(p) in gln (Rp /p).
We will prove that for fixed A, X ∈ sln (R), and for any maximal ideal p of R,
there exists a solution Y (p) ∈ sln (Rp ) to the localised equation [X(p), Y (p)] = A(p).
Since the equations [X, Y ] = A, tr(Y ) = 0 in Y are equivalent to a system of linear

COMMUTATORS OF TRACE ZERO

equations in the entries of Y , the well known (and easy to prove) local-global
principle for systems of linear equations (see, e.g., [3, Proposition 1]) implies the
existence of a global solution.
Theorem 5.3. Let A ∈ sln (R) for n ≥ 3. Then there exist matrices X, Y ∈ sln (R)
such that [X, Y ] = A, where X can be chosen such that Xp is gln (R/p)-regular for
every maximal ideal p of R. Moreover, X can be chosen such that Xp is sln (R/p)regular for every p such that Ap is not scalar.
Proof. Assume first that A is scalar. Then A ∈ sln (R) implies that either A = 0 or
n = 0 in R. The former case is trivial, while the latter follows from Lemma 4.1.
Assume from now on that A is not scalar and let A = (aij ). After a possible
GLn (R)-conjugation, we can assume that A is in Laffey–Reams form. Moreover,
we may assume that (a11 , a12 ) = (1), because if d is a common divisor of a11 and
a12 , we can write A = dA′ for A′ in Laffey–Reams form, and if A′ is a commutator
of two matrices in sln (R), then so is A.
By Lemma 5.1, there exists an x = (x1 , . . . , xn−1 )T ∈ Rn−1 , with xn−1 = a11 ,
such that
tr(X(x, a12 )r A) = 0,
for each r = 1, . . . , n − 1. From now on, let X := X(x, a12 ). Since (a11 , a12 ) = (1),
we have, for every maximal ideal p of R, that either xn−1 ∈
/ p or a12 ∈
/ p, and
therefore that Xp is gln (R/p)-regular; see Lemma 3.3. Moreover, since A is in
Laffey-Reams form, we have A ≡ a11 1n mod (a12 ), and this, combined with the
fact that tr(A) = 0 and (a11 , a12 ) = (1), implies that
(5.1)

n ∈ (a12 ).

We will now pass to the localisations Rp for various maximal ideals p of R. Let
p be any maximal ideal of R. Then we have the local relation
tr(X(p)r A(p)) = 0,

r = 1, . . . , n − 1.

in Rp . First, suppose that Ap is not scalar. Then a12 ∈
/ p, so the matrix X(p)p = Xp
is sln (Rp /p)-regular, by Lemma 3.3, and so, by Proposition 2.4, there exists a
Y (p) ∈ sln (Rp ) such that
[X(p), Y (p)] = A(p).
Next, suppose that Ap is scalar, so that a12 ∈ p. Since a12 6= 0, X is sln (F )regular as an element of sln (F ), by Lemma 3.3, so there exists a Y (0) ∈ sln (F ) such
that [X, Y (0)] = A. Clearing denominators in Y (0) and passing to the localisation
at p, we conclude that there exists a power pm of a generator p ∈ Rp of p and a
Q ∈ sln (Rp ), such that
(5.2)

[X(p), Q] = pm A(p).

Let m ≥ 0 be the minimal integer such that (5.2) holds for some Q ∈ sln (Rp ). We
will show that m = 0. For a contradiction, assume that m ≥ 1. Reducing (5.2) mod
p, we obtain [Xp , Qp ] = 0, so Qp commutes with Xp . Since Xp is gln (R/p)-regular,
Q = f (X(p)) + pD,

for some polynomial f (T ) ∈ Rp [T ] of degree n − 1 and some D ∈ gln (Rp ). Write,

Moreover, we have [X(p), Q] = [X(p), pD] = pm A(p), so
0 = tr(pDpm A(p)) = pm+1 tr(DA(p)),
and thus tr(DA(p)) = 0. Since A(p) ≡ a11 1n mod (a12 ) and (a11 , a12 ) = (1), we
conclude that
(5.5)

tr(D) ∈ (a12 ).

Since n ∈ (a12 ) by (5.1), we have n = a12 n′ for some n′ ∈ Rp . Moreover, since Rp
is a local ring, n − 1 is a unit in Rp , so we can define the matrix
Q′ = (c0 n′ (n − 1)−1 + cn−1 )X n−1 + pD.
By (5.3) and (5.4) we have
tr(Q′ ) = c0 n + cn−1 (n − 1)a12 + p tr(D) = tr(Q) = 0,
which, by (5.5), implies that c0 n + cn−1 (n − 1)a12 ∈ (pa12 ), and thus
c0 n′ (n − 1)−1 + cn−1 ∈ (p).
Writing c0 n′ (n − 1)−1 + cn−1 = pα for some α ∈ Rp , we then get
[X(p), Q] = [X(p), pD] = [X(p), Q′ ] = p[X(p), αX n−1 + D] = pm A(p),
where tr(αX n−1 + D) = 0 because
p tr(αX n−1 + D) = tr((c0 n′ (n − 1)−1 + cn−1 )X n−1 + pD) = tr(Q′ ) = 0.
By cancelling a factor of p, we obtain a contradiction to the minimality of m in
(5.2). Thus m = 0, so there exists a Y (p) ∈ sln (Rp ) such that [X(p), Y (p)] = A(p).
We have thus proved that for any maximal ideal p of R, there exists a Y (p) ∈
sln (Rp ) such that
[X(p), Y (p)] = A(p).
Thus, by the local-global principle for systems of linear equations (see, e.g., [3,
Proposition 1]), there exists a Y ∈ sln (R) such that
[X, Y ] = A.

In the same way as in [9, Corollary 6.4], Theorem 5.3 implies the analogous
statement over any principal ideal ring (PIR), thanks to a theorem of Hungerford
that any PIR is a finite product of homomorphic images of PIDs.
6. Shalev’s conjecture for n = 2
This section is devoted to a proof of Shalev’s conjecture mentioned in the introduction, in the case n = 2. For a group G and elements x, y ∈ G we write the
commutator as (x, y) = xyx−1 y −1 . In this section, R will denote a local PID (i.e., a
discrete valuation ring) with residue field k. We denote the maximal ideal in R by
p and let π ∈ p be a generator. We first prove a result whose conclusion is weaker
than Shalev’s conjecture for n = 2, in that one of the elements is only shown to lie
in GL2 (R), but where the hypotheses are slightly more general in that we allow any
residue field apart from F2 . We will then refine this result to prove Proposition 6.2,
which contains Shalev’s conjecture for n = 2 as a special case.
Recall that an element X ∈ gln (R) is gln (R)-regular if and only if Xp is gln (k)regular; see [9, Lemma 2.5]. Moreover, if X is gln (R)-regular then X is GLn (R)conjugate to a companion matrix; see [9, Lemma 2.3]. By convention, we will
write companion matrices row-wise, that is, with ones on the super-diagonal. If
X ∈ gln (R) has units on the superdiagonal and zeros above the superdiagonal,
then it is regular; see [9, Lemma 2.7] (note that to go from units to ones on the
superdiagonal, one only needs to conjugate by a diagonal element). The same
conclusion holds if ‘superdiagonal’ is replaced by ‘subdiagonal’.
Proposition 6.1. Let R be a local PID such that |k| > 2. Then, for every A ∈
SL2 (R) there exist x ∈ GL2 (R) and y ∈ SL2 (R) such that (x, y) = A. Moreover, y
0 1
can be taken to be GL2 (R)-conjugate to an element of the form −1
s ∈ SL2 (R).

Proof. The strategy of the proof is the following. We find a y ∈ SL2 (R) such that
both y and yA are regular as elements in gln (R), and such that y and yA have the
same determinant and trace. This implies that y and yA are GL2 (R)-conjugate,
that is, there exists an x ∈ GL2 (R) such that
yA = xyx−1 ,
and so (x, y) = A.
By [9, Lemma 2.7], any

y11
y=
y21

y22

∈ gln (R)

is gln (R)-regular. In order for det(y) = det(yA) we need det(y) = 1, so y21 =
y11 y22 − 1, which we assume henceforth. We distinguish two cases: either the
image Ap of A in SL2 (k) is scalar or regular.
Case 1: Assume that Ap is scalar. If moreover A is scalar, then A = ±1, so
yA = ±y is regular, and tr(yA) = ± tr(y). Setting y22 = −y11 so that tr(y) = 0,
we obtain the existence of an x ∈ GL2 (R) such that yA = xyx−1 .
If Ap is scalar but A is not scalar, then up to conjugation of A, we can write
A = λ1 + π i A′ ,

COMMUTATORS OF TRACE ZERO

where λ = ±1, i ≥ 1 and A′ =

∈ SL2 (R). Then, since yp ∈ SL2 (k) is

(yA)p = ±yp ,
we also have that (yA)p is regular, and hence (because R is local), that yA is
regular. Furthermore, we need to ensure that
(6.1)

tr(yA) = y11 (π i y22 + λ) + y22 (b′ π i + λ) + π i (a′ − 1) = tr(y) = y11 + y22

If char k 6= 2 and λ = −1, then λ− 1 is a unit, so this equation clearly has a solution
y11 ∈ R for any y22 ∈ R. If λ = 1 (6.1) is equivalent to
y11 y22 + y22 b′ + a′ − 1 = 0,
which has a solution over R, for example y11 = −a′ − b′ + 1, y22 = 1.
Case 2: Assume that Ap is non-scalar. Then Ap is regular, so A is regular, and
hence, up to conjugation, we can write

−y22 y22 (y11 + b) − 1
Since the residue field of R has at least three elements, we can choose y22 such that
both y22 and y22 − 1 are units. Then yA is regular by [9, Lemma 2.7], and the
equation
tr(yA) = y22 (y11 + b) − 2 = tr(y) = y11 + y22 ,
−1
has a solution y11 ∈ R. Hence, there

Note that the hypothesis on the residue field in the above proposition is optimal,
since GL2 (F2 ) = SL2 (F2 ), and this group is not perfect.
The following result implies Shalev’s conjecture mentioned in the introduction,
in the case n = 2.
Proposition 6.2. Let R be a Henselian discrete valuation ring with finite residue
field k such that char k > 2 and |k| > 3. Then, for every A ∈ SL2 (R) there exist
x ∈ SL2 (R) and y ∈ SL2 (R) such that (x, y) = A.
Proof. If Ap is non-scalar, the result follows from [2, Theorem 3.5]. Assume therefore that Ap is scalar. By Proposition
6.1 we have (x, y) = a for some x ∈ GL2 (R)

image of y under the canonical map SL2 (R) → SL2 (k). We will show that s can be
chosen such that yp is semisimple. If yp is not semisimple, then it has characteristic
polynomial x2 − sx + 1 ≡ (x ± 1)2 mod p, so s ≡ ±2 mod p. We therefore want to
show that s can be chosen such that s 6≡ ±2 mod p. We will examine Case 1 of the
proof of Proposition 6.1 to show that this can indeed be achieved. As before, write

if λ = 1, the last part of Case 1 of the proof of Proposition 6.1 says that we need
to consider the relation

has at most 4 distinct solutions ((y11 )p , (y22 )p ) ∈ k 2 (at most two for each choice
of sign for ±2). On the other hand, the equation
(y11 y22 + a′ − 1)p = 0
has at least |k| − 1 distinct solutions, so when |k| > 5, there exist (y11 )p , (y22 )p ∈ k
such that (y11 +y22 )p 6= ±2. Furthermore, if k = F5 , the equation (y11 y22 +a′ −1)p =
0 has 9 solutions if a′p = 1, so it only remains to consider the case k = F5 , with
a′p 6= 1. In this case, one checks easily that either (y11 )p = 1, (y22 )p = 1 − a′ or
(y11 )p = 2, (y22 )p = (1 − a′ )2−1 is a solution to (y11 y22 + a′ − 1)p = 0 such that
(y11 + y22 )p 6= ±2. We have therefore shown that whenever |k| > 3, there exist
y11 , y22 ∈ R such that y11 y22 + a′ − 1 ≡ 0 mod p and such that s = y11 + y22 6≡
±2 mod p. Hensel’s lemma now implies that equation (6.2) has a solution y11 , y22 ∈
R such that s = y11 + y22 6≡ ±2 mod p. We thus conclude that s = y11 + y22 can
be chosen such that yp is semisimple.
Suppose, as we may, that s 6≡ ±2 mod p, so that yp is semisimple. We claim
that the determinant map
det : CGL2 (k) (yp ) −→ k ×
is surjective. Indeed, since yp is regular, we have
CGL2 (k) (yp ) = k[yp ]× ,
and if the characteristic polynomial of yp is irreducible, k[yp ] is a field, while otherwise yp has distinct eigenvalues in k. When k[yp ] is a field, the determinant
coincides with the norm map N : k[yp ]× → k × , which is well-known to be surjective (because k is finite). When k[yp ] has distinct eigenvalues in k, the centraliser
CGL2 (k) (k[yp ]) is GL2 (k)-conjugate to the diagonal subgroup of GL2 (k), on which
det is clearly surjective. We now want to show that
det : CGL2 (R) (y) −→ R×
is surjective. Since y is regular, we have

so the determinant is surjective if α2 +αβs+β 2 = r has a solution α, β ∈ R for each
r ∈ R× . We show that Hensel’s lemma implies that this equation has a solution
α, β ∈ R. Indeed, if the gradient


2β + αs

then α ≡ αs4 , so either α ≡ 0 or s2 ≡ 4. In the same way, either β ≡ 0 or s2 ≡ 4.
Then, since we have assumed that s 6≡ ±2, we obtain, α ≡ β ≡ 0, which is not the
case if α2 + αβs + β 2 = r ∈ R× . Thus, any solution to this equation mod p has a
lift to R. Since we have just observed that this equation has a solution mod p for
every r ∈ R× , we conclude that det : CGL2 (R) (y) → R× is surjective.
We have shown that there exists a g ∈ CGL2 (R) (y) such that det(g) = det(x)−1 .
Thus
yA = xyx−1 = (xg)y(xg)−1 ,
so (xg, y) = A with xg ∈ SL2 (R).
