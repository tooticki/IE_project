UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS
DAG NORMANN AND SAM SANDERS
Abstract. The 19th century saw a systematic development of real analysis
in which many theorems were proved using compactness. In the work of Dini,
Pincherle, Bolzano, Young, Riesz, Hardy, and Lebesgue, one finds such proofs
which (sometimes with minor modification) additionally are highly uniform in
the sense that the objects proved to exist only depend on few of the parameters
of the theorem. More recently, similarly uniform results have been obtained
as part of the redevelopment of analysis based on techniques from gauge integration. Our aim is to study such ‘highly uniform’ theorems in Reverse Mathematics and computability theory. Our prototypical example is Pincherle’s
theorem, published in 1882, which states that a locally bounded function is
bounded on certain domains. We show that both the ‘original’ and ‘uniform’
versions of Pincherle’s theorem have noteworthy properties. In particular, the
upper bound from Pincherle’s theorem turns out to be extremely hard to compute in terms of (some of) the data, while the uniform version of Pincherle’s
theorem requires full second-order arithmetic for a proof. We obtain similar
results for Heine’s uniform continuity theorem and Fejér’s theorem. Our study
of the role of the axiom of countable choice in the aforementioned results leads
to the observation that the status of the Lindelöf lemma is highly dependent
on its formulation (provable in second-order arithmetic vs unprovable in ZF).

1. Introduction
1.1. Aim and motivation. The motivation for this paper stems from the (historical and modern) connection between compactness and uniformity, as follows.
As to compactness, the importance of this notion cannot be overstated, as it
provides a direct connection between local and global properties and guarantees
that limits are well-behaved. Historically, the 19th century saw the first systematic
development of real analysis -spearheaded by Bolzano, Weierstrass, and others- in
which many now fundamental theorems were proved using compactness.
As to uniformity, some of these proofs (due to Dini, Pincherle, Bolzano, Young,
Hardy, Riesz, and Lebesgue) deserve attention as they are highly uniform (sometimes after minor modification) in the sense that the objects claimed to exist by
the theorem only depend on few of the parameters of the theorem. More recently,
similarly uniform results have been obtained as part of the development of analysis
based on techniques from the gauge integral, a generalisation of Lebesgue’s integral.
Our aim is to study such ‘highly uniform’ theorems in Reverse Mathematics (RM
hereafter) and computability theory; we discuss the latter fields in Section 2. Our
starting point, and illustrative example, is Pincherle’s theorem.
Theorem 1.1 (Pincherle). Let E be a closed, bounded subset of Rn and let f :
E → R be locally bounded. Then f is bounded on E.

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

As to its history, Theorem 1.1 was (essentially) established by Salvatore Pincherle
in 1882 in [60, p. 67] in a more verbose formulation. Indeed, Pincherle did not use
the notion of local boundedness, and a function is nowadays called locally bounded
on E if every x ∈ E has a neighbourhood U ⊂ E on which the function is bounded.
Note that Pincherle assumed the existence of L, r : E → R+ such that for any
x ∈ E the function is bounded by L(x) on the ball B(x, r(x)) ⊂ E ([60, p. 66-67]).
We refer to these functions L, r : E → R+ as realisers for local boundedness. We
do not restrict the notion of realiser to any of its established technical definitions.
As to its conceptual nature, Pincherle’s theorem may be found as [24, Theorem 4]
in a Monthly paper aiming to provide conceptually easy proofs of well-known theorems. Furthermore, Pincherle’s theorem is the sample theorem in [77], a recent
monograph dealing with elementary real analysis. Thus, Pincherle’s theorem qualifies as ‘basic’ mathematics in any reasonable sense of the word, and is also definitely
within the scope of RM as it essentially predates set theory ([72, I.1]).
Despite the aforementioned ‘basic nature’ of Pincherle’s theorem, its proofs in
[4, 24, 60, 77] actually provide ‘highly uniform’ information: as shown in Section A,
these proofs establish Pincherle’s theorem and that the bound in the consequent only
depends on the realisers r, L : E → R+ for local boundedness. Note that in the case
of [60] we need a minor modification of the proof, as discussed in Section A.2.
As discussed in detail in Section 1.2, one of our main aims is the study of the
‘highly uniform’ version of Pincherle’s theorem in which the bound in the consequent
only depends on the realisers r, L : E → R+ . As it turns out, both the original and
uniform versions of Pincherle’s theorem have noteworthy properties from the point
of view of RM and computability theory. In particular, we answer the following
questions, where ‘computable’ refers Kleene’s S1-S9, as discussed in Section 2.3
(i) How hard is it to compute the upper bound in Pincherle’s theorem in terms
of (some of) the data?
(ii) What is the computational strength of the ability to obtain the upper
bounds from Pincherele’s theorem?
(iii) How do the original and uniform versions of Pincherle’s theorem compare
to the Big Five systems from RM and the Gödel hierarchy?
(iv) How does Pincherle’s theorem relate to basic theorems from RM, in particular those (about continuity) equivalent to weak König’s lemma?
While Pincherle’s theorem constitutes an illustrative example, it is by no means an
isolated event: we analogously study Heine’s theorem on uniform continuity and
sketch the (highly similar) approach for Fejér’s theorem. These results are a natural
outgrowth of question (iv), and a number of theorems from the RM of weak König’s
lemma will be studied in a follow-up paper (See Remark 4.21 for details).
Finally, like in [58], statements of the form ‘a proof of uniform Pincherle’s theorem requires full second-order arithmetic’ should be interpreted in reference to the
usual scale of comprehension axioms that is part of the Gödel hierarchy (See Appendix B for the latter). The previous statement thus (merely) expresses that there
is no proof of uniform Pincherle’s theorem using comprehension axioms restricted
to a sub-class, like e.g. Π1k -formulas (with only first and second-order parameters).
An intuitive visual clarification may be found in Figure 1, where uniform Pincherle’s
theorem is shown to be independent of the medium range of the Gödel hierarchy.

1.2. Pincherle’s theorem and uniformity. We formally introduce Pincherle’s
theorem and the aforementioned ‘highly uniform’ version, and discuss the associated
results, to be established in Sections 3 and 4.
First of all, to reduce technical details to a minimum, we mostly work with Cantor
space, denoted 2N or C, rather than the unit interval; the former is homeomorphic
to a closed subset of the latter anyway. The advantage is that we do not need to
deal with the coding of real numbers using Cauchy sequences, which can get messy.
Secondly, in keeping with Pincherle’s use of L, r : R → R+ , we say that G : C → N
is a realiser for the local boundedness of the functional F : C → N if


LOC(F, G) ≡ (∀f, g ∈ C) g ∈ [f G(f )] → F (g) ≤ G(f ) .

Note that f n = hf (0), f (1), . . . , f (n − 1)i for n ∈ N, while g ∈ [f n] means that
g(m) = f (m) for m < n. Hence, LOC(F, G) expresses that G provides for every
f ∈ C a neighbourhood [f G(f )] in C in which F is bounded by G(f ).
We make use of one functional G for both the neighbourhood and upper bound,
while Pincherle uses two separate functions L (for the upper bound) and r (for the
neighbourhood); as discussed in Remark 3.10, this makes no difference.
Thirdly, the following are the original and uniform versions of Pincherle’s theorem for Cantor space, respectively PITo and PITu . As discussed in Section A.2,
Pincherle’s proof from [60] (with minor modification only) yields PITu ; the same
holds for [4, 24, 77] without any changes to the proofs.


(∀F, G : C → N)(∃N ∈ N) LOC(F, G) → (∀g ∈ C)(F (g) ≤ N )
(PITo )


(∀G : C → N)(∃N ∈ N)(∀F : C → N) LOC(F, G) → (∀g ∈ C)(F (g) ≤ N ) (PITu )

The difference in quantifier position is important: by Corollary 4.7, PITo is essentially provable in the second Big Five of RM (i.e. WKL0 with higher types and a
weak fragment of the axiom of choice), while PITu requires full second-order arithmetic for a proof. Furthermore, by Theorem 4.12, local boundedness is equivalent in
weak systems to subcontinuity, a kind of sequential continuity. Hence, Pincherle’s
theorem is a generalisation of the following theorem from the RM of WKL0 : a continuous function on Cantor space is bounded ([72, IV.2.2]). Finally, PITu is equivalent
to the Heine-Borel theorem for uncountable covers by Corollary 4.6, over the ‘base
theory’ of higher-order RM plus a weak fragment of the axiom of choice.
Fourth, it is a natural question how hard it is to compute an upper bound as
in Pincherle’s theorem from (some of) the data. To this end, we consider the
specification for a (non-unique) functional M : (C → N) → N as follows.


(∀F, G : C → N) LOC(F, G) → (∀g ∈ C)(F (g) ≤ M (G)) .
(PR(M ))
Any M satisfying PR(M ) is called a realiser 1 for Pincherle’s theorem PITu , or a
Pincherele realiser (PR) for short. By Section 3.1, PRs are extremely hard to
compute, as they are not computable in any type two functional. The functional
∃3 from Section 2.3 computes (certain) PRs, but yields full second-order arithmetic.
In a nutshell, we answer the questions from Section 1.1 as follows.
1We use the term realiser in a quite liberal way. In fact, Pincherle realisers are witnesses to
the truth of uniform Pincherle’s theorem by selecting, to each G, an upper bound as in PITu .
However, the set of upper bounds, seen as a function of G, is highly complex: the PR that selects
the least bound is computationally equivalent to ∃3 from Section 2.3, which is left as an exercise.

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

(i) Pincherle realisers cannot be computed (in the sense of Kleene’s S1-S9)
from any type two functional, but some may be computed from ∃3 .
(ii) Pincherle realisers compute realisers of Π11 -separation for subsets of NN and
natural generalisations to sets of objects of type two.
(iii) Pincherle’s theorem PITu falls far outside the Big Five of RM and requires
far stronger systems than the latter, namely full second-order arithmetic.
(iv) Pincherle’s theorem(s) may be reformulated with ‘subcontinuous’ instead
of ‘locally bounded’, making it a natural generalisation of a continuous
function on Cantor space is bounded from classical RM ([72, IV.2.2]). Furthermore, PITu is equivalent to the Heine-Borel theorem for uncountable
covers, over a weak system. See Corollary 4.6 for a precise statement.
These results are in line with in [56–58], where we answered similar questions for
a number of covering theorems like the Cousin and Lindelöf lemmas, and the associated development of the gauge integral. A notable -and important- difference
between the latter lemmas and Pincherle’s (original) theorem is that the latter’s
behaviour in computability theory (See Corollary 3.15 and Theorem 3.18) and RM
(See Theorem 4.4) diverges completely: by these results PITo is extremely easy to
prove, but the upper bound in PITo is extremely hard to compute (in terms of F, G).
Remark 1.2 (Variations of Pincherle’s theorem). Pincherle describes the following
theorem in a footnote on [60, p. 67]:
Let E be a closed, bounded subset of Rn and let f : E → R be locally
bounded away from 0. Then f has a positive infimum on E.
He states that this theorem is proved in the same way as Theorem 1.1 and provides
a generalisation of Heine’s theorem as proved by Dini in [13]. We could formulate
versions of the centred theorem, and they would be equivalent to the associated
versions of Pincherle’s theorem. Restricted to uniformly continuous functions, the
centred theorem is studied in constructive RM ([9, Ch. 6]). Lest there be any doubt,
we show in Remark A.5 that Pincherle works with arbitrary functions.
1.3. Heine’s theorem and uniformity. We formally introduce Heine’s theorem
and the associated ‘highly uniform’ version, and discuss the associated results, to
be established in Sections 3 and 4. As in the previous section, we work over 2N .
First of all, Heine’s theorem is the statement that a continuous f : X → R
on a compact space X is uniformly continuous. Dini’s proof ([13, §41]) of Heine’s
theorem makes use of a modulus of continuity, i.e. a functional computing δ from
ε > 0 and x ∈ X in the usual ε-δ-definition of continuity. As discussed in [65],
Bolzano’s definition of continuity involves a modulus of continuity, while his (apparently faulty) proof of Heine’s theorem may be found in [5, p. 575]. The following
formula expresses that G is a modulus of (pointwise) continuity for F on C:
(∀f, g ∈ C)(f G(f ) = gG(f ) → F (f ) = F (g)).

(MPC(G, F ))

Secondly, we introduce UCTu , the uniform Heine’s theorem for C. By Section A.1,
the proofs by Dini, Bolzano, Young, Hardy, Riesz, Thomae, and Lebesgue ([5, 13,
28, 43, 62, 76, 81]) establish the uniform UCTu for [0, 1] (with minor modification for
[5, 13, 76]); the same for [4, 7, 24, 32, 36, 41, 43, 61, 74, 77] without changes.
Definition 1.3. [UCTu ]

(∀G2 )(∃m0 )(∀F 2 ) MPC(G, F ) → (∀f, g ∈ C)(f m = gm → F (f ) = F (g))].

The difference in quantifier position has big consequences: Heine’s theorem is
essentially provable in the second Big Five system of RM by [39, Prop. 4.10], while
UCTu requires full second-order arithmetic for a proof. Indeed, we prove in Section 4.4 that UCTu is equivalent to the Heine-Borel theorem for uncountable covers,
and hence to PITu . The previous equivalences require an ‘intermediate’ version of
Heine’s theorem based on the codes used in RM, introduced next.
Now, the logical framework for RM is second-order arithmetic, i.e. only natural
numbers and sets thereof are available. Thus, higher-order objects are represented
in RM by (countable) codes; the representation of continuous functions is given by
[72, II.6.1]. The following formula, abbreviated ‘α ∈ K0 ’, essentially expresses that
α : N → N is a code in the sense of RM; the sequence α is also called an ‘associate’:
(∀f 1 )(∃n0 )(α(f n) >0 0) ∧ (∀n0 , m0 , f 1 , )(m > n ∧ α(f n) > 0 → α(f n) =0 α(f m)).
The value α(f ) for α ∈ K0 is defined as the unique α(f n) − 1 for n large enough. It
is standard (abuse of language) to treat α ∈ K0 as a type two functional λf.α(f ).
The set of associates K0 is Π11 -complete, i.e. the quantifier ‘(∀α ∈ K0 )’ entails
Π12 -complexity. Historically, associates were first introduced by Kleene in the early
days of higher-order computability theory ([46, §2.3.1]).
In higher-order arithmetic, a functional Φ : NN → NN has a continuous modulus
of continuity if and only if there is a code α ∈ K0 such that λf.α(f ) equals Φ on
Baire space ([39, Prop. 4.4]). The following principle is essentially uniform Heine’s
theorem for RM codes on C, which is also equivalent to UCTu by Corollary 4.14.
Definition 1.4. [UCT′u ]

(∀G2 )(∃m0 )(∀α1 ∈ K0 ) MPC(G, α) → (∀f, g ∈ C)(f m = gm → α(f ) = α(g))],

The computability-theoretic differences between the uniform and original versions of Heine’s theorem are as follows: on one hand, assuming MPC(F, G), one
computes2 the upper bound from (original) Heine’s theorem in terms of F and ∃2
from Section 2.3, i.e. the third Big Five system suffices.
On the other hand, given G, the class of F such that MPC(G, F ) is equicontinuous
(and finite if F is restricted to C), but computing a modulus of equicontinuity from
G is as hard as computing a PR from G. In this light, the (original) Heine theorem
is simpler than the (original) Pincherle theorem in computability theory, while the
uniform versions are equivalent both in RM and computability theory.
Clearly, many theorems from the RM of WKL0 can be studied in the same way
as Pincherle’s and Heine’s theorems; we provide one such example, namely Fejér’s
theorem, in Section 4.4, while a systematic study is reserved for a follow-up paper.
Finally, many results in this paper (and those in [58]) are obtained using fragments of the axiom of countable choice. It is a natural RM-question, posed previously by Hirschfeldt (See [52, §6.1]), whether such fragments of choice are necessary.
We answer this question in Section 5.2, and in the process reveal that the strength
of the Lindelöf lemma is extremely dependent on its formulation: one version is
provable in ZΩ
2 (and even provable in a conservative extension of WKL0 ); a slight
variation of the first version is unprovable in ZF.
2If MPC(G, F ), one computes an associate for F : C → N from F and ∃2 , and one then
computes an upper bound for F on C, as the fan functional has a computable code ([55, p. 102]).

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

2. Preliminaries
We sketch the program Reverse Mathematics in Section 2.1, as well as its generalisation to higher-order arithmetic in Section 2.2. As our main results will be proved
using techniques from computability theory, we discuss the latter in Section 2.3.
2.1. Introducing Reverse Mathematics. Reverse Mathematics (RM) is a program in the foundations of mathematics initiated around 1975 by Friedman ([18,19])
and developed extensively by Simpson ([72]) and others. We refer to [74] for a basic
introduction to RM and to [72] for an overview of RM; we now sketch some of the
aspects of RM essential to this paper.
The aim of RM is to find the axioms necessary to prove a statement of ordinary,
i.e. non-set theoretical mathematics. The classical base theory RCA0 of ‘computable
mathematics’ is always assumed. Thus, the aim of RM is:
The aim of RM is to find the minimal axioms A such that RCA0
proves [A → T ] for statements T of ordinary mathematics.
Surprisingly, once the minimal axioms A have been found, we almost always also
have RCA0 ⊢ [A ↔ T ], i.e. not only can we derive the theorem T from the axioms
A (the ‘usual’ way of doing mathematics), we can also derive the axiom A from the
theorem T (the ‘reverse’ way of doing mathematics). In light of these ‘reversals’,
the field was baptised ‘Reverse Mathematics’.
Perhaps even more surprisingly, in the majority of cases, for a statement T of
ordinary mathematics, either T is provable in RCA0 , or the latter proves T ↔
Ai , where Ai is one of the logical systems WKL0 , ACA0 , ATR0 or Π11 -CA0 from
[72, I]. The latter four systema together with RCA0 form the ‘Big Five’ and the
aforementioned observation that most mathematical theorems fall into one of the
Big Five categories, is called the Big Five phenomenon ([52, p. 432]).
Furthermore, each of the Big Five has a natural formulation in terms of (Turing)
computability (See [72, I]), and each of the Big Five also corresponds (sometimes
loosely) to a foundational program in mathematics ([72, I.12]). The Big Five systems of RM also satisfy a linear order, as follows:
Π11 -CA0 → ATR0 → ACA0 → WKL0 → RCA0 .

(2.1)

By contrast, there are many incomparable logical statements in second-order arithmetic. For instance, a regular plethora of such statements may be found in the
Reverse Mathematics zoo in [17]. The latter is intended as a collection of (somewhat natural) theorems outside of the Big Five classification of RM. It is also worth
noting that the Big Five only constitute a very tiny fragment of Z2 ; on a related
note, the RM of topology does give rise to theorems equivalent to Π12 -CA0 ([54]),
but that is the current upper bound of RM to the best of our knowledge. Moreover,
the coding of topologies is not without problems, as discussed in [33].
2.2. Higher-order Reverse Mathematics. We sketch Kohlenbach’s higher-order
Reverse Mathematics as introduced in [38]. In contrast to ‘classical’ RM, higherorder RM makes use of the much richer language of higher-order arithmetic.
As suggested by its name, higher-order arithmetic extends second-order arithmetic. Indeed, while the latter is restricted to numbers and sets of numbers, higherorder arithmetic also has sets of sets of numbers, sets of sets of sets of numbers,

et cetera. To formalise this idea, we introduce the collection of all finite types T,
defined by the two clauses:
(i) 0 ∈ T and (ii) If σ, τ ∈ T then (σ → τ ) ∈ T,
where 0 is the type of natural numbers, and σ → τ is the type of mappings from
objects of type σ to objects of type τ . In this way, 1 ≡ 0 → 0 is the type of functions
from numbers to numbers, and where n + 1 ≡ n → 0. Viewing sets as given by
characteristic functions, we note that Z2 only includes objects of type 0 and 1.
The language of Lω consists of variables xρ , y ρ , z ρ , . . . of any finite type ρ ∈ T.
Types may be omitted when they can be inferred from context. The constants of
Lω includes the type 0 objects 0, 1 and <0 , +0 , ×0 , =0 which are intended to have
their usual meaning as operations on N. Equality at higher types is defined in terms
of ‘=0 ’ as follows: for any objects xτ , y τ , we have
[x =τ y] ≡ (∀z1τ1 . . . zkτk )[xz1 . . . zk =0 yz1 . . . zk ],

(2.2)

if the type τ is composed as τ ≡ (τ1 → . . . → τk → 0). Furthermore, Lω also
includes the recursor constant Rσ for any σ ∈ T, which allows for iteration on type
σ-objects as in the special case (2.3). Formulas and terms are defined as usual.
Definition 2.1. The base theory RCAω
0 consists of the following axioms:
(1) Basic axioms expressing that 0, 1, <0 , +0 , ×0 form an ordered semi-ring with
equality =0 .
(2) Basic axioms defining the well-known Π and Σ combinators (aka K and S
in [2]), which allow for the definition of λ-abstraction.
(3) The defining axiom of the recursor constant R0 : For m0 and f 1 :
R0 (f, m, 0) := m and R0 (f, m, n + 1) := f (R0 (f, m, n)).

(2.3)

(4) The axiom of extensionality: for all ρ, τ ∈ T, we have:


(∀xρ , y ρ , ϕρ→τ ) x =ρ y → ϕ(x) =τ ϕ(y) .

(Eρ,τ )

3

(5) The induction axiom for quantifier-free formulas of Lω .
(6) QF-AC1,0 : The quantifier-free axiom of choice as in Definition 2.2.

Definition 2.2. The axiom QF-AC consists of the following for all σ, τ ∈ T:
(∀xσ )(∃y τ )A(x, y) → (∃Y σ→τ )(∀xσ )A(x, Y (x)),

(QF-ACσ,τ )

for any quantifier-free formula A in the language of Lω .
As discussed in [38, §2], RCAω
0 and RCA0 prove the same sentences ‘up to language’ as the latter is set-based and the former function-based. Recursion as in (2.3)
is called primitive recursion; the class of functionals obtained from Rρ for all ρ ∈ T
is called Gödel’s system T of all (higher-order) primitive recursive functionals.
We use the usual notations for natural, rational, and real numbers, and the
associated functions, as introduced in [38, p. 288-289].
Definition 2.3 (Real numbers and related notions in RCAω
0 ).
(1) Natural numbers correspond to type zero objects, and we use ‘n0 ’ and
‘n ∈ N’ interchangeably. Rational numbers are defined as signed quotients
of natural numbers, and ‘q ∈ Q’ and ‘<Q ’ have their usual meaning.
3To be absolutely clear, variables (of any finite type) are allowed in quantifier-free formulas of
the language Lω : only quantifiers are banned.

(2) Real numbers are coded by fast-converging Cauchy sequences q(·) : N → Q,
i.e. such that (∀n0 , i0 )(|qn − qn+i )| <Q 21n ). We use Kohlenbach’s ‘hat
function’ from [38, p. 289] to guarantee that every f 1 defines a real number.
1
(3) We write ‘x ∈ R’ to express that x1 := (q(·)
) represents a real as in the
previous item and write [x](k) := qk for the k-th approximation of x.
(4) Two reals x, y represented by q(·) and r(·) are equal, denoted x =R y, if
1
). Inequality ‘<R ’ is defined similarly.
(∀n0 )(|qn − rn | ≤ 2n−1
(5) Functions F : R → R mapping reals to reals are represented by Φ1→1
mapping equal reals to equal reals, i.e.
(∀x, y ∈ R)(x =R y → Φ(x) =R Φ(y)).

(RE)

(6) The relation ‘x ≤τ y’ is defined as in (2.2) but with ‘≤0 ’ instead of ‘=0 ’.
Binary sequences are denoted ‘f 1 , g 1 ≤1 1’, but also ‘f, g ∈ C’ or ‘f, g ∈ 2N ’.
(7) Sets of type ρ objects X ρ→0 , Y ρ→0 , . . . are given by their characteristic
ρ→0
ρ→0
functions fX
, i.e. (∀xρ )[x ∈ X ↔ fX (x) =0 1], where fX
≤ρ→0 1.
We sometimes omit the subscript ‘R’ if it is clear from context. Finally, we
introduce some notation to handle finite sequences nicely.
Notation 2.4 (Finite sequences). We assume a dedicated type for ‘finite sequences
of objects of type ρ’, namely ρ∗ . Since the usual coding of pairs of numbers goes
∗
through in RCAω
0 , we shall not always distinguish between 0 and 0 . Similarly, we
ρ
ρ
do not always distinguish between ‘s ’ and ‘hs i’, where the former is ‘the object
s of type ρ’, and the latter is ‘the sequence of type ρ∗ with only element sρ ’. The
empty sequence for the type ρ∗ is denoted by ‘hiρ ’, usually with the typing omitted.
∗

Furthermore, we denote by ‘|s| = n’ the length of the finite sequence sρ =
ρ ρ
hs0 , s1 , . . . , sρn−1 i, where |hi| = 0, i.e. the empty sequence has length zero. For
∗
∗
sequences sρ , tρ , we denote by ‘s∗t’ the concatenation of s and t, i.e. (s∗t)(i) = s(i)
∗
for i < |s| and (s∗t)(j) = t(|s|−j) for |s| ≤ j < |s|+|t|. For a sequence sρ , we define
0
0→ρ
sN := hs(0), s(1), . . . , s(N − 1)i for N < |s|. For a sequence α
, we also write
∗
αN = hα(0), α(1), . . . , α(N −1)i for any N 0 . By way of shorthand, (∀q ρ ∈ Qρ )A(q)
0
abbreviates (∀i < |Q|)A(Q(i)), which is (equivalent to) quantifier-free if A is.
2.3. Higher-order computability theory. As noted above, some of our main
results will be proved using techniques from computability theory. Thus, we first
make our notion of ‘computability’ precise as follows.
(I) We adopt ZFC, i.e. Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice,
as the official metatheory for all results, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
(II) We adopt Kleene’s notion of higher-order computation as given by his nine
clauses S1-S9 (See [46, 68]) as our official notion of ‘computable’.
For the rest of this section, we introduce some existing axioms which will be used
below. These functionals constitute the counterparts of Z2 , and some of the Big
Five, in higher-order RM by Remark B.1. First of all, ACA0 is readily derived from:

(∃µ2 )(∀f 1 ) (∃n)(f (n) = 0) → [f (µ(f )) = 0 ∧ (∀i < µ(f ))f (i) 6= 0]
(µ2 )

in the left-hand side of (S 2 )) is true or false. We similarly define the functional Sk2
which decides the truth or falsity of Σ1k -formulas; we also define the system Π1k -CAω

and we therefore define ZΩ

also called ‘∃3 ’, and we use the same convention for other functionals.
Finally, recall that the Heine-Borel theorem (aka Cousin’s lemma) states the existence of a finite sub-cover for an open cover of a compact space. Now, a functional
Ψ : R → R+ gives rise to the canonical cover ∪x∈I IxΨ for I ≡ [0, 1], where IxΨ is
the open interval (x − Ψ(x), x + Ψ(x)). Hence, the uncountable cover ∪x∈I IxΨ has
a finite sub-cover by the Heine-Borel theorem; in symbols:

(∀Ψ : R → R+ )(∃hy1 , . . . , yk i)(∀x ∈ I)(∃i ≤ k)(x ∈ IyΨi ).

By Theorem 4.2 below, ZΩ

2 proves HBU, but Πk -CA0 + QF-AC
As studied in [58, §3], many basic properties of the gauge integral are equivalent to
HBU. By Remark 4.10, we may drop the requirement that Ψ in HBU needs to be
extensional on the reals, i.e. Ψ does not have to satisfy (RE) from Definition 2.3.
Furthermore, since Cantor space (denoted C or 2N ) is homeomorphic to a closed
subset of [0, 1], the former inherits the same property. In particular, for any G2 ,
∗
the corresponding ‘canonical cover’ of 2N is ∪f ∈2N [f G(f )] where [σ 0 ] is the set of
all binary extensions of σ. By compactness, there is a finite sequence hf0 , . . . , fn i
such that the set of ∪i≤n [f¯i G(fi )] still covers 2N . By [58, Theorem 3.3], HBU is
equivalent to the same compactness property for C, as follows:

(∀G2 )(∃hf1 , . . . , fk i)(∀f 1 ≤1 1)(∃i ≤ k)(f ∈ [fi G(fi )]).

(HBUc )

We now introduce the specification SCF(Θ) for a (non-unique) functional Θ which
computes a finite sequence as in HBUc . We refer to such a functional Θ as a realiser
for the compactness of Cantor space, and simplify its type to ‘3’.
(∀G2 )(∀f 1 ≤1 1)(∃g ∈ Θ(G))(f ∈ [gG(g)]).

(SCF(Θ))

Clearly, there is no unique such Θ (just add more binary sequences to Θ(G));
nonetheless, we have in the past referred to any Θ satisfying SCF(Θ) as ‘the’ special
fan functional Θ, and we will continue this abuse of language. As to its provenance,
Θ was introduced as part of the study of the Gandy-Hyland functional in [69, §2]

10

via a slightly different definition. These definitions are identical up to a term of
Gödel’s T of low complexity by [57, Theorem 2.6]. As shown in [58, §3], one readily
obtains a realiser Θ from HBU if the latter is given; in fact, it is straightforward to
establish HBU ↔ (∃Θ)SCF(Θ) over ACA0 + QF-AC.
In conclusion, we have sketched the ‘received view’ of RM in Section 2.1, including the elegant ‘Big Five’ picture and linear order (2.1). As noted in Section 1.3,
the framework of RM is second-order arithmetic, i.e. higher-order objects are represented via codes. However, the higher-order language described in Section 2.2
allows us to study e.g. the Heine-Borel theorem for uncountable covers as in HBU;
the latter does not fit (at all) in the elegant ‘Big Five’ picture as HBU can only
be proved from full second-order arithmetic (as given by ∃3 ). Numerous natural
higher-order theorems with similarly ‘deviant’ behaviour are studied in [58], and a
number of new such results are obtained in this paper. We leave it to the reader to
decide the implications of all this for the ‘Big Five picture’ of RM.
3. Pincherle’s theorem in computability theory
We answer the first two questions from Section 1.1. In Section 3.1, we show
that Pincherle realisers (PR hereafter) from Section 1.2, cannot be computed by
any type two functional. We also show that any PR (uniformly) give rise to a nonBorel continuous functional. The latter result follows from the extension theorem
(Theorem 3.3). In Section 3.2, we discuss similar questions for PITo .
3.1. Pincherle realisers. In this section we show that any PR has both considerable computational strength and hardness, as captured by the following theorems.
Theorem 3.1. There is no PR that is computable in a functional of type two.
Theorem 3.2. There is an arithmetical functional F of type (1 × 1) → 0 such that
for any PR M we have that G(f ) = M (λg.F (f, g)) is not Borel continuous.
Theorem 3.3 (Extension Theorem). Let M be a PR and let e0 be a Kleene index
for a partially computable functional Φ(F ) = {e0 }(F, µ). Then, uniformly in M , Φ
has a total extension (depending on M ) that is primitive recursive in M, µ.
Note that Theorem 3.3 is the ‘higher-order’ version of a known extension theorem. Indeed, by Corollary 4.7, PITo is equivalent to WKL, and the latter implies:
If a partially computable f : N → N is bounded by a total computable function,
then f has a total extension.
By the low basis theorem, the extension may be chosen to be of low degree.
Now, PRs are realisers for uniform Pincherle’s theorem (and for uniform WKL by
Remark 4.21), and Theorem 3.3 is the associated ‘higher-order’ extension theorem,
where the concept of computability is relativised to Feferman’s µ using S1-S9. By
Corollary 3.7, PRs also yield a higher-order version of the well-known separation
theorem for Σ01 -sets that follows from WKL (See e.g. [72, I.11.7]). The analogy
with the low basis theorem will be that we can separate pairwise disjoint sets of
type 2 functionals, semi-computable in µ, with a set relative to which not all semicomputable sets are computable, so separation does not imply comprehension for
sets semi-computable in µ. It would be interesting to learn if some PRs can provide
us with an analogue of sets of low degree.
We first prove Theorem 3.1. The proof is similar to the proof of the fact that no
special fan functional Θ is computable in any type two functional (See [56, §3]).

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

11

Proof. Suppose that M is a PR and that M is computable in the functional H of
type two. Without loss of generality, we may assume that ∃2 is computable in H,
so the machinery of Gandy selection ([46, p. 210]) is at our disposal. We define the
(partial) functional G : C → N ∪ {⊥} by G(f ) = e + 1 where e is the index of f as
a function computable in H obtained by application of Gandy selection. We put
G(f ) = ⊥ if f is not computable in H.
Now let Ĝ be any total extension of G. If we evaluate M (Ĝ) = a following the
assumed algorithm for M from H, we see that we actually can replace Ĝ with G
in the full computation tree (using that G is partially computable in H, so we will
only call upon Ĝ(f ) for H-computable f ). Thus M (Ĝ) is independent of the choice
of Ĝ. On the other hand, we have that for any N , the set of g where the bounding
condition LOC(F, G) forces F (g) to be bounded by N is a small, clopen set, and if
we let Ĝ(g) > N for all g not computable in H, we obtain a contradiction.

We now prove a number of theorems, culminating in a proof of Theorem 3.3.
We assume M to be a PR for the rest of this section.
Theorem 3.4. For each Kleene-index e0 and all numbers a0 , n there are arithmetical, uniformly in e0 , a0 , n, functionals F 7→ Fe0 ,a0 ,n of type 2 → 2 such that
if {e0 }(F, µ)↓, we can, independently of the choice of M , find the value a of the
computation from λ(a0 , n).M (Fe0 ,a0 ,n ) in an arithmetical manner.
Proof. We let M , F , e0 , a0 and n be fixed throughout. We first need some notation.
Let R be a preordering of a domain D ⊆ N. For x ∈ D, we denote
• [x]R = {y ∈ D | (y, x) ∈ R}
• [x]R = {y ∈ D | (y, x) ∈ R ∧ ¬((x, y) ∈ R)}
• Rx is R restricted to [x]R
• Rx is R restricted to [x]R
Let f ∈ C and define Df := {x | f (hx, xi) = 1} and Rf := {(x, y) | f (hx, yi) =
1}, where x, y ∈ N. Let PRE be the set of f ∈ C such that Rf is a preordering of
Df . Then PRE is a Π01 -set, and for each f 6∈ PRE, we can find an integer k such
that [f¯k] ∩ PRE = ∅.
Let ΓF be the monotone inductive definition of DF = {he, ~a, bi | {e}(F, µ, ~a) =
b}. Since each valid computation {e}(F, µ, ~a) = b has an ordinal rank khe, ~a, bikF <
ℵ1 , let RF be the pre-well-ordering on DF induced by k · kF . Then RF is the least
fixed point of an, uniformly in F , arithmetical and monotone inductive definition
α
is always an end extension of ∆α
∆F such that ∆α+1
F , where we write ∆F for
F
α
∆F (∅).
Now, let R be any preordering of the domain D ⊆ N. We call x ∈ D an F point if Rx = ∆F (Rx ) We let D[F ] be the maximal R-initial segment consisting of
F -points, and we let R[F ] be R restricted to D[F ].
Claim 1: If R[F ] does not contain RF as an initial segment, then R[F ] is an
initial segment of RF .
Proof of Claim 1. Let α be the least ordinal such that ∆α
F is not an initial segment
S
of R[F ]. Then β<α ∆βF is an initial segment of R[F ]. If this is all of R[F ], we
are through, since then R[F ] is an initial segment of RF . If not, there is some
S
x ∈ D[F ] such that β<α ∆βF is an initial segment of Rx [F ]. But since x is an

12

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

F -point and ∆F is monotone we have that Rx [F ] = ∆F (Rx [F ]) and that ∆α
F is an
initial segment of Rx [F ], contradicting the choice of α. Claim 1 now follows.
For now, assume that f ∈ PRE.
Claim 2: If Rf [F ] is not a fixed point of ∆F , there is k ∈ N, µ-computable from
F, f , such that whenever g ∈ PRE such that ∆F (Rf [F ]) is an initial segment of
Rg [F ] we have that g(k) 6= f (k).
Proof of Claim 2. If there is a pair (y, x) ∈ ∆F (Rf [F ]) such that f (hy, xi) = 0, we
can just let k = hy, xi for one such pair, chosen by numerical search. Now assume
f (hy, xi) = 1 when (y, x) ∈ ∆F (Rf [F ]). Since we for all x ∈ Df [F ] have that
(Rf )x ⊆ (Rf )x = ∆F ((Rf )x ) and ∆F is monotone, we must have that Rf [F ] ⊆
∆F (Rf [F ]). Further, since Rf [F ] is not a fixed point of ∆F , we must have some x
such that (x, x) ∈ ∆F (Rf [F ]) \ Rf [F ]. Since this x is not an F -point, and since
f (hx, yi) = f (hy, xi) = 1
whenever (x, y) ∈ ∆F (Rf [F ]) and (y, x) ∈ ∆F (Rf [F ]), there must be a y such that
f (hx, yi) = f (hy, xi) = 1, but (x, y) 6∈ ∆F (Rf [F ]) or (y, x) 6∈ ∆F (Rf [F ]). We can
find such a pair k = hx, yi or k = hy, xi by effective search. Claim 2 now follows.
We now define Fe0 ,a0 ,n (f ), where f ∈ C is not necessarily in PRE anymore.
Definition 3.5. We define Fe0 ,a0 ,n (f ) by cases, assuming for each case that the
previous cases fail:
(1) For f 6∈ PRE, let Fe0 ,a0 ,n (f ) = k for the least k such that [f¯k] ∩ PRE = ∅
(2) There is an a ∈ N such that
(2.i) he0 , ai is in the domain of Rf [F ]
(2.ii) For no b ∈ N with b 6= a do we have that (he0 , bi, he0 , ai) ∈ Rf [F ].
We then let Fe0 ,a0 ,n (f ) = 0 if a 6= a0 and n if a = a0 .
(3) Rf [F ] is a fixed point of ∆F . Then let Fe0 ,a0 ,n (f ) = 0.
(4) Rf [F ] is not a fixed point of ∆F . Then let Fe0 ,a0 ,n (f ) = k + 1, where k is
the number identified in Claim 2.
We now prove the theorem via establishing the following final claim.
Claim 3: If {e0 }(F, µ)↓, the following algorithm provides the result:
{e0 }(F, µ) is the unique a0 for which {M (Fe0 ,a0 ,n ) | n ∈ N} is infinite.
This algorithm is uniformly arithmetical in M , by definition.
Proof of Claim 3. Assume that {e0 }(F, µ) = a. Then he0 , ai is in the well founded
part of RF . If a 6= a0 , we see from the definition of Fe0 ,a0 ,n that this functional
is independent of n, so M (Fe0 ,a0 ,n ) has a fixed value independent of n. If a = a0
we claim that M (F0 , a0 , n) ≥ n, and the conclusion follows: Let g ∈ C be such
that RF = Rg [F ], and let f be arbitrary such that g ∈ [f¯Fe0 ,a0 ,n (f )]. If f 6∈ PRE,
we clearly do not have that g ∈ [f¯Fe0 ,a0 ,n (f )], so the first item from Definition 3.5
does not apply. If f ∈ PRE, but he0 , a0 i is not in the domain of Rf [F ], then by
Claim 1, Rf [F ] is a proper initial segment of RF , and using Claim 2 we have chosen
Fe0 ,a0 ,n (f ) = k + 1 in such a way that g(k) 6= f (k). Then, by our assumption on
f , we must have that he0 , a0 i is in the domain of Rf [F ], and since this appearance
will be in the well-founded part, there will be no competing values b at the same
or lower level. Then we set the value of Fe0 ,a0 ,n (f ) to n.


UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

13

As an immediate consequence, we obtain a proof of Theorem 3.3.
Proof. Let Fe0 ,a0 ,n be as in the proof of Theorem 3.4. Define Ψ(F ) = a0 if a0 is
unique such that M (Fe0 ,a0 ,n ) ≥ n for all n, and define Ψ(F ) = 0 if there is no such
unique a0 .

Finally, we list some corollaries to the theorem.
Corollary 3.6. Let Φ3 be partial and Kleene-computable in µ. Then for any PR
M there is a total extension of Φ that is primitive recursive in M and µ.
This is almost a rephrasing of Theorem 3.3, modulo some coding of mixed types.
Corollary 3.7. Let X and Y be disjoint sets of functionals of type 2, both semicomputable in µ. Then, for each PR M , there is a set Z primitive recursive in M
and µ, that separates X and Y .
Proof. Since we use µ as a parameter, we have Gandy selection in a uniform way,
so there will be a partial function computable relative to µ that takes the value 0
on X and 1 on Y . Then apply Corollary 3.6.

As a special case, we obtain the proof of Theorem 3.2, as follows.
Proof. Let X = {(e, f ) | {e}(e, f, µ) = 0} and Y = {(e, f ) | {e}(e, f, µ) = 1}.
X and Y are Borel-inseparable disjoint Π11 -sets, but can be separated using one
parameterised application of M .

As another application of Corollary 3.6 we see that the partial enumeration of all
hyperarithmetical functions, which is partially computable in µ, can be extended
to a total enumeration primitive recursive in M and µ for all Pincherle realisers M .
We leave further applications to the imagination of the reader.
The previous results, as well as the equivalence in Corollary 4.6, suggest a strong
similarity between the special fan functional Θ and PRs. In fact, Theorem 3.1
can be seen as a consequence of the following theorem and the properties of Θ
established in [56, 57]. We establish (and make essential use of) the equivalences in
Theorem 3.8 when discussing Heine’s theorem below.
Theorem 3.8. Let G : C → N. The following are equivalent for each n ∈ N
(1) There is a PR M with M (G) = n
(2) There is a special fan functional Θ such that G(f ) ≤ n for each f ∈ Θ(G)
(3) There are f1 , . . . , fk ∈ C with C ⊂ ∪i≤k [f¯i G(fi )] and n ≥ G(fi ) for i ≤ k.
Despite these similarities, there are certain fundamental differences between the
special fan functional and Pincherle realisers, leading to the following conjecture.
Even if the latter turns out to be incorrect, we still expect that there is no uniform
way to compute an instance of Θ from an instance of M , even modulo ∃2 .
Conjecture 3.9. There is M03 satisfying PR(M0 ) such that no Θ3 as in SCF(Θ))
is computable (S1-S9) in M03 .
We finish this section with a remark on the exact formulation of (realisers for)
local boundedness; recall that we used one functional G in LOC(F, G).

14

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

Remark 3.10. In order to be faithful to the original formulation of Pincherle, the
bounding condition has to be given by two functionals G1 and G2 , as follows:


LOC∗ (F, G1 , G2 ) ≡ (∀f, g ∈ C) g ∈ [f G1 (f )] → F (g) ≤ G2 (f ) .

Let M ∗ be a functional which on input (G1 , G2 ) provides an upper bound on C
for F satisfying LOC∗ (F, G1 , G2 ). A PR M can be reduced to such M ∗ , and vice
versa, as follows: M (G) = M ∗ (G, G) and M ∗ (G1 , G2 ) = M (max{G1 , G2 }).
3.2. Realisers for Pincherle’s original theorem. In this section, we study the
computational properties of realisers for PITo . As discussed in Section 3.2.1, there
are two natural examples of such realisers (in contrast to PITu , where there was
only one natural choice). We show in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 that these two classes
of realisers have extremely different computational properties.
3.2.1. Introduction. In the previous section we have established that Pincherle realisers, i.e. realisers for PITu , are hard to compute, and Theorem 4.3 shall establish
that PITu is similarly hard to prove. This correspondence between computational
and first-order ‘hardness’ also4 holds for Heine-Borel compactness by [58, §3]. Moreover, the linear order (2.1), and even the Gödel hierarchy (See Appendix B), is based
on the very idea that computational and first-order hardness line up.
In this section, we show that PITo does not follow the aforementioned correspondence. Indeed, on one hand PITo is easy to prove: it essentially follows from WKL
by Corollary 4.7. On the other hand, the two natural notions of ‘realiser for PITo ’
will be shown to be hard to compute. These two kinds of realisers arise from the
two possible kinds of realisers for ATR0 : based on (3.1) and (3.2) respectively. The
latter formulas are classically equivalent, but yield very different realisers.
Remark 3.11. In [56, 57] we proved that a special fan functional Θ (with Feferman’s µ) computes a realiser for ATR0 as follows: given a total ordering ‘≺’ and an
arithmetical operator ‘Γ’, we can compute a pair (x, y) such that either x codes a
Γ-chain over ≺, or y codes a ≺-descending sequence. This is a realiser for:
¬WO(≺) ∨ (∃X ⊂ N)(X is a Γ-chain over ≺).

(3.1)

The situation is different for PRs: if ≺ is a well-ordering, then we can compute
the unique Γ-chain X, and by the Extension Theorem 3.3, there is for any PR M ,
a total functional ∆(≺, Γ) that is primitive recursive in M, µ, and that gives us a
Γ-chain (over ≺) assuming ≺ is a well-ordering. The difference is that for PRs, no
information is provided when ≺ is not a well-ordering. This yields a realiser for:
WO(≺) → (∃X ⊂ N)(X is a Γ-chain over ≺).

(3.2)

Below, we will consider two similar kinds of realisers for PITo , and we will see that
the difference in complexity is considerable. As an aside, it is an open problem if
it is possible to compute realisers for ATR0 of the strong kind (3.1) from a PR, a
problem intimately connected to the problem if HBU is computationally derivable
from PITo via realisers (and relative to µ).
4Indeed, the special fan functional Θ is a realiser for HBU , and Θ cannot be computed by any
c
type two functional, while Π1k -CAω
0 cannot prove HBUc by the results in [56, §3].

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

3.2.2. Weak Pincherle realisers. We introduce a notion of realiser for PITo based
on (3.1). To this end, note that (3.3) is the latter with all quantifiers brought to
the front. It is extremely hard to compute the underlined objects in (3.3) in terms
of F, G, by Corollary 3.15. We will later discuss why this is to be expected.
(∀F, G : C → N)(∃N ∈ N, f, g ∈ C)(∀h ∈ C)

g ∈ [f G(f )] → F (g) ≤ G(f ) → (F (h) ≤ N ) .

By contrast, bringing WKL in the same form as (3.3), one readily5 obtains a witnessing functional. In conclusion, the behaviour of PITo in RM seems to diverge
completely from its computability-theoretic behaviour.
We now introduce the following specification for a non-unique functional computing N, f, g as in (3.3). Note that the number i can be obtained by checking if
f, g witness ¬LOC(F, G).
Definition 3.12. [WPR(Mo )] For any F, G : C → N, Mo (F, G) = (i0 , N 0 , f 1 , g 1 )
is such that either i = 0 and N is an upper bound for F on C, or i = 1 and
g ∈ [f¯G(f )] ∧ F (g) > G(f ), i.e. the functions f, g witness ¬LOC(F, G).
Any Mo satisfying WPR(Mo ) is called a weak Pincherle realiser (WPR for
short). We emphasise the modifier ‘weak’: (3.3) and Definition 3.12 may seem
to be the most natural choice, esp. following the idea of realisers and the aforementioned results on HBUc , but the computational strength of any WPR, as established
below, immediately disqualifies it as a ‘true’ realiser.
For our next results, we need the following functional, similar to κ3 from [56]:

(∃κ30 ≤3 1)(∀Y 2 ) κ0 (Y ) = 0 ↔ (∃f ∈ C)Y (f ) = 0 .

Theorem 3.13. The system ACAω
0 proves (∃M )WPR(M ) → (κ0 ).

H(f ) :=

(n + 1) · F (g) if f =1 σn ∗ 0 ∗ g
Note that µ2 , F suffices to define the functional H; The latter is constant 0 on C
if F is constant 0 on C, and unbounded otherwise. Let M be such that WPR(M ),
i.e. if M (H, G) = (i, N, f, g) we have that either N is an upper bound for H on
Cantor space or that H(g) > G(f ). Hence, by evaluating H(g) we can decide if H,
and thus F , is constant 0.

The formula in square brackets is quantifier-free. Then QF-AC

Proof. The reverse implication follows from obtaining PITo via Theorem 4.4, and
then applying QF-AC2,1 to obtain (∃M )WPR(M ). The forward implication follows
from [(∃2 ) + (κ30 )] ↔ (∃3 ) and the theorem.

Corollary 3.15. A WPR combined with µ2 computes ∃3 via a term of Gödel’s T .
The converse of this corollary’, even when we replace Gödel’s T with Kleene’s
S1-S9, is not provable in ZFC, essentially due to the fact that QF-AC2,1 has no
realiser provably computable in ∃3 .
3.2.3. Another realiser for Pincherle’s theorem. We introduce another realiser for
PITo , based on (3.2), after some discussion why WPRs are not satisfactory.
First of all, the concept of WPRs turned out to be too strong, because defining
a realiser for the prenex normal form of PITo (almost) induces the ability to decide
the relation LOC(F, G), and the definition will use unbounded quantifiers over C
with type two parameters. Moreover it (almost) induces the ability to select an
element of an arbitrary non-empty subset of C. It does not reflect what we aim for
with realisers: given that LOC(F, G), how hard is it to find an upper bound for G?
Secondly, if we chose not to rewrite PITo to its prenex normal form, then it is
natural to consider a functional Mo∗ as a ‘realiser for PITo ’ if Mo∗ (F, G) is an upper
bound for G whenever LOC(F, G), but containing no information about F or G
in the case of ¬LOC(F, G), similar to (3.2). Clearly, every realiser for PITu is a
realiser for PITo in this sense, but since PITu is not logically derivable from PITo ,
we cannot expect to be able to compute any PR from these simpler forms.
However, even though by Corollary 4.7, PITo is provable in a weak logical system,
using a modest version of the axiom of choice, it is impossible to compute any of
these modest realisers from any type two functional:
Theorem 3.16. There is no functional Mo∗ at type level 3 computable in any type
2 functional such that
∀F 2 , G2 (LOC(F, G) → ∀f 1 (G(f ) ≤ Mo∗ (F, G))),

(MPR(Mo∗ ))

Proof. The proof follows the pattern of our proofs of similar results. Let H with
µ ≤Kleene H be any type 2 functional, and assume that Mo∗ is computable in
H. Let F ∗ be partially H-computable and injective on the set of H-computable
functions, taking only values > 1 and let G∗ be the constant 0. Then LOC(F, G∗ )
for any total extension F of F ∗ .
The computation of Mo∗ (F, G∗ ) = N from H will then only make oracle calls
F (f ) = F ∗ (f ) or G(f ) = 0 for a countable set of f ’s enumerable by an Hcomptutable function. If we let G(f ) = N + 1 if f is neither in this enumerated set
nor in any neighbourhood induced by F ∗ (f ) where F ∗ (f ) ≤ N , and 0 elsewhere,
and we let F (f ) = F ∗ (f ) when defined, and N + 1 elsewhere, we still have that
M0∗ (F, G) = N , LOC(F, G), but not that N is an upper bound for G. This is the
desired contradiction.

Note that ‘MPR’ stands for ‘modest PR’ in the theorem. Despite this suggestive
name, the combination of Theorem 3.18 and Theorem 4.3 yields a model that
satisfies Π1k -CAω
0 , but falsifies PITu and is lacking any and all realisers for Pincherle’s
theorem. A functional of type two is normal if it computes the functional ∃2 .

Theorem 3.18. For any normal H 2 , the type structure MH is a model for QF-AC0,1 ,
¬PITu , PITo , (∀Mo )¬WPR(Mo ), (∀Mu )¬PR(Mu ), and (∀Mo∗ )¬MPR(Mo∗ ).
Proof. Fix N ∈ N and let H ∗ (f ) = e + 1 where e is some H-index for f found using
Gandy selection. The first claim follows readily from Gandy selection. The second
claim is proved as for [58, Theorem 3.4] by noting that H ∗ restricted to the finite
set {f1 , . . . , fk } of functions f with H ∗ (f ) ≤ N does not induce a sufficiently large
sub-cover of C to guarantee that all F satisfying the bounding condition induced
by H ∗ is bounded by N .
H
In order to prove the third claim, let G ∈ MH
2 be arbitrary, and let F ∈ M2
satisfy the bounding condition induced by G. Assume that F is unbounded. Then,
employing Gandy selection we can, computably in H, find a sequence {fi }i∈N such
that F (fi ) > i for all i. Using ∃2 we can then find a convergent subsequence
and compute its limit f . Then F will be bounded by G(f ) on the set [f¯G(f )],
contradicting the choice of the sequence fi .
H
In order to prove the fourth claim, assume that Mo ∈ MH
3 is a WPR in M .
∗
Let F be the constant zero, and let Mo (H , F ) = (i, N, f0 , g0 ). We now use that
Mo is computable in H, and that thus the computation tree of Mo (F, H ∗ ) in itself
is computable in H. Let f1 , . . . , fk be as in the argument for the second claim.
There will be some f computable in H that is not in any of the neigbourhoods
[f¯i H ∗ (fi )] and such that F (f ) is not called upon in the computation of Mo (F, H ∗ ).
We may now define FN so that FN (f ) = 0 if F (f ) = 0 is used in the computation
of Mo (G, H ∗ ) or if f ∈ [f¯i (H ∗ (fi )] for i = 1, . . . , k, and we let FN (f ) = N + 1
otherwise. Then the computation of Mo (FN , H ∗ ) yields the same value as the
computation of Mo (F, H ∗ ) and FN still satisfies the bounding condition induced
by H ∗ , but the output does not give an upper bound for FN . Since we never used
f0 , g0 in Mo (H ∗ , F ) in this argument, the fifth and sixth claims follow.

4. Pincherle’s and Heine’s theorem in Reverse Mathematics
We classify the various forms of Pincherle’s and Heine’s theorems from Sections 1.2 and 1.3 within the framework of higher-order RM. Sections 5 is devoted
to a detailed study of the proof techniques used in this section, the role of the axiom
of choice and the law of excluded middle in particular.
4.1. Pincherle’s theorem and second-order arithmetic. We formulate a supremum principle which allows us to easily obtain HBU and PITu from (∃3 ); this constitutes a significant improvement over the results in [58, §3]. We show that PITu
ω
0,1
is not provable in any Π1k -CAω
proves PITo .
0 , but that ACA0 + QF-AC
First of all, a formula ϕ(x1 ) is called extensional on R if we have
(∀x, y ∈ R)(x =R y → ϕ(x) ↔ ϕ(y)).
Note that the same condition is used in RM for defining open sets as in [72, II.5.7].
Principle 4.1 (LUB). For second-order ϕ (with any parameters), if ϕ(x1 ) is extensional on R and ϕ(0) ∧ ¬ϕ(1), there is a least y ∈ [0, 1] such that (∀z ∈ (y, 1])¬ϕ(y).

18

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

Secondly, we have the following theorem, which should be compared8 to [34, §2].
The reversal of the final implication is proved in Corollary 4.6, using QF-AC0,1 .
3
Theorem 4.2. The system RCAω
0 proves (∃ ) → LUB → HBU → HBUc → PITu .

Proof. For the first implication, note that (∃3 ) can decide the truth of any formula
ϕ(x) as in LUB. Hence, the usual interval-halving technique yields the least upper
bound as required by LUB. For the second implication, fix Ψ : R → R+ and consider
∗

ϕ(x) ≡ x ∈ [0, 1] ∧ (∃w1 )(∀y 1 ∈ [0, x])(∃z ∈ w)(y ∈ IzΨ ),
which is clearly extensional on R. Note that ϕ(0) holds with w = h0i, and if ϕ(1),
then HBU for Ψ follows. In case ¬ϕ(1), we use LUB to find the least y0 ∈ [0, 1) such
that (∀z >R y0 )¬ϕ(y). However, by definition [0, y0 −Ψ(y0 )/2] has a finite sub-cover
(of the canonical cover provided by Ψ), and hence clearly so does [0, y0 + Ψ(y0 )/2],
a contradiction. For the final implication, to obtain PITu , let F0 , G0 be such that
∗
LOC(F0 , G0 ) and let w01 be the finite sequence from HBUc for G = G0 . Then F0
is clearly bounded by maxi<|w| G0 (w(i)) on Cantor space, and the same holds for
any F such that LOC(F, G0 ), as is readily apparent.
Finally, HBU → HBUc is readily proved given (∃2 ), since the latter provides a
functional which converts real numbers into their binary representation(s). Moreover, in case ¬(∃2 ) all functions on Baire space are continuous by [38, Prop. 3.7].
Hence, HBUc just follows from WKL0 (which is immediate from HBU): the latter lemma suffices to prove that a continuous function is uniformly continuous on
Cantor space by [39, Prop. 4.10], and hence bounded. The law of excluded middle
(∃2 ) ∨ ¬(∃2 ) finishes this part, as we proved HBU → HBUc for each disjunct.

The first part of the proof is similar to Lebesgue’s proof of the Heine-Borel
theorem from [43]. We also note that Bolzano used a theorem similar to LUB (See
[5, p. 269]). We now establish that PITu is extremely hard to prove.
ω
0,1
1
Theorem 4.3. The system Zω
2 proves PITu , while no system Πk -CA0 + QF-AC
(k ≥ 1) proves it.

Proof. The first part follows from Theorem 4.2. For the second part, we construct
0,1
a countable model M for Π1k -CAω
assuming that V = L, where L is
0 + QF-AC
Gödel’s universe of constructible sets. This is not a problem, since the model M
we construct also is a model in the full set-theoretical universe V. However, this
means that when we write Sk2 in this proof, we really mean the relativised version
(Sk2 )L . The advantage is that due to the ∆12 -well-ordering of NN in L, if a set
A ⊆ NN is closed under computability relative to all Sk2 , all Π1k -sets are absolute
for (A, L) and hence (Sk2 )A is a sub-functional of (Sk2 )L for each k. We now drop
the superscript ‘L’ for the rest of the proof. Put Sω2 (k, f ) := Sk2 (f ) and note that
2
Sω2 is a normal functional in which all Sk2 are computable. Let M = MSω be as in
Definition 3.17. This model is as requested by Theorem 3.18, i.e. ¬PITu holds. 
The model M can be used to show that many classical theorems based on un0,1
countable data cannot be proved in any system Π1k -CAω
, e.g. the Vitali
0 + QF-AC
covering lemma and the uniform Heine theorem from Section 1.3.
8Keremedis proves in [34] that the statement a countably compact metric space is compact is
not provable in ZF minus the axiom of foundation. This theorem does follow when the axiom of
countable choice is added.

19

Finally, we show that PITo is much easier to prove than PITu . By contrast,
weak Pincherle realisers, i.e. realisers for PITo , are extremely hard to compute
as established in Section 3.2. As a result, the behaviour of PITo in RM diverges
completely from its computability-theoretic behaviour.
0,1
Theorem 4.4. The system ACAω
proves PITo .
0 + QF-AC

Proof. Recall that ACA0 is equivalent to various convergence theorems by [72, III.2],
i.e. ACAω
0 proves that a sequence in Cantor space has a convergent subsequence.
Now let F, G be such that LOC(F, G) and suppose F is unbounded, i.e. (∀n0 )(∃α ≤
1)(F (α) > n). Applying QF-AC0,1 , we get a sequence αn in Cantor space such that
(∀n0 )(F (αn ) > n). By the previous, the sequence αn has a convergent subsequence,
say with limit β ≤1 1. By assumption, F is bounded by G(β) in [βG(β)], which
contradicts the fact that F (αn ) becomes arbitrarily large close enough to β.

We show that PITo ↔ WKL in Corollary 4.7. On one hand, for conceptual
reasons9, PITo cannot be stronger than WKL in terms of first-order strength. On
the other hand, reflection upon the previous proof suggests that any proof of PITo
has to involve ACAω
0 . Thus, the aforementioned equivalence is surprising.
4.2. Pincherle’s theorem and uncountable Heine-Borel. We establish that
Pincherle’s theorem PITu and Heine-Borel HBU are equivalent; note that the base
theory in the following theorem is Π12 -conservative over ACA0 by [67, Theorem 2.2].
Theorem 4.5. The system ACAω
0 + QF-AC proves
HBUc ↔ HBU ↔ (∃Θ)SCF(Θ) ↔ PITu ↔ (∃M )PR(M ).

(4.1)

Proof. The first two equivalences in (4.1) are in [58, Theorem 3.3], while HBUc →
PITu may be found in Theorem 4.2. By [58, §2.3], Θ as in SCF(Θ) computes a finite
sub-cover on input an open cover of Cantor space (given by a type two functional);
hence (∃Θ)SCF(Θ) → (∃M )PR(M ) follows in the same was as for HBUc → PITu in
the proof of Theorem 4.2. Finally, the implication (∃M )PR(M ) → PITu is trivial,
and we now prove the remaining implication PITu → HBUc in ACAω
0 + QF-AC. To
this end, fix G2 and let N0 be the bound provided by PITu . We claim:
(∀f ≤ 1)(∃g ≤ 1)(G(g) ≤ N0 ∧ f ∈ [gG(g)]).

(4.2)

Indeed, suppose ¬(4.2) and let f0 be such that (∀g ≤ 1)(f0 ∈ [gG(g)] → G(g) >
N0 ). Now use (∃2 ) to define F02 as follows: F0 (h) := N0 + 1 if h =1 f0 , and zero
otherwise. By assumption, we have LOC(F0 , G), but clearly F (f0 ) > N0 and PITu
yields a contradiction. Hence, PITu implies (4.2), and the latter provides a finite
sub-cover for the canonical cover ∪f ≤1 [f G(f )]. Indeed, apply QF-AC1,1 to (4.2) to
obtain a functional Φ1→1 providing g in terms of f . The finite sub-cover (of length

2N0 ) then consists of all Φ(σ ∗ 00 . . . ) for all binary σ of length N0 .
By the previous proof, a Pincherle realiser M provides an upper bound, namely
2M(G) , for the size of the finite sub-cover of the canonical cover of G, but the
contents of that cover is not provided (explicitly) in terms of M . This observed
difference between the special fan functional Θ and Pincherle realisers also supports
the conjecture that Θ is not computable in any PR as in Conjecture 3.9.
9The ECF-translation is discussed in the context of RCAω in [38, §2]. Applying ECF to PIT ,
o
0
we obtain a sentence equivalent to WKL0 , and hence PITo has the first-order strength of WKL.

The previous theorem is of historical interest: Hildebrandt discusses the history
of the Heine-Borel theorem in [31] and qualifies Pincherle’s theorem as follows.
Another result carrying within it the germs of the Borel Theorem
is due to S. Pincherle [. . . ] ([31, p. 424])
The previous theorem provides evidence for Hildebrandt’s claim, while the following
two corollaries provide a better result, for PITu and PITo respectively.
0,1
Corollary 4.6. The system RCAω
proves PITu ↔ HBUc ↔ HBU.
0 + QF-AC

Proof. The reverse implications are immediate (over RCAω
0 ) from Theorem 4.2. For
the first forward implication, PITo readily implies WKL as follows: If a tree T ≤1 1
has no path, i.e. (∀f ≤ 1)(∃n)(f n 6∈ T ), then using quantifier-free induction and
QF-AC1,0 , there is H 2 such that (∀f ≤ 1)(f H(f ) 6∈ T ) and H(f ) is the least such
number. Clearly H 2 is continuous on Cantor space and has itself as a modulus of
continuity. Hence, H 2 is also locally bounded, with itself as a realiser for this fact.
By PITo , H is bounded on Cantor space, which yields that T ≤ 1 is finite.
Secondly, if we have (∃2 ), then the (final part of the) proof of Theorem 4.5 goes
through by applying QF-AC0,1 to
∗

(∀σ 0 ≤ 1)(∃g ≤ 1)(|σ| = N0 ∧ G(g) ≤ N0 ∧ σ ∈ [gG(g)]).

(4.3)

rather than using (4.2). On the other hand, if we have ¬(∃2 ), then [38, Prop. 3.7]
yields that all G2 are continuous on Baire space. Since WKL is given, [39, 4.10]
implies that all G2 are uniformly continuous on Cantor space, and hence have an
upper bound there. The latter immediately provides a finite sub-cover for the
canonical cover of G2 , and HBUc follows. Since we are working with classical logic,
we may conclude HBUc by invoking the law of excluded middle (∃2 ) ∨ ¬(∃2 ).
Finally, HBUc → HBU was proved over RCAω
0 in [58, Theorem 3.3].



The previous proof suggests the RM of HBU is rather robust: given a theorem
T such that [T + (∃2 )] → HBU → T → WKL, we ‘automatically’ obtain HBU ↔ T
over the same base theory, using the previous ‘excluded middle trick’.
Note that QF-AC0,1 is interesting in its own right as it is exactly what is needed to
prove the pointwise equivalence between epsilon-delta and sequential continuity for
Polish spaces, i.e. ZF alone does not suffice (See [38, Rem. 3.13]). Furthermore, the
previous proof provides a method for ‘upgrading’ a result RCAω

Corollary 4.7. The system RCAω

Proof. The reverse direction is immediate by the first part of the proof of the
0,1
previous corollary. For the forward direction, working in RCAω
+ WKL,
0 + QF-AC
2
first assume (∃ ) and note that Theorem 4.4 yields PITo in this case. Secondly, again
0,1
working in RCAω
+ WKL, assume ¬(∃2 ) and note that all functions on
0 + QF-AC
Baire space are continuous by [38, Prop. 3.7]. Hence, HBUc just follows from WKL
as the latter suffices to prove that a continuous function is uniformly continuous
(and hence bounded) on Cantor space ([39, Prop. 4.10]). By Theorem 4.2, we
obtain PITu , and hence PITo . The law of excluded middle (∃2 ) ∨ ¬(∃2 ) now yields
the forward direction, and we are done.

By the low basis theorem ([72, VIII.2.16]), a binary tree T has a path α which
is low relative to the tree, i.e. the path α is such that the Turing jump of α is
computable from the Turing jump; the previous are statements in classical recursion
theory. In the case of PITo , a similar result is out of the question: the functions
f, g in (3.3) are extremely hard to compute from the inputs F, G by Theorem 3.15.
Finally, one further improvement of Theorem 4.5 is possible, using the fan functional as in (FF), where ‘Y 2 ∈ cont’ means that Y is continuous on NN .
(∃Φ3 )(∀Y 2 ∈ cont)(∀f, g ∈ C)(f Φ(Y ) = gΦ(Y ) → Y (f ) = Y (g)).

(FF)

Note that the previous two corollaries only dealt with third-order objects, while the
following corollary connects third and fourth-order objects.
Corollary 4.8. The system RCAω
0 + FF + QF-AC proves HBUc ↔ (∃Θ)SCF(Θ).
Proof. We only need to prove the forward implication. Working in RCAω
0 + FF,
assume (∃2 ) and note that the forward implication follows from Theorem 4.5. In
case of ¬(∃2 ), all functions on Baire space are continuous by [38, Prop. 3.7]. Hence,
Φ(Y ) from FF provides a modulus of uniform continuity for any Y 2 . The special
fan functional Θ is then defined as outputting the finite sequence of length 2Φ(Y )
consisting of all sequences σ ∗ 00 for binary σ of length Φ(Y ).

The base theory in the previous corollary is a (classical) conservative extension of
WKL0 by [38, Prop. 3.15], which is a substantial improvement over the base theory
ACAω
0 from [58, Theorem 3.3]. One proves PITu ↔ (∃M )PR(M ) over the same base
theory, and the same hold for Theorem 3.13. We can also improve Corollary 3.14.
2,1
Corollary 4.9. The system RCAω
proves (∃M )WPR(M ) ↔ (κ30 ).
0 + FF + QF-AC

Proof. Use (∃2 ) ∨ ¬(∃2 ) and Corollary 3.14.



Hence, WPRs amount to little more than the known functional, namely κ0 which
was essentially introduced in [56]. Finally, we use the above ‘excluded middle trick’
in the context of the axiom of extensionality on R.
Remark 4.10 (Real extensionality). The trick from the previous proofs involving
(∃2 ) ∨ ¬(∃2 ) has another interesting application, namely that HBU does not really
change if we drop the extensionality condition (RE) from Definition 2.3 for Ψ1→1 .
+
In particular, RCAω
0 proves HBU ↔ HBU , where the latter is HBU generalised to
1→1
any functional Ψ
such that Ψ(f ) is a positive real, i.e. Ψ1→1 need not satisfy
(RE). To prove HBU → HBU+ , note that (∃2 ) yields a functional ξ which converts
x ∈ [0, 1] to a unique binary representation ξ(x), choosing σ ∗ 00 . . . if x has two
P∞
binary representations; then λx.Ψ(r(ξ(x))) with r(α) := n=0 α(n)
2n satisfies (RE)
restricted to [0, 1], even if Ψ1→1 does not, and we have HBU → HBU+ assuming (∃2 ).
In case of ¬(∃2 ), all functionals on Baire space are continuous by [38, Prop 3.7], and
HBU → WKL yields that all functions on Cantor space are uniformly continuous
(and hence bounded). Now, consider Ψ as in HBU+ and note that for λα.Ψ(r(α))
there is n0 ∈ N such that (∀α ∈ C)(Ψ(r(α)) > 2n10 ). Hence, the canonical cover
of Ψ has a finite sub-cover consisting of r(σi ∗ 00 . . . ) where σi is the i-th binary
sequence of length n0 + 1. i.e. HBU → HBU+ follows in this case.

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

4.3. Subcontinuity and Pincherle’s theorem. We sketch an equivalent version
of Pincherle’s theorem based on an existing notion of continuity, called subcontinuity. As it happens, subcontinuity is actually used in (applied) mathematics in
various contexts: see e.g. [23, §4.7], [50, §14.2], [51, p. 318], and [44, §4].
First of all, in a rather general setting, local boundedness is equivalent to the
notion of subcontinuity, introduced by Fuller in [21]. The equivalence between
subcontinuity and local boundedness (for first-countable Haussdorf spaces X and
functions f : X → R) may be found in [66, p. 252]. For the purposes of this paper,
we restrict ourselves to I ≡ [0, 1], which simplifies the definition.
Definition 4.11. [Subcontinuity] A function f : R → R is subcontinuous on I if
for any sequence xn in I convergent to x ∈ I, f (xn ) has a convergent subsequence.
Secondly, the equivalence between subcontinuity and local boundedness (without
realisers) can then be proved as in Theorem 4.12. The weak base theory in the latter
constitutes a surprise: subcontinuity has a typical ‘sequential compactness’ flavour,
while local boundedness has a typical ‘open-cover compactness’ flavour. The former
and the latter are classified in the RM of resp. ACA0 and WKL (HBU).
0,1
Theorem 4.12. The system RCAω
proves that a function f : R → R
0 + QF-AC
is locally bounded on I if and only if it is subcontinuous on I.
0,1
Proof. We establish the equivalence in RCAω
in two steps: first we prove
0 +QF-AC
2
it assuming (∃ ) and then prove it again assuming ¬(∃2 ). The law of excluded
middle as in (∃2 ) ∨ ¬(∃2 ) then yields the theorem.
Hence, assume (∃2 ) and suppose f : R → R is subcontinuous on I but not locally
bounded. The latter assumption implies that there is x0 ∈ I such that

(∀n0 )(∃x ∈ I)(|x − x0 | <R

1
n+1

∧ |f (x)| >R n).

(4.4)

Both conjuncts in (4.4) are Σ01 -formula, i.e. we may apply QF-AC0,1 to (4.4) to
obtain Φ0→1 such that for yn := Φ(n) and x0 as in (4.4), we have
(∀n ∈ N)(|yn − x0 | <R

1
n+1

∧ |f (yn )| >R n),

(4.5)

Clearly yn converges to x0 , and hence for some function g : N → N, the subsequence
f (yg(n) ) converges to some y ∈ R by the subcontinuity of f . However, f (yg(n) ) also
grows arbitrarily large by (4.5), a contradiction, and the reverse implication follows.
Next, again assume (∃2 ); for the forward implication, suppose f is locally bounded
and let yn be a sequence in I convergent to x0 ∈ I. Then there is k ∈ N such that
for all y ∈ B(x0 , k1 ), |f (y)| ≤ k. However, for n large enough, yn lies in B(x, k1 ),
implying that |f (yn )| ≤ k for n large enough. In other words, the sequence f (yn )
eventually lies in the interval [−k, k], and hence has a convergent subsequence by
(∃2 ) and [72, I.9.3]. Thus, f is subcontinuous, and we are done with the case (∃2 ).
Finally, in case that ¬(∃2 ), any function f : R → R is everywhere sequentially
continuous and everywhere ε-δ-continuous by [38, Prop. 3.12]. Hence, any f : R → R
is also subcontinuous on I and locally bounded on I, and the equivalence from the
theorem is then trivially true.

4.4. Heine’s theorem, Fejér’s theorem, and uncountable Heine-Borel. We
prove that the uniform versions of Heine’s theorem from Section 1.3 are equivalent
to HBUc . We prove similar results for Heine’s theorem for the unit interval and

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

23

the related Fejér’s theorem. The latter states that for continuous f : R → R, the
Cesàro mean of the partial sums of the Fourier series uniformly converges to f .
We first obtain the following intermediate result.
0,1
Theorem 4.13. The system RCAω
proves UCT′u → HBUc .
0 + QF-AC

Proof. Fix G2 and let m = N0 − 1 be the number provided by UCT′u . Suppose
(4.2) is false, i.e. for some f0 ≤ 1, we have (∀g ≤ 1)(f0 ∈ [gG(g)] → G(g) > N0 ),
implying G(f0 ) ≥ N0 + 1. Define α0 : N → N as :

α0 (σ) := 0 if |σ| < N0 ∧ σ = f0 |σ|

1 otherwise

Clearly, we have α0 ∈ K0 (in fact α(σ) > 0 if |σ| ≥ N0 ), and if α0 and G satisfy the
antecedent of UCT′u , we obtain a contradiction as α0 (f0 (N0 − 1) ∗ 0) 6= α0 (f0 (N0 −
1) ∗ 1) by definition. Hence, (4.2) must hold and the proof of Corollary 4.6 now
readily yields HBUc . What remains to be shown is that MPC(G, α0 ), for which
we distinguish the following cases. First of all, MPC(G, α0 ) holds for f = f0 since
G(f0 ) ≥ N0 + 1 and hence α(f0 ) = 2 = α(g) for any g such that f0 G(f0 ) = gG(f0 ).
Secondly, if f (0) 6= f0 (0), we have α(f ) = α(g) = 1 for any g such that f (0) = g(0),
i.e. MPC(G, α0 ) also holds in this case. Thirdly, if f n = f0 n for some n ≤ N0 , then
also G(f ) > n; indeed G(f ) ≤ n would imply f0 ∈ [f G(f )], and hence G(f ) ≥
N0 + 1 by the assumption on f0 , yielding the contradiction N0 ≥ N0 + 1. Hence, if
f N0 = f0 N0 but f 6= f0 then G(f ) ≥ N0 , implying that α(f ) = 2 = α(g) for any
g ≤ 1 such that f G(f ) = gG(f ). Similarly, if f n = f0 n but f (n + 1) 6= f0 (n + 1)
for n < N0 , then G(f ) > n. By the latter, α(f ) = 1 = α(g) for any g ≤ 1 such that
f G(f ) = gG(f ). Hence MPC(G, α0 ) follows, and we are done.

Corollary 4.14. The system RCAω
proves UCT′u ↔ UCTu ↔ HBUc .
0 + QF-AC

Proof. The implication HBUc → UCTu follows by applying HBUc to the canonical
cover associated to G2 from UCT′u and taking the maximum of G evaluated at the
points in the finite sub-cover. We now prove UCTu → UCT′u , and the corollary then
follows from the theorem. Let G2 and m0 be as in UCT′u . Now for α ∈ K0 such that
MPC(G, α), apply QF-AC1,0 to (∀f 1 )(∃n0 )(α(f (n + 1)) > 0 ∧ α(f n) = 0) to obtain
H 2 which computes such n0 in terms of f 1 . Define F (f ) := α(f (H(f ) + 1)) − 1
and note that (∀f ≤ 1)(∀m ≥ G(f ))(α(f m) = F (f ) + 1) by assumption. Hence,
F is continuous with modulus of continuity G, implying that m0 is a modulus of
uniform continuity for F by UCT′u . But this implies (∀f 1 )(∃n0 ≤ m)(α(f n) > 0),
i.e. m is also a modulus of uniform continuity for α, and we are done.

An alternative proof of ‘UCTu → HBUc ’ is as follows. This argument also shows
that the same type three functionals may serve as realisers for PITu and UCTu .
Proof. This proof is based on that of PITu → HBUc : For fixed G, let N be as in
UCTu . Then for g ≤ 1 there is f ≤ 1 such that G(f ) ≤ N and ḡ(G(f )) = f¯(G(f )).
Because, if this is not the case, there is a binary sequence s of length N such that
for all f extending s we have that G(f ) > N . Then we can define F (f ) = 0 if
f does not extend s and F (f ) = f (N ) if f extends s. Then F has a modulus of
continuity given by G, but not a modulus of uniform continuity given by N .

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

The previous results establish the equivalence between the uniform version of
Heine’s theorem and the Heine-Borel theorem for uncountable covers, in the case
of Cantor space. One similarly proves the equivalence between the Heine-Borel
theorem HBU and uniform Heine’s theorem for the unit interval, as follows.
Principle 4.15 (UCTRu ). For any ε >R 0 and g : (I × R) → R+ , there is δ >R 0
such that for any f : I → R with modulus of continuity g, we have
(∀x, y ∈ I)(|x − y| <R δ) → |f (x) − f (y)| <R ε).
We shall prove that UCTRu is equivalent to the uniform version of Fejér’s theorem.
We follow the approach in [40, p. 65] and we define Iπ ≡ [−π, π].

Definition 4.16. Define σn (f, x) := n1 Rk=0 S(k, f, x), where S(n, Rf, x) := a20 +
Pn

1 π
k=1 (ak ·cos(kx)+bk ·sin(kx)) and ak := π −π f (t) cos(kt)dt, bk := π −π f (t) sin(kt)dt.
Note that Fejér’s theorem already deals with uniform convergence, i.e. the notion
of convergence in FEJu below is ‘super-uniform’ in that it only depends on the
modulus of continuity for the function.
Principle 4.17 (FEJu ). For any k ∈ N and g : (Iπ × R) → R+ , there is N ∈ N
such that for any f : Iπ → R with modulus of continuity g and f (0) = 0, we have
(∀n ≥ N, x ∈ Iπ )(|σn (f, x) − f (x)| < k1 ) ∧ (∀y ∈ Iπ , n ∈ N)(|σn (f, x)| ≤ nN ). (4.6)
Note that functions like sin x and ex can be defined in RCAω
0 by [72, II.6.5], while
WKL is needed to make sure σn makes sense by [72, IV.2.7].
R
Theorem 4.18. The system RCAω
0 + WKL proves UCTu ↔ FEJu .

Proof. For the forward implication, the modulus of uniform convergence Ψ for
Fejér’s theorem from [40, p. 65] is
Ψ(f, k) := 48(k + 1) · kf k∞ · (ωf (2(k + 1)) + 1)2 ,
for a modulus of uniform continuity ωf : N → N for f . Note that we can replace
kf k∞ by 16ωf (1) if f (0) = 0. Due to the high level of uniformity of Ψ, the first
conjunct of (4.6) immediately follows from UCTRu . For the the second conjunct of
(4.6), fix g and apply UCTRu for ε = 1 to obtain δ1 as in the latter. Now note
that any f such that f (0) = 0 and g is a modulus of continuity for f , we have
(∀x ∈ Iπ )(|f (x)| ≤ N ) where N = ⌈ 2π
δ1 ⌉. Intuitively, this N is a ‘uniform’ bound
for f that only depends on a modulus of continuity for the latter. By definition,
this also yields a uniform bound for σn (f, x) (in terms of n and N only).
For the reverse implication, note that UCTRu does not change if we additionally
require f (0) = 0, since we can consider f0 (x) := f (x) − f (0), which has the same
modulus of continuity as f . Now fix g as in UCTRu , fix x, y ∈ Iπ , ε > 0 and consider
|f (x) − f (y)| ≤ |f (x) − σn (f, x)| + |σn (f, x) − σn (f, y)| + |f (y) − σn (f, y)| (4.7)
for f with g as modulus of continuity and f (0) = 0. The first and third part
of the sum in (4.7) are both below ε/3 for n large enough. Such number, with
the required independence properties, is provided by FEJu . Moreover, σn (f, x) is
uniformly continuous on Iπ with a modulus which depends on n but not f due to
the second conjunct of (4.6). Hence, (4.7) implies that f is uniformly continuous

in the sense required by UCTRu .

Using a proof similar to that of Corollary 4.14, we obtain.

Corollary 4.19. RCAω
proves UCTRu ↔ FEJu ↔ HBU.
0 + WKL + QF-AC

By the previous, realisers for FEJu and UCTu are equi-computable modulo ∃2 .
When coded as functionals of pure type 3, these realisers are all essentially PRs,
modulo a computable scaling. Similarly, many theorems from analysis yield analogous uniform versions, and there are at least two sources: on one hand, as noted
above, the redevelopment of analysis based on techniques from the gauge integral
(as in e.g. [3]) yields uniform theorems. On the other hand, as hinted at in the
proof of Theorem 4.18, Kohlenbach’s proof mining program is known to produce
highly uniform results (See e.g. [37, Theorem 15.1]), which yield uniform versions,
like FEJu for Fejér’s theorem. We finish this section with some conceptual remarks.
Remark 4.20 (Atsuji spaces). A metric space X is called Atsuji if for any metric
space Y , any continuous function f : X → Y is uniformly continuous. The RM
study of Atsuji spaces may be found in [26, §4], and one of the results is that the
Heine-Borel theorem for countable covers of [0, 1] is equivalent to the latter being
Atsuji. Theorem 4.13 may be viewed as a generalisation (or refinement) establishing
that HBU is equivalent to [0, 1] being ‘uniformly’ Atsuji, i.e. as in UCTu .
Remark 4.21 (Other uniform theorems). It is possible to formulate uniform versions (akin to PITu , UCTu , and FEJu ) of many theorems. For reasons of space, we
delegate the study of such theorems to a future publication. We point the reader
to [25, Example 2] and [75] for ‘real-world’ examples using HBU by two Fields
medallists. We also provide the example of uniform weak König’s lemma WKLu :


(∀G2 )(∃m0 )(∀T ≤1 1) (∀α ∈ C)(αG(α) 6∈ T ) → (∀β ∈ C)(βm 6∈ T ) ,

Note that WKLu expresses that a binary tree T is finite if it has no paths, and the
upper bound m only depends on a realiser G of ‘T has no paths’. It is fairly easy
to show that WKLu is equivalent to HBU by adapting the proof of Theorem 4.6.
5. A finer analysis: the role of the axiom of choice

Our above proofs often make use of the axiom of countable choice, and its exact
role is studied in this section. We first discuss some required preliminaries in Section 5.1 We study the tight connection between QF-AC0,1 and the Lindelöf lemma
in Section 5.2. We show that the logical status of the latter is highly dependent on
its formulation (provable in a weak fragment of ZΩ
2 versus unprovable in ZF).
5.1. Historical and mathematical context. To appreciate the study of countable choice and the Lindelöf lemma, some mathematical/historical facts are needed.
First of all, many of the results proved above or in [58] make use of the axiom
of choice, esp. QF-AC0,1 in the base theory. Whether the axiom of choice is really
necessary is then a natural RM-question (posed first by Hirshfeldt; see [52, §6.1]).
Moreover, QF-AC0,1 also figures in the grander scheme of things: e.g. the local
equivalence of ‘epsilon-delta’ and sequential continuity is not provable in ZF set
theory, while QF-AC0,1 yields the equivalence in a general context ([38, Rem. 3.13]).
Finally, countable choice for subsets of R is equivalent to the fact that R is a Lindelöf
space over ZF ([30]). Thus, the role of QF-AC0,1 is connected to the status of the
Lindelöf property, i.e. that every open cover has a countable sub-cover.

26

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

Secondly, the previous points give rise to a clear challenge: find a version of the
Lindelöf lemma equivalent to QF-AC0,1 , over RCAω
0 . An immediate difficulty is that
the aforementioned results from [30] are part of set theory, while the framework of
RM is much more minimalist by design; for instance, what is a (general) open cover
in RCAω
0 ? Fortunately, the pre-1900 work by Borel and Schoenflies on open-cover
compactness provides us with a suitable starting point.
Thirdly, we consider Lindelöf’s original lemma from [45, p. 698].
Let P be any set in Rn and construct for every point of P a sphere
SP with x as center and radius ρP , where the latter can vary from
point to point; there exists a countable infinity P ′ of such spheres
such that every point in P is interior to at least one sphere in P ′ .
A similar formulation was used by Cousin in [12]. However, these covers are ‘special’
in that for x ∈ Rn , one knows the open set covering x, namely B(x, ρ(x)), similar to
our notion of canonical cover. By contrast, a (general) open cover of R is such that
for every x ∈ R, there exists a set in the cover containing x. This is the modern
definition, and one finds its roots with Borel ([10]) as early as 1895 (and in 1899 by
Schoenflies), the same year Cousin published Cousin’s lemma (aka HBU) in [12].
Motivated by the above, we shall study the Borel-Schoenflies formulation of the
Lindelöf lemma (and HBU) in Section 5.2. This version turns out to be equivalent
to QF-AC0,1 on the reals, and also provides further nice results.
5.2. A rose by many other names. We formulate versions of the Heine-Borel
theorem and Lindelöf lemma based on the 1895 and 1899 work of Borel and Schoenflies on open-cover compactness ([10, 71]). These versions provide a nice classification involving QF-AC0,1 and show that the logical status of the Lindelöf lemma
is highly dependent on its formulation (provable in second-order arithmetic versus
unprovable in ZF). We note that Schoenfield in [71, Theorem V, p. 51] first reduces
an uncountable cover to a countable sub-cover, and then to a finite sub-cover.
For our purposes it suffices that open covers are ‘enumerated’ by 2N and have
rational endpoints. As discussed in Remark 5.9, this restriction is insignificant in
our context. As to notation, JgΨ is the open set (Ψ(g)(1), Ψ(g)(2)) for Ψ : C → Q2 ,
while we say that Ψ : C → R2 provides an open cover of R if (∀x ∈ R)(∃g ∈ C)(x ∈
JgΨ ). We first study the following version of the Lindelöf lemma for the real line.
Definition 5.1. [LINDbs ] For every open cover of R provided by Ψ : C → Q2 , there
Ψ
exists Φ : N → C such that (∀x ∈ R)(∃n ∈ N)(x ∈ JΦ(n)
).
To gauge the strength of LINDbs , we first prove that QF-AC0,1 in Corollary 4.7
may be replaced by the latter. While this theorem also follows from Theorem 5.3,
the following proof is highly illustrative.
bs
Theorem 5.2. The system RCAω
proves WKL ↔ PITo .
0 + LIND

Proof. The reverse implication is immediate from (the proof of) Corollary 4.6. The
proof of the forward implication in Corollary 4.7 makes use of QF-AC0,1 once,
namely to conclude from (∀n0 )(∃α ≤ 1)(F (α) > n) the existence of a sequence
αn in Cantor space such that (∀n0 )(F (αn ) > n) in the proof of Theorem 4.4.
This application of QF-AC0,1 can be replaced by LINDbs as follows: since F is
unbounded on Cantor space, Ψ(x) := (−F (x), F (x)) yields an open cover of R,

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

27

and the countable sub-cover Φ provided by LINDbs is such that (∀m ∈ N)(∃n ∈
N)(F (Φ(n)) > m). Applying QF-AC0,0 now yields the sequence αn .

The previous proof goes through, but becomes a lot messier, if we assume Ψ from
LINDbs has [0, 1] or R as a domain, rather than Cantor space. This is the reason we
have chosen the latter domain. As expected, we also have the following theorem.
bs
Theorem 5.3. RCAω
proves QF-AC0,1
0 + LIND
R , i.e. for all F : R → N, we have

(∀n ∈ N)(∃x ∈ R)(F (x, n) = 0) → (∃Y 0→1 )(∀n ∈ N)(F (Y (n), n) = 0).

(5.1)

Proof. In case of ¬(∃2 ), all functions on the reals are continuous by [38, Prop. 3.12],
and the antecedent of (5.1) then implies (∀n ∈ N)(∃q ∈ Q)F (q, n) = 0; by definition,
2
QF-AC0,0 is included in RCAω
0 and finishes this case. In case of (∃ ), we fix F : R →
2
N such that (∀n ∈ N)(∃x ∈ R)(F (x, n) = 0). Now use (∃ ) to define inv(x) as 0 if
x =R 0 and 1/x otherwise; note that:

(∀n ∈ N)(∃x ∈ [0, 1]) F (x, n)×F (inv(x), n)×F (−x, n)×F (−inv(x), n) = 0 . (5.2)

Thus, we may assume that (∀n ∈ N)(∃x ∈ [0, 1])(F (x, n) = 0). Using ∃2 , define
G : C → N as follows for f ∈ C and wn = h1 . . . 1i with length n:
(
n + 2 if (∀i ≤ n)F (b(π(f, n)(i)), i) = 0 ∧ f (0) = 0
G(wn ∗ f ) :=

if there is no such n
P∞
(1×0)→1∗
is the inverse of a function which codes n
where b(x) = i=0 x(i)
2i and π
sequences into one. Since ∃2 can compute a binary representation of any real in the
unit interval, we have (∀n ∈ N)(∃x ∈ C)F (b(x), n) = 0, and Ψ(x) := (−G(x), G(x))
yields an open cover of R. Then LINDbs provides Φ0→1 such that the countable
sub-cover ∪n∈N (−G(Φ(n)), G(Φ(n))) still covers R. Hence, (∀m0 )(∃n0 )(G(Φ(n)) >
m + 1), and applying QF-AC0,0 , there is g 1 such that (∀m0 )(G(Φ(g(m))) > m + 1).
In the latter, the first case of G from (5.3) must always hold, and we have that
(∀m0 )(F (b(π(Φ(g(m)))(m)), m) = 0, as required.

Corollary 5.4. The system ZF cannot prove LINDbs .
Proof. By the proof of [39, Prop. 4.1], QF-AC0,1
R suffices to prove that for any f :
R → R and x ∈ R, f is ‘epsilon-delta’ continuous at x if and only if f is sequentially
continuous at x. However, this equivalence is independent of ZF ([30]).

In hindsight, the previous theorem is not that surprising: applying QF-AC1,0 to
the conclusion of LINDbs , we obtain a functional which provides for each x ∈ R an
interval JgΨ covering x, while we only assume (∀x ∈ R)(∃g ∈ C)(x ∈ JgΨ ), i.e. a
typical application of the axiom of choice. Indeed, the functional Φ from LINDbs is
essential to the proof of the theorem, and it is a natural question what the status
is of the following weaker version which only states the existence of a countable
sub-cover, but does not provide a sequence of reals which generates the sub-cover.

Definition 5.5. [LINDbs
w ] For every open cover of R provided by Ψ : C → Q , there
is a sequence ∪n∈N (an , bn ) covering R such that (∀n ∈ N)(∃x ∈ R)[(an , bn ) = JxΨ ]

We also study the associated version of the Heine-Borel theorem.
Definition 5.6. [HBUbs ] For every open cover of [0, 1] provided by Ψ : C → Q2 ,
there exists a finite sub-cover, i.e. (∃y1 , . . . , yk ∈ C)(∀x ∈ R)(∃i ≤ k)(x ∈ JyΨi ).

Remark 5.9. By way of a practical argument, while we could have formulated
LINDbs using Ψ : R → R2 , we already obtain QF-AC0,1
R with the above version, i.e.
Ψ : C → Q2 ‘is enough’, and this choice makes the above proofs easier. On a more
conceptual level, ∃2 computes a functional converting reals in the unit interval into
a binary representation, which combines nicely with our ‘excluded middle trick’

(∀N ∈ N)(∃x0 , . . . , xk ∈ [−N, N ])(∀y ∈ [−N, N ] ∩ Q)(∃i ≤ k)(y ∈ IyΨi ).

In conclusion, we have formulated two versions of the Lindelöf lemma based on
the Borel-Schoenflies framework; one version is provable in (a weak fragment of) ZΩ
2,
while the other one is not provable in ZF. The latter is due to the ‘hidden presence of
the axiom of choice’ in LINDbs : an open cover in the sense of the latter only tells us
that x ∈ R is in some interval, but not which one. The sequence Φ however provides
Ψ
such an interval for x ∈ R by applying QF-AC1,0 to (∀x ∈ R)(∃n ∈ N)(x ∈ JΦ(n)
).
In a nutshell, the Lindelöf lemma only becomes unprovable in ZF if we build some
choice into it, something of course set theory is wont to do.
Appendix A. Uniform proofs in the literature
We discuss numerous proofs of Heine’s and Pincherle’s theorem from the literature and show that these proofs actually establish the uniform versions, sometimes
after minor modifications (only). Our motivation is to convince the reader that
mathematicians like Dini, Pincherle, Lebesgue, Young, Riesz, and Bolzano were
using strong axioms (like the centred theorem below) in their proofs, and the latter
establish (sometimes after minor modification) highly uniform theorems.
Some of the aforementioned proofs are only discussed briefly due to their similarity to the above proofs. We first discuss Heine’s theorem in Section A.1, as Dini’s
proof of the latter ([13]) predates the proof of Pincherle’s theorem from [60]; the
latter theorem is discussed in Section A.2. A comparison between the proofs by
Dini and Pincherle suggests that Pincherle based his proof on Dini’s. Both proofs
make use of the following version of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.
If a function has a definite property infinitely often within a finite
domain, then there is a point such that in any neighbourhood of
this point there are infinitely many points with the property.
Note that Weierstrass has indeed formulated this theorem in [80, p. 77], while
Pincherle mentions it in [59, p. 237] (with an attribution to Weierstrass); Dini
states a special case of the centred theorem in [13, §36].
Finally, we stress the speculative nature of historical claims (say compared to
mathematical ones). We have taken great care to accurately interpret all the mentioned proofs, but more certainty than the level of interpretation we cannot claim.
A.1. Proofs of Heine’s theorem. First of all, the proofs of Heine’s theorem in
[1, §4.20], [4, p. 148], [7, Theorem 3], [24, Theorem 7], [28, V], [32, p. 239], [36, p.
111], [41, p. 35], [42, p. 14], [43, p. 105], [48, p. 185], [53, p. 178], [61, p. 82], [63, p.
91], [74, p. 62], [77, Example 3, p. 474], and [81, p. 218] are basic compactness
arguments, i.e. they amount to little more than HBUc → UCTu from Corollary 4.14.

30

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

Secondly, the proof of Heine’s theorem by Dini in [13, §41] (Italian) and [14, §41]
(German) is essentially as in Theorem A.1, with one difference: Dini does not use
the function from (A.1), but introduces a modulus of continuity as follows:
the number ε should be interpreted as the supremum of all values
of ε that, in reference to the point x, are compatible with those
properties any ε should have. (See §41 in [13, 14])
Thus, Dini’s modulus modulus of continuity ε(x, σ) is the supremum of all ε′ > 0
such that (∀x, y ∈ I)(|x − y| < ε′ → |f (x) − f (y)| < σ). Our modulus ε0 (x, σ) from
(A.1) is always below ε(x, σ), but does not depend on the function f and hence
yields uniform Heine’s theorem.
Theorem A.1. Any continuous f : [a, b] → R is uniformly continuous on [a, b].
Proof. For simplicity, we work over I ≡ [0, 1]. Using Dini’s notations, let ε :
(I × R) → R+ be a modulus of (pointwise) continuity for f : I → R, i.e.
(∀σ >R 0)(∀x, y ∈ I)(|x − y| <R ε(x, σ) → |f (x) − f (y)| <R σ).
Without loss of generality, we may assume that ε(x, σ) < 2 for all x ∈ I. There
are many moduli of continuity, and we need a ‘nice’ modulus, or similar object. To
ε(x,σ)
this end, define Ix
as the interval (x − ε(x, σ), x + ε(x, σ)) and define
1

ε(y,σ) 	
.
(A.1)
ε0 (x, σ) := sup ε(y, σ) : y ∈ I ∧ x ∈ Iy2

Note that if |x − z| < ε0 (x, σ)/2, then |f (x) − f (z)| < 2σ, i.e. ε0 is essentially a
modulus of continuity for f too. Now fix σ >R 0 and let λ0 be inf z∈I ε0 (z, σ/2).
Then there is a point x′ ∈ I such that for any neighbourhood U of x′ , no matter
1
ε(x′ ,σ/2)
how small, we have inf z∈U ε0 (z, σ/2) = λ0 . Now consider U0 = Ix2′
and note
that inf z∈U0 ε0 (z, σ/2) = λ0 by definition. However, for z ∈ U0 , (A.1) (for σ/2)
implies that ε0 (z, σ/2) is at least ε(x′ , σ/2), i.e. ε0 (z, σ/2) ≥ ε(x′ , σ/2). Taking the
infimum, λ0 = inf z∈U0 |ε0 (z, σ/2)| ≥ ε(x′ , σ/2). Define ε1 := 12 ε(x′ , σ/2) and note
(∀x, y ∈ I)(|x − y| <R ε1 ) → |f (x) − f (y)| <R σ),
and the uniform continuity of f follows.



Lüroth’s proof of Heine’s theorem [47] proceeds in the same way: a nice modulus of continuity is defined, for which it is argued that the infimum cannot be
zero anywhere in the interval, establishing uniform continuity. With inessential
modification, Lüroth’s proof also yields uniform Heine’s theorem.
Incidentally, Weierstrass’ proof from [79, p. 203-204] establishes the Heine-Borel
theorem (without explicit formulation) and also starts with the introduction of a
nice modulus (in casu: of uniform convergence). A detailed motivation for this
observation is in [49, p. 96-97]. The following corollary is now immediate.
Corollary A.2. For any ε >R 0 and g : (I × R) → R+ , there is δ >R 0 such that
for any f : I → R with modulus of continuity g, we have
(∀x, y ∈ I)(|x − y| <R δ) → |f (x) − f (y)| <R ε),
Thirdly, as discussed in Remark 1.2, Pincherle mentions a variation of Pincherle’s
theorem in [60, Footnote 1] and states it is a generalisation of Heine’s theorem as
proved by Dini in [13, §41]. As discussed in Section A.2, Pincherle’s proof of
Pincherle’s theorem with minor modification also establishes the uniform version,

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

31

and the uniform version of the variation from Remark 1.2 immediately yields uniform Heine’s theorem when applied to a modulus of continuity. Hence, Pincherle’s
proof from [60] establishes uniform Heine’s theorem with minor modification.
Fourth, Bolzano provides an incorrect proof of Heine’s theorem in [5, p. 575,
§6]. However, Russnock claims in [64, p. 113] that Bolzano’s basic strategy is solid
and provides a correct proof, which he calls a Bolzanian proof of Heine’s theorem,
in [64, Appendix]. The latter proof can establish uniform Heine’s theorem as it
is is similar in spirit to the proof of Theorem A.1: one starts from a modulus of
continuity, then defines a certain sequence in terms of the latter, and the cluster
point of this sequence is used to define a modulus of uniform continuity.
Fifth, Lebesgue provides (what he refers to as) a ‘pretty proof’ of Heine’s theorem in [43, p. 105, Footnote 1] as an application of the Heine-Borel theorem for
uncountable covers. The proof is in prose (only), and can be summarised as follows.
For fixed ε > 0, every point x ∈ [a, b] is covered by a ball in which
the oscillation of f (x) is at most ε. By the Heine-Borel theorem,
finitely many of those balls cover [a, b]. The length of the smallest
ball is then as required for the uniform continuity of f .
Now Lebesgue’s proof arguably also establishes HBU → UCTRu as follows: Lebesgue’s
notion of (uniform) continuity (See [43, p. 22]) seems to involve a modulus of (uniform) continuity. Of course, given a modulus of continuity g for f on [a, b], the ball
(x − g(x, ε), x + g(x, ε)) is such that the oscillation of f (x) is at most ε. Hence,
applying HBU to the cover ∪x∈I Ixg immediately implies UCTRu . The proofs by Riesz,
Hardy, and Young in [28, 62, 81] amount to the same proof.
Sixth, Thomae’s proof ([76, p. 5]) of Heine’s theorem is not correct, but actually
suggests using (A.1). Indeed, for the associated canonical cover, build a sequence
in which the first interval covers zero, and the next one the right end-point of the
previous one, as in Thomae’s proof. The latter now yields uniform Heine’s theorem.
Finally, neither Weierstrass’ proof in [80], or Heine’s proof in [29], or Dirichlet’s
proof in [15] establish the uniform version of Heine’s theorem, as far as we can see.
A.2. Proofs of Pincherle’s theorem. First of all, the proofs of Pincherle’s theorem in [4, p. 149], [24, p. 111], and [77, p. 185] are basic compactness arguments,
amounting to little more than the proof of HBUc → PITu in Theorem 4.2.
Secondly, the proof of Pincherle’s theorem by Pincherle himself is essentially as
follows (See [60, p. 67 for the Italian original]).
Theorem A.3 (Pincherle). Let E be a closed, bounded subset of Rn and let f :
E → R be locally bounded with realisers L, r : R → R+ . Then f is bounded on E.
Proof. We start with a note regarding references: Pincherle motivates the crucial
step in the proof in [60, p. 67] as follows: per le proposizioni generali sulle grandezze
variabili, which translates to due to general propositions on variable magnitudes.
Pincherle does not provide references, but it is clear from his proof that he meant
the version of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem from the beginning of this section.
Now suppose f : E → R is locally bounded with realisers L′ , r : R → R+ , i.e. for
every x ∈ E and y ∈ E ∩ B(x, r(x)), we have |f (y)| ≤ L′ (x). Let L(x) be the lim
sup of |f (y)| for y ∈ E ∩ B(x, r(x)). By assumption L : E → R+ is always finite
(and well-defined) for inputs from E. Now let L ∈ R+ ∪ {+∞} be the lim sup of
L(x) for x ∈ E; we show that L is a finite number.

32

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

In fact, there is, due to the first paragraph, a point x′ ∈ E such that for any
neighbourhood U of x′ , however small, the lim sup of L(y) for y ∈ U is L. By locally
boundeness, the lim sup of |f (y)| for y ∈ B(x′ , r(x′ )) is a finite number, namely less
than L′ := L(x′ ). By the previous, the lim sup of |L(y)| for y ∈ B(x′ , r(x′ )/2) is L.
But since B(x′ , r(x′ )/2) ⊂ B(x′ , r(x′ ), we have L ≤ L′ , and L is indeed finite. 
A minor modification of the previous proof now yields the uniform version.
Corollary A.4. Let E be a closed, bounded subset of Rn and let f : E → R be
locally bounded with realisers L, r : R → R+ . Then |f | has an upper bound on E
that only depends on the latter.
Proof. It suffices to define a suitable L(x) in terms of L′ (x) (rather than in terms
of f (x)). This can be done in the same way as ε0 (x, σ) in (A.1) is defined in terms
of ε(x, σ). For instance, define L : E → R+ as follows:
L(x) := inf {L′ (z) : Ixr ⊆ Izr },
z∈E

where L′ , r : E → R+ are realisers for the local boundedness of f .

(A.2)


Remark A.5 (A function by any other name). We show that Pincherle intended
to formulate his theorem for any function, not just continuous ones. First of all,
Pincherle includes the following expression in his theorem:
Funzione di x nel senso più generale della paróla ([60, p. 67]),
which translates to ‘function of x in the most general sense’. However, discontinuous functions had already enjoyed a long history by 1882: they were discussed by
Dirichlet in 1829 ([16]); Riemann studied such functions in his 1854 Habilitationsschrift ([35, p. 115]), and the 1870 dissertation of Hankel, a student of Riemann,
has ‘discontinuous functions’ in its title ([27]). We also mention Thomae’s function,
similar to Dirichlet’s function and introduced in [76, p. 14] around 1875.
Secondly, Pincherle refers to a number of theorems due to Dini and Weierstrass as
special cases of his theorem in [60, p. 66-68]. He also mentions that Dini’s theorem
is about continuous functions, i.e. it seems unlikely he just implicitly assumed his
theorem to be about continuous functions. Finally, the proof on [60, p. 67] does
not require the function to be continuous (nor does it mention the latter word).
Since Pincherle explicitly mentions establishing una proposizione generale, it seems
unlikely he overlooked the fact that his Teorema was about arbitrary functions.
In conclusion, Dini almost establishes UCTRu in [13, 14], while Pincherle later
probably adapted Dini’s proof to obtain Pincherle’s theorem in [60]. Pincherle’s
proof is uniform if we define L(x) as in (A.2) rather than in terms of f itself, i.e.
similar to (A.1). Moreover, the proof in [64, Appendix] seems to establish UCTRu ,
and is claimed by the historian Rusnock to be a Bolzanonian proof of Heine’s
theorem. Finally, Lebesgue, Riesz, and Young prove HBU → UCTRu in [43, 62, 81].
In a nutshell, we observe that the version of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem
from the beginning of this section, as well as the Heine-Borel theorem for uncountable covers, was (or could be) used to prove uniform versions of Heine’s and
Pincherle’s theorems. Weierstrass’ more ‘constructive’ approach as in [15, 80] later
became the norm however, until the redevelopment of analysis as in e.g. [4] based
on techniques from gauge integration. With that, both history and this paper have
come full circle, which constitutes a nice ending for this paper.

Appendix B. The Gödel Hierarchy
The Gödel hierarchy is a collection of logical systems ordered via consistency
strength, or essentially equivalent: ordered via inclusion11. This hierarchy is claimed
to capture most systems that are natural or have foundational import, as follows.
It is striking that a great many foundational theories are linearly
ordered by <. Of course it is possible to construct pairs of artificial
theories which are incomparable under <. However, this is not the
case for the “natural” or non-artificial theories which are usually
regarded as significant in the foundations of mathematics. ([73])
Burgess makes essentially the same claims in [11, §1.5]. However, the above results,
as well as those in [58], imply that e.g. HBU, basic properties of the gauge integral,
and uniform theorems, do not fit the Gödel hierarchy. In particular, these theorems
yield a branch that is completely independent of the medium range of the Gödel
hierarchy (with the latter based on inclusion11), as depicted in the following figure:

as depicted in [73, Table 1], i.e. one gets the ‘same’ Gödel hierarchy.

34

UNIFORMITY IN MATHEMATICS

Arguably, the Gödel hierarchy is a central object of study in mathematical logic,
as e.g. argued by Simpson in [73, p. 112] or Burgess in [11, p. 40]. Precursors to
the Gödel hierarchy may be found in the work of Wang ([78]) and Bernays (See [6],
and the English translation in [8]). Friedman ([20]) has studied the linear nature
of the Gödel hierarchy, including many more systems than present in Figure 1.
Some remarks on the technical details concerning Figure 1 are as follows.
Remark B.1. First of all, we use a non-essential modification of the Gödel hierω
archy, namely involving systems of higher-order arithmetic, like e.g. RCAω
0 , ACA0 ,
ω
ω
Π11 -CA0 , and Z2 instead of RCA0 , ACA0 , Π11 -CA0 , and Z2 ; these higher-order systems are (at least) Π12 -conservative over the associated second-order system, by
respectively [38, §2], [67, Theorem 2.2], and [33, Cor. 2.6].
Secondly, ZΩ
2 is placed between the medium and strong range, as the combination
of the recursor R2 from Gödel’s T and ∃3 yields a system stronger than ZΩ
2 . Note
ω
that Π1k -CAω
0 and Z2 do not change in this way.
Thirdly, in light of the extreme (logical and computational) differences between
second-order and higher-order theorems (like e.g. HBU and its counterpart for
countable covers), it is a natural questions how robust higher-order theorems actually are. As shown in [70], the properties of the Cousin and Lindelöf lemmas do not
depend on the exact definition of cover, even in the absence of the axiom of choice.
The previous remark also establishes that the systems with superscript ‘ω’ deserve to be called the higher-order counterparts of the corresponding second-order
systems, while ZΩ
2 does not seem to fall into the same category.
Finally, in light of the equivalences involving the gauge integral and the Cousin
lemma in [58, §3], the latter seriously challenges the ‘Big Five’ classification from
RM, the linear nature of the Gödel hierarchy, as well as Feferman’s claim that
the mathematics necessary for the development of physics can be formalised in
relatively weak logical systems (See [58, p. 24]).
