TRIANGULATED CATEGORIES WITH A SINGLE COMPACT
GENERATOR AND A BROWN REPRESENTABILITY THEOREM
AMNON NEEMAN
Abstract. We generalize a theorem of Bondal and Van den Bergh. A corollary of
our main results says the following: Let X be a scheme proper over a noetherian
ring R. Then the Yoneda map, taking an object D in the category Dbcoh (X) to the
functor Hom(−, D)|Dperf (X) : Dperf (X)op −→ R–mod, is an equivalence of Dbcoh (X)
with the category of finite R–linear cohomological functors H : Dperf (X)op −→ R–mod.
i
A cohomological functor H is finite if ⊕∞
i=−∞ H (C) is a finite R–module for every
perf
C ∈D
(X).
Bondal and Van den Bergh proved the special case where R is a field and X is
projective over R.
But our theorems are more general. They work in the abstract generality of triangulated categories with coproducts and a single compact generator, satisfying a certain
approximability property. At the moment I only know how to prove this approximability for the categories Dqc (X) with X a quasicompact, separated scheme, for the
homotopy category of spectra, and for the category D(R) where R is a (possibly noncommutative) negatively graded dg algebra.
The work was inspired by Jack Hall’s elegant new proof of a vast generalization of
GAGA, a proof based on representability theorems of the type above. The generality
of Hall’s result made me wonder how far the known representability theorems could be
improved.

0. Introduction
This paper begins with the observation that triangulated categories with coproducts
and a single compact generator have a preferred class of t–structures. This allows us to
define thick subcatgories T − , T + and T b . A slightly subtler definition is that of Tc− . The
full subcategory Tc− ⊂ T makes sense unconditionally, and it is thick as long as there
exists a compact generator G and an integer A > 0 so that Hom(G, Σi G) = 0 for all
i ≥ A. We also define a subcategory Tcb = Tc− ∩ T b .
In the special case where T = Dqc (X), with X a quasicompact, separated scheme, the
preferred class of t–structures contains the standard t–structure, the subcategories T − ,
+

T + and T b are nothing other than D−
qc (X), Dqc (X) and Dqc (X), and if X is noetherian

the subcategories Tc ⊂ Tc can be proved to be Dcoh (X) ⊂ D−
coh (X). What we have
learned so far is that these standard categories have an intrinsic description. There is a
method to construct them out of T in purely triangulated-category terms.
Still in the world of triangulated categories with coproducts and a single compact
generator: the category T may be approximable. We will define this concept later in the
introduction, and study its properties in the body of the paper. For now we note that
the category Dqc (X) is approximable, as long as X is a quasicompact, separated scheme.
The homotopy category of spectra is also approximable.
To show that this abstraction can be useful we will prove representability theorems.
To state them we begin with
Definition 0.1. Let R be a commutative ring, let T be an R–linear triangulated category
and let B ⊂ T be a full, replete subcategory with ΣB = B. A B–cohomological functor is
an R–linear functor H : Bop −→ R–Mod which takes triangles to long exact sequences.
This means that, if we have a triangle x −→ y −→ z −→ Σx with all three of x, y, z
belonging to B, then H takes it to a long exact sequence in R–Mod.
Suppose the ring R is noetherian, and let G ∈ B ⊂ T be an object. The B–cohomological
functor H : Bop −→ R–Mod is called G–locally finite if
(i) H(Σi G) is a finite R–module for all i ∈ Z.
(ii) H Σi G = 0 for i ≪ 0.

The B–cohomological functor H is G–finite if, in addition to the above, we have

(iii) H Σi G = 0 for i ≫ 0.

Remark 0.2. Let T be an R–linear triangulated category, B a full, replete subcategory
with ΣB = B, and H a B–cohomological functor. If H is G–locally finite (respectively finite) for every G ∈ B we leave out the G, and just say that H is locally finite (respectively
finite).
Note that if H is G–locally finite (respectively finite) then it is also G′ –locally finite
for any G′ obtainable from G by forming in B finite direct sums, direct summands,
suspensions or triangles. Thus local finiteness (respectively finiteness) can be checked on
any classical generator.

A BROWN REPRESENTABILITY THEOREM

Our main theorem says that
Theorem 0.3. Let R be a noetherian ring, and T an R–linear triangulated category
with coproducts. Assume T has a compact generator G with Hom(−, G) a G–locally
finite cohomological functor. Suppose further that T is approximable.
Then the restricted Yoneda functor Y : T −→ Hom (T c )op , R–Mod , that is the functor
taking an object t ∈ T to the restriction to T c of the representable functor Hom(−, t),
restricts on Tc− ⊂ T to a full functor. In fact more is true: any map ϕ : Y(s) −→ Y(t),
with s ∈ Tc− and t ∈ T, is equal to Y(f ) for some f : s −→ t. Furthermore the essential
image of Tc− is precisely the category of locally finite T c –cohomological functors.
If f : s −→ t is a morphism from s ∈ Tc− to t ∈ T + , then Y(f ) = 0 implies f = 0. It
follows that on the subcategory Tcb ⊂ Tc− the functor Y is fully faithful. Furthermore the
essential image of Tcb is the category of finite T c –cohomological functors.
From this we will deduce
Corollary 0.4. Let T be as in Theorem 0.3, but assume further that T c is contained in
Tcb . Let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be one of the preferred t–structures.
Assume L : Tcb −→ S is an R–linear triangulated functor such that

(i) For any pair of objects (t, s), with t ∈ T c and s ∈ S, the R–module Hom L(t), s is
finite.

(ii) For any object s ∈ S there exists an integer A > 0 with Hom L(Tcb ∩ T ≤−A ) , s = 0.
(iii) For any object t ∈ T c and any object s ∈ S there exists an integer A so that
Hom L(Σm t), s = 0 for all m ≤ −A.
Then L has a right adjoint R : S −→ Tcb .

In the special example of T = Dqc (X) Theorem 0.3 specializes to
Corollary 0.5. If X is a scheme proper over a noetherian ring R, then the restricted
Yoneda functor Y gives an equivalence from the category Dbcoh (X) to the category of finite
op
cohomological functors Dperf (X) −→ R–Mod.
On the larger category D−
coh (X), the functor Y is full and the essential image is the
op
category of locally finite cohomological functors Dperf (X) −→ R–Mod.
Proof. If X is proper over R then it is separated and quasicompact, hence the category
T = Dqc (X) is approximable. But properness also guarantees that, for any compact
generator G ∈ T and any i ∈ Z, the R–module Hom(Σi G, G) is finite. The vanishing of
Hom(Σi G, G) for i ≪ 0 is true more generally, it doesn’t require properness. Anyway:
the functor Hom(−, G) is G–locally finite and Theorem 0.3 applies.

Remark 0.6. If R is a field and X is projective over R, then the part of Corollary 0.5
concerning the objects in the image of Y is known—see Bondal and Van den Bergh [5,
Theorem A.1]. Bondal and Van den Bergh’s theorem says nothing about the functor Y
being fully faithful.

The existing proofs of variants of Theorem 0.3, including the current one, proceed
in two steps. Starting with a finite T c –cohomological functor H one first proves that
H ∼
= Y(t) for some t ∈ T, and then shows that t must actually belong to Tcb . Bondal
and Van den Bergh [5, Theorem A.1] and Jack Hall [9, Proposition 4.1] rely on suitable
special features that allow the functor H : T c = Dperf (X) −→ R–Mod to extend to a
cohomological functor on all of T = Dqc (X), and then use the usual Brown representability theorem for Dqc (X). For Bondal and Van den Bergh the key is forming the double
dual—this works since R is assumed a field, and a finite-dimensional vector space over R
is canonically isomorphic to its double dual. Jack Hall relies on the fact that his functors
come from morphisms of ringed spaces c : X −→ X, and formal properties then provide
adjoints

We should recall one more result in the literature: although Ben-Zvi, Nadler and
Preygel [4, Section 3] is not technically either a special case or a generalization of Theorem 0.3, the reader is nonetheless encouraged to look at it—there are interesting parallels.
Enhancements play a role in [4], as well as the construction of an explicit generator and
estimates similar to those of [13, Theorem 4.1].
What’s different here is the generality. Let H be any locally finite T c –cohomological
functor. Under hypotheses weaker than approximability (see Proposition 7.10 for the
precise statement) we prove that H ∼
= Y(t) where t ∈ T is some object—the existence
of t is formal, not special to narrow classes of T’s or H’s. And by combining a careful
analysis of the proof of Proposition 7.10, with the theory developed in Section 2, we will
deduce—under only the approximability hypothesis—that t must belong to Tc− .
Remark 0.7. The work was inspired by the lovely new proof of a vast generalization of
GAGA to be found in Jack Hall [9]. More precisely: it was inspired by the original idea,
which is to be found in [9, Section 2]—as Hall’s paper became more general it developed
a different tack. Let me sketch the simple idea and encourage the reader to look at [9]
for more detail, as well as for far greater generality. Because this is only a tiny glimpse
I will confine myself to the original, analytic version of GAGA in Serre [19], not to the
other incarnations.
Suppose X is a scheme proper over C. Then X an is a compact, complex analytic space,
and analytification defines a functor L : Dbcoh (X) −→ Dbcoh (X an ), taking a complex
of OX –modules with bounded, coherent cohomology to its analytification. With T =
Dqc (X) and Tcb = Dbcoh (X) we have exhibited a C–linear triangulated functor L : Tcb −→
S, where S = Dbcoh (X an ). It is a tiny exercise to show that this functor satisfies the
criteria of Corollary 0.4, hence has a right adjoint R : S −→ Tcb .
To prove GAGA it suffices to show that R is an essential inverse of L. The gist of
the argument is that, when you have a pair of adjoint triangulated functors between
triangulated categories, there are standard techniques that render it easy to check if

these functors are inverse equivalences. And the stunning feature of this particular
application is that the global data one needs, about coherent analytic sheaves on the
compact, complex analytic space X an , are just the minimal ones used to prove that the
hypotheses of Corollary 0.4 are satisfied. Once you have the right adjoint R, the proof
that L and R are essential inverses reduces to applying Nakaya’s lemma to some suitable
finite modules over the noetherian local rings OX,x and Oan
X an ,x , the stalks at a closed

We have already mentioned that part of the interest of the paper is that natural
objects, like the subcategories Dbcoh (X) ⊂ D−
coh (X) of the category T = Dqc (X), have
an intrinsic description. The definitions are not hard to give, we include them in the
Introduction. Before all else we recall some standard notation.
Reminder 0.8. Let T be a triangulated category. We define
(i) If A ⊂ T is a full subcategory, then smd(A) is the full subcategory of all direct
summands of objects of A.
(ii) If A ⊂ T is a full subcategory, then add(A) is the full subcategory of all finite direct
sums of objects of A.
(iii) If T has small coproducts and A ⊂ T is a full subcategory, then Add(A) is the full
subcategory of all coproducts of objects of A.
(iv) If A, B are two full subcategories of T, then A ⋆ B is the full subcategory of all
objects y ∈ T such that there exists a triangle a −→ y −→ b −→ with a ∈ A and
b ∈ B.
(v) Given an object G ∈ T and two integers A ≤ B, let C ⊂ T be the full subcategory
with objects {Σ−i
 G | A ≤ i ≤ B}. For integers n > 0 we define the subcategories
coprodn G[A, B] , inductively on the integer n, by the formulas

coprod1 G[A, B] = add(C) ,

coprodn+1 G[A, B] = coprod1 G[A, B] ⋆ coprodn G[A, B] .

(viii) Suppose T has coproducts, let G be an object, and let A ≤ B be two integers. We
define C ⊂ T to be the full subcategory with objects {Σ−i G | A ≤ i ≤ B}. For

Coprodn+1 G[A, B] = Coprod1 G[A, B] ⋆ Coprodn G[A, B] .

In other words the difference between Coprod and coprod is that in Coprod we
allow infinite coproducts in the formation of Coprod1 . The inductive procedure is
unaltered.

We allow A and B to be infinite in (viii). For example Coprod1 G(−∞, B] is
defined to be Add(C) with C = {Σ−i G | i ≤ B}.

Let A ≤ B be integers, possibly infinite. Then Coprod G[A, B] is the smallest full
subcategory S ⊂ T, closed under coproducts, with S ⋆ S ⊂ S, and with Σ−i G ∈ S
for A ≤ i ≤ B.

are closed under coproducts and (positive) suspensions, and therefore contain all
direct summands of their objects.
The following lemma is an easy consequence of the definitions.

the sets in the union. For (ii) observe that hGi = hHi implies H ∈ hGi and G ∈ hHi
and apply (i).

Now we come to the first new definition.
Definition 0.10. Suppose we are given two t–structures on a triangulated category T,
that is we are given two pairs of subcategories (T1≤0 , T1≥0 ) and (T2≤0 , T2≥0 ) satisfying the
conditions in [3, Définition 1.3.1]. These t–structures are equivalent if and only if there
exists an integer A > 0 with T1≤−A ⊂ T2≤0 ⊂ T1≤A .

Observation 0.11. For any t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) we have T ≤0 = Σ−1 ⊥ T ≥0 and
T ≥0 = (ΣT ≤0 )⊥ . It immediately follows that two t–structures (T1≤0 , T1≥0 ) and (T2≤0 , T2≥0 )
are equivalent if and only if there exists an integer A > 0 with T1≥A ⊂ T2≥0 ⊂ T1≥−A .

Observation 0.12. Recall that, for any t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ), the categories T − , T +
and T b are defined by
T − = ∪m>0 T ≤m ,

T + = ∪m>0 T ≥−m ,

Tb = T− ∩ T+ .

If (T1≤0 , T1≥0 ) and (T2≤0 , T2≥0 ) are equivalent t–structures we note
(i) T1− = T2− , T1+ = T2+ and T1b = T2b .
(ii) If T − [respectively T + , respectively T b ] contains a compact generator G ∈ T c , then
T − [respectively T + , respectively T b ] contains all of T c .
Proof. We prove (i) and (ii) for T − and leave T + and T b to the reader. To prove (i)
observe that the inclusions T1≤−A ⊂ T2≤0 ⊂ T1≤A imply

that is T1− ⊂ T2− ⊂ T1− .
For the proof of (ii) the assumption is that G ∈ T − . This makes T − ⊂ T a thick
subcategory containing G, hence T c = hGi ⊂ T − .

Example 0.13. Let T be a triangulated category with coproducts. Given any compact
object G ∈ T, from Alonso, Jeremı́as and Souto [2, Theorem A.1] we learn that T has
≤0
≥0
a unique t–structure (TG

TG
under coproducts is also true for any aisle, while the fact that TG
is closed under
coproducts may be found in [2, Proposition A.2]; it comes from the compactness of the
object G.
If G, H are two compact objects of T with hGi = hHi, Lemma 0.9(ii) tells us that there

generated by G.

Remark 0.15. For any compact generator G we have that hGi = T c , the full subcategory
of all compact objects. Any two compact generators G, H satisfy hGi = T c = hHi, and
Example 0.13 says that G and H generate equivalent t–structures. Thus the preferred
equivalence class of t–structures does not depend on the choice of compact generator.
Now [2, Proposition A.2] guarantees that, in the preferred equivalence class, there
will exist some t–structures with T ≤0 and T ≥0 both closed under coproducts—just take

stable under equivalence. In general there will be t–structures in the preferred equivalence
class where T ≥0 is not closed in T under coproducts.
From Observation 0.12(i) we learn that, as long as we stick to the preferred equivalence
class of t–structures, the categories T − , T + and T b are intrinsic.
And now for the next formal construction.
Definition 0.16. Suppose T is a triangulated category with coproducts and let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 )
be a t–structure.
An object F belongs to the subcategory Tc− ⊂ T if, for any integer m > 0, there exists
a triangle E −→ F −→ D with E ∈ T c and D ∈ T ≤−m .
The subcategory Tcb is defined by Tcb = Tc− ∩ T b .
Remark 0.17. Note that the definition of Tc− depends on the choice of a t–structure, but
not much—equivalent t–structures lead to the same Tc− . For any choice of t–structure
id

the category Tc− contains T c . After all if F is compact then the triangle F −→ F −→ 0
has F ∈ T c and 0 ∈ T ≤−m , for every m and every t–structure.
Remark 0.18. Assume the t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) is such that there is a compact generator G contained in T − ; any t–structure in the preferred equivalence class is an example,
(−∞,0]
≤0

⊂ T − . Observation 0.12(ii) gives that T c ⊂ T − , and

Definition 0.16 tells us that, for any integer m > 0,

Still in gorgeous generality we will prove
Proposition 0.19. Let T be a triangulated category with coproducts, and let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 )
be a t–structure. If there exists an integer A > 0 and a compact generator G ∈ T with
Hom Σ−A G, T ≤0 = 0 then Tcb ⊂ Tc− are triangulated subcategories of T. If furthermore
G ∈ T − , then Tcb ⊂ Tc− ⊂ T are thick subcategories of T − .
Remark 0.20. We are most interested in the special case where the t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 )
is in the preferred equivalence class and Tcb ⊂ Tc− are independent of choices.
Suppose there exists a compact generator G and an integer A > 0, so that Hom(G, Σi G) =
0 for all i ≥ A. Define the full subcategory S by
S

{S ∈ T | Hom(Σ−A G, S) = 0}.

The compactness of G says that S is closed under coproducts, by hypothesis S contains
Σi G for all i ≥ 0, while obviously S is closed under direct summands and S ∗ S ⊂ S.

For the structure defined so far we needed very little. To go further it turns out to be
useful to estimate how much effort it takes to approximate an object in T − by a compact
generator G. This leads us to
Definition 0.21. Let T be a triangulated category with coproducts. The category T is
called weakly approximable if there exists a compact generator G, a t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 )
and an integer A > 0 so that

(i) ΣA G ∈ T ≤0 and Hom Σ−A G, T ≤0 = 0.
(ii) Every object F ∈ T ≤0 admits a triangle E −→ F −→ D with E ∈ hGi
D ∈ T ≤−1 .

and

The category T is called approximable if the integer A can be chosen to further satisfy
(iii) In the triangle E −→ F −→ D of (ii) above we may strengthen the condition on E,
[−A,A]

we may assume E ∈ hGiA

⊂ hGi

[−A,A]

.

The following are easy to prove, they will be part of a string of formal consequences
of approximability, see Section 2.
Facts 0.22. Let T be a triangulated category with coproducts. If T is weakly approximable then
(i) The t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ), which is part of Definition 0.21 and is assumed to satisfy
some hypotheses, must belong to the preferred equivalence class.
(ii) For any compact generator G and any t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) in the preferred equivalence class there must exist an integer A, depending on G and on the t–structure
(T ≤0 , T ≥0 ), which satisfies Definition 0.21(i) and (ii). If T is approximable the
integer A may be chosen to satisfy (iii) as well.
Thus in proving that T is (weakly) approximable we can choose our compact generator
and t–structure to suit our convenience. Once we know the category is approximable,
it follows that the convenient t–structure is in the preferred class, and any compact
generator and any t–structure in the preferred equivalence class fulfill the approximability
criteria.
Facts 0.23. As stated in the first few paragraphs of the introduction [before we presented the definitions] we will prove that, if X is a quasicompact, separated scheme, then
T = Dqc (X) is approximable and the standard t–structure is in the preferred equivalence
class. If X is noetherian then Tcb ⊂ Tc− are just Dbcoh (X) ⊂ D−
coh (X), for non-noetherian
−
b
X the description of Tc ⊂ Tc is slightly more complicated, but still classical—see Example 3.4. The fact that the standard t–structure is in the preferred equivalence class tells
+
+
b
b
us that T − = D−
qc (X), T = Dqc (X) and T = Dqc (X).
Another example is the homotopy category T of spectra. In this case we can take
≤0
T ⊂ T to be the subcategory of connective spectra—the t–structure this defines is in
the preferred equivalence class. The category T turns out to be approximable, and the
subcategory Tc− is the category of spectra X whose stable homotopy groups πi (X) are

10

AMNON NEEMAN

finitely generated Z–modules and πi (X) = 0 for i ≪ 0. And Tcb ⊂ Tc− is the subcategory
where all but finitely many of the πi (X) vanish.
The representability we prove in Theorem 0.3 applies to this example but the result is
not new. There is a theorem of Adams [1] which says that every cohomological functor H
on T c is the restriction of a representable one on T, and it is easy to show that finiteness
or local finiteness of H translate to saying that the representing object must lie in Tcb or
Tc− . But the theorem of Adams does not generalize to Dperf (X) ⊂ Dqc (X); see [15, 8].
We will not give a proof but the interested reader can check that, if X is a quasicompact, separated scheme and Z ⊂ X is a closed subset with quasicompact complement,
then the category T = Dqc,Z (X), the subcategory of Dqc (X) of all complexes supported
on Z, is weakly approximable but not approximable. The standard t–structure is in the
preferred equivalence class. If X is noetherian the categories Tc− and Tcb are (respectively)
b
the intersections of D−
coh (X) and Dcoh (X) with the category Dqc,Z (X).
The definitions have all been made and the reader can go back to the statements of
Theorem 0.3 and Corollary 0.4, which are now precise. Note that in both results T has
to be approximable, weakly approximable is not enough.
We have discussed what we know, but should point out that there are many more
potential examples. After all: let R be a commutative ring and let T be a dg R–algebra.
Then the category T = H0 (T –Mod) is a triangulated category with coproducts and a
single compact generator T . It has a preferred equivalence class of t–structures, one can
define the intrinsic subcategories T − , T + , T b , Tc− and Tcb , and in general I have no idea
what they are. If H i (T ) = 0 for i ≫ 0 then the subcategories Tc− and Tcb are thick,
this follows from Remark 0.20. If H i (T ) = 0 for all i > 0 we are in the trivial case (see
Remark 3.3), where it’s easy to prove the category H0 (T –Mod) approximable and work
out explicitly what are T − , T + , T b , Tc− and Tcb .
So far the only other general result, producing further examples of approximable triangulated categories, is [6, Theorem 4.1]. It says that, under reasonable hypotheses,
the recollement of two approximable triangulated categories is approximable. But for
T a general dga, satisfying H i (T ) = 0 for i ≫ 0, I have no idea when the categories
H0 (T –Mod) are approximable. In view of Theorem 0.3 and Corollary 0.4 it would be
interesting to find out, especially since the categories H0 (T –Mod) are of so much current
active interest—their study is at the core of noncommutative algebraic geometry. Who
knows, there might be a noncommutative generalization of GAGA.
1. Basics
Since t–structures will play a big part in the article we begin with a quick reminder of
some elementary facts.
Reminder 1.1. In this section T will be a triangulated category and (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) will be
a t–structure on T. The category A = T ≤0 ∩ T ≥0 is abelian, it is called the heart of the




≥ℓ
will let Hℓ be the functor Hℓ (−) = H Σℓ (−) = Σℓ (−)≤ℓ .

Lemma 1.2. Let T be a triangulated category and let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be a t–structure on T.
If F is an object of T − , and Hℓ (F ) = 0 for all ℓ > −i, then F belongs to T ≤−i .
Proof. We are given that F belongs to T − = ∪n T ≤n , hence F ∈ T ≤n for some n and the
map F ≤n −→ F is an isomorphism. But now the triangle F ≤ℓ−1 −→ F ≤ℓ −→ Σ−ℓ Hℓ (F )
informs us that, as long as ℓ > −i, the map F ≤ℓ−1 −→ F ≤ℓ is also an isomorphism.
Composing the string of isomorphisms F ≤−i −→ F ≤−i+1 −→ · · · −→ F ≤n −→ F we
have that F ≤−i −→ F is an isomorphism—therefore F ∈ T ≤−i .


Lemma 1.3. If there is an integer A and a generator G ∈ T with Hom G, T ≤−A = 0,
then
(i) Any object F ∈ T − , with Hℓ (F ) = 0 for all ℓ, must vanish.
(ii) If f : E −→ F is a morphism in T − such that Hℓ (f ) is an isomorphism for every
ℓ ∈ Z, then f is an isomorphism.

Proof. To prove (i) assume Hℓ (F ) = 0 for all ℓ; Lemma 1.2 says that F belongs to ∩ℓ T ≤ℓ .
But then Hom(Σi G, F ) = 0 for all i ∈ Z, and as G is a generator this implies F = 0.
(ii) follows by applying (i) to the mapping cone of f .

Lemma 1.4. Suppose the category T has coproducts, and the t–structure is such that
both T ≤0 and T ≥0 are closed under the coproducts of T. Then:
(i) The functors (−)≤0 and (−)≥0 both respect coproducts.
(ii) The heart A ⊂ T is closed in T under coproducts, and the functor H : T −→ A
respects coproducts.
(iii) The abelian category A satisfies [AB4], that is coproducts are exact.
(iv) If E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · is a sequence of objects and morphisms in T, then
there is a short exact sequence in the heart A of the t–structure

This proves (i).
Since T ≤0 and T ≥0 are closed in T under copoducts so is their intersection A =

Remark 1.5. Remark 0.15 tells us that, if T is a triangulated category with coproducts
and a single compact generator, then the preferred equivalence class contains t–structures
(T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) with T ≤0 and T ≥0 both closed under coproducts. This is the situation in which
we will apply Lemma 1.4. Note also that Remark 0.15 warns us that not every t–structure
in the preferred equivalence class need satisfy the property.
We will mostly use Lemma 1.4(iv) in the special case where the sequences Hℓ (E1 ) −→

2. The fundamental properties of approximability

Lemma 2.1. Let T be a triangulated category with a t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ), and let
S ⊂ T be a full subcategory with ΣS = S. Assume A is also a full subcategory of T, and
define A(m) inductively by
(i) A(1) = A.
(ii) A(m + 1) = A(m) ⋆ Σm A.
Suppose every object in F ∈ S ∩ T ≤0 admits a triangle E1 −→ F −→ D1 , with E1 ∈ A
and D1 ∈ S ∩ T ≤−1 . Then we can construct a sequence E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · ,

with a map from the sequence to F and so that, if we complete Em −→ F to a triangle
Em −→ F −→ Dm , then Em ∈ A(m) and Dm ∈ S ∩ T ≤−m .
Proof. We are given the case m = 1; assume we have constructed the sequence as far as
an integer m > 0, and we want to extend it to m+1. Take any object F ∈ S∩T ≤0 , and by
the inductive hypothesis construct the sequence up to m. In particular choose a triangle
Em −→ F −→ Dm with Em ∈ A(m) and Dm ∈ S ∩ T ≤−m . Now apply the case m = 1
to Σ−m Dm ; we produce a triangle E ′ −→ Dm −→ Dm+1 with Dm+1 ∈ S ∩ T ≤−m−1 and
E ′ ∈ Σm A. Form an octahedron from the composable morphisms F −→ Dm −→ Dm+1 ,
that is

The object Dm+1 belongs to S∩T ≤−m−1 by construction. The triangle Em −→ Em+1 −→
E ′ tells us that Em+1 ∈ A(m) ⋆ Σm A = A(m + 1), and we have factored the map
Em −→ F as Em −→ Em+1 −→ F so that, in the triangle Em+1 −→ F −→ Dm+1 , we
have Em+1 ∈ A(m + 1) and Dm+1 ∈ S ∩ T ≤−m−1 .

Corollary 2.2. Let T be a triangulated category with coproducts, let G ∈ T be an object,
and let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be a t–structure. The following is true.

with a map from the sequence to F and so that, if we complete Em −→ F to a triangle
[1−m−A,A]
Em −→ F −→ Dm , then Em ∈ hGimA
and Dm ∈ T ≤−m .
2.2.3. For a full subcategory S ⊂ T with ΣS = S, suppose every object F ∈ S ∩ T ≤0
admits a triangle E1 −→ F −→ D1 , with E1 ∈ hGi[−A,A] and D1 ∈ S ∩ T ≤−1 . Then
we can extend to a sequence E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · , with a map from the sequence
to F and so that, if we complete Em −→ F to a triangle Em −→ F −→ Dm , then
Em ∈ hGi[1−m−A,A] and Dm ∈ S ∩ T ≤−m .
2.2.4. For a full subcategory S ⊂ T with ΣS = S, suppose every object F ∈ S ∩ T ≤0
[−A,A]
admits a triangle E1 −→ F −→ D1 , with E1 ∈ hGiA

Lemma 2.3. Suppose T is a compactly generated triangulated category, G is a compact generator and (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) a t–structure. Suppose there exists an integer B with
Hom(Σ−B G, T ≤0 ) = 0.
With any sequence E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · mapping to F , and such that in
the triangles Em −→ F −→ Dm we have Dm ∈ T ≤−m , the (non-canonical) map
Hocolim
✲ Em −→ F is an isomorphism.
Proof. For any n ≥ 0 we have T ≤−n ⊂ T ≤0 , hence Hom(Σ−B G, T ≤−n ) = 0. By shifting
we deduce that Hom(Σ−ℓ G, T ≤−m ) = 0 as long as m + ℓ ≥ B.
The triangle Em −→ F −→ Dm , with Dm ∈ T ≤−m , tells us that if m > max(1, B − ℓ)
then the functor Hom(Σ−ℓ G, −) takes the map Em −→ F to an isomorphism. Now [14,
Lemma 2.8], applied to the compact object G ∈ T and the map from the sequence {Em }
to F , tells us that Hom(Σ−ℓ G, −) takes the map Hocolim
✲ Em −→ F to an isomorphism.

But G is a generator, hence the map Hocolim
✲ Em −→ F must be an isomorphism.
Proposition 2.4. Suppose the triangulated category T, the generator G and the t–
structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) are as in the hypotheses of weakly approximable categories of Definition 0.21. We remind the reader: T has coproducts, G is a compact generator, and
there is an integer A > 0 so that
(i) ΣA G ∈ T ≤0 and Hom(Σ−A G, T ≤0 ) = 0.

be an integer so that, with k = 1, the conditions

both hold. Then, after increasing the integer A if necessary, (i) and (ii) will also hold

then the integer A may be chosen large enough so that (iii) will hold for k = 2.
Proof. Because the t–structures are equivalent we may choose an integer
B so that

T2≤−B ⊂ T1≤0 ⊂ T2≤B . Hence Hom Σ−A−B G, T2≤0 ∼
= 0, where the

vanishing is because T2≤−B ⊂ T1≤0 and Hom Σ−A G, T1≤0 = 0. Also ΣA G ∈ T1≤0 ⊂ T2≤B
implies ΣA+B G ∈ T2≤0 . This proves (i) for k = 2, as long as we replace A by A + B.
If F is an object in T2≤0 ⊂ T1≤B we may, using (ii) in combination with (2.2.1) applied to
[−B−A,B+A]

ΣB F ∈ T1≤0 , construct a triangle E2B+1 −→ F −→ D2B+1 with E2B+1 ∈ hGi
and D2B+1 ∈ T1≤−B−1 ⊂ T2≤−1 . Thus (ii) also holds for k = 2, as long as A is replaced
by A + B.
It remains to prove the assertion (iii) for k = 2, assuming it holds for k = 1. By (2.2.2)
applied to ΣB F ∈ T1≤0 , we may construct the triangle E2B+1 −→ F −→ D2B+1 with

(i) ΣA H ∈ T1≤0 and Hom(Σ−A H, T1≤0 ) = 0.

Proof. The definition of weakly approximable categories gives us a compact generator
G, a t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) and an integer A satisfying (i) and (ii), plus (iii) if T is
approximable. Proposition 2.4 guarantees that (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) is in the preferred equivalence
class of t–structures. By assumption so is (T1≤0 , T1≥0 ), hence the t–structures (T ≤0 , T ≥0 )
and (T1≤0 , T1≥0 ) are equivalent. By Lemma 2.5 we can, by modifying the integer A, also
have the conditions (i), (ii) and [when appropriate] (iii) hold for the the t–structure
(T1≤0 , T1≥0 ) and the compact generator G. Thus we may assume that the t–structures
are the same. We have a single t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) = (T1≤0 , T1≥0 ), and two compact
generators G and H. There exists an integer A that works for G and the t–structure
(T ≤0 , T ≥0 ), and we need to produce an integer that works for H and the t–structure
(T ≤0 , T ≥0 ).
We are given that G and H are compact generators of T, hence hGi = T c = hHi,

Remark 2.7. We have so far proved Facts 0.22: Proposition 2.4 amounts to 0.22(i) and
Proposition 2.6 to 0.22(ii). The remainder of the section will be devoted to the basic
properties of the subcategory Tc− of Definition 0.16.
Lemma 2.8. Suppose T is a triangulated category with coproducts and let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be
a t–structure. Assume
there exists a compact generator G and an integer A > 0 so that

Hom Σ−A G, T ≤0 = 0.
Then for any compact
 object H ∈ T there exists an integer B > 0, depending on H,
with Hom Σ−B H, T ≤0 = 0.
Proof. Let H ∈ T be a compact object. The fact that G is a compact generator gives
the equality in H ∈ T c = hGi; Lemma 0.9(i) allows us to deduce that H ∈ hGi[−C,C]

A BROWN REPRESENTABILITY THEOREM

for some C > 0. Thus Σ−A−C H ∈ hGi[A,A+2C] , and as Hom hGi[A,A+2C] , T ≤0 = 0 the
Lemma follows, with B = A + C.

Lemma 2.9. Suppose T is a compactly generated triangulated category and let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 )
be a t–structure. Assume
there exists a compact generator G and an integer A > 0 so


that Hom Σ G, T
= 0.
Then the subcategory Tc− ⊂ T is triangulated.
Proof. It is clear that Tc− is closed under all suspensions and is additive. We must show
that, if R −→ S −→ T −→ ΣR is a triangle so that R and T belong to Tc− , then S must
also belong to Tc− .
Choose any integer m > 0. Because T belongs to Tc− we may choose a triangle
′
T −→ T −→ T ′′ with T ′ ∈ T c and T ′′ ∈ T ≤−m . Since T ′ is compact, Lemma 2.8 says
that we may choose an integer B > 0 with Hom T ′ , T ≤−B = 0.
Now R belongs to Tc− , allowing us to choose a triangle R′ −→ R −→ R′′ with R′ ∈ T c
and R′′ ∈ T ≤−m−B . We have a diagram

Because R′ and T ′ are compact, the triangle R′ −→ S ′ −→ T ′ tells us that S ′ must be
compact. Also T ′′ ∈ T ≤−m and R′′ ∈ T ≤−m−B ⊂ T ≤−m , and the triangle R′′ −→ S ′′ −→
T ′′ implies that S ′′ ∈ T ≤−m . The triangle S ′ −→ S −→ S ′′ now does the job for S. 
Proposition 2.10. Suppose T is a compactly generated triangulated category and let
(T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be a t–structure. Assume there exists a compact generator G and an integer
A > 0 so that ΣA G ∈ T ≤0 and Hom Σ−A G, T ≤0 = 0.
Then the subcategory Tc− is thick.
Proof. We already know that Tc− is triangulated, we need to prove it closed under direct
summands. Suppose therefore that S ⊕ T belongs to Tc− , we must prove that so does S.
Consider the map 0 ⊕ id : S ⊕ T −→ S ⊕ T . Complete to a triangle

the case n = 0 above. For any n we know that Σ2n+1 (S ⊕ ΣS) ∼
= Σ2n+2 S ⊕ Σ2n+1 S lies

in Tc , and induction on n allows us to assume that so does S ⊕ Σ2n+1 S. The triangle

By Remark 0.18 the category Tc− is contained in T − , and the object S ⊕ ΣS must
belong to T ≤ℓ for some ℓ > 0. Hence S belongs to T ≤ℓ and, for every integer m > 0,
we have that Σℓ+m S ∈ T ≤−m . Choose an integer n ≥ 0 with 2n + 2 ≥ ℓ + m; then
Σ2n+2 S ∈ T ≤−m . Since the object S ⊕ Σ2n+1 S belongs to Tc− we may choose a triangle
K −→ S ⊕ Σ2n+1 S −→ P with K ∈ T c and P ∈ T ≤−m . Now form the octahedron on

By [16, Lemma 1.7] any morphism from an object in T c , to any of X1 , X2 or Z, factors
(respectively) through an object in A1 , A2 or C. Now the map f : K −→ K ′ is a
morphism from K ∈ T c to an object K ′ ∈ Xi ∗ Z, with i = 1 or i = 2. By [16, Lemma 1.5]
it factors as K −→ K ′′ −→ K ′ with K ′′ ∈ Ai ∗ C, with i = 1 or 2. Since the composite
K −→ K ′′ −→ K ′ −→ K is the identity we deduce that K is a direct summand of the

Now hGi(−∞,−3A−1] ⊂ T c hence the object D is compact, and it belongs to T ≤−2A−1 since
G ∈ T ≤A . Applying Lemma 2.11 to the object Σ−2A−1 D and with m = 6A we obtain a

Proposition 2.13. Let us fix a weakly approximable [or approximable] triangulated category T. Choose a compact generator G and a t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) in the preferred

Corollary 2.14. Let T be a weakly approximable triangulated category. Let G be a
compact generator and let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be a t–structure in the preferred equivalence class.
Choose an integer B > 0 as in Lemma 2.12.
For any object F ∈ Tc− ∩ T ≤0 there exists a sequence of objects E1 −→ E2 −→
E3 −→ · · · mapping to F , and so that Em ∈ hGi[1−m−B,B] and in each triangle Em −→

Proof. The fact that any such sequence would deliver a non-canonical isomorphism

✲ Em −→ F is contained in Lemma 2.3. We need to prove the existence of
the sequence.
In Proposition 2.13 we constructed a triangle E1 −→ F −→ D1 with E1 ∈ hGi[−B,B]
and D1 ∈ T ≤−1 . But hGi[−B,B] ⊂ T c , and in Remark 0.17 we noted that T c ⊂ Tc− . In
the triangle E1 −→ F −→ D1 we have that both E1 and F lie in Tc− , while Lemma 2.9
proved that the category Tc− is triangulated. Therefore D1 ∈ Tc− ∩T ≤−1 . If we let S = Tc−
we are in the situation of Corollary 2.2, more specifically the hypotheses of (2.2.3) hold;

if T is approximable the hypotheses of (2.2.4) hold. The current Corollary is simply the
conclusions of (2.2.3) and (2.2.4).

3. Examples
In Section 2 we developed some abstraction, and it’s high time to look at examples.
We begin with the trivial ones.
Example 3.1. Let R be a ring, and put T = D(R) its unbounded derived category.
The category T has coproducts and R is a compact generator. Let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be the
standard t–structure. Then Hom Σ−1 R, T ≤0 = 0 and ΣR ∈ T ≤0 .
Let F be any object in T ≤0 . That is, we take a cochain complex F with H ℓ (F ) = 0
for all ℓ > 0. Such a complex has a free resolution; it is isomorphic in T to the cochain

gory is approximable, the standard t–structure is in preferred equivalence class, and Tc−
is just D− (R–proj), the category of bounded-above complexes which admit projective
resolutions by finitely generated projectives.
The category Tcb is the intersection Tc− ∩ T b ; it consists of the objects in D− (R–proj)
with only finitely many nonzero cohomology groups. We have an inclusion Db (R–proj) ⊂
Tcb , and for R general I don’t know much about the difference Tcb − Db (R–proj). When R
is noetherian we have Tcb = Db (R–mod), which is usually much larger than Db (R–proj).
Example 3.2. A very similar analysis works when T is the homotopy category of spectra.
The sphere S 0 is a compact generator. Consider the t–structure where T ≤0 is the category
of connective spectra—these
are the spectra F with πi (F ) = 0 when i < 0. Then

Example 3.4. If X is a quasicompact, quasiseparated scheme then T = Dqc (X) has
a single compact generator, see Bondal and Van den Bergh [5, Theorem 3.1.1(ii)]. Let
G be any such compact generator; [5, Theorem 3.1.1(i)] tells us that G is a perfect
complex. Let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be the standard t–structure. It is easy
 to show that there exists
an integer A > 0 so that ΣA G ∈ T ≤0 and Hom Σ−A G, T ≤0 = 0. It follows formally,
from Proposition 2.10, that Tc− is thick.
But in this case we happen to know Tc− explicitly. To state the results it might be
helpful to imagine two classes of objects in T = Dqc (X).
−
(i) The objects belonging to Tc− = Dqc (X)−
c , for the Tc defined using the standard
t–structure.
(ii) The objects locally with this property. That is the objects P ∈ Dqc (X) such that,

for any open immersion j : Spec(R) −→ X, the object Lj ∗ P ∈ Dqc Spec(R) ∼

case of D(R) the standard t–structure is in the preferred equivalence class.

The objects satisfying (ii) are classically called pseudocoherent, they were first studied in
Illusie’s exposés [11, 12] in SGA6. Now [13, Theorem 4.1] is precisely the statement that
the objects satisfying (ii) all satisfy (i). It is trivial to check that the objects satisfying (i)
must satisfy (ii); this means that, for the standard t–structure on T = Dqc (X), the subcategory Tc− is just Dpqc (X) ⊂ Dqc (X), the subcategory of pseudocoherent complexes. If
X happens to be noetherian then pseudocoherence simplifies to something more familiar:
for noetherian X we have Tc− = Dpqc (X) = D−
coh (X).
Still in the general case, where X is only assumed quasicompact and quasiseparated:
Since G is compact it is perfect, and there exists an integer A > 0 so that Hom(G, Σi G) =
0 for all i ≥ A. Remark 0.20 applies and teaches us that the Tc− corresponding to the
preferred equivalence class of t–structures is also thick.
This ends what I know in glorious generality. In this kind of generality I have no idea
if Dqc (X) is approximable, or how the Tc− obtained from a t–structure in the preferred
equivalence class compares to Tc− = Dpqc (X), the subcategory Tc− that comes from the
standard t–structure on T = Dqc (X). But when X is separated we can prove
Lemma 3.5. Let X be a separated, quasicompact scheme, let T = Dqc (X) be its derived category, and let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be the standard t–structure. Then there is a compact
generator G′ ∈ T and an integer A > 0, so that every object F ∈ T ≤0 admits a triangle
[−A,A]
and D ∈ T ≤−1 .
E −→ F −→ D with E ∈ hG′ iA
Proof. Absolute noetherian approximation, that is Thomason and Trobaugh [21, Theorem C.9] or [20, Tags 01YT and 081A], allows us to choose a separated scheme Y , of finite

type over Z, and an affine map f : X −→ Y . From [16, Definition 5.2 and Theorem 5.8],
in the special case where S = Dqc (Y )≤0 for the standard t–structure and m = 0, we
learn:
(i) There exists a compact generator G ∈ Dqc (Y ) and an integer A > 0, so that
[−A,A]

every F ′ ∈ Dqc (Y )≤0 admits a triangle E ′ −→ F ′ −→ D ′ with E ′ ∈ hGiA
D ′ ∈ Dqc (Y )≤−1 .

and

Hall and Rydh [10, Lemma 8.2] tells us that G′ = Lf ∗ G is a compact generator for
Dqc (X); this is our choice of G′ for the Lemma. Now take any object F ∈ Dqc (X)≤0 .
Since f : X −→ Y is affine we have Rf∗ F ∼
= f∗ F ∈ Dqc (Y )≤0 , and (i) above permits us
[−A,A]

to find a triangle E ′ −→ f∗ F −→ D ′ with E ′ ∈ hGiA
and D ′ ∈ Dqc (Y )≤−1 . Applying
∗
∗

the functor Lf , and remembering that Lf Dqc (Y ) ⊂ Dqc (X)≤0 , we deduce
(ii) There is in Dqc (X) a triangle Lf ∗ E ′ −→ Lf ∗ f∗ F −→ Lf ∗ D ′ , with Lf ∗ D ′ ∈
[−A,A]

Dqc (X)≤−1 and Lf ∗ E ′ ∈ Lf ∗ hGiA

But the counit of adjunction gives a map ε :

f∗ ε

f∗ F −→ f∗
∗ F −→ f∗ F compose to the identity tells us that the functor f∗ takes
∗
ε : Lf f∗ F −→ F to a split epimorphism. In particular f∗ ε induces an epimorphism on
cohomology sheaves and, because f is affine, this means that ε induces an epimorphism
of cohomology sheaves already over X. We have a morphism ε : Lf ∗ f∗ F −→ F in
Dqc (X)≤0 and, if we complete it to a triangle, the long exact sequence of cohomology
sheaves gives
ε

(iii) In the triangle Lf ∗ f∗ F −→ F −→ D ′′ we have D ′′ ∈ Dqc (X)≤−1 .

Example 3.6. Assume X is separated and quasicompact, and let the t–structure on
T = Dqc (X) be the standard one. Lemma 3.5 finds a generator G′ and an integer A > 0
so that, for every object F ∈ T ≤0 , there exists a triangle E −→ F −→ D with E ∈

Putting this together we have that T is approximable; it satisfies Definition 0.21 for the
compact generator G′ , the standard t–structure, and the integer max(A, A′ ). And now
Proposition 2.6 informs us that
(i) The standard t–structure is in the preferred equivalence class.
By (i) the two Tc− discussed in Example 3.4 agree. Hence
(ii) For the Tc− coming from a t–structure in the preferred equivalence class we have
Tc− = Dpqc (X), the category of pseudocoherent complexes. If X is noetherian this
simplifies to D−
coh (X).
Up until now we have simply figured out that the standard t–structure on Dqc (X) is
in the preferred equivalence class, that Dqc (X) is approximable and that Dqc (X)−
c is
p
nothing other than Dqc (X). Together this tells us first that Dqc (X) is an example of
the general theory, and then works out what Dqc (X)−
c is.
When we apply Corollary 2.14 we discover something new.
(iii) Let X be a quasicompact, separated scheme, and let G be a compact generator
of Dqc (X). There exists an integer B > 0 so that, for any integer m > 0 and
any object F ∈ Dpqc (X) ∩ Dqc (X)≤0 , there is a triangle Em −→ F −→ Dm with
[1−m−B,B]
and Dm ∈ Dqc (X)≤−m .
Em ∈ hGimB
4. Approximating systems
In this short section we collect some elementary facts about countable direct limits
of representable functors. The generality that will suffice for us is R–linear functors
between R–linear categories, where R is a commutative ring.
Definition 4.1. Let R be a commutative ring, let T be an R–linear category, let A, B
be full subcategories of T, and let H : Bop −→ R–Mod be an R–linear functor. An A–
approximating system for H is a sequence in A of objects and morphisms E1 −→ E2 −→
E3 −→ · · · , so that
(i) There is a cofinal subsequence of E∗ whose objects belong to A ∩ B.
(ii) We are given an isomorphism colim Hom(−, Ei ) −→ H(−).
−→
In this article we will mostly consider the case where A is contained in B, but in a sequel
we will need the more flexible notion.
Since we will freely use approximating systems in our constructions, it is comforting
to know that they are all the same up to subsequences. More precisely we have
Lemma 4.2. Suppose we have an R–linear functor H : Bop −→ R–Mod, and two
A–approximating systems E∗ and F∗ for H. Then the systems E∗ and F∗ are indisomorphic. We remind the reader: this means that there exists an A–approximating
system L∗ for the functor H, more explicitly L1 −→ L2 −→ L3 −→ · · · , and subsequences
E∗′ ⊂ E∗ , F∗′ ⊂ F∗ and L′∗ , L′′∗ ⊂ L∗ with E∗′ = L′∗ and F∗′ = L′′∗ .

A BROWN REPRESENTABILITY THEOREM

27

Proof. Since we may pass to subsequences we will assume that both E∗ and F∗ belong
to A ∩ B, To slightly compress the argument we will extend the sequences by zero; we
will set E0 = F0 = L0 = 0, look at the sequences E0 −→ E1 −→ E2 −→ · · · and F0 −→
F1 −→ F2 −→ · · · , and out of them construct the sequence L0 −→ L1 −→ L2 −→ · · · .
Let L0 = 0 and L1 = E1 , and inductively proceed as follows. Assume that, for some
m ≥ 1, the sequence L0 −→ L1 −→ · · · Lm−1 −→ Lm and the map from the sequence to
H(−) have been defined, in such a way that L1 −→ L3 −→ L5 −→ · · · is a subsequence
of E∗ and L0 −→ L2 −→ L4 −→ L6 −→ · · · is a subsequence of F∗ . We wish to extend
to m + 1. There are two cases, m can be odd or even, but up to interchanging E∗ and
F∗ in the argument below they are the same. We will therefore assume m odd and leave
to the reader the even case.
Then Lm is equal to EJ for some J > 0 while Lm−1 is FI for some I ≥ 0. The map
Hom(−, Lm ) = Hom(−, EJ ) −→ H(−) = colim Hom(−, Fi ) is a natural transformation
−→
from the representable functor Hom(−, EJ ) to the colimit. Yoneda tells us that it corresponds to an element in H(EJ ) = colim Hom(EJ , Fi ), where the colimit is over i. We
−→
may therefore choose an I ′ > J and a morphism Lm = EJ −→ FI ′ which delivers the
right element in the colimit. The composite FI = Lm−1 −→ Lm −→ FI ′ does not have
to agree with the map FI −→ FI ′ of the sequence F∗ , but they have the same image in
H(FI ) = colim Hom(FI , Fi ) [where the colimit is over i]. That is: after composing with
−→

some FI ′ −→ FI ′′ in the sequence F∗ they become equal. Set Lm+1 = FI ′′ .
Lemma 4.3. Let T be and R–linear category let A, B be full subcategories, let H, H ′ :
Bop −→ R–Mod be two R–linear functors, and assume we are given for H an A–
approximating system E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · . Replacng the sequence E∗ by a subsequence belonging to A ∩ B, there is a natural isomorphism Hom(H, H ′ ) ∼

Corollary 4.4. Suppose we are given R–linear categories A ⊂ B and two R–linear
functors H, H ′ : Bop −→ R–Mod. If H has an A–approximating system then restriction

to the subcategory A ⊂ B is a natural bijection Hom(H, H ′ ) −→ Hom H|A , H ′ |A .

Proof. Choose an A–approximating system E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · for H. Lemma 4.3
tells us that both sets are in bijection with lim H ′ (Em ), and the bijection commutes with

Lemma 4.5. Let B be an R–linear category, let H, H ′ : Bop −→ R–Mod be two R–linear
functors, and let ϕ : H −→ H ′ be a natural transformation. If each of H, H ′ has a B–
approximating system, let’s say E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · for H and E1′ −→ E2′ −→
E3′ −→ · · · for H ′ then, after replacing E1′ −→ E2′ −→ E3′ −→ · · · by a subsequence, we
can produce a map of sequences f∗ : E∗ −→ E∗′ so that ϕ : H −→ H ′ is the colimit of the
image of f∗ under Yoneda.
Moreover: if we are given n > 0 pairs of subsequences of E∗ and E∗′ , then we construct
the subsequence of the map f∗ : E∗ −→ E∗′ to respect the given subsequences.
Proof. By Lemma 4.3 we have an isomorphism
Hom(H, H ′ ) ∼
= lim H ′ (Ei ) = lim i colimj Hom(Ei , Ej′ ).
←−
←− −→
′
Our element ϕ ∈ Hom(H, H ) must therefore correspond to an inverse system of elements
ϕi ∈ colimj Hom(Ei , Ej′ ). We proceed inductively.
−→
(i) Choose a some integer j1 and a preimage in Hom(E1 , Ej′ ) of ϕ1 ∈ colimj Hom(E1 , Ej ).
1
−→
Call this map f1 : E1 −→ Ej′ . If E1 belongs to one of the prescribed subsequences
1
of E∗ then choose j1 so that Ej′ belongs to the matching subsequence of E∗′ .
1
(ii) Suppose the sequence has been constructed up to an integer m ≥ 1. In particular we
have a map Em −→ Ej′ m , whose image under the natural map Hom(Em , Ej′ m ) −→
colimj Hom(Em , Ej′ ) is ϕm .
−→
We have the element ϕm+1 ∈ colimj (Em+1 , Ej′ ), we can choose a preimage in
−→
Hom(Em+1 , EJ ) for some integer J, and we may assume J > jm . This gives us a
map f ′ : Em+1 −→ EJ′ . Now the square

need not commute, but the two composites both go, via the map Hom(Em , EJ′ ) −→
colimj Hom(Em , Ej′ ), to the same element ϕm . Hence replacing EJ′ by some Ej′
m+1
−→
with jm+1 > J, we may assume the square commutes. And if Em+1 belongs to one
of the prescribed subsequences of E∗ , choose jm+1 > J so that Ej′
belongs to
m+1
′
the matching subsequence of E∗ .
We have replaced E∗′ by a subsequence and produced a map of sequences f∗ : E∗ −→ E∗′ .
The reader can check that, if we apply Yoneda to the map of sequences f∗ : E∗ −→ E∗′
and then take colimits, we recover ϕ : H −→ H ′ .

Remark 4.6. In the remainder of the paper we will use approximating systems in the
following situation. We will work in some ambient R–linear triangulated category T, and
will assume that T has coproducts. What is special in this case is that, given a functor

H : Bop −→ R–Mod and an A–approximating system E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · for H,
we can construct in T the homotopy colimit F = Hocolim
✲ Ei . For (−) in the category
B we have a natural map
colim Hom(−, Ei )
−→

H(−)

/ Hom(−, F )

and we will be interested in approximating sequences for which this map H(−) −→
Hom(−, F ) is an isomorphism.
In this situation we will say that E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · is an A–approximating
system for F over B.
Remark 4.7. In this article the case of interest is where B ⊂ T c , that is the objects
of B are all compact. From [14, Lemma 2.8] we know that, for any compact object
∼
K ∈ T and any sequence of objects of T, the
 natural map is an isomorphism H(K) =
colim Hom(K, Ei ) −→ Hom K, Hocolim
✲ Ei . Thus we’re automatically in the situation
−→
of Remark 4.6; any sequence E∗ in A is an A–approximating system for F = Hocolim
✲ Ei ,
over any B ⊂ T c . Late in the article (meaning in Section 7) we will therefore allow
ourselves to occasionally leave unspecified the category B ⊂ T c , and just say that E∗ is
an A–approximating system for F .
For now we are careful to specify B, because we plan to use the lemmas in other
contexts in future articles.
In the generality of Remark 4.6 we note the following little observation.
Lemma 4.8. Let T be a triangulated category with coproducts, let A, B be subcategories,
and assume E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · is a A–approximating system for F ∈ T over B.
If G is another object of T, and if ϕ : Hom(−, F )|B −→ Hom(−, G)|B is a natural
transformation of functors on B, then there exists in T a (non-unique) morphism f :
F −→ G with ϕ = Hom(−, f )|B .
Proof. By Lemma 4.3 the natural transformation ϕ : Hom(−, F ) −→ Hom(−, G) corresponds to an element in lim Hom(Ei , G). Thus for each i we are given in T a morphism
←−
fi : Ei −→ G, compatibly with the sequence maps Ei −→ Ei+1 . The compatibility
means that the composite

5. An easy representability theorem
It’s time to start proving representability theorems. The main theorems in the article
are a little technical—they depend on taking homotopy colimits carefully. For this reason
I thought it best to illustrate the methods in a simple case, which involves no homotopy
colimits. In this section we give a simple proof of an old result of Rouquier, generalizing
an even older result of Bondal and Van den Bergh.
Lemma 5.1. Let R be a commutative, noetherian ring, let S be an R–linear triangulated
category, let G ∈ S be an object and, with the notation of Definition 0.1 and Remark 0.2,
assume Hom(−, G) is a G–finite cohomological functor. Let k ≥ 0 be an integer and
H a finite hGi2k –cohomological functor. Then there exists an object F ∈ hGi2k and an
epimorphism Hom(−, F )|hGi k −→ H(−).
2

Proof. The proof is by induction on k. Suppose k = 0: by hypothesis H(Σ−i G) is
a finite R–module, and vanishes for i outside a bounded interval [−A, A]. For each i
with −A ≤ i ≤ A choose a finite set of generators {fij , j ∈ Ji } for the R–module
H(Σ−i G). Yoneda tells us that each fij corresponds to a natural transformation ϕij :
−i
Hom(−, Σ−i G)|hGi1 −→ H(−). Define F to be F = ⊕A
i=−A ⊕j∈Ji Σ G, and let ϕ :
Hom(−, F )|hGi1 −→ H(−) be the composite
A
M
M

Hom(−, F )|hGi1

Hom(− , Σ−i G)|hGi1

(ϕij )

/ H(−)

i=−A j∈Ji

Obviously F belongs to hGi1 and ϕ is surjective.
Now suppose we know the Lemma for k ≥ 0, and let H be a finite hGi2k+1 –cohomological
functor. Then the restriction of H to hGi2k is a finite hGi2k –cohomological functor, and
induction permits us to find an object F1 ∈ hGi2k and an epimorphism ϕ : Hom(−, F1 )|hGi k −→
2
H(−)|hGi k . Complete the map ϕ to a short exact sequence

/ Hom(−, F1 )|hGi

ϕ

Then H ′ is a finite hGi2k –cohomological functor, and induction applies again to tell us
that there exists an object F2 ∈ hGi2k and an epimorphism ρ : Hom(−, F2 )|hGi k −→
2
H ′ (−). Combining the results we deduce an exact sequence of functors

Hom(−, F1 )|hGi k is Hom(−, α)|hGi k for some morphism α : F2 −→ F1 , the natural trans2

formation ϕ : Hom(−, F1 )|hGi k −→ H(−)|hGi k corresponds to some element y ∈ H(F1 ),

to zero.
β
γ
α
Complete α : F2 −→ F1 to a triangle F2 −→ F1 −→ F −→ ΣF2 . As F1 and ΣF2
belong to hGi2k , the triangle tells us that F must be in hGi2k ∗ hGi2k ⊂ hGi2k+1 . And
now we remember that H is actually a hGi2k+1 –cohomological functor. The sequence
H(β)

H(α)

H(F ) −→ H(F1 ) −→ H(F2 ) is exact, and the vanishing of H(α)(y) says that there exists
an element x ∈ H(F ) so that H(β) : H(F ) −→ H(F1 ) takes x ∈ H(F ) to y ∈ H(F1 ).
By Yoneda x corresponds to a natural transformation ψ : Hom(−, F )|hGi k+1 −→ H(−).
2
The fact that H(β)x = y translates, via Yoneda, to the assertion that the composite

surjectivity of the map ψ : Hom(C , F ) −→ H(C ). Now hGi2k+1 = smd hGi2k ∗ hGi2k ,
so there exists an object C ′′ ∈ S with C ′ ⊕ C ′′ ∈ hGi2k ∗ hGi2k . Put C = C ′ ⊕ C ′′ and it
clearly suffices to prove the surjectivity of ψ : Hom(C, F ) −→ H(C). Choose a triangle

Take any z ∈ H(C). The map H(β ′ ) : H(C) −→ H(B) takes z to an element
H(β ′ )z ∈ H(B). But the map ϕ : Hom(B, F1 ) −→ H(B) is surjective, hence there
is an element g ∈ Hom(B, F1 ) with ϕ(g) = H(β ′ )(z). Now 0 = H(α′ )H(β ′ )z =
H(α′ )ϕ((g) = ϕHom(α′ , F1 )g, where the last equality is by the naturality of the map
ϕ : Hom(−, F1 )|hGi k −→ H(−)|hGi k . Therefore Hom(α′ , F1 )g = gα′ ∈ Hom(A, F1 ) lies
2
2
in the kernel of ϕ : Hom(A, F1 ) −→ H(A). The exact sequence

tells us that there is an f ∈ Hom(A, F2 ) with gα′ = Hom(A, α)f = αf .

We now have an element h ∈ Hom(C, F ) with hβ ′ = βg, or in more complicated terms
Hom(β ′ , F )h = Hom(B, β)g. This buys us the third equality below
H(β ′ )z = ϕ(g)
= ψHom(B, β)(g)
= ψHom(β ′ , F )h
= H(β ′ )ψ(h)
The first equality is the choice of g, the second is because on the category hGi2k we
have ϕ = ψ ◦ Hom(−, β), and the fourth equality is the naturality of ψ. We deduce that
H(β ′ ) : H(C) −→ H(B) annihilates z − ψ(h).
H(γ ′ )

H(β ′ )

But the exact sequence H(ΣA) −→ H(C) −→ H(B) tells us there exists a z ′ ∈
H(ΣA) with H(γ ′ )z ′ = z−ψ(h). Since ΣA belongs to hGi2k the map ϕ : Hom(ΣA, F1 ) −→
H(ΣA) must be surjective; there is a λ ∈ Hom(ΣA, F1 ) with ϕ(λ) = z ′ . Therefore
z − ψ(h) = H(γ ′ )ϕ(λ)
= H(γ ′ )ψHom(ΣA, β)(λ)
= ψHom(γ ′ , F )Hom(ΣA, β)(λ)
= ψ(βλγ ′ )
where the second equality is the fact that on the category hGi2k we have ϕ = ψ ◦
Hom(−, β), the third is the naturality of ψ, and the fourth is obvious. Hence z =
ψ(h + βλγ ′ ) is in the image of ψ.

When R is a field the theorem below is due to Bondal and Van den Bergh [5, Theorem 1.3], and in the generality below it may be found in Rouquier [18, Theorem 4.16 and
Corollary 4.18]. We include this new proof because it contains the simple ideas, whose
more technical adaptation will yield the theorems of Section 7.
Theorem 5.2. Let R be a noetherian, commutative ring, let S be an R–linear triangulated category, and assume that G ∈ S is a strong generator—we remind the reader,
this means that there exists some integer n > 0 with hGin = S. Assume H is a finite
cohomological functor, as is Hom(−, G). Then there exists a cohomological functor H ′
with H ⊕ H ′ representable. If S is Karoubian, meaning idempotents split, then H is
representable.
Proof. Choose an integer k with hGi2k = S. Applying Lemma 5.1 to the hGi2k –cohomological
functor H we can find an epimorphism Hom(−, F ) −→ H(−). Complete to an exact sequence 0 −→ H ′ (−) −→ Hom(−, F ) −→ H(−) −→ 0, and it follows that H ′
is also a finite cohomological functor. Applying Lemma 5.1 again we have a surjection Hom(−, F ′ ) −→ H ′ (−), and this assembles to an exact sequence Hom(−, F ′ ) −→
Hom(−, F ) −→ H(−) −→ 0.

A BROWN REPRESENTABILITY THEOREM

33

Yoneda’s lemma tells us that the natural transformation Hom(−, F ′ ) −→ Hom(−, F )
must be of the form Hom(−, α) for some α : F ′ −→ F , that the natural transformation
Hom(−, F ) −→ H(−) corresponds to an element y ∈ H(F ), and that the vanishing
of the composite Hom(−, F ′ ) −→ Hom(−, F ) −→ H(−) means that the map H(α) :
H(F ) −→ H(F ′ ) must take y ∈ H(F ) to zero. Now complete α : F ′ −→ F to a triangle
α

H(β)

β

H(α)

F ′ −→ F −→ F ′′ −→. The exactness of H(F ′′ ) −→ H(F ) −→ H(F ′ ), coupled with the
fact that H(α)y = 0, means that there must be an element x ∈ H(F ′′ ) with y = H(β)x.
By Yoneda this means that we obtain a natural transformation Hom(−, F ′′ ) −→ H(−)
so that the diagram below commutes
Hom(−, F ′ )

/ Hom(−, F )

and the rows are exact. It immediately follows that the map Hom(−, F ′′ ) −→ H(−) is a
split epimorphism.
Choose a splitting H(−) −→ Hom(−, F ′′ ), for example the one coming from the
diagram above. The composite Hom(−, F ′′ ) −→ H(−) −→ Hom(−, F ′′ ) is an idempotent
natural endomorphism of a representable functor, therefore of the form Hom(−, e) where
e : F ′′ −→ F ′′ is idempotent. If e splits then H is representable.

6. A couple of technical lemmas
In Section 7 we will prove Theorem 0.3. The proof will rely heavily on a couple of
technical lemmas—in this section we state these in great generality, to cover both the
application to come in Section 7 and the one to be found in the proof of [17, Theorem 4.6].
Let us therefore set up a little notation.
Notation 6.1. Throughout this section R will be a commutative ring, T will be an
R–linear triangulated category with coproducts, and S ⊂ T will
 be a triangulated subcategory. The Yoneda functor Y : T −→ HomR Sop , R–Mod will be the map taking
t ∈ T to Hom(−, t), where Hom(−, t) is viewed as an R–linear functor Sop −→ R–Mod.
We remind the reader of Definition 4.1: suppose A is a full subcategory of T closed
under direct summands, finite coproducts and suspensions, and H is a S–cohomological
functor, meaning H : Sop −→ R–Mod is an R–linear cohomological functor. Then a
A–approximatng system for H is a sequence E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · in A, with a
subsequence in A ∩ S, and an isomorphism colim Y(Ei ) −→ H(−).
−→
Definition 6.2. Let T be an R–linear triangulated category with coproducts and let S be
a triangulated subcategory. If H is a S–cohomological functor, we define ΣH by the rule
ΣH(s) = H(Σ−1 s).

the surjective map ψβ : B(b) −→ H(b). After all b is an object in B, and the map
ψβ : B(b) −→ H(b) is an epimorphism on objects b ∈ B. Choose an element g ∈ B(b)

If we apply the equal composites in the square to g ∈ B(b) we discover that it goes to

takes g ∈ B(b) to an element in the kernel of ψβ : B(a) −→ H(a). As a belongs to A
the map α : A(a) −→ B(a) surjects onto this kernel; there is an element f ∈ A(a) with
α(f ) = B(α′ )(g).
We have produced elements f ∈ A(a) and g ∈ B(b), and Yoneda allows us to view

We have produced a morphism h : Y(c) −→ C, which we may view as an element
h ∈ C(c). And the commutativity of the middle square translates, under Yoneda, to
the statement that C(β ′ ) : C(c) −→ C(b) takes h ∈ C(c) to β(g) ∈ C(b). Applying
ψ : C −→ H we obtain the second equality below
H(β ′ )(y) = ψβ(g)
= ψC(β ′ )(h)
= H(β ′ )ψ(h) .
The first equality is by construction of g ∈ B(b), and the third is the naturality of
ψ. Therefore the map H(β ′ ) : H(c) −→ H(b) annihilates y − ψ(h). Because H is
cohomological there is an element x ∈ H(Σa) with H(γ ′ )(x) = y − ψ(h). But a ∈ A ⊂ B
and we may choose an θ ∈ B(Σa) with ψβ(θ) = x. We have
y − ψ(h) = H(γ ′ )ψβ(θ)
= ψC(γ ′ )β(θ)
where the first equality is the construction of θ, and the second

H(Σa) lies in the kernel of H(γ ′ ), which is the image of H(Σα′ ) : H(Σb) −→ H(Σa). And
since the map ψβ : B(Σb) −→ H(Σb) is surjective we may lift further to B(Σb); we can
choose an element w ∈ B(Σb) whose image under the equal composites in the bottomleft square are equal to ψβ(x). Therefore we have that, with x ∈ B(Σa) as in (vii) and
w ∈ B(Σb) as above, the element x−B(Σα′ )(w) is annihilated by ψβ : B(Σa) −→ H(Σa).
Now (vi) tells us that
(viii) We may choose an element v ∈ A(Σa) whose image under α : A(Σa) −→ B(Σa) is

The horizontal map in the top row takes the element v ∈ A(Σa) constructed in (viii) to

the commutativity of the top square coupled with (viii), this means that x − B(Σα′ )(w)
is an element of B(Σa) annihilated by the equal composites in the bottom square. In
particular the horizontal map B(γ ′ ) takes x − B(Σα′ )(w) to an element of the kernel of
β : B(c) −→ C(c). But the map B(γ ′ ) annihilates B(Σα′ )(w), and by (vii) it takes x to

7. The main theorems
It’s time to prove Theorem 0.3; we should focus the general lemmas of Section 6 on
the situation at hand. Thus in this section we make the following global assumptions:
Notation 7.1. We specialize the conventions of Notation 6.1 by setting S = T c , that
is S is the subcategory of compact objects in T. Thus in this section the functor Y of
Notation 6.1 specializes to Y : T −→ HomR [T c ]op , R–Mod , which takes an object t ∈ T
to Y(t) = Hom(−, t)|T c .
In the generality of Notation 6.1 we considered S–cohomological functors H and B–
approximating systems E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · . Because we are now in the special
case where S = T c Remark 4.7 applies: if F = Hocolim
✲ Ei then the natural map H −→
Y(F ) must be an isomorphism.
We will furthermore assume that we have chosen in T a single compact generator
G. We will suppose given a t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) in the preferred equivalence class,
with T ≥0 closed under coporducts. For example we could let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be equal to

, see Remark 0.15. Let A be the heart of the t–structure, and H : T −→ A
, TG
TG
the homological functor
of Reminder 1.1. We will assume given an integer A > 0 with

Hom Σ−A G, T ≤0 = 0. The existence of such an A is equivalent to the hypothesis that
Hom(G, Σi G) = 0 for i ≫ 0. And what is important for us is that this guarantees that
the category Tc− is a thick subcategory of T.
Finally and most importantly: as in Notation 6.1 the triangulated category T is assumed to be R–linear for some commutative ring R. But from now on we add the
assumption that the ring R is noetherian and, with G as in the last paragraph, the R–
module Hom(G, Σi G) is finite for every i ∈ Z. Combining this paragraph with the last:
the functor Y(G) is G–locally finite.

Under some additional approximability assumptions, Theorem 0.3 describes the essential image of the functor Y taking F ∈ Tc− to Y(F ) = Hom(−, F )|T c , and tells us that
the functor Y is full. To show that Y(F ) lies in the expected image one doesn’t need any
hypotheses beyond the ones above, we prove
Lemma 7.2. With the assumptions of Notation 7.1, for any F ∈ Tc− the functor Y(F ) :
[T c ]op −→ R–Mod is a locally finite T c –cohomological functor.
Proof. We are given that the functor Y(G) is G–locally finite. In particular: for i ≪ 0
we have Hom(Σi G, G) = 0. With (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) as in Notation 7.1, that is our fixed t–
structure in the preferred equivalence class, Remark 0.20 coupled with Lemma 2.8
 tell
us that, for any object K ∈ T c , there is an integer B > 0 so that Hom Σ−B K, T ≤0 = 0.
Remark 0.18 gives the inclusion in F ∈ Tc− ⊂ T − , hence we may choose an integer A > 0
with ΣA F ∈ T ≤0 . We deduce that Hom(Σi K, F ) = 0 for all i ≤ −A − B.
The fact that the functor Y(G) is G–locally finite also means that, for every integer
i ∈ Z, the R–module Hom(Σi G, G) is finite. The full subcategory L ⊂ T c defined by
L

=

{L ∈ T c | Hom(Σi G, L) is a finite R–module for all i ∈ Z}

is thick and contains G, hence T c = hGi ⊂ L. Now take any L ∈ T c and define the full
subcategory K(L) ⊂ T c by
K(L)

=

{K ∈ T c | Hom(Σi K, L) is a finite R–module for all i ∈ Z}

Then K(L) is thick and contains G, hence T c = hGi ⊂ K(L). We conclude that
Hom(Σi K, L) is a finite R–module for all K, L ∈ T c and all i ∈ Z.
Now fix the integer i, the object K ∈ T c and the object F ∈ Tc− , and we want to prove
that Hom(Σi K, F ) is a finite R–module.
The first paragraph of the proof produced an

integer B > 0 with Hom Σ−B K, T ≤0 = 0, and since F is approximable there exists a
triangle L −→ F −→ D with L ∈ T c and D ∈ T ≤−i−B−1 . In the exact sequence
Hom(Σi K, Σ−1 D)

/ Hom(Σi K, L)

/ Hom(Σi K, F )

/ Hom(Σi K, D)

we have that Hom(Σi K, D) = 0 = Hom(Σi K, Σ−1 D), and Hom(Σi K, F ) ∼
= Hom(Σi K, L)
must be a finite R–module by the second paragraph of the proof.

In Corollary 2.14 we learned that, under some approximability hypotheses, objects in Tc−
can be well approximated by sequences with special properties. We don’t need all these
properties yet; for the next few lemmas we formulate what we will use.
Definition 7.3. Adopting the conventions of Notation 7.1, a strong hGin –approximating
system is a sequence of objects and morphisms E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · ·
(i) Each Em belongs to hGin .
(ii) The map Hi (Em ) −→ Hi (Em+1 ) is an isomorphism whenever i ≥ −m.
In this definition we also allow n = ∞, we simply declare hGi∞ = hGi = T c .
Suppose we are also given an object F ∈ T, together with
(iii) A map of the approximating system E∗ to F .
(iv) The map in (iii) is such that Hi (Em ) −→ Hi (F ) is an isomorphism whenever
i ≥ −m.
Then we declare E∗ to be a strong hGin –approximating system for F .
Remark 7.4. Although Definition 7.3 was phrased in terms of the particular choice of
t–structure (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ), made in Notation 7.1, it is robust—up to passing to subsequences
a strong hGin –approximating system for F will work for any equivalent t–structure.
Lemma 7.5. With the conventions of Definition 7.3 we have
(i) Given an object F ∈ T − and a strong hGin –approximating system E∗ for F , then
the (non-canonical) map Hocolim
✲ Ei −→ F is an isomorphism.
−
(ii) Any object F ∈ Tc has a strong T c –approximating system.
(iii) Any hGin –strong approximating system E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · is a strong
hGin –approximating system of the homotopy colimit F = Hocolim
✲ Ei . Moreover F
−
belongs to Tc .
Proof. We begin by proving (iii). Suppose E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · · is a strong hGin –
approximating system, and let F = Hocolim
✲ Ei . The objects Ei all belong to hGin ⊂
c
−
T ⊂ T . Choose an integer n > 0 with E1 ∈ T ≤n . The fact that Hi (E1 ) −→ Hi (Em )
is an isomorphism for all i ≥ −1 means that Hi (Em ) = 0 for all i > n and all m, and
Lemma 1.2 gives that the Em all lie in T ≤n . Hence the homotopy colimit F also belongs
to T ≤n .
Now Remark 1.5 tells us that the map colim Hi (Em ) −→ Hi (F ) is an isomorphism
−→
for every i ∈ Z. By the previous paragraph the triangle Em −→ F −→ Dm lies in T − ,
and as Hi (Em ) −→ Hi (F ) is an isomorphism for i ≥ −m we deduce that Hi (Dm ) = 0
for all i ≥ −m. Lemma 1.2 guarantees that Dm ∈ T ≤−m−1 , and as Em ∈ hGin ⊂ T c and
m > 0 is arbitrary we have that F satisfies the criterion for belonging to Tc− .
Next we prove (i). By (iii) the map Hocolim
✲ Ei −→ F is a morphism from Hocolim
✲ Ei ∈
− . The hypothesis of (i), coupled with ReTc− to F ∈ T − , hence it is a morphism
in
T

i
mark 1.5, tell us that Hi Hocolim
✲ Ei −→ H (F ) is an isomorphism for every i ∈ Z. By
Lemma 1.3(ii) the map Hocolim
✲ Ei −→ F is an isomorphism.

A BROWN REPRESENTABILITY THEOREM

43

It remains to prove (ii). Note that, if we assume more approximability hypotheses on
T, then (ii) is immediate from Corollary 2.14. But let us see that we don’t yet need any
strong assumptions.
Take any F ∈ Tc− . There exists a triangle E1 −→ F −→ D1 with E1 ∈ T c and
D1 ∈ T ≤−3 . When i ≥ −1 exact sequence Hi−1 (D1 ) −→ Hi (E1 ) −→ Hi (F ) −→ Hi (D)
has Hi−1 (D1 ) = 0 = Hi (D), starting the construction of E∗ .
Suppose now that we have constructed the sequence up to an integer n > 0, that is we
have a map fm : Em −→ F , with Em ∈ T c , and so that Hi (fm ) is an isomorphism for all
i ≥ −m. Lemma 2.8 allows us to choose an integer N > 0 so that Hom Em , T ≤−N =
0. Because F belongs to Tc− we may choose a triangle Em+1 −→ F −→ Dm+1 with
Em+1 ∈ T c and Dm+1 ∈ T ≤−N −m−3 . As in the paragraph above we show that the map
Hi (Em+1 ) −→ Hi (F ) is an isomorphism for all i ≥ −m − 1. And since the composite
fn

Em −→ F −→ Dm+1 vanishes, the map fn must factor as Em −→ Em+1 −→ F .



Remark 7.6. Lemma 7.5(iii) and Remark 4.7 combine to tell us that a strong hGin –
approximating system for F , in the sense of Definition 7.3, is in fact an approximating
system for F as defined in Remark 4.6. Our terminology isn’t misleading.
Remark 7.7. Let us now specialize Lemma 6.5 to the framework of this section. Assume
we are given

Applying the functor Hi with i ≥ −m yields a commutative diagram in the heart of T
where the rows are exact, and where the vertical maps away from the middle are isomorphisms. By the 5-lemma the middle vertical map, i.e. the map Hi (Cm ) −→ Hi (Cm+1 ),

Lemma 7.8. Let the conventions be as in Notation 7.1. Assume H is a locally finite
hGin –cohomological functor. Then there exists an object F ∈ Tc− and an epimorphism
of hGin –cohomological functors ϕ : Y(F )|hGin −→ H. Furthermore the object F may be
chosen to have a strong hGin –approximating system.
We will in fact prove a refinement of the above. Since H is assumed to be a locally
finite hGin –cohomological functor its restriction to hGim , for any integer m < n, is
a locally finite hGim –cohomological functor. Hence for any m < n the first paragraph
delivers an object Fm ∈ Tc− , with a strong hGim –approximating system, and a surjective
natural transformation ϕm : Y(Fm )|hGim −→ H|hGim . We will actually construct these
Fm ’s compatibly. We will produce in Tc− a sequence F1 −→ F2 −→ · · · −→ Fn−1 −→ Fn ,
with compatible maps ϕm : Y(Fm )|hGin −→ H, so that
(i) For each m > 0 the object Fm has a strong hGim –approximating system, and the
map ϕm |hGim : Y(Fm )|hGim −→ H|hGim is an epimorphism.
(ii) The sequence is such that the kernel of the map (ϕm )|hGi1 : Y(Fm )|hGi1 −→ H|hGi1
is annihilated by the map Y(Fm )|hGi1 −→ Y(Fm+1 )|hGi1 .
Proof. The proof is by induction on n. In the case n = 1 we prove the refinement that
allows the induction to proceed
(iii) Suppose H is a locally finite hGi1 –cohomological functor. Then we may construct an
object F ∈ Tc− and an epimorphism Y(F )|hGi1 −→ H. Furthermore the object F can
be chosen to have a strong hGi1 –approximating system E1 −→ E2 −→ E3 −→ · · ·
in which every morphism Ei −→ Ei+1 is a split monomorphism.

The proof of (iii) is easy: we have that H(Σi G) is a finite R–module for every i ∈ Z,
and vanishes is i ≪ 0. For each i with H(Σi G) 6= 0 choose a finite number of generators
{fij , j ∈ Ji } for the R–module H(Σi G). By Yoneda every fij ∈ H(Σi G) corresponds to
a morphism ϕij : Y(Σi G) −→ H. Let F be defined by

F =

integer B > 0 with ΣB G ∈ T ≤0 . For m > 0 we define
M M
Em =

i≤m+B j∈Ji

The sum is finite by hypothesis, making Em an object of hGi1 . The obvious map Em −→
Em+1 is a split monomorphism, and in the decomoposition F ∼
= Em ⊕ Fe we have that
Fe , being the coproduct of Σi G for i = m + B + 1, belongs to T ≤−m−1 . Therefore
the map Hi (Em ) −→ Hi (F ) is an isomorphism when i ≥ −m, making E∗ is a strong
hGi1 –approximating system for F .
Now for the induction step. Suppose n ≥ 1 is an integer and we know the Lemma
for all integers ≤ n. We wish to show it holds for n + 1. Let H be a locally finite
hGin+1 –cohomological functor. Then the restriction of H to hGin is a locally finite
hGin –cohomological functor, and we may apply the induction hypothesis to produce
in Tc− a sequence F1 −→ F2 −→ · · · −→ Fn−1 −→ Fn , with compatible surjections
ϕm : Y(Fm )|hGim −→ H|hGim . In particular the map ϕn : Y(Fn )|hGin −→ H|hGin is an
epimorphism. Complete the natural transformation ϕn to a short exact sequence

of functors on hGin . Since H|hGin and Y(Fn )|hGin are locally finite hGin –cohomological
functors so is H ′ , and induction applies. For any m ≤ n we may choose a surjection ϕ′m :
Y(F ′ )|hGim −→ H ′ |hGim , as in (i) and (ii). We wish to consider the special case m = 1,
where we can assume our F ′ is as in (iii). That is we choose an object F ′ ∈ Tc− , which
admits a strong hGi1 –approximating system and a surjection ϕ′ : Y(F ′ )|hGi1 −→ H ′ |hGi1 .
And we may further assume that our approximating system E1′ −→ E2′ −→ E3′ −→ · · ·
′
for F ′ is such that every morphism Ei′ −→ Ei+1
is a split monomorphism.
′
We have natural transformations Y(F )|hGi1 −→ H ′ |hGi1 −→ Y(Fn )|hGi1 , and as F ′
admits a hGi1 –approximating system Lemma 4.8 tells us that the composite is equal to
Y(αn )|hGi1 for some morphism αn : F ′ −→ Fn in the category T. And now Lemma 6.5
applies; see Remark 7.7 for an elaboration of how it specializes to the current context.

we will also call ϕn ) of the form ϕn : Y(Fn ) −→ H. The triangle

us that the triangle commutes on the nose.
Proposition 7.10. Let the conventions be as in Notation 7.1 and assume H is a locally
finite T c –cohomological functor. Then there exists an object F ∈ T and an isomorphism
ϕ : Y(F ) −→ H.
Now let G = ⊕C∈T c C; for those worried about set theoretic issues this means that G is
the coproduct, over the isomorphism classes of objects in T c , of a representative in the
isomorphism class. Then F may be chosen to lie in hGi4 .

colim Y(Fn ) −→ Y(F ) is an isomorphism. We have constructed a map ϕ : Y(F ) −→ H

and will prove that ϕ is an isomorphism.
Let us consider the restriction of the natural transformation ϕ to the subcategory

and Lemma 7.8(ii) says the sequence is such that each map Y(βn )|hGi1 factors as Y(Fn )|hGi1 −→
H|hGi1 −→ Y(Fn+1 )|hGi1 . Hence the colimit agrees with the colimit of the ind-isomorphic
constant sequence H|hGi1 −→ H|hGi1 −→ H|hGi1 −→, and this proves that the restriction
of ϕ : Y(F ) −→ H to the category hGi1 is an isomorphism. Concretely: for every i ∈ Z

is that we may choose Fn to lie in T ≤A for some A
Because H is locally finite there exists an integer B ′ > 0 with H(Σ−i G) = 0 for

And Corollary 2.14 gives us an integer B > 0 so that, for every integer m > 0, every
object F ∈ Tc− ∩ T ≤0 admits a triangle Em −→ F −→ Dm with Dm ∈ T ≤−m and
e = B + B ′ works.
Em ∈ hGi[1−m−B,B] ⊂ hGi[1−m−B,∞) . I assert that A
Let us begin with the Fn provided by Remark 7.9. Because it belongs to Tc− ⊂ T −

Now we apply Lemma 6.5 with n′ = n = ∞. The object Fn ∈ Tc− , of Lemma 7.8

a strong T c –approximating system. The object E ∈ T c comes with the trivial strong

surjective. Lemma 7.14, with m = n + 3, allows us to construct in Tc− ∩ T ≤0 the diagram

as well as the natural transformation ϕ
en+1 : Y(Fen+1 ) −→ H satisfying lots of properties:
Lemma 7.14(i) tells us that En+1 belongs to T c . Lemma 7.14(ii) gives that Hℓ (αn+1 )
and Hℓ (γn+1 ) are isomorphisms if ℓ ≥ −n − 3 + 2 = −n − 1. Lemma 7.14(iii) says that
ϕ
en+1 is an epimorphism when restricted to hGi(n+4)B , and Lemma 7.14(iv) says that the
square in (ii) above commutes. This finishes the induction.

Also: we may apply Hℓ to the commutative triangle. From (iii) we know that Hℓ (αi )
is an isomorphism for ℓ ≥ −i and also that Hℓ (γi+1 ) is an isomorphism for ℓ ≥ −i − 1.
Since Hℓ (αi ) = Hℓ (γi+1 )Hℓ (εi+1 ) we learn that Hℓ (εi+1 ) is an isomorphism when ℓ ≥ −i.
Therefore E∗ is a strong T c –approximating system as in Definition 7.3, and Lemma 7.5

informs us that F = Hocolim
✲ Ei belongs to Tc —that is we have proved (vii). It remains
only to prove (viii).
Suppose therefore that C is an object T c . There exists an n > 0 with C ∈ hGi(n+3)B ,
and Lemma 2.8 says that we may also choose n so that Hom(C, T −n−1 ) = 0. Because ϕ

Reminder 7.16. Let T be a triangulated category with coproducts. A morphism
f : D −→ E is called phantom if, for every compact object C ∈ T, the induced map
Hom(C, f ) : Hom(C, D) −→ Hom(C, E) vanishes. The phantom maps form an ideal:
e

f

g

if f, f ′ : D −→ E are phantom then so is f + f ′ , and if D ′ −→ D −→ E −→ E ′ are
composable morphisms with f phantom, then gf e : D ′ −→ E ′ is also phantom.

Corollary 7.17. Let the conventions be as in Notation 7.13. Let F ′ ∈ T be an object
such that the functor H = Y(F ′ ) is a locally finite T c –cohomological functor. There exists
f

g

an object F ∈ Tc− and a triangle F −→ F ′ −→ D with g phantom.
Proof. Lemma 7.15 gives us an object F ∈ Tc− and an epimorphism ϕ : Y(F ) −→ H =
Y(F ′ ). Since F belongs to Tc− Lemma 7.5(ii) produces for F a (strong) T c –approximating
system. Lemma 4.8 allows us to realize the natural transformation ϕ as Y(f ) : Y(F ) −→
f

g

Y(F ′ ) for some (non-unique) f : F −→ F ′ . Complete f to a triangle F −→ F ′ −→ D.
For every object C ∈ T we have an exact sequence
Hom(C, F )

Hom(C,f )

/ Hom(C, F ′ )

Hom(C,g)

/ Hom(C, D)

and if C is compact the map Hom(C, f ) = Y(f )(C) is surjective. It follows that Hom(C, g)
is the zero map.

Now that it’s time to state the main theorem we include all the hypotheses explicitly.
Theorem 7.18. Let R be a noetherian, commutative ring. Let T be an R–linear triangulated category with coproducts, and suppose it has a compact generator G such that
Hom(−, G) is a G–locally finite cohomological functor. Assume further that T is approximable.
Let Tc− ⊂ T be the category of Definition 0.16, where the t–structure with respect to
which we define it is in the preferred equivalence class. Then the functor Y : Tc− −→
Hom (T c )op , R–Mod , taking F ∈ Tc− to Y(F ) = Hom(−, F )|T c , satisfies
(i) The objects in the essential image of Y are the locally finite T c –cohomological functors.
(ii) The functor Y is full.

Proof. The fact that, for any object F ∈ Tc− , the functor Y(F ) is a locally finite T c –
cohomological functor was proved in Lemma 7.2. In Lemma 7.5(ii) we saw that any
F ∈ Tc− admits a T c –approximating system, and Lemma 4.8 guarantees that any natural
transformation ϕ : Y(F ) −→ Y(F ′ ) can be expressed as ϕ = Y(f ) for some f : F −→ F ′ ;
that is the functor is full. It remains to show that any locally finite T c –cohomological
functor H : (T c )op −→ R–Mod is in the essential image; we must show it isomorphic to
Y(F ) for some F ∈ Tc− .
Proposition 7.10 produced a candidate F ; we have an F ∈ hGi4 and an isomorphism
H∼
= Y(F ). We wish to show that F belongs to Tc− . We proceed by induction to prove
(iii) Let I be the ideal of phantom maps. For each integer n > 0 there exists a triangle
βn

Fn −→ F −→ Dn with Fn ∈ Tc− and βn ∈ In .
We prove (iii) by induction on n. The case n = 1 is given by Corollary 7.17. Now for the
βn

inductive step: assume that, for some n ≥ 1, we are given a triangle Fn −→ F −→ Dn

56

AMNON NEEMAN

with Fn ∈ Tc− and βn ∈ In . We know that both Y(Fn ) and Y(F ) are locally finite
T c –cohomological functors, and the exact sequence

/ Y(Σ−1 Dn )

/ Y(Fn )

/ Y(F )

says that so is Y(Σ−1 Dn ). Corollary 7.17 permits us to construct a triangle F ′ −→
γ
Dn −→ Dn+1 with F ′ ∈ Tc− and γ ∈ I. Let βn+1 : F −→ Dn+1 be the composite
βn

γ

F −→ Dn −→ Dn+1 . Since βn ∈ In and γ ∈ I we deduce that βn+1 ∈ In+1 . If we
βn+1

complete βn+1 to a triangle Fn+1 −→ F −→ Dn+1 , the octahedral axiom allows us to
find a triangle Fn −→ Fn+1 −→ F ′ . Since Fn and F ′ lie in Tc− so does Fn+1 . This
completes the proof of (iii).
Now consider the triangle F4 −→ F −→ D4 . The morphism F −→ D4 is in I4 , but F
belongs to hGi4 . One easily shows that hGi1 , I is a projective class as in Christensen [7,

Definition 2.2], and [7, Theorem 1.1] tells us that so is hGi4 , I4 . The map F −→ D4 is
a morphism in I4 out of an object in hGi4 and must vanish, making F a direct summand
of F4 ∈ Tc− . Proposition 2.10 tells us that Tc− is thick, and therefore F ∈ Tc− .

Lemma 7.19. Let the assumptions be as in Theorem 7.18. Suppose f : F −→ F ′ is a
morphism in Tc− and assume F ′ belongs to Tcb . Then Y(f ) = 0 implies f = 0.
Proof. Because F ′ belongs to Tcb there must be an integer ℓ with F ′ ∈ T ≥ℓ ; without loss
of generality we may assume ℓ = 0. Now F belongs to Tc− , hence there must exist a
g

h

triangle E −→ F −→ D with E ∈ T c and D ∈ T ≤−1 . Choose such a triangle.
The vanishing of Y(f ) means that Hom(E, f ) : Hom(E, F ) −→ Hom(E, F ′ ) must take
g ∈ Hom(E, F ) to zero; that means f g = 0. But the triangle tells us that f : F −→ F ′
h

must factor as F −→ D −→ F ′ . As D ∈ T ≤−1 and F ′ ∈ T ≥0 we have Hom(D, F ′ ) = 0,
hence f = 0.

Theorem 7.20. Let the assumptions be as in Theorem 7.18. The restriction of the
functor Y to the subcategory Tcb is fully faithful, and the essential image is the class of
finite T c –cohomological functors.
Proof. The functor is full on all of Tc− , and Lemma 7.19 guarantees that on the subcategory Tcb it is faithful. It remains to identify the essential image. Let F be an object in
Tc− , we need to show that Y(F ) is finite if and only if F ∈ Tcb .
Suppose F ∈ Tcb ⊂ T + and C ∈ T c ⊂ T − . We can choose an integer ℓ > 0 so that
Hom(Σi C, F ) = 0 for all i ≥ ℓ, which implies that Hom(−, F )|T c is C–finite. Since this
is true for every C ∈ T c we have that Y(F ) is finite.
Conversely: suppose Y(F ) is finite and choose a compact generator G. Because Y(F ) =
Hom(−, F )|T c is G–finite there is an integer ℓ so that Hom(Σi G, F ) = 0 for all i ≥ ℓ. But
then Hom(T, F ) = 0 for all T ∈ hGi
Tcb .

8. Applications: the construction of adjoints
We prove Corollary 0.4, a restricted version of which was the key tool in Jack Hall’s
original, simple proof of GAGA—see Remark 0.7. Hall’s later proof of a more general
result, see [9], sidesteps the representability theorems presented here.
Theorem 8.1. Let R be a noetherian, commutative ring. Let T be an R–linear triangulated category with coproducts, and assume that it is approximable. Let Tcb ⊂ Tc−
be the subcategories of Definition 0.16, constructed using a t–structure in the preferred
equivalence class. Assume the category T c is contained in Tcb . Assume further that T has
a compact generator G so that HomT (−, G) is a G–locally finite cohomological functor.
Let L : Tcb −→ S be an R–linear triangulated functor, and let (T ≤0 , T ≥0 ) be any t–
structure in the preferred equivalence class. Assume further:

(i) For any pair of objects (t, s), with t ∈ T c and s ∈ S, the R–module Hom L(t), s is
finite.

(ii) For any object s ∈ S there exists an integer A > 0 with Hom L(Tcb ∩ T ≤−A ) , s = 0.
(iii) For any object t ∈ T c and any object s ∈ S there exists an integer A so that

Hom L(Σm t), s = 0 for all m ≤ −A.
Then L has a right adjoint R : S −→ Tcb .

Proof. For any pair of objects t ∈ T c , s ∈ S and any integer m ∈ Z, from (i) we learn
that Hom L(Σm t), s is a finite R–module. Now (ii)
that it vanishes
 and (iii) guarantee
c
whenever m ≫ 0 or m ≪ 0. Thus Hom L(−), s is a finite
 T –cohomological functor.
The assignment taking s ∈ S to the functor Hom L(−), s is a functor from S to the
category of finite T c –chomological functors; by Theorem 7.18 we can lift it through the
equivalence of categories Y. There is a functor R : S −→ Tcb so that, for all objects t ∈ T c
and all objects s ∈ S, we have a natural isomorphism

Theorem 7.20 allows us to express it uniquely as Y(αt′ ) for some morphism αt′ : t′ −→
RL(t′ ) in Tcb . We leave it to the reader to check that αt′ is natural in t′ ; it gives a natural
transformation α : id −→ RL.

When restricted to t ∈ T c ⊂ Tcb the map ψ agrees with ϕ and is an isomorphism. It
suffices to prove that ψ is an isomorphism for all t ∈ Tcb and all s ∈ S.
Fix t ∈ Tcb and s ∈ S. By (ii) we can choose an integer A > 0 with Hom L(Tcb ∩
T ≤−A ) , s = 0. Because R(s) belongs to Tcb ⊂ T + we may choose an integer A′ > 0


so that Hom T ≤−A , R(s) = 0. Now take m ≥ 1 + max(A, A′ ), and choose a triangle
Σ−1 d −→ e −→ t −→ d with e ∈ T c and d ∈ T ≤−m . Because t ∈ Tcb and e ∈ T c ⊂ Tcb we
have that d ∈ Tcb ∩ T ≤−m . Consider the commutative diagram with exact rows
