Abstract. For integers e, ℓ ≥ 2, the level ℓ Fock space has an sl∞ -crystal structure arising from
ce -crystal. The vertices of these crystals are
the action of a Heisenberg algebra, intertwining the sl
charged ℓ-partitions. We give the combinatorial rule for computing the arrows anywhere in the sl∞ crystal. This allows us to pinpoint the location of any charged ℓ-partition. As an application, we
compute the support of the spherical representation of a cyclotomic rational Cherednik algebra, and
in particular, the set of parameters such that it is finite-dimensional. We also give an easy abacus
characterization of all finite-dimensional representations of type B Cherednik algebras.

The level ℓ Fock space, whose standard basis consists of all ℓ-partitions, appears as the
Grothendieck group of categories of representations of cyclotomic rational Cherednik algebras,
Hecke and q-Schur algebras at roots of unity, and finite classical groups in non-defining characteristic. These identifications require a choice of parameters s ∈ Zℓ and e ∈ Z≥2 for the Fock space,
ce -crystal and the sl∞ then denoted Fs . There are two important crystal structures on Fs : the sl
crystal, both of which are represented by a graph whose vertices are the standard basis elements of
ce -crystal is categorified by parabolic branching rules in the respective module categories;

this is related to induction and restriction with respect to parabolics of the same type [1], [33],

of a Heisenberg algebra on the cyclotomic Cherednik category O [34],[27]; this action is related to
parabolic induction with respect to type A parabolics [34]. Previous work by Losev [27] and the

first author [13] gave roundabout or indirect constructions of the sl∞ -crystal, with explicit formulas
only in special cases. This left open the problem of formulating a direct combinatorial rule for the
arrows in the sl∞ -crystal.
ce - and sl∞ -crystals
The motivation for studying the combinatorics of the sl∞ -crystal is that the sl
taken in conjunction provide the answers to some important representation theoretic questions,
in particular about the cyclotomic Cherednik category O. The simple objects L(λ) of O are
parametrized by ℓ-partitions λ [15]. The finite-dimensional simple modules (cuspidals) are exactly
ce - and sl∞ -crystals [34], [27]. More generally,
those L(λ) such that λ is a source vertex for both the sl
the two crystals determine the Harish-Chandra series of O: the cuspidal support of L(λ) can be
ce - and sl∞ -crystals [34], [27], [29].
read off from the location of λ in the sl
In this paper, we study the sl∞ -crystal of higher level Fock spaces (so for ℓ ≥ 2) using combinatorics of ℓ-abaci, which encode charged ℓ-partitions using beads on ℓ runners. Our first main
result gives a simple rule for computing the incoming and outgoing arrows of the sl∞ -crystal at a
vertex A for an arbitrary ℓ-abacus A, from which we derive a formula for the position of A in its
connected component. In order to state our theorem, we adapt the notion of e-period from [19],
defining certain patterns of e beads in the abacus called fore and aft periods (Definition 3.5).
Theorem A.
(a) Let A and A′ be ℓ-abaci. There is an arrow A → A′ in the sl∞ -crystal if and only if for
some k ∈ N, A′ is obtained from A by shifting the k’th fore period Pk of A one unit to the
right, and the shift P˜k of Pk is equal to Q′k , the k’th aft period of A′ .
(b) The position of a vertex A in the sl∞ -crystal is determined by a partition θ that can be read
off directly from A.
Part (a) of the above statement is Theorem 3.14, and provides the analogue for the sl∞ -crystal
ce -crystal rule [10]. It allows us to construct the entire connected component of
to the celebrated sl
the sl∞ -crystal containing an arbitrary ℓ-abacus A, completing the results of [14, Section 5]. Part
(b) is a reformulation of Theorem 4.1. This gives an easy way to compute the depth q(λ) of λ in
the sl∞ -crystal, which is equal to |θ| (where λ is the ℓ-partition read off from A). The number q(λ)
gives one part of the support of the simple module L(λ) [27].
In special cases, our results allow us to deduce closed formulas. Section 5 presents a closed
combinatorial formula for each ℓ-partition in a certain connected component of the sl∞ -crystal
component when the charge s ∈ eZℓ (this is the lattice cZ of [27, Section 1.2] containing the origin).
The connected component in question is the one containing the empty ℓ-partition, and consists of
ce and of its level-rank dual (see
all ℓ-partitions which are simultaneously singular for the action of sl
[13]).

Applications to representation theory of Cherednik algebras. In Section 6 we answer some
classical questions about the representation theory of cyclotomic rational Cherednik algebras. Our
first result on this topic consists of a formula for the set of charges s ∈ Zℓ such that the spherical
representation L(Triv) of Hc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) has a given support. Fix s ∈ Zℓ , normalized so that
s1 = n − e − 1 (without loss of generality). Let q(Triv) and p(Triv)) denote the depth of A(Triv, s)
ce -crystals, respectively. Set m = min{n mod e, sj mod e | sj ≥ 0, 2 ≤ j ≤ ℓ}.
in the sl∞ - and sl
The following result is Theorem 6.1.

Theorem B. Write n = qe + r with q, r ∈ N ∪ {0} and r < e. We have
(
q if sj < 0 for all j ≥ 2
q(Triv) =
0 if sj ≥ 0 for some j ≥ 2
(
r if sj < 0 for all j ≥ 2
p(Triv) =
m if sj ≥ 0 for some j ≥ 2.
Theorem B with ℓ = 2 overlaps with a result of [8, Section 4.2]; Corollary 6.5 implies [16, Corollary
5.4] and answers [16, Question 5.5] in the affirmative, which is also answered by the forthcoming
[17]. Outside type A, finite-dimensional simples L(λ) occur for λ such that dim λ > 1, and it is an
interesting and difficult problem to classify them. Theorem 6.10 replaces Triv = ((1n ), ∅, . . . , ∅) with
λ := (λ, ∅, . . . , ∅), λ an arbitrary partition, and with similar formulas to Corollary 6.5 identifies the
parameters such that dim L(λ) < ∞. Corollary 6.14 classifies all finite-dimensional Hc (Bn )-modules
by a pattern avoidance condition on abaci:
Theorem C. A charged bipartition |λ, si labels a finite-dimensional representation of Hc (Bn ) if
and only if the abacus A of |λ, si avoids the e + 1 patterns of Theorem 6.13, and additionally, any
bead in A with a space directly to its left is either the last bead of a period, or sits above an empty
space or the last bead of a period.
Relation of our work to previous work on the sl∞ -crystal. We now discuss the history of
the problem and previous work by other authors. A first method for computing the sl∞ -crystal
was found by Losev [27]. He gives a formula for the action of the annihilation operators in the case
of an asymptotic parameter ([27, Proposition 1.1]), then introduces wall-crossing functors which
ce -crystals in order to transfer the sl∞ -crystal to other chambers of the
commute with the sl∞ - and sl
parameter space. These functors induce a bijection on the set of ℓ-partitions; concrete computations
with the sl∞ -crystal can then be performed given a precise understanding of the combinatorics of
iterated wall-crossings. Jacon and Lecouvey recently found a combinatorial description of crossing
a single wall [20], however the composition of wall-crossings becomes complicated, and there is no
known closed formula for an arbitrary composition of wall-crossings. The number of walls grows as
the size of the ℓ-partitions increases, but the number of asymptotic chambers stays fixed, so that
the number of walls that must be crossed to compute the sl∞ -crystal for all parameters and larger
ℓ-partitions increases.
We use combinatorics of e-periods in abaci to study the sl∞ -crystal, continuing the project begun
in the first author’s previous work [14, Section 5], in which the action of the operators ãµ of [34],[27]
was expressed in terms of adding “good vertical e-strips”. This yielded a way to compute the
sl∞ -crystal of the ℓ Fock space recursively, starting from the empty ℓ-partition, and starting a
new connected component at every ℓ-partition with no incoming arrow. However, the sl∞ -crystal
structure is not directly given by the operators ãµ , which rather describe the action of the Heisenberg
algebra at the crystal level. In particular, [14] did not give a formula for the action of the creation
and annihilation operators of sl∞ . The questions of describing the edges in the sl∞ -crystal, how to
compute a path leading to the highest weight vertex, how to determine the position or depth of a
multipartition in the sl∞ -crystal, remained open. Likewise, the wall-crossing approach left it as an
open question whether any direct combinatorial rule existed for computing the arrows in the sl∞ crystal or the depth of an ℓ-partition in an arbitrary chamber [27, Section 1.2]. Our construction
resolves these questions.

1. Combinatorics of abaci and crystal structures
1.1. Abaci. Fix ℓ ∈ Z≥2 . An ℓ-abacus is a subset A of Z × {1, . . . , ℓ} such that there exists
m− , m+ ∈ Z verifying:
• For all β ≤ m− and for all j ∈ {1, . . . , ℓ}, (β, j) ∈ A.
• For all β ≥ m+ and for all j ∈ {1, . . . , ℓ}, (β, j) ∈
/ A.
The ℓ-abacus A is represented by ℓ rows of beads (numbered from 1 at the bottom to ℓ at the top);
the position (column, row) of a bead is given by (β, j), and we will therefore write b = (β, j) for the
bead b of A in position (β, j). Accordingly, a pair (β, j) ∈ Z × {1, . . . , ℓ} such that (β, j) ∈
/ A will
be called a space of A. We see that an abacus is infinitely full in the left direction and infinitely
empty in the right direction. For k ∈ N and j ∈ {1, . . . , ℓ}, the k’th bead in row j of A, denoted bjk ,
is the k’th element of the set A ∩ {(β, j) ; β ∈ Z} written in decreasing order (with respect to the
natural order on Z × {j} induced by ≥ on Z).
We define the charge of A as the element s = (s1 , . . . , sℓ ) of Zℓ such that in the abacus obtained
from A by pushing all beads as far to the left as possible, the rightmost bead in row j, say b = (β, j),
verifies β = sj , for all j ∈ {1 . . . , ℓ}.
Let s = (s1 , . . . , sℓ ) ∈ Zℓ . The set of ℓ-abaci with charge s is in bijection with the set of ℓ-partitions
via the map A 7→ λ = ((λ11 , λ12 , . . . ), . . . , (λℓ1 , λℓ2 , . . . )) defined by
(β, j) 7→ λjk = β − sj + k − 1
for all (β, j) ∈ A, where k ∈ Z≥0 is such that (β, j) = bjk . We will sometimes also write β = β(b)
and j = j(b) for a bead b = (β, j). These are the β-numbers associated to A (or to λ and s), see
[21], [22]. In particular, we have bjk = (β(bjk ), j).
We write |λ, si for the data consisting of an element s ∈ Zℓ and an ℓ-partition λ, and call it a
charged ℓ-partition. Further, we write A = A(λ, s) for the corresponding ℓ-abacus, and will often
identify A with |λ, si.
Example 1.1. Let ℓ = 3, λ = ((10, 9, 1), (93, 7, 6, 4, 1), (6, 32)) and s = (−4, 0, −5). Then we have

The elements |λ, si, for s fixed and λ varying, form the C-basis of the so-called level ℓ Fock space,
denoted Fs.

whose data is encoded in the sl
in place of “crystal graph”). This is usually achieved by replacing the ground field C by the field of
rational functions C(v), and by endowing the resulting space Fsv (called the v-deformed Fock space)
ce )-module [23], [11], which depends on the parameters s
with the structure of an integrable Uv′ (sl
and e. By Kashiwara’s theory of crystals for quantum groups [24], [18], the representation Fsv has
ce )-crystal structure, a combinatorial datum controlling the behaviour of the U ′ (sl
ce )-module
a Uv′ (sl

“at v = 0”. Since the role of v is irrelevant for our purpose, we will simply talk of the sl
for Fs . (This is also justified by the fact that the cyclotomic Cherenik category O provides an
ce -categorification of Fs , see Section 2.8.)

briefly recall the rule for the arrows in the sl
Firstly, this requires the notion of good left- and right-shiftable i-beads. Let A be an ℓ-abacus with
charge s. Let b = (β, j) ∈ A, and let i = β mod e. If (β + 1, j) ∈
/ A (respectively (β − 1, j) ∈
/ A),
then b is called a right-shiftable i-bead (respectively a left-shiftable (i−1)-bead ). For a right-shiftable
bead b = (β, j) ∈ A (regardless of the value of β mod e), one can define shifting b in A one unit
to the right as the procedure replacing A by (A \ {b}) ⊔ {b′ }, where b′ = (β + 1, j). One defines
similarly shifting b one unit to the left for a left-shiftable bead b.
Secondly, this requires an order on the beads of a given abacus with charge s. For beads b = (β, j)
and b′ = (β ′, j ′ ) in A, set
b < b′

⇐⇒

β < β′

or

( β = β′

and j > j ′ ).

Form the sequence (b1 , b2 , . . . , br ) of all left- and right-shiftable i beads of A, where b1 < b2 < · · · <
br , and encode each bk by − if it is left-shiftable and by + if it is right-shiftable, and form the
corresponding word w. Delete all subwords of the form −+ in w recursively, ending up with a word
w ′ of the form ++· · ·+− · · ·−−. The word w ′ depends only on w and is independent of the order in
which the deletions are made. The good left-shiftable i-bead (respectively good right-shiftable i-bead )
of A is, if it exists, the bead bk of w corresponding to the leftmost − (respectively the rightmost
+) in w ′ .
Remark 1.2. Note that the order generalises the usual order on beads of level one (i.e. one-runner)
abaci in a non-canonical way. Indeed, this order gives rises to the so-called Uglov realization of the
ce -crystal, in opposition to the Kleshchev realization (inducing an isomorphic but different crystal)
sl
which arises from another order on beads, see for instance [11, Example 6.2.16]. For our purposes,
it is essential to work with Uglov’s realization, see Section 2.8.

(2) A is obtained from A′ by shifting its good left-shiftable i-node one unit to the left.

Definition 1.5. [19, Definition 2.2] Let A be an ℓ-abacus. The first e-period of A is, if it exists,
the sequence of e beads P1 = (bi = (βi , ji ))i=1,...,e of A satisfying βi+1 = βi − 1 for all i = 1, . . . , e − 1
such that
(1) ji+1 ≤ ji for all i = 1, . . . , e − 1,
(2) β1 = max {β | (β, j) ∈ A, 1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ},
(3) ji = min {j | (β, j) ∈ A, β = βi }.

The procedure A 7→ A \ P1 is called peeling P1 off A. Recursively, one defines the k’th e-period
of A as, if it exists, the first e-period of the abacus obtained from A by peeling off P1 . . . , Pk−1. We
call A totally e-periodic if there exists k ≥ 0 and r ∈ Zℓ such that peeling off the first k periods of
A results in A(∅, r). We have the following result [19, Theorem 5.9].

1.3. sl∞ -crystal of the Fock space. There is a second important action on level ℓ Fock spaces,
namely that of a Heisenberg algebra. This was first investigated by Uglov [36], where he considered
the action of a quantum Heisenberg algebra on the v-deformed Fock space. It has been shown in
[27] (using a Heisenberg categorical action appearing in [34]) that this action yields a new crystal
structure on Fs , called the sl∞ -crystal (or sometimes the Heisenberg crystal). Another definition
of the sl∞ -crystal has then been given in [14] in purely combinatorial terms.
The sl∞ -crystal is determined by the action of some operators b̃σ 1, where σ is a partition,
ce -crystal operators f˜i , ẽi . It is encoded in a directed graph
that commute with the Kashiwara sl
whose vertices are all abaci with charge s, and each of whose connected components is isomorphic
to the Kashiwara sl∞ -crystal on partitions (the direct limit of the Kashiwara Uv (sle )-crystals on
partitions), i.e. to the Young graph [32, Definition 5.1.2] (the branching graph of the symmetric
group in characteristic 0). Each connected component of this graph has a unique source vertex,
called a highest weight vertex for sl∞ . For each A ∈ Fs , there exists a unique partition θ such that
A = b̃θ A◦ , where A◦ is the unique highest weight vertex A◦ in the connected component of A. 2.
In [13, Section 6.3], the operators b̃σ have been expressed as the composition of more elementary
′
operators b̃+
k , where k ∈ Z. Drawing an arrow labeled by k between two abaci A and A whenever
A′ = b̃+
k A gives the description of the sl∞ -crystal isomorphic to the Young graph. Reversing
3
. The graph isomorphism between an
the arrows gives the action of operators denoted by b̃−
k
arbitrary connected component of the sl∞ -crystal and the Young graph is then given by the bijection
A = b̃θ A◦ 7→ θ, and an arrow labeled k goes to an arrow that adds a box of content k to a partition.
Remark 1.7. The operators b̃±
k are analogues of the Kashiwara crystal operators for the Heisenberg
algebra. More precisely, they are the image of the Kashiwara operators of Uv (sl∞ ) under a certain
bijection, see [13] and [14].
An explicit formula for computing the sl∞ -crystal of Fs using b̃σ has been first given in [14,
Theorem 5.11] using the combinatorics of vertical strips. Let us recall it.
Theorem 1.8. Let σ = (σ1 , σ2 , . . . ) be a partition. The operator b̃σ acts on any charged multipartition by recursively adding the k’th good vertical e-strip σk times for each k ≥ 1.
Thanks to this formula we can reconstruct the whole sl∞ -crystal of Fs . However, the process
of constructing the sl∞ -crystal using Theorem 1.8 is recursive: it requires one to start from the
highest weight vertex (∅, ∅, . . . , ∅) and then to apply the various operators b̃σ , adding a new crystal
component whenever there is no incoming arrow at an ℓ-partition λ. In Section 3, we will give an
explicit description of the action of b̃±
k on an arbitrary ℓ-partition λ in terms of abaci, consequently
permitting the construction of any connected component of the sl∞ -crystal starting from any λ in
that connected component. This will yield an easy formula (Theorem 4.1) for finding the position
of any vertex in its connected component without going back to the source.
Remark 1.9. The sl∞ -crystal is invariant under componentwise translation of the charge s by any
integer t. For this reason, together with Remark 1.4, we may omit the labeling of columns by
β-numbers when drawing an abacus.
Example 1.10. The following is the beginning of two connected components of the sl∞ -crystal of
the level 2 Fock space with parameters s = (0, 1) and e = 3.

2. The cyclotomic rational Cherednik algebra and its Category O
In this section we explain the representation theoretic meaning of the sl∞ -crystal from the viewpoint of cyclotomic rational Cherednik algebras.
2.1. The rational Cherednik algebra Hc (W ). A finite subgroup W ⊂ GLn (C) is called a complex
reflection group if it is generated by S := {s ∈ W | rk(Id − s) = 1} (such elements s are called
reflections). For example, any finite Coxeter group is a complex reflection group. The C-vector
space h of minimal dimension such that there is a faithful representation ρ : W → GL(h) is called
the reflection representation of W . For each reflection s ∈ S, let αs ∈ h∗ and αs∨ ∈ h be eigenvectors
with eigenvalue different from 1 such that hαs , αs∨i = 2 where h−, −i : h∗ × h −→ C is the natural
pairing. Let c : S → C be a conjugacy-invariant function on the set of reflections of W and write cs
for c(s). We may think of c as a multiparameter attaching a parameter to each conjugacy class of
reflections; with this understood, we will refer to c simply as a parameter. The rational Cherednik
algebra Hc (W ) is the quotient of T(h ⊕ h∗ ) ⋊ C[W ] by the relations

[x, x′ ] = 0, [y, y ′] = 0, [y, x] = hy, xi −

for all x, x ∈ h and all y, y ∈ h [9]. The rational Cherednik algebra is called rational double affine
Hecke algebra (rational DAHA) by some authors, e.g. in [34], [37].

2.2. The cyclotomic rational Cherednik algebra Hc (G(ℓ, 1, n)). The group G(ℓ, 1, n) ⊂
GL(n, C) consists of all n × n permutation matrices whose nonzero entries are ℓ’th roots of 1.
It is the semidirect product Γn ⋊ Sn where Γ is the cyclic group of order ℓ. The Weyl groups
Sn = An−1 = G(1, 1, n) and Bn = G(2, 1, n) appear as special cases. From now on, take ℓ ≥ 2. The
reflection representation h is then isomorphic to Cn . Fix the standard basis {yi }, i = 1, . . . , n, for
h (i.e. yi is the vector with 1 in the i’th place and 0’s elsewhere). Then h∗ ≃ Cn with dual basis
{xi }, i = 1, . . . , n. The set of reflections S in G(ℓ, 1, n) is given by:
S = {γi | 1 6= γ ∈ Γ, i = 1, . . . , n} ∪ {sγij | γ ∈ Γ, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n}.
where γi := diag(1, . . . , γ, . . . , 1) with γ in the i’th place, and sγij := γi−1 sij γi = sij γi γj−1 . There are
ℓ conjugacy classes of reflections in G(ℓ, 1, n): one class containing all sγij , and one class for each
γ ∈ Γ, γ 6= 1, consisting of all γi , i = 1, . . . , n.

For each reflection s ∈ S we fix the eigenvectors αs , αs∨ as follows. For s = sγij we take αs =
γ
αij
:= (0, . . . , −γ, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) ∈ h∗ with −γ in the i’th place and 1 in the j’th place. Then
γ ∨
(αij
) := (0, . . . , −γ −1 , . . . , 1, . . . , 0) ∈ h. The reflection s = γi has xi ∈ h∗ and yi ∈ h as eigenvectors
with eigenvalue different from 1, but in order that hαs , αs∨ i = 2, we take αs = xi and αs∨ = 2yi .
Fix a parameter c : S → C. Let κ be the parameter for the conjugacy class of sγij , and let cγ be
the parameter for the conjugacy class of γi , γ 6= 1 ∈ Γ. The cyclotomic rational Cherednik algebra
is generated by the group algebra C[G(ℓ, 1, n)] and the two polynomial algebras C[x1 , . . . , xn ] and
C[y1 , . . . , yn ] with relations sij yk = ysij (k) sij , sij xk = xsij (k) sij , γj yi = δij γyi γj , γj xi = δij γ −1 xi γj ,

2.3. Parameters for the cyclotomic Cherednik algebra versus parameters for the Fock
space. Shan and Vasserot introduce a reparametrization for Hc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) in order to translate

Here, c′γ = 2cγ for γ 6= 1 and c′1 = −1. If e ∈ Z≥2 , s = (s1 , . . . , sℓ ) ∈ Zℓ are the parameters
for the level ℓ Fock space, then following [34, Theorem 6.10] the corresponding Cherednik algebra
parameters are given by:
h = −1/e,

hp = (sp+1 − sp )/e,

Then κ = 1/e > 0, and using this convention we are opposite to Losev in [27] who takes κ = −1/e;
therefore by [27, Section 4.1.4], whenever Losev has |(λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λℓ ), (s1 , s2 , . . . , sℓ )i, we have
|((λ1 )t , (λ2 )t , . . . , (λℓ )t ), (−s1 , −s2 , . . . , −sℓ )i.
2.4. Category Oc (W ). The category Oc (W ) is the category of finitely generated Hc (W )-modules
on which h acts locally nilpotently [15]. It is a highest weight category with finitely many simple
objects, which are labeled by the irreducible representations of W over C [15]. In the case of
W = G(ℓ, 1, n), this means that the simple objects are labeled by ℓ-partitions λ of n. We write
L(λ) for the simple module in Oc (W ) labeled by λ. For a generic parameter c, Oc (W ) ≃ C[W ] and
L(λ) ∼
= C[x1 , . . . , xn ] ⊗ λ as C-vector spaces for all λ ∈ IrrW . We are interested in those parameters
for which Oc (W ) is not a semisimple category and for which the simple modules can be smaller.
2.5. Integral parameters. In this paper we always assume that κ = 1/e for some integer e ≥ 2
and that the Fock space Fs has integral charge s ∈ Zℓ ; we call this the case of integral parameters.
To consider all parameters c such that Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) is not a semisimple category, it is necessary
to allow κ = r/e with r ∈ Z, gcd(r, e) = 1, and also to allow rational charges s ∈ Qℓ for Fs .
However, the general case of rational parameters can be reduced to the case of integral parameters.
Dipper and Mathas proved such a reduction in the case of Hecke algebras of G(ℓ, 1, n) because of the
existence of a certain Morita equivalence, see [5, Theorem 1.1] or [11, Section 5.4] for details. The
Cherednik category Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) is a highest weight cover of the category of finite-dimensional
modules for the Hecke algebra of G(ℓ, 1, n) at certain parameters determined by c [30] (highest
weight covers were defined in [30], and further developed in [31],[28]). Highest weight covers are
unique up to equivalence [30],[31],[28]; using this property, Rouquier showed that Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) is

COMBINATORICS OF THE sl∞ -CRYSTAL

equivalent to a tensor product of category O’s of G(ℓ, 1, n) with integral parameters [30, Theorem
6.13, Remark 6.16], with a restriction on κ which was later removed by Losev [26, Proposition 3.2].
Without loss of generality we may therefore consider the integral parameter case.
2.6. Parabolic induction and restriction, and Harish-Chandra series. For any parabolic
subgroup W ′ ⊂ W (i.e. the stabilizer of a point in h), there are exact, biadjoint induction and reW
′
′
striction functors IndW
W ′ : Oc (W ) → Oc (W ) and ResW ′ : Oc (W ) → Oc (W ) [3]. Finite-dimensional
′
modules are characterized by the property that their restriction to Oc (W ) for any parabolic W ′ ⊂ W
is 0 [3]. For this reason, finite-dimensional simple modules are sometimes referred to as cuspidal
modules (as in [16, Section 5.7], for example). Any simple module L ∈ Oc (W ) appears as a direct
′
′
′
summand of the head of IndW
W ′ L for some finite-dimensional simple module L ∈ Oc (W ) and some
′
′
′
′
parabolic subgroup W ⊂ W [3]. Let us call (W , L ) a cuspidal pair if L is a finite-dimensional sim′
ple Oc (W ′ )-module. The cuspidal pair (W ′ , L′ ) such that HomOc (W ) (IndW
W ′ L , L) 6= 0 is unique up to
W -conjugacy [29]. We will then use the standard terminology from Lie theory and refer to (W ′ , L′ )
as the cuspidal support of L, and say that L belongs to the Harish-Chandra series of (W ′, L′ ). This
is completely analogous to Harish-Chandra series in Lie theory. In the case of finite unitary groups
in positive, non-defining characteristic, the parametrization of Harish-Chandra series by cuspidal
pairs is known to coincide with the parametrization of the Harish-Chandra series of a sum of type
B Cherednik algebras, see [7].
2.7. Parabolic subgroups and supports of simple modules in Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)). The support
of L(λ) is the set-theoretic support of L(λ) as a C[h]-module. It has a concrete description for
G(ℓ, 1, n) which we explain now. Let W = G(ℓ, 1, n) for ℓ ≥ 2 and W ′ ⊂ W be a parabolic subgroup.
Parabolics W ′ of W are of the form G(ℓ, 1, n1 )×Sn2 ×Sn3 ×· · ·×Snu with n1 +n2 +n3 +· · ·+nu ≤ n,
up to W -conjugacy. We are interested in those parabolics W ′ such that Oc (W ′ ) contains a finitedimensional representation. Suppose κ = 1/e is the parameter for the transpositions of Sn ⊂ W .
Then Oc (W ′ ) can contain a finite-dimensional representation only when W ′ is of the form:
W ′ = G(ℓ, 1, n − eq − p) × Se×q
n
up to conjugacy, with 0 ≤ q ≤ e and 0 ≤ p ≤ n − eq; such a parabolic W ′ is the stabilizer of the
point
a = (0, ..., 0, x1 , x2 , . . . , xp , y1 , y1 , . . . , y1 , y2 , y2 , . . . , y2 , . . . , yq , yq , . . . , yq ) ∈ h
where the entry 0 occurs n − eq − p times, and each entry yi occurs e times [27]. If (L′ , W ′) is the
′
cuspidal support of L(λ) for some finite-dimensional simple L′ ∈ Oc (W ′ ), W hW coincides with the
support of L(λ). We then write p(λ) for p above and q(λ) for q above, as in [27].
ce -crystal. One part of the support of L(λ), determined by the integer
2.8. i-induction and the sl
ce -crystal [33],[27]. Using Chuang and Rouquier’s technique
p(λ), is given by the depth of λ in the sl
W
of sl2 -categorification [4], Shan showed that the induction and restriction functors IndW
W ′ and ResW ′ ,
for W = G(ℓ, 1, n) and W ′ = G(ℓ, 1, n−1), split into a direct sum of functors Fi and Ei respectively,

The functors Fi and Ei are called i-induction and i-restriction, respectively. Taking the head of
Fi (L(λ)) and the socle of Ei (L(λ)) gives rise to an abstract crystal structure on the Grothendieck
L
ce -crystal of the Fock space Fs (explained in Section
group of n≥0 Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)), isomorphic to the sl
1.2), where s is determined from c by the formulas of Section 2.3. Note that this isomorphism has
been made explicit by Losev [25, Theorem 5.1]: provided one works with Uglov’s realization of

10

THOMAS GERBER AND EMILY NORTON

the Fock space crystal, it is simply given by the correspondence [L(λ)] ↔ λ, i.e. if F̃i denotes
head(Fi (−)) and Ẽi denotes socle(Ei (−)), we have
F̃i (L(λ)) = L(f˜i (λ)) and Ẽi (L(λ)) = L(ẽi (λ)),
where f˜i and ẽi are the Kashiwara crystal operators on Fs of Section 1.2.
2.9. The functor Aσ and the sl∞ -crystal. We summarize the construction of the sl∞ -crystal on
Fs by Losev in [27, Section 5.1], who adapts the results of Shan and Vasserot in [34, Section 5.6]
to the language of crystals. Shan and Vasserot define an exact functor from Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n − em)) to
Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)), by:
G(ℓ,1,n)
Aσ (M) = IndG(ℓ,1,n−em)×Sem M ⊠ L(eσ)
for σ a partition of m and em ≤ n (see [34, Definition 5.12], note that they denote Aσ by a∗σ ). Shan
and Vasserot showed that the functor Aσ gives rise to an exact functor on ⊕n Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) and
that Aσ commutes with the i-induction and i-restriction functors Fi and Ei [34, Proposition 5.15].
There is a bijection
{partitions} × {ℓ-partitions λ | p(λ) = 0, q(λ) = 0} −→ {ℓ-partitions µ | p(µ) = 0}
given by sending (σ, λ) to µ =: b̃σ (λ) where L(µ) is the unique irreducible constituent (up to
multiplicity) in the head of Aσ (λ) [34, Section 5.6],[27, Section 5.1]. Since the set of partitions has
an sl∞ -crystal structure, this bijection induces an sl∞ -crystal structure on the set of ℓ-partitions
ce -crystal. Losev then extends the crystal to all of Fs by using the
which have depth 0 in the sl
commutative diagram of [27, Proposition 5.1].This gives a bijection as above:
{partitions} × {ℓ-partitions λ | p(λ) = p, q(λ) = 0} −→ {ℓ-partitions µ | p(µ) = p}

sending (σ, λ) to µ = b̃σ (λ). These bijections taken over all p ≥ 0 then induce an sl∞ -crystal
ce -crystal. The depth |µ| of µ in the sl∞ -crystal is equal
structure on Fs , that commutes with the sl
to q(µ), determining the other part of the support of the simple module L(µ) ∈ Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) [27].

2.10. Finite-dimensional representations of Hc (G(ℓ, 1, n)). When W = Sn , it is well-known
that Oc (Sn ) contains a finite-dimensional module if and only if c = ±r/n with r ∈ N coprime to n,
and then there is exactly one finite-dimensional simple module, L(Triv) if c > 0 and L(Sign) if c < 0
[2]. The category O for a direct product of groups is the tensor product of the categories, and thus
it follows that any L(λ) ∈ Oc (Sn ) when c = r/e > 0 with r coprime to e and 2 ≤ e ≤ n appears
 
as a direct summand of the head of IndSWn′ L(Triv×m ) where W ′ = Se×m for some 0 ≤ m ≤ ne [3].
Wilcox solved the problem of finding the support of any simple L(λ) ∈ Oc (Sn ) [38].
In general, a module L ∈ Oc (W ) is finite-dimensional if and only if its support is 0. By the results
of Shan, Shan and Vasserot, and Losev explained in the preceding paragraphs, this means that the
simple module L(λ) ∈ Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) is finite-dimensional if and only if λ has depth 0 in both the
ce - and sl∞ -crystals. The crystal structures depend on the Fock space charge (e, s), equivalently,
sl
on the parameter c, so the classification of finite-dimensional representations also depends on c. We
can find the cuspidal support (W ′ , L′ ) of L(λ) ∈ Oc (W ) by finding W ′ using the formula in Section
◦
2.7, and finding L′ = L(λ̃ × Triv) ∈ Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n − eq − p) × (Se×q )) by first finding the source
ce -crystal component containing λ, and then finding the source vertex λ̃◦ of the
vertex λ̃ of the sl
sl∞ -crystal component containing λ̃.

3. The rule for the arrows in the sl∞ -crystal
3.1. Quasiperiods, fore periods, and aft periods.
Definition 3.1. Let A be an ℓ-abacus. An e-quasiperiod in A is an ordered set of e beads {b1 , . . . , be }
of A such that that, if bi = (βi , ji ) for i = 1 . . . e, the following two conditions holds:
• βi+1 = βi − 1 for all i = 1, . . . , e − 1.
• ji ≥ ji+1 for all i = 1, . . . , e − 1.
Definition 3.2. The abacus A is totally e-quasiperiodic if the set of beads of A can be partitioned
into e-quasiperiods.
In particular, e-periods (see Definition 1.5) are e-quasiperiods. When e is clear from the context,
we will simply write periods for e-periods and quasiperiods for e-quasiperiods. Likewise, we might
simply talk about totally periodic/quasiperiodic abaci.
Recall the total order on beads defined in Section 1.2. The lexicographic extension of that order
to quasiperiods is a total order on the set of quasiperiods of A. If A is a totally quasiperiodic abacus
with a chosen set of quasiperiods P̃1 , P̃2 , . . . partitioning its beads, the quasiperiods P̃1 , P̃2 , . . . may
therefore be enumerated in such a way that P̃k > P̃k′ for all k < k ′ .
(m)

Notation 3.3. Given a totally ordered set of quasiperiods P̃k of A, k ∈ N, write {bk } for the
(m)
(m+1)
beads of P̃k , m ∈ {1, . . . , e}, ordered so that bk > bk
for each m ≤ e − 1.
Lemma 3.4. An abacus A is totally quasiperiodic if and only if it is totally periodic.
Proof. It is clear that if A is totally periodic then A is totally quasiperiodic.
Conversely, assume that A is totally quasiperiodic. We will describe an algorithm that constructs
the first period P1 of A step by step in such a way that the abacus at each step remains totally
quasiperiodic. The following picture illustrates the process:

−→

−→

−→

Now we explain the algorithm. Let P̃1 , P̃2 , . . . be a chosen set of quasiperiods partitioning the
(1)
beads of A with P̃k > P̃k′ for all k < k ′ . Then b1 is the maximal bead in A. If P̃1 is a period,
we are done. Otherwise, if P̃1 is not a period, then there is a bead (β, j) ∈ A where (β, j ′ ) ∈ P̃1
and j < j ′ . Pick the largest bead (β, j) such that this happens. Since A is totally quasiperiodic,
(m)
(n)
(β, j) belongs to a quasiperiod P̃k for some k 6= 1. Write (β, j ′ ) = b1 and (β, j) = bk as above

12

THOMAS GERBER AND EMILY NORTON

(i.e. (β, j ′) is the m’th bead of P̃1 and (β, j) is the n’th bead of P̃k ). Observe that m ≥ n since
(1)
(1)
(1)
β(bk ) ≤ β(b1 ) due to b1 being the maximal bead of A. Let s ∈ Z, 0 < s ≤ e − m be minimal

is in a lower row than bk
, if such an s exists; otherwise, set s = e − m + 1. Now

, . . . , b1
, bk
, bk
, . . . , bk }
Thus we exchange an interval of s beads which are “out of order” between the two quasiperiods P̃1
and P̃k .
We must check that P̃1′ and P̃k′ are quasiperiods. It is clear from the construction that the
β-numbers of the successive elements of P̃1′ are successive elements of N, and likewise for P̃k′ .
(m−1)

Thus it suffices to check that j(b1

) ≥ j(b1
),
(m+s−1)
(n+s)
(m−1)
(m)
(n)
and j(b1
) ≥ j(bk
). We have j(b1
) ≥ j(b1 ) > j(bk ) where the first inequality
is because P̃1 is a quasiperiod and the second inequality is by the definitions of m, n; likewise
(n−1)
(m−1)
(m)
(n−1)
(m−1)
j(bk
) > j(b1
) ≥ j(b1 ), where the first inequality is because β(bk
) = β(b1
) = β+1
and by our assumption on the maximality of (β, j), for all b ∈ P̃1 with β(b) > β there is no bead
b′ ∈ A with β(b′ ) = β(b) and j(b′ ) < j(b). The remaining two inequalities are checked similarly.
It follows that P̃1′ , P̃2 , . . . , P̃k−1 , P̃k′ , P̃k+1, . . . is a partitioning of the beads of A into quasiperiods,
(1)
of which P̃1′ is the maximal quasiperiod since it contains the maximal bead b1 of A. Moreover, if
b is among the first m beads of P̃1′ , b satisfies the condition that if b′ ∈ A, b′ 6= b and β(b′ ) = β(b),
then j(b′ ) > j(b). Now iterate the procedure on P̃1′ with respect to this new partitioning, and so
on. With each iteration, the number M such that the first M beads of the maximal quasiperiod
belong to the minimal row among beads in that column, increases by at least 1. Thus the process
terminates after at most e − 1 iterations with the construction of a partitioning of the beads of A
into quasiperiods such that the maximal quasiperiod is a period, P1 . Moreover, by construction
A \ P1 is totally quasiperiodic.
Iterating on A \ P1 to construct P2 , and so on, it follows that A is totally periodic.

We now define some new combinatorial notions which will be used in Theorem 3.14:
Definition 3.5. Let A be an ℓ-abacus.
(1) The first fore period P1 is the largest quasiperiod of A. Inductively, the k’th fore period Pk
is the largest quasiperiod of A satisfying Pk < Pk−1 and Pk ∩ Pi = ∅ for all i < k.
(2) A bead of A which does not belong to any fore period of A is called a free bead.
(i)
(3) For each k ∈ N, let Pk be the k’th fore period of A and bk be the i’th bead of Pk .
The k’th vessel Vk of A is the union of Pk and the set of free beads b = (β, j) of A,
(e)
(1)
β(bk+1) ≤ β ≤ β(bk ), satisfying:
(i)
(i)
(a) if β = β(bk ) for some i ∈ {1, . . . , e} then j > j(bk )
(i)
(i)
(b) if β = β(bk+1 ) for some i ∈ {1, . . . , e} then j < j(bk+1 )
(e)
(c) if β < β(bk ) then there exists j ′ such that (β + 1, j ′ ) ∈ Vk .
Informally, we think of these conditions as saying that b is “between” Pk and Pk+1 and Vk
is “connected.”
(4) The k’th aft period Qk is the minimal quasiperiod in the k’th vessel of A.
(5) A bead of A that does not belong to a vessel is called adrift.

Remark 3.6. Note that fore and aft periods are not, in general, periods in the sense of [19]. When
an abacus is totally e-periodic, there are no free beads, and thus the fore periods and the aft periods
coincide. In this case they also coincide with Definition 1.5, and we will simply refer to them as the
periods of A.
Example 3.7. Let e = 3 and ℓ = 4. The fore periods of A are drawn in red, the aft periods of A
are drawn in blue when they differ from the fore periods. The first vessel consists of the rightmost
three beads linked in red which form P1 , the rightmost three beads linked in blue which form Q1 ,
and two more beads – the free bead one unit below and left of P1 , and the free bead above the
middle of Q1 . There are two beads that are adrift, below and right of P1 .

Lemma 3.8. Let Vk and Vk′ be vessels in an abacus A, k 6= k ′ . Then Vk ∩ Vk′ = ∅.
Proof. Suppose by way of contradiction that b = (β, j) ∈ Vk ∩ Vk′ is a bead in the intersection of
two different vessels. Since Pk ∩ Pk′ = ∅, and Vk \ Pk consists of free beads, likewise Vk′ \ Pk′ , b must
be a free bead. Without loss of generality, k < k ′ , so Pk′ < Pk . We then have

so β = β(bk′ ) for some i′ ∈ {1, . . . , e} and also β = β(bk+1) for some i′′ ∈ {1, . . . , e}. On the

3.5(3)(a) implies that j > j(bk′ ). But j(bk+1 ) ≤ j(bk′ ) (with equality if and only if k + 1 = k ′ ).

So j < j(bk+1 ) ≤ j(bk′ ) < j, a contradiction.

Definition 3.9. Let P be a quasiperiod in A. Let j1 , j2 , . . . js be the distinct j’s such that (β, j) ∈ P
for some β ∈ Z. For each i = 1, . . . , s, let βi = max{β | (β, ji ) ∈ P }. If (βi + 1, ji ) ∈
/ A for all
i = 1, . . . , s then we may define the right shift of P as
P̃ = {(β + 1, j) | (β, j) ∈ P }
and we say that P is right-shiftable. Let P be a right-shiftable quasiperiod. We say that we shift
P one unit to the right if we replace A with (A \ P ) ∪ P̃ . The left versions of these definitions are
similar.
Example 3.10. Let |λ, si = |((1), (12)), (0, 1)i and e = 3. Let P = P1 . Then P is both right- and
left-shiftable. Here is P being shifted to the right:

Lemma 3.11. For an abacus A and k ∈ N, let Pk be the k’th fore period of A, and assume Pk is
right-shiftable. Let P̃k be the right shift of Pk and let Vk be the k’th vessel of A.
(1) (Vk \ Pk ) ∪ P˜k contains a unique quasiperiod, which is equal to P̃k .
(2) Let A′ = (A \ Pk ) ∪ P̃k be the abacus obtained by shifting Pk one unit to the right. For
a ∈ N, denote Pa′ (respectively Q′a ) the a’th fore (respectively aft) periods of A′ . Then
P˜k = Q′k if and only if P̃k ∩ Pa′ = ∅ for all 1 ≤ a ≤ k − 1.

THOMAS GERBER AND EMILY NORTON

(1) Let Q ⊂ ((Vk \ Pk ) ∪ P̃k ) be a quasiperiod. Definition 3.5 implies that Q is not
contained in Vk \ Pk . Let b = (β, j) ∈ Q ∩ P̃k . Say b is the i’th bead of Q and the m’th
bead of P̃k . Consider what the i + 1’st bead of Q can then be (if i < e): by the definition
of quasiperiod, we know it is (β − 1, j ′ ) for some j ′ ≤ j, and that (β, j) ∈ P̃k . By Definition
3.5(3), note that if (α, h) ∈ Pk , then (α, h′′ ) ∈
/ Vk for h′′ < h. This implies: (a) if (α, h) and
(α − 1, h′ ) are successive beads of Pk , and so (α + 1, h) and (α, h′) are successive beads of
P̃k , then (α, h′′ ) ∈ (Vk \ Pk ) ∪ P̃k with h′′ ≤ h if and only if h′′ = h′ ; and (b) if (α, h) is the
e’th bead of Pk then (α, h′) ∈
/ (Vk \ Pk ) ∪ P̃k for all h′ ≤ h. Therefore (β − 1, j ′ ), the i + 1’st
bead of Q, must be the m + 1’st bead of P̃k . Iterating this argument, it follows that once
Q meets P̃k in a bead b, then all beads of Q which are smaller than b coincide with beads
of P̃k . Since both Q and P̃k consist of e beads with consecutive β-numbers, the first bead
of Q must then have at least as big a β-number as the first bead of P̃k . But by Definition
3.5(3)(a), the maximum β-number of a bead in Vk is the β-number of the first bead of Pk .
The only bead of Q ⊂ ((Vk \ Pk ) ∪ P̃k ) with β-number equal to that of the first bead of
P̃k is the first bead of P̃k itself. So Q and P̃k have the same first bead, and therefore they
completely coincide.
(2) Suppose P̃k ∩ Pa′ = ∅ for all 1 ≤ a ≤ k − 1. Since A′ is obtained from A by shifting its k’th
fore period Pk to the right and this does not affect the fore periods smaller than Pk , we have
Pa = Pa′ and P̃k ∩ Pa′ = ∅ for all a ≥ k + 1. Any quasiperiod in an abacus must intersect
some fore period, so it must hold that P̃k ∩ Pk′ 6= ∅. Moreover, the preceding remarks also
imply that P̃k ⊂ Vk′ . The first bead b′ of Q′k cannot be to the right of the first bead b of
P̃k by minimality of Q′k in Vk′ . If some bead of Q′k lies in the same column and below a
bead of P̃k then, since Pa = Pa′ and Pa′ ∩ Q′k = ∅ for all 1 ≤ a ≤ k − 1, we’d be able to
construct a larger quasiperiod than Pk in A which doesn’t intersect Pa for all 1 ≤ a ≤ k − 1,
contradicting that Pk is the k’th fore period of A. If b′ is in the same column as b and above
(1) (2)
(e−1)
it, then (b′ , bk , bk , . . . , bk ) would be the k’th fore period of A instead of Pk . It follows
that Q′k belongs to (Vk \ Pk ) ∪ P˜k , but by Part (1), the only quasiperiod of (Vk \ Pk ) ∪ P˜k is
P̃k . Therefore P˜k = Q′k .
Conversely, suppose that P̃k = Q′k . Then P̃k is a subset of Vk′ . The vessels are disjoint by
Lemma 3.8, and Pa′ is a subset of Va′ for all a, so P̃k ∩ Pa′ = ∅ for all a 6= k.


Proof.

Remark 3.12. Note that taking k = 1 in Lemma 3.11 (2), it follows that P̃1 = Q′1 always.
3.2. Arrows in the sl∞ -crystal. Our main theorem allows us to construct the entire connected
sl∞ -crystal component of any ℓ-abacus A starting from nothing but knowledge of A itself (and the
specification of e, of course), using a rule for computing all incoming and outgoing arrows that is
explicit and easy to use. We indicate direction of motion in the sl∞ -crystal moving away from a
source by traveling downstream, and moving towards a source by traveling upstream.
Recall from Section 1.3 that there is a graph isomorphism from a connected component of the
sl∞ -crystal on Fs with source A◦ to the Young graph, sending A = b̃θ A◦ to θ and sending an arrow
m
b̃θ A◦ −
→ b̃ρ A◦ , m ∈ Z, to the arrow that adds a box of content m to θ to obtain ρ.
Definition 3.13. For k ∈ N and a connected component of the Fock space Fs , let Υ+
k be the

the operator on partitions which acts on a partition θ by removing a box from row k of θ if θ has
at least k nonzero parts, and acts by 0 otherwise.

Thus Υ+
k acts on A = b̃θ A by b̃θk +1−k and Υk acts on A by b̃θk −k , and the data of Υk , k ∈ N is
equivalent to the data of b̃±
m , m ∈ Z.
The following theorem is a direct analogue of Theorem 1.3. It gives the action of the maps Υ±
k
for k ≥ 1. Using these, starting from any A, one can construct the entire connected component of
the sl∞ -crystal containing A. In particular, one can recover its source vertex.

Theorem 3.14. Let A and A′ be ℓ-abaci. There is an arrow A → A′ in the sl∞ -crystal if and only
if the following equivalent situations hold for some k ∈ N:
(1) (traveling downstream) A′ is obtained from A by shifting the k’th fore period Pk of A one
unit to the right, and the shift P˜k of Pk is equal to Q′k , the k’th aft period of A′ .
(2) (traveling upstream) A is obtained from A′ by shifting the k’th aft period Q′k of A′ one unit
to the left, and the shift Q̃′k of Q′k is equal to Pk , the k’th fore period of A.
− ′
In this case, we have A′ = Υ+
k A, or equivalently A = Υk A .
Proof. It is easily seen that (1) holds if and only if (2) holds, so we will prove that there is an arrow
A → A′ in the sl∞ -crystal if and only if (1) holds.
First we argue that arrows in the sl∞ -crystal are given by shifting fore periods to the right. From
Sections 1.3 and 2.9, we know that A = b̃θ A◦ for a unique partition θ = (θ1 , θ2 , . . . ) and a unique
highest weight vertex A◦ of the sl∞ -crystal, that A′ is in the connected component of A if and only
if A′ = b̃σ A◦ for a unique partition σ, and that the connected component of A◦ is isomorphic to
′
◦
the Young graph. This implies that A′ = Υ+
k A if and only if A = b̃θ∪γ A where γ is an addable
box in row k of θ. Now we recall how b̃θ was defined in [14]: this operator recursively adds the k’th
good vertical e-strip θk times to a charged multipartition, for each k ≥ 1 (Theorem 1.8). Adding
the k’th good addable strip corresponds to shifting the k’th fore period one unit to the right in the
abacus, since adding a box to the diagram corresponds to shifting a bead to the right in the abacus,
and the fore periods correspond to the good addable strips (Definition 3.5). Therefore, the vertex
A has an outgoing arrow given by shifting the k’th fore period one unit to the right for each k such
that θ has an addable box in row k.
Now we are ready to prove that if there is an arrow A → A′ in the sl∞ -crystal then (1) holds.
By the previous paragraph, A → A′ implies that A′ is obtained from A by shifting the k’th fore
◦
period Pk of A to the right for some k ∈ N. Write A = b̃θ A◦ and A′ = Υ+
k A = b̃θ∪γ A where γ
′
is an addable box in row k of θ. If k = 1 then by Lemma 3.11(2), P̃1 = Q1 . So suppose k > 1.
By Lemma 3.11 (2), it suffices to show that P̃k ∩ Pa′ = ∅ for all 1 ≤ a ≤ k − 1. By contradiction,
suppose that there exists a bead b = (β, j) in P̃k ∩ Pc′ for some 1 ≤ c ≤ k − 1. We may choose the
bead b so that (β − 1, j) ∈
/ P̃k ∩ Pa′ for any 1 ≤ a ≤ k − 1. Since P̃k is the right shift of Pk , either
(β − 1, j) ∈ P̃k or (β − 1, j) ∈
/ A′ . So (β − 1, j) ∈
/ Pa′ for all 1 ≤ a ≤ k − 1. Let σ = θ + (1k ) =
θ ∪ γ + (1k−1) = (θ1 + 1, θ2 + 1, . . . , θk + 1, θk+1 , θk+2 , . . . ). Now consider the position (β, j) in the
abacus b̃σ A◦ . On the one hand, computing first b̃θ∪γ A◦ = A′ and then applying b̃(1k−1 ) , we observe
that b ∈ Pc′ is shifted one unit to the right in b̃(1k−1 ) A′ , but since (β − 1, j) ∈
/ Pa′ for all 1 ≤ a ≤ k − 1,
′
′
then (β, j) ∈
/ (A′ \ (P1′ ∪ · · · ∪ Pk−1
)) ∪ P̃1′ ∪ · · · ∪ P̃k−1
= b̃(1k−1 ) A′ = b̃σ A◦ . On the other hand,
◦
◦
computing b̃θ+(1k−1 ) A◦ first and then applying Υ+
k , we observe that in b̃θ+(1k−1 ) A = b̃(1k−1 ) (b̃θ A ),
the k’th period has not shifted the θk + 1’st time yet and coincides with the k’th period Pk of b̃θ A◦ ;
+
◦
◦
upon applying Υ+
k , we have (β, j) ∈ P̃k ⊂ Υk b̃θ+(1k−1 ) A = b̃σ A . This is a contradiction, and
therefore P̃k ∩ Pa′ = ∅ for all 1 ≤ a ≤ k − 1.

Conversely, suppose that (1) holds, i.e. suppose that Pk ⊂ A can be shifted to the right yielding
A , and that the right shift P̃k of Pk is Q′k , the k’th aft period of A′ . Let A′′ = b̃(1k ) A. By Lemma
3.11(2), P̃k ∩ Pa′ = ∅ for all 1 ≤ a < k. Thus b̃(1k−1 ) A′ = A′′ . Let b̃−

Remark 3.15. In particular, one recovers [14, Theorem 5.11] by expressing the operators b̃σ as
+
compositions of operators b̃+
k (or equivalently, operators Υk ).
Example 3.16. In Example 3.7, the only fore periods which can travel downstream are P1 , P2 ,
and P6 . The only aft periods which can travel upstream are Q1 and Q5 .
Example 3.17. Let ℓ = 3, e = 5, λ = ((4, 1), (7, 2), (2, 15)), and s = (3, −3, 1). We have its abacus
A = A(λ, s):
...

...

In this example, the aft periods and the fore periods coincide: Pk = Qk for all k ∈ N. The only
period that has space to move to the left is Q2 in the top row. However, the shift of Q2 one unit
to the left, Q̃2 , is not the 2nd fore period in the resulting abacus, so shifting Q2 to the left is not a
move that allows A to travel upstream in the crystal. Indeed, here is the abacus (A \ Q2 ) ∪ Q̃2 :
...

...

Its second period is not the left shift of Q2 from A. So no aft period Qk can travel upstream, and
A is a highest weight vertex for the sl∞ -crystal.
The only period of A that can travel downstream is P1 . Note that this is always the case if A is
a highest weight vertex for the sl∞ -crystal.
Example 3.18. Let ℓ = 5, e = 4, λ = ((9, 2), (52, 4, 3, 2, 12), (2, 12 ), (6, 4, 2, 12), (42 , 22 , 12 )), and
s = (−4, 2, −1, 2, 3). Let A = A(λ, s).

All but two pairs of the aft periods and fore periods coincide: Pk = Qk except for when k = 3, 5.
The fore periods are drawn in red, and the aft periods which differ from the fore periods are drawn
in blue. We stopped drawing the periods after P8 . The fore periods P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , and P6 can

Example 3.19. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to verify that taking e = 3, there is no aft

the rule for going upstream or downstream in the crystal simplifies:

Corollary 3.20. Let A, A′ be totally e-periodic ℓ-abaci. There is an arrow A → A′ in the sl∞ crystal if and only if the following equivalent situations hold for some k ∈ N:
(1) A′ is obtained from A by shifting the k’th period Pk one unit to the right, and the shift P̃k
of Pk is the k’th period of A′ .
(2) A is obtained from A′ by shifting the k’th period Pk one unit to the left, and the shift P̃k
of Pk is the k’th period of A.
Example 3.21. The following 3-abacus is totally 4-periodic.

Here, only P2 can travel upstream. In fact, the highest weight vertex is obtained by shifting P2
twice to the left, and then P1 twice to the left. In particular, θ = (22 ).

4. Position of an abacus in its sl∞ -crystal component
For all A ∈ Fs, there exists a unique highest weight vertex A◦ ∈ Fs for sl∞ and a unique partition
θ such that A = b̃θ A◦ , and |θ| is the depth of A in the sl∞ -crystal (see Sections 1.3 and 2.9). Pairing
this observation with Theorem 3.14 gives an easy way to read off θ from A. For all k ∈ N, let
− q
−
q
αk = max{q ∈ Z≥0 | (Υ−
k ) (A) 6= 0}, where (Υk ) is Υk applied q times. In abacus terms, αk is
the number of successive times Qk ⊂ A can travel a unit upstream. Let
P r = max{n ∈ N | αn 6= 0}.
Thus r is maximal such that Qr ⊂ A can travel upstream. Set δk = rm=k αm .
Theorem 4.1. The partition θ is given by the formula

θ = (δ1 , δ2 , . . . , δr ).
Proof. By Theorem 3.14, there is an edge B → A in the sl∞ -crystal if and only if Qk ⊂ A can
− a
travel upstream for some k yielding B if and only if Υ−
k A = B. By Definition 3.13, (Υk ) (A) 6= 0
if and only if θ has a successively removable boxes in row k. Thus αk is the maximum number
of successively removable boxes in row k, which means that θ has exactly αk columns of length k.
αk
α
α
Therefore, θt = (ks ks , ks−1s−1 , . . . , k1 k1 ), where k1 < k2 < · · · < ks ∈ N are all of the k ∈ N such that
αk 6= 0. It then follows by the formula for the transpose of a partition that θ = (δ1 , δ2 , . . . , δr ). 
Example 4.2. Let ℓ = 2, e = 2, s = (0, −1), and λ = ((6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1), (5, 5, 5, 3, 3)). Then
A(λ, s) = . . .

...

We have Qi = Pi for all i 6= 2; Q2 is the quasiperiod drawn in blue. We have r = 4, α4 = 2, α2 = 2,
and αk = 0 for all k 6= 2, 4. The position of λ in the sl∞ -crystal is therefore θ = (4, 4, 2, 2)t =
(4, 4, 2, 2), and q(λ) = |θ| = 12.
Example 4.3. The abacus in Example 3.7 has only two aft periods which can travel upstream,
Q5 and Q1 , and α5 = 1 = α1 . This abacus thus has position θ = (5, 1)t = (2, 14) in its crystal
component, and its depth in the sl∞ -crystal is 6.
ce -crystal structure of the Fock space has been widely studied
Remark 4.4. Even though the sl
and is considered well-understood ([23], [10], [11], [12]), it is a difficult problem to find an explicit
combinatorial formula for the depth of an abacus A(λ, s) =: A in this crystal. However, this piece
of information is one half of the knowledge of the support of L(λ) ∈ Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) (see Section
ce -crystal component containing A, then
2.7). Note that if A(λ, s) is the source vertex of the sl
ce -crystal. An efficient algorithm for computing λ
p(λ) = |λ| − |λ| is the depth of A in the sl
has been given in [12, Theorem 6.3]. This does not require computing the action of the Kashiwara
crystal operators, and relies instead on an affine analogue of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence,
denoted Φ. Constructing Φ however requires iterated use of the Schensted insertion procedure on
symbols. We pose the question: is there a way to compute p(λ) without constructing λ, as we have
done for q(λ)?
5. Charges in eZℓ and a closed formula for doubly highest weight vertices
In this section, we consider ℓ-charges of the form s = (s1 , . . . , sℓ ) where sj − sj ′ ∈ eZ for all
j, j ′ . Without loss of generality in virtue of Remarks 1.4 and 1.9, we can assume that min{sj |
1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ} = 0 and thus sj = ezj with zj ∈ Z≥0 for all j = 1 . . . , ℓ and min{zj } = 0. Write
z = (z1 , . . . , zℓ ), and A◦ = A(∅, s). We will give a combinatorial formula for the vertices belonging
to the connected component of the sl∞ -crystal with highest weight vertex A◦ . Such vertices are
ce and sl
cℓ (see [36]
called doubly highest weight vertices in [13] as they are singular for the action of sl
and [13]) simultaneously.

Because A◦ is the abacus of the empty charged multipartition, it is totally periodic, and thus
its fore and aft periods coincide by Remark 3.6. Moreover, because s = ez, each period of A◦ is
a sequence of e beads (bi )i=1,...,e in the same row and satisfying b1 = (β1 , j1 ) with β1 = 0 mod e.
Therefore, we can construct a (reverse) tabloid T by replacing the k’th period of A◦ by the number
k. For each j = 1, . . . , ℓ, let Tj be the sequence of numbers in row j of T , in increasing order.
For a partition σ = (σ1 , σ2 , . . . ) (with infinitely many zero parts), and for any increasing integer
sequence X = (x1 , x2 , . . . ), write σ[X, e] = (σxe 1 , σxe 2 , . . . ).
Theorem 5.1. Let σ be a partition and s be as above. Then b̃σ |∅, si = |λ, si where
λj = σ[Tj , e]
ce - and sl∞ -crystals,
Proof. Corollary 3.20 implies that if A◦ is a highest weight vertex in both the sl
◦
then every other vertex b̃θ A in its sl∞ -crystal connected component may be obtained from A◦
by first, shifting P1 to the right θ1 times, then, shifting P2 to the right θ2 times, etc.4 Complete
information about the periods of A◦ is given by the tabloid T : the row of T containing entry k is
the row containing the k’th period of A. Making the k’th period travel σk times downstream is
exactly shifting its e beads, that all belong to the same row, say j, by σk steps to the right, which
corresponds to adding σke in the j’th component of the ℓ-partition.

Example 5.2. Take e = 3, ℓ = 8 and z = (2, 5, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2). Then the abacus A◦ looks as follows

from which we may compute b̃σ (A◦ ) for any partition σ. E.g. if σ = (12, 92 , 7, 6, 4, 32, 22 , 14 ),
b̃σ |∅, si = ((63 , 23 ), (123 , 96, 43 , 13 ), (73 , 33 , 13 ), ∅, (33, 13 ), (13 ), ∅, (23)).
In the case where z1 ≥ z2 ≥ · · · ≥ zℓ = 0, we can give a more direct formula for b̃σ A. In this
case, we may write
am
z = (z1 , . . . , zℓ ) = (y1a1 , y2a2 , . . . , ym

set di = yi − yi+1 , i = 1, . . . , m. If λ = (λ1 , λ2 , . . . ) is a partition, write λ[e] as shorthand for
λ[N, e] = (λe1 , λe2 , λe3 , . . . ).
4Note

that this recovers [13, Proposition 7.4]. In the even more particular case where A is a doubly highest weight
vertex, i.e. A◦ is the empty ℓ-partition, one recovers the original result of [13, Remark 6.16].

Proof. By Theorem 5.1, the formula for |λ, si is obtained by identifying the periods in A by looking
at the tabloid T and taking the subsequences of N corresponding to the rows of T . Therefore,
it suffices to determine a closed formula for the entries of row j of T for all j = 1, . . . , ℓ. It is an
elementary combinatorial problem to see that the formulas above compute the desired numbers. 
We can now give a combinatorial procedure for computing b̃σ A◦ when z need not satisfy zj ≥ zj+1 ,
starting from the situation of Corollary 5.3. Take any z ∈ Zℓ with min{zj } = 0, let T be its tabloid,
and let T ′ be the tabloid resulting from switching zj and zj ′ for some j > j ′ . Since the order in
T goes from bottom to top across the rows, all entries of T located in the rectangle consisting of
columns of T which have an entry in row j or j ′ but not both, and rows from j ′ to j inclusive,
will slide up (if zj < zj′ ) or down (if zj > zj′ ) to the next available spot in the same column of the
diagram of shape T ′ .
Example 5.4. Take z = (7, 7, 5, 1, 0) and say we want to change the 2nd and 4th entries to get
z′ = (7, 1, 5, 7, 0). We replace the diagram of shape T with the diagram of shape T ′ by switching
the second and fourth rows. Then to get the tableau T ′ , all entries located in the rectangle slide
up to the next available row in the new diagram, while all entries outside the rectangle remain
unchanged:

the depth of A in the sl

For n ∈ Z≥0 , let Triv denote the ℓ-partition ((1n ), ∅, ∅, . . . , ∅). This labels the trivial representation of G(ℓ, 1, n). The aim of this section is to answer the following question: given (q, p) ∈ Z2≥0
and n ∈ Z≥0 , for which values of the parameters e, s does the abacus A := A(Triv, s) have bidepth
(q, p)? Take s = (s1 , s2 , . . . , sℓ ) ∈ Zℓ such that s1 = n − e − 1, without loss of generality by Remarks
1.4 and 1.9 (we identify an abacus with its horizontal shifts). Write n = qe + r with q, r ∈ N ∪ {0}
and r < e. Set
m = min{r, sj mod e | sj ≥ 0, 2 ≤ j ≤ ℓ}.
Let (q(Triv), p(Triv)) denote the bidepth of A(Triv, s).
Lemma 6.1. The number of free beads in A is equal to p(Triv).
Proof. We will induct on the number of free beads. By Theorem 1.6, p(Triv) = 0 if and only if A
is totally periodic, which is the case if and only if the number of free beads is equal to 0. The bead
b1n is the only left-shiftable bead in A. Then by Theorem 1.3, b1n is good left-shiftable if and only if
p(Triv) > 0, which holds if and only if A has free beads. It is easy to see that if A has free beads
then b1n must be a free bead, and that b1n+1 is never a free bead in the abacus of ((1n ), ∅, . . . , ∅) for
any charge s. Shifting b1n to the left then reduces both p(Triv) and the number of free beads by 1,
and now the statement is true by induction.

Lemma 6.2. Suppose sj ≥ 0 for some j ≥ 2. Then the number of free beads in A is equal to m.
Proof. By induction on m. Suppose m = 0. If m = r = 0 then e divides n. Then A is totally
quasiperiodic, so by Lemma 3.4, A is totally periodic and hence the number of free beads in A is
equal to 0. If m = sj mod e = 0 for some j ≥ 2 and sj ≥ 0, then take j such that sj is minimal
with this property. Then in the word of left- and right-shiftable 0-beads (see Section 1.2), the −
for the unique left-shiftable bead b1n = (−e + 1, 1) of A cancels with the + for the right-shiftable
bead (sj , j) and therefore b1n is not good left-shiftable. It follows by Theorem 1.3 that A is a highest
ce -crystal, so by Theorem 1.6 A is totally periodic, i.e. the number of free
weight vertex for the sl
beads is 0. For the induction step: if b1n is good left-shiftable then shifting it to the left reduces
the number of free beads by 1. Since our formulas use a charge normalized in a way depending on
n, we must renormalize the charge s for ((1n−1 ), ∅, . . . , ∅) to charge t by subtracting 1 from every
component of s, so that t1 = s1 − 1 = (n − 1) − e − 1 and tj = sj − 1. If n = eq + r with r > 0 then

22

THOMAS GERBER AND EMILY NORTON

n − 1 = eq + (r − 1) = eq + r ′ , e > r ′ := r − 1 ≥ 0; and if sj > 0 mod e for all sj ≥ 0, j ≥ 2, then
sj − 1 mod e = sj mod e − 1. Therefore
m − 1 = min{r − 1, sj − 1 mod e | j ≥ 2, sj ≥ 0} = min{r ′ , tj

mod e | j ≥ 2, tj ≥ 0}

and by induction, the right-hand-side equals the number of free beads in A(((1n−1), ∅, . . . , ∅), t) =
A(((1n−1), ∅, . . . , ∅), s). Hence the number of free beads in A is (m − 1) + 1 = m.

Theorem 6.3. The bidepth of A(Triv, s) is given by the following formulas:
(
q if sj < 0 for all j ≥ 2
q(Triv) =
0 if sj ≥ 0 for some j ≥ 2
(
r if sj < 0 for all j ≥ 2
p(Triv) =
m if sj ≥ 0 for some j ≥ 2.
Proof. Proof of the formula for q(Triv). If e > n then obviously Triv is a highest weight vertex
for the sl∞ -crystal by Theorem 3.14, as there is no space for a bead in row 2 or higher to shift to
the left, and any quasiperiod containing {b11 , . . . , bn1 } must contain a bead from a higher row since
e > n. Then q(Triv) = 0 = q.
For the remainder of the proof of the q(Triv) formula, assume that e ≤ n. Let
P = {b1n−e+1 , . . . , b1n } = {(0, 1), (−1, 1), (−2, 1), . . . , (−e + 1, 1)},
a quasiperiod of A consisting of the e beads directly to the right of the space in row 1. Observe that
2
P is the unique left-shiftable quasiperiod of A. Furthermore, since (β(b1n ) − 2, 1) ∈ A, (Υ−
k ) A = 0.
It then follows by Theorems 3.14 and 4.1 that either (a) q(Triv) = 0, or (b) P = Qk for some
k ≥ 1 and the left shift P̃ of P is the k’th fore period of (A \ P ) ∪ P̃ , in which case θ = (1k ) and
q(Triv) = k.
First, suppose that sj < 0 for all j. Then the first q fore periods are chains of e successive beads
in row 1 and P = Qq is the q’th aft period. Let Q̃q be the left shift of Qq . If b = (β, j) ∈ A with
j ≥ 2 then β ≤ −1. The first bead of Q̃q is (β(b1n−e+1 ) − 1, 1) = (−1, 1). Thus Q̃q > Q for any
quasiperiod Q of A whose first bead belongs to a row j > 1, and so Q̃q is the q’th fore period of
(A \ Qq ) ∪ Q̃q . Therefore q(Triv) = q.
Next, suppose that sj ≥ 0 for some j ≥ 2. If P is not an aft period then q(Triv) = 0, so
suppose that P = Qk for some k. Either P is also a fore period or it is not. If P = Pk then for all
1 ≤ β ≤ e − 1 and all j ≥ 2, (β, j) cannot be the first bead of a fore period Pa , because otherwise
the bead (0, 1) would belong to Pa and not to Pk . Since sj ≥ 0 for some j ≥ 2, (0, j) ∈ A. Take j
minimal with this property. It follows that (0, j) is the first bead of Pk+1 . Then by Lemma 3.22,
Υ−
k A = 0, and since Qk is the only left-shiftable quasiperiod, we conclude that q(Triv) = 0.
On the other hand, if P 6= Pk then beads {(0, 1), (−1, 1), . . . , (−α, 1)} for some 0 ≤ α < e − 1
are beads of Pk and beads {(−α − 1, 1), . . . , (−e + 1, 1)} are free beads. Pick j ≥ 2 minimal with
(1)
sj ≥ 0. Then (0, j) belongs to some fore period Pm . If the first bead bm of Pm is to the right of
(1)
the first bead b of Pk , i.e. if β(bm ) > β(b), then k > m, but then a larger quasiperiod than Pm
not intersecting any Pa , a < m, could be constructed using (0, 1), (−1, 1), ... instead of (0, j), etc.,
(1)
contradicting the definition of m’th fore period. If β(bm ) < β(b) then the bead (−α − 1, 1) would
(1)
(e)
(e)
belong to Pm and would not be free. So β(bm ) = β(b), and thus β(bm ) = −α. Then β(bk+1 ) = −α
also since Pm ≤ Pk+1 < Pk . But then P is not an aft period Qk as its free beads b′ do not satisfy
(e)
the condition β(bk+1 ) ≤ β(b′ ) in Definition 3.53. So in this situation, P 6= Qk and thus q(Triv) = 0.
Proof of the formula for p(Triv). The case sj ≥ 0 for some j ≥ 2 follows from Lemmas 6.1 and
6.2. Consider the case sj < 0 for all j. Then the first q fore periods of A are P1 = {b11 , . . . , b1e }, P2 =

23

{b11+e , . . . b12e },... Pq = {b11+(q−1)e , . . . b1qe }. If r = 0, then peeling off P1 , ..., Pq off A yields A(∅, s),
which by Theorem 1.6 implies p(Triv) = 0. If r > 0, beads b1n = (−e + 1, 1), . . . , b1n−r+1 = (−e + r, 1)
are the free beads because (−e, 1), (0, j) ∈
/ A for all j ≥ 2. By Lemma 6.1, q(Triv) = r.

Remark 6.4. By the results of Shan, Vasserot, and Losev explained in Sections 2.8 and 2.9, Theorem 6.3 has a representation theoretic meaning: it gives the support of the irreducible representation
L(Triv) ∈ Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)), where c is the parameter for the Cherednik algebra determined by (e, s)
as in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. Conversely, Theorem 6.3 also permits the description of all n and all
parameters c (or equivalently (e, s)) such that L(Triv) ∈ Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) has a given support.
Consequently, we deduce the set of parameters (without normalizing s) such that the spherical
representation L(Triv) is finite-dimensional. Let n ∈ N.
Corollary 6.5. The set of parameters (e, s) ∈ Z × Zℓ such that L(Triv) ∈ Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n)) is finitedimensional consists of all (e, s) satisfying either
(i) sj − s1 = ke − n + 1 for some k ∈ N and some 2 ≤ j ≤ ℓ, or
(ii) the following two conditions hold:
(a) e divides n, and
(b) sj − s1 ≥ e − n + 1 for some 2 ≤ j ≤ ℓ.
Proof. As explained in Section 2.10, a simple module L(λ) in Oc (G(ℓ, 1, n) is finite-dimensional if
and only if q(λ) = p(λ) = 0. From Theorem 6.3, we deduce that the module L(Triv) is finitedimensional if and only if the following two conditions hold:
(i’) sj − s1 ≥ e − n + 1 for some 2 ≤ j ≤ ℓ, and
(ii’) either
(a’) e divides n, or
(b’) sj − s1 = −n + 1 mod e for some 2 ≤ j ≤ ℓ such that sj − s1 ≥ e − n + 1.
Note that (a) is the same as (a’), (b) is the same as (i’), and that (b’) is equivalent to (i). Moreover,
(b’) trivially implies (i’), so ((i’) and (ii’)) is equivalent to ((i) or (ii)).

Remark 6.6. The problem of determining the parameters c such that the Hc (W )-representation
L(Triv) is finite-dimensional has been studied by a number of authors. We list prior results intersecting the case of W = G(ℓ, 1, n). The first result in this direction was Berest, Etingof and
Ginzburg’s theorem for W = Sn = G(1, 1, n), which states that L(Triv) is finite-dimensional if and
only if c = r/n for some r ∈ N with gcd(r, n) = 1 [2]. Using methods of geometric representation
theory, Varagnolo and Vasserot showed several years later that for W a Weyl group, L(Triv) is a
finite-dimensional Hc (W )-module for equal parameters c if and only if c = r/e for e an elliptic number of W , r ∈ N, gcd(r, e) = 1 [37]. Etingof extended Varagnolo and Vasserot’s result to unequal
parameters and to the more general question of the support of L(Triv), thus giving a complete answer for W = Bn = G(2, 1, n) for any pair of parameters [8]. More recently, Griffeth, Gusenbauer,
Juteau, and Lanini developed a “degenerate” version of Bezrukavnikov-Etingof parabolic restriction
aimed towards studying finite-dimensional representations [16]; this produced a sufficient condition
for L(Triv) to be finite-dimensional for W = G(ℓ, 1, n) [16, Corollary 5.4]. They followed this with
the natural question: is the condition of [16, Corollary 5.4] also necessary for L(Triv) to be finitedimensional? [16, Question 5.5]. We now check that our Corollary 6.5 agrees with the answers for
ℓ = 2 in [8] and for ℓ ≥ 2 in [16], giving a positive answer to [16, Question 5.5]. Note that we have
restricted ourselves to the case of integral charges for the Fock space and κ = 1/e instead of r/e,
but the general case can be reduced to this case, see Section 2.5.
In the case of G(2, 1, n) = Bn , the change of parameters of Section 2.3 directly translates Corollary
6.5 into Etingof’s criterion [8, Section 4.2] for the set of parameters c = (c1 , c2 ) such that L(Triv) is

24

finite-dimensional. If (e, (s1 , s2 )) is a Fock space charge, then c1 = 1/e and c2 = (s2 − s1 )/e − 1/2.
Corollary 6.5 (i) gives c2 = (ke − n + 1)/e − 1/2 for some k ∈ N, and therefore
c1 (n − 1) + c2 = (n − 1)/e + c2 = (2k − 1)/2
for some k ∈ N, which are the lines described by Etingof in [8, Section 4.2]. In the case that e divides
n, Corollary 6.5 (ii) gives additional parameters at which L(Triv) is finite-dimensional: those not
already included in (i) consist of (s1 , s2 ) with s2 − s1 ≥ e − n + 1 and s2 − s1 + (n − 1) 6= 0 mod e.
Write s2 − s1 = ke − n + 1 + a for 1 ≤ a ≤ e − 1, k ∈ N. Write n = er. Changing to Cherednik
parameters,
(c1 , c2 ) = (1/e, (s2 − s1 )/e − 1/2) = (1/e, (2k − 1)/2 − n/e + (1 + a)/e)
= (r/n, (2k − 1)/2 − r + r(1 + a)/n) = (r/n, p/2 − r + (rs)/n)
with p an odd positive integer and 2 ≤ s ≤ e = n/r = n/gcd(r, n). These are exactly the isolated
points of [8, Section 4.2] where L(Triv) is finite-dimensional, when c1 = 1/e.
In the general case of G(ℓ, 1, n), we compare our result with the sufficient condition for L(Triv)
to be finite-dimensional given in [16, Corollary 5.4]. The surface appearance of their criterion is
slightly different as they use a different parametrization of the Cherednik algebra. We check that
after reparametrization, it is consistent with Corollary 6.5. In our notation, the condition of [16,
Corollary 5.4] is that either
(i’) ℓ(n − 1)/e + d0 − dj = −j + kℓ for some 1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ − 1 and some positive integer k, or
(ii’) e divides n and ℓ(p − 1)/e + d0 − dj = −j + kℓ for some 1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ − 1, some positive integer
k, and some n − e + 1 ≤ p ≤ n
where the parameters dj , 0 ≤ j ≤ ℓ − 1, are related to the parameters sj+1, 0 ≤ j ≤ ℓ − 1 via the
formula
(1 + dj−1 − dj )/ℓ = hj = (sj+1 − sj )/e for all 1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ − 1
(where hj is given in Section 2.3). Therefore, we have
(i′ ) ⇔ ℓ(n − 1)/e + d0 − dj = −j + kℓ
ℓ
ℓ
⇔ (n − 1) + (sj+1 − s1 ) − j = −j + kℓ
e
e
⇔ sj+1 − s1 = ke − n + 1
⇔ (i).
Similarly,
(ii′ ) ⇔ ℓ(p − 1)/e + d0 − dj = −j + kℓ
⇔ sj+1 − s1 = ke − p + 1
⇔ (ii)
We see that the condition in [16, Corollary 5.4] is not only sufficient, but also necessary. Note finally
that this is proved independently in Griffeth and Juteau’s latest work [17].

and set t = min{−t′ , m}. Then q(λ) = tq.
Proof. Let A := A(λ, s). As in the proof of Theorem 6.3, q(λ) can only be nonzero if
Q = {(0, a), (−1, a), (−2, a), . . . , (−e + 1, a)} = {ban−e+1 , ban−e+2 , . . . , ban }
is an aft period. When n < e then Q is not an aft period and q = 0, so the statement q(λ) = tq is
true as both sides are 0. For the rest of the proof suppose q > 0.
/ A
First, consider the case that sj < 0 for all j > a and sj ′ < −e for all j ′ < a. Then (β, j) ∈
′ ′
′
for all β ≥ 0, (β , j ) ∈
/ A for all β ≥ −e. This implies that the first q fore periods of A are
Pk := {ba(k−1)e+1 , ba(k−1)e+2 , . . . , bake }, k = 1, . . . , q and that Q = Qq is the q’th aft period. Q can
be shifted to the left up to m times, and each left shift gives an edge in the crystal so long as the
situations of Lemma 3.22 do not occur. The number t is by construction the number of times Q can
be shifted to the left without the situations of Lemma 3.22 occurring. Theorem 4.1 then implies
θ = (tq ) and hence q(λ) = tq.
Next, suppose sj ≥ 0 for some j > a. Then by arguments identical to those used in the proof of
Theorem 6.3, q(λ) = 0. Suppose sj ′ ≥ −e for some j ′ < a. Definition 3.5 implies that if Q is an aft
period Qk then ban does not lie above a bead b belonging to Pm for m > k. On the other hand, by
assumption (−e, j ′ ) ∈ A and it belongs to some fore period. Therefore if Q is an aft period, then
(−e, j ′ ) is the first bead of the fore period that it belongs to. Then by Lemma 3.22, shifting Q to
the left does not give an edge in the sl∞ -crystal.

Corollary 6.8. Suppose that |λ, si is as in the theorem and e divides n. Then L(λ) is finitedimensional if and only if sj ≥ 0 for some j > a or sj ′ ≥ −e for some j ′ < a.
Proof. In this case, λ is totally e-quasiperiodic, hence totally e-periodic by Lemma 3.4, so λ is a
ce -crystal by Theorem 1.6. Applying Theorem 6.7 gives the additional
highest weight vertex for the sl
condition for λ to be a highest weight vertex for the sl∞ -crystal.

6.3. Depth of (λ, ∅, . . . , ∅) in the sl∞ -crystal for any partition λ. Throughout this subsection, λ = (λa11 , λa22 , λa33 , . . . ) denotes a partition with λi being the distinct parts of λ and ai their
multiplicities, and we study the position in the sl∞ -crystal of λ := (λ, ∅, . . . , ∅), an ℓ-partition all
of whose nonzero parts are in the first component.
Lemma 6.9. q(λ) = 0 if and only if either (i) e > max{ai }, or (ii) taking λi to be maximal so that

, j) is occupied by a bead for some j ≥ 2, where Ni := im=1 am .
i −e+1

Proof. The depth q(λ) = 0 if and only if there is no aft period in row 1 which can travel upstream
in the crystal. The first way for there to be none such is if ai < e for all i, because then there is
no uninterrupted string of e beads in the first row with space to its left. The second way is if for
any consecutive string of e beads in row 1 with a space to its left, it can’t shift to the left without
changing the other periods. As in the proof of Theorem 6.3, if there are beads above all the beads
of such a quasiperiod, either it will fail to be an aft period, or there will be a fore period above it,
which means that when it is shifted to the left, the smallest fore period above will change and take
its first (shifted) bead.

sj = ke + λi + rt=i+1 at for some k ∈ N,
(2) sj ′ ≥ λ1 + N − a1 + e for some j ′ ≥ 2.

Proof. The abacus of |λ, si is totally periodic if and only if every bead with a space to its left is in
a period. If b is in row 1 and to the right of a space, then b is in a period if and only if it is the last
bead of a period. It follows from the proof of Theorem 6.3 that this is the case if and only if (1)
holds. Lemma 6.9 restricted to the situation that (1) holds is (2).

Next, we may iterate using the lemma to obtain a complete description of θ(λ), the position of
λ in the sl∞ -crystal, and thus of q(λ) = |θ|. Let λi1 , . . . , λis ⊂ {λ1 , . . . , λr } be the distinct parts of
λ for which ai ≥ e, ordered so that iu < iu+1 , and set δiu = λiu − λiu+1 for u = 1, . . . , s − 1 and set
δis = λis . For i = 1, . . . , r, write ai = qi e + ri with qi , ri ∈ Z≥0 , ri < e.

Proof. The quasiperiod Q consisting of the last e beads of a sequence of aui beads corresponding to
a part λui occurring aui ≥ e times, can, first of all, move to the left as many times as there is space
to do so, which is until it encounters the next part of λ. If the next part occurs less than e times
then the shift of Q forms a chain of > e beads with those beads and the minimal quasiperiod, the
last e beads of that chain, can continue moving left... and this continues until such a quasiperiod
encounters the beads corresponding to the next part λiu+1 of λ occurring aiu+1 ≥ e times. Thus Q
can physically shift (recursively) to the left as many times as there are spaces between the clump
of beads corresponding to parts of λ of size λui and the clump of beads corresponding to parts of
size λui+1 , so δui times. This will always be traveling upstream in the crystal unless at some point
the first bead of Q passes to the left of a bead in one of the rows above; if this happens then that is
where Q stops traveling upstream. Translating these remarks into formulas gives the theorem. 
Example 6.12. Let λ = (127 , 7, 6, 411), s = (20, s2, . . . , sℓ ), and e = 3. Let sj = max{s2 , . . . , sℓ }.
We illustrate the computation of θ(λ) and q(λ), drawing rows 1 and j only since no other row plays
a role. There are two distinct parts λi with ai ≥ e, λ1 and λ4 , and so i1 = 1, i2 = 4, qi1 = 2, qi2 = 3.
(1) sj = 28. The blue bead, the first bead of the qi1 ’st aft period, cannot move to the left of the
red bead, which means it cannot move left at all. Then θ(λ) = ∅ and q(λ) = 0.

27

(2) sj = 24. The blue bead, the first bead of the qi1 ’st aft period, cannot move to the left of the
red bead, which is 4 units to its left. Since qi1 = 2 we have θ = (24 )t = (42 ) and q(λ) = 8.

(3) sj = 18. The blue bead cannot move to the left of the red bead, but it’s a moot point
because there’s no space for it to do so: Q2 can move 8 = 12 − 4 = λi1 − λi2 units left and
then runs into the next fore period. So Q2 can travel upstream in the crystal 8 times and
we have θ(λ) = (28 )t = (82 ) and q(λ) = 16.

(4) sj = 5. As in

Qqi1 +qi2 = Q5 .
in the crystal.

the previous example, Q2 which is marked by the rightmost blue bead can
upstream. The leftmost blue bead marks the first bead of the aft period
It cannot move to the left of the red bead, so Q5 can travel upstream twice
Then θ(λ) = (52 , 28 )t = (102, 23 ) and q(λ) = 26.

(5) sj = 3. As in the previous example Q2 can travel 8 times upstream. The blue bead of Q5
cannot move to the left of the red bead, but this is a moot point as there’s no space for it
to do so, it runs into the infinite chain of beads starting 4 = δi2 spaces to its left and there
it stops. So Q5 can travel upstream 4 times in the crystal. Then θ(λ) = (54 , 28)t = (122 , 43 )
and q(λ) = 36.

6.4. A criterion for finite-dimensionality of Cherednik algebra modules in type B. Let
ℓ = 2 and take a charged bipartition |λ, si: λ = (λ1 , λ2 ), s = (s1 , s2 ) ∈ Z2 . Fix e ≥ 2. Let A be
the abacus of λ = (λ1 , λ2 ) and let N ∈ Z be the β-number (i.e. column position) of the first bead
of the first fore period of A.
Theorem 6.13. The level 2 abacus A is a highest weight vertex for the sl∞ -crystal if and only if
A avoids the following e + 1 patterns from column N and to the left:

...

More formally, the k+1’st pattern (k+1) for a given β ≤ N, 0 ≤ k ≤ e, is that (β, 2), (β−k, 1) ∈
/A
and (β ′ , j) ∈ A for all β − k ≤ β ′ ≤ β, j = 1, 2, (β ′ , j) 6= (β, 2), (β − k, 1). The statement is that A
is a highest weight vertex for the sl∞ -crystal if and only if patterns (1) through (e+1) do not occur
in A for every β ≤ N.
Proof. First we show that if patterns (1) through (e+1) do not occur then A is the source of its
sl∞ -crystal component. There are e + 1 distinct quasiperiods up to shift when ℓ = 2: for 0 ≤ k ≤ e,
the k’th type of quasiperiod is {(γ, 2), (γ − 1, 2), . . . , (γ − e + k + 1, 2), (γ − e + k, 1), . . . , (γ − e +
2, 1), (γ − e + 1, 1)} for some γ ∈ Z. If patterns (1) through (k+1) do not occur then the k’th type of
quasiperiod has no space to move to the left, for all k = 1, ..., e − 1. Now consider the two extremal
cases of a quasiperiods of types 0 and e concentrated in rows 2 and 1 respectively. For the former:
if case (1) does not occur and the quasiperiod P has space to the left to move, then the position
one step below and left of the last bead of P is occupied by a bead b. The left shift of P would
then not form a fore period as such a period would use b instead of the last bead of the shift of P .
For the latter: if A avoids patterns (1) through (e) and a quasiperiod P of type e, concentrated in

28

row 1, has space to move to its left, then either pattern (e+1) occurs or the space directly left of P
is free, the space above it is occupied by a bead, and all spaces above the beads of P are occupied
by beads. A slightly longer but straightforward argument shows that in the latter case, P cannot
travel upstream in the crystal.
For the reverse implication: assume that A is a highest weight vertex for the sl∞ -crystal. In
pattern (e+1), the e beads in row 2 always form a fore period, and the e beads in row 1 an aft period
which can move upstream in the crystal by shifting left. Thus pattern (e+1) does not occur. Suppose
one of the patterns (1) through (e) appears in A, say pattern (k+1) for some 0 ≤ k ≤ e−1, with the
column position of the upper right space equal to β. As k < e, there is no quasiperiod that is a subset
of the pattern, and there is no quasiperiod starting to the right of the pattern and ending to the left
of the pattern. But we have assumed β ≤ N where N is the position of the first bead of the first
fore period of A. This implies there must be some quasiperiod Q ⊂ A whose last bead b(e) satisfies
β(b(e) ) ≥ β − k + 1. Consider the smallest such Q, and say Q is of type k ′ . Set β ′ = β(b(e) ). We have
Q = {(β ′ + e − 1, 2), (β ′ + e − 2, 2), (β ′ + e − 3, 2) . . . , (β ′ + k ′ , 2), (β ′ + k ′ − 1, 1), . . . , (β ′ + 1, 1), (β ′, 1)}.
If (β ′ − 1, 1) ∈ A then β ′ > β − k + 1 and {(β ′ + e − 2, 2), (β ′ + e − 3, 2) . . . , (β ′ + k ′ , 2), (β ′ + k ′ −
1, 1), . . . , (β ′ +1, 1), (β ′, 1), (β ′ −1, 1)} ⊂ A is a smaller quasiperiod than Q whose last bead b satisfies
β(b) ≥ β − k + 1, contradicting minimality of Q. So (β ′ − 1, 1) ∈
/ A. If (β ′ + k ′ − 1, 2) ∈ A, then
{(β ′ + e − 1, 2), (β ′ + e − 2, 2), (β ′ + e − 3, 2) . . . , (β ′ + k ′ , 2), (β ′ + k ′ − 1, 2), . . . , (β ′ + 1, 1), (β ′, 1)} ⊂ A
is a smaller quasiperiod than Q, again contradicting minimality of Q. So (β ′ + k ′ − 1, 2) ∈
/ A. Since
′
′
′
(β − 1, 1), (β + k − 1, 2) ∈
/ A, Q is a left-shiftable quasiperiod.
In the pattern (k) it is impossible for the beads (γ, 2) to belong to the same quasiperiod as the
beads (γ ′ , 1) for all β − k ≤ γ ≤ β − 1 and all β − k + 1 ≤ γ ′ ≤ β. This implies that Q is the minimal
quasiperiod in its vessel, hence is an aft period. Moreover, we claim that the left shift of Q is a
fore period: this is clear if Q is not concentrated in a single row. If Q is concentrated in row 1 then
(β ′ + e − 1, 2) ∈
/ A because otherwise Q is not minimal. Then the left shift of Q is a fore period. If
Q is concentrated in row 2, so if k ′ = 0, then (β ′ − 1, 2) = (β ′ + k ′ − 1, 2), (β ′ − 1, 1) ∈
/ A and this
implies that the left shift of Q is a fore period. So in every possible case, the left shift of Q is a fore
period. This contradicts the assumption that A is a highest weight vertex in the sl∞ -crystal.

Corollary 6.14. Suppose |λ, si is a charged bipartition, |λ| = n. Then L(λ) is a finite-dimensional
representation of the rational Cherednik algebra Hc (Bn ) = Hc (G(2, 1, n)) at the corresponding
parameters c = (1/e, (s2 − s1 )/e − 1/2) if and only if
(1) A(λ, s) satisfies the pattern avoidance condition of Theorem 6.13,
(2) and additionally,
(a) if b = (β, 1) ∈ A and (β − 1, 1) ∈
/ A, then b is the last bead of a period.
(b) if b = (β, 2) ∈ A and (β − 1, 2) ∈
/ A, then either (β, 1) ∈
/ A or (β, 1) ∈ A is the last
bead of a period.
Proof. L(λ) is finite-dimensional if and only if A := A(λ, s) is a source vertex in both the sl∞ ce -crystals. By Theorem 6.13, A is a source vertex for the sl∞ -crystal if and only if A
and the sl
avoids the e + 1 patterns described in the theorem. In order for A to also be a source vertex for
ce -crystal, A must in addition be totally e-periodic. This is the case if and only if any bead
the sl
directly to the right of a space belongs to an e-period. If b := (β, 1) ∈ A and (β − 1, 1) ∈
/ A then b is
in a period if and only if it is the last bead of a period. If b := (β, 2) and (β − 1, 2) ∈
/ A, then since
we are already assuming A is a highest weight vertex for the sl∞ -crystal, it follows from Theorem
6.13 that (β − 1, 1), (β − 2, 1),..., (β − e, 1),(β − e − 1, 1) ∈ A. Thus b will belong to a period if and
only if condition (2)(b) is satisfied.

Remark 6.15. Note that this theorem concerns any bipartition λ, and thus detects finitedimensionality of L(λ) for any λ ∈ Irr Bn , not just L(Triv). This is a new result which can

be applied not only to Cherednik algebras of type B but to type D as well, since finite-dimensional
representations of H1/e (Dn ) are obtained via restriction from finite-dimensional representations of
H(1/e,0) (Bn ). For example, the main theorem of [35], which was proved by computing wall-crossings,
follows immediately from Corollary 6.14. Indeed: let e ∈ 2N and s = (0, e/2), so that c = (1/e, 0) is
the corresponding type B Cherednik algebra parameter. Let λ = (λa11 , λa22 , . . . ) 6= ∅ be an arbitrary
partition with λi the distinct nonzero parts of λ and ai their multiplicities. The abacus A of the
charged bipartition |(λ, λ), (0, e/2)i has the same arrangement of beads in row 2 as in row 1, except
that the beads in row 2 are shifted e/2 units to the right relative to those in row 1. This means that
A has a pair of spaces in positions (λ1 − a1 , 1) and (λ1 − a1 + e/2, 2), violating the pattern avoidance
condition of Theorem 6.13. Therefore L(λ, λ) is infinite-dimensional, implying [35, Theorem 2.1].
Remark 6.16. Combining Corollary 6.14 and [13, Theorem 7.7], we get an easy combinatorial
characterization of charged bipartitions whose level-rank dual is an FLOTW e-partition (see e.g.
[11, Definition 5.7.8] for the definition).
