Abstract. Let H be any reductive p-adic group. We introduce a notion of cuspidality for enhanced Langlands parameters for H, which conjecturally puts supercuspidal H-representations in bijection with such L-parameters. We also define
a cuspidal support map and Bernstein components for enhanced L-parameters,
in analogy with Bernstein’s theory of representations of p-adic groups. We check
that for several well-known reductive groups these analogies are actually precise.
Furthermore we reveal a new structure in the space of enhanced L-parameters
for H, that of a disjoint union of twisted extended quotients. This is an analogue
of the ABPS conjecture (about irreducible H-representations) on the Galois side
of the local Langlands correspondence. Only, on the Galois side it is no longer
conjectural. These results will be useful to reduce the problem of finding a local
Langlands correspondence for H-representations to the corresponding problem for
supercuspidal representations of Levi subgroups of H.
The main machinery behind this comes from perverse sheaves on algebraic
groups. We extend Lusztig’s generalized Springer correspondence to disconnected
complex reductive groups G. It provides a bijection between, on the one hand,
pairs consisting of a unipotent element u in G and an irreducible representation
of the component group of the centralizer of u in G, and, on the other hand,
irreducible representations of a set of twisted group algebras of certain finite
groups. Each of these twisted group algebras contains the group algebra of a
Weyl group, which comes from the neutral component of G.

Introduction
As the title suggests, this paper consists of two parts. The first part is purely in
complex algebraic geometry, and is accessible without any knowledge of the Langlands program or p-adic groups. We start with discussing the second part though,
which is an application of and a motivation for the first part.
The local Langlands correspondence (LLC) predicts a relation between two rather
different kinds of objects: on the one hand irreducible representations of reductive
groups over a local field F , on the other hand some sort of representations of the
Weil–Deligne group of F . According to the original setup [Bor, Lan], it should be
possible to associate to every L-parameter a finite packet of irreducible admissible
representations. Later this was improved by enhancing L-parameters [Lus1, KaLu],
and the modern interpretation [ABPS6, Vog] says that the LLC should be a bijection
(when formulated appropriately).
We consider only non-archimedean local fields F , and we speak of the Galois side
versus the p-adic side of the LLC. The conjectural bijectivity makes it possible to
transfer many notions and ideas from on side of the LLC to the other. Indeed,
a main goal of this paper is to introduce an analogue, on the Galois side, of the
Bernstein theory [BeDe] for smooth representations of reductive p-adic groups.
Bernstein’s starting point is the notion of a supercuspidal representation. For a
long time it has been unclear how to translate this to the Galois side. In [Mou,
Def. 4.12] the second author found the (probably) correct notion for split reductive
p-adic groups, which we generalize here.
For maximal generality, we adhere to the setup for L-parameters from [Art2].
Let WF be the Weil group of F , let H be a connected reductive group over F
∨ be the adjoint group of
and let L H = H∨ ⋊ WF be its dual L-group. Let Had

∨ and let G = Z 1 (φ(W )) be its inverse image in H∨ .

We propose (see Definition 6.8) to call an enhanced L-parameter (φ, ρ) for H
cuspidal if u = φ(1, ( 10 11 )) and ρ, considered as data for the complex reductive
group G, form a cuspidal pair. This is turn means that the restriction of ρ from
AG (u) = π0 (ZG (u)) to AG◦ (u) is a direct sum of cuspidal representations in Lusztig’s
sense [Lus2]. We emphasize that it is essential to use L-parameters enhanced with
a representation of a suitable component group, for cuspidality cannot be detected
from the L-parameter alone.
Let Irrcusp (H) be the set of supercuspidal H-representations (up to isomorphism)
and let Φcusp (H) be the set of H∨ -conjugacy classes of cuspidal L-parameters for
H. It is known that in many cases such cuspidal L-parameters do indeed parametrize supercuspidal representations, and that moreover there is a nice bijection
Irrcusp (H) → Φcusp (H).
Based on this notion, we develop a cuspidal support map for enhanced L-parameters
(Definition 7.7). It assigns to every enhanced L-parameter for H a Levi subgroup
L ⊂ H and a cuspidal L-parameter for L, unique up to conjugation. We conjecture
that this map is a precise analogue of Bernstein’s cuspidal support map for irreducible H-representations, in the sense that these cuspidal support maps commute
with the respective local Langlands correspondences (assuming that these exist of
course).

A result for p-adic groups which has already been transferred to the Galois side
is the Langlands classification [SiZi]. On the p-adic side it reduces Irr(H) to the
tempered duals of Levi subgroups of H, while on the Galois side it reduces general
(enhanced) L-parameters to bounded L-parameters for Levi subgroups. We show
(Lemma 7.11) that our cuspidal support map factors through through the Langlands
classification on the Galois side, just like Bernstein’s cuspidal support map on the
p-adic side.
Recall that a crucial role in the Bernstein decomposition is played by inertial
equivalence classes of (super)cuspidal pairs for H. These consist of a Levi subgroup L ⊂ H and a supercuspidal representation thereof, up to equivalence by
H-conjugation and twists by unramified characters. Since the LLC for unramified
characters is known, we can easily translate this to a notion of inertial equivalence
classes of enhanced L-parameters (Definition 8.1). Using the cuspidal support map,
we can also partition the set of enhanced L-parameters Φe (H) into countably many
∨
Bernstein components Φe (H)s , parametrized by the inertial equivalence classes s∨ ,
see (113).
Let L ⊂ H be a Levi subgroup, and let
W (H, L) = NH (L)/L
be its ”Weyl” group. In [ABPS6] it was shown to be naturally isomorphic to
NH∨ (L∨ ⋊ WF )/L∨ , so it acts on both Irrcusp (L) and Φcusp (L).
Our main result provides a complete description of the space of enhanced Lparameters Φe (H) in terms of cuspidal L-parameters for Levi subgroups, and the
associated Weyl groups. It discovers a new structure in Φe (H), that of a union of
extended quotients. It improves on both the Langlands classification and the theory
of the Bernstein centre (on the Galois side of the LLC).

Here (·//·)κ denotes a twisted extended quotient, as defined in (13). The bijection
is not entirely canonical, but we provide a sharp bound on the non-canonicity. We
note that the bijection is not based on the earlier cuspidal support map, but rather
on a modification thereof, which preserves boundedness of L-parameters.
We expect that Theorem 1 will turn out to be an analogue of the ABPS conjecture
[ABPS6] on the Galois side of the LLC. To phrase this precisely in general, we need
yet another ingredient.
Conjecture 2. Let H be a connected reductive group over a local non-archimedean
field, and let Irr(H) denote the set of its irreducible smooth representations. There

with the following maps:
• The right hand side is Theorem 1.
• The upper horizontal map is a local Langlands correspondence for H.
• The lower horizontal map is obtained from local Langlands correspondences
for Irrcusp (L) by applying (·//W (H, L))κ .
• The left hand side is the bijection in the ABPS conjecture [ABPS6, §2].
With this conjecture one can reduce the problem of finding a LLC for H to that
of finding local Langlands correspondences for supercuspidal representations of its
Levi subgroups. Conjecture 2 is currently known in the following cases:
• inner forms of GLn (F ) [ABPS5, Theorem 5.3],
• inner forms of SLn (F ) [ABPS5, Theorem 5.6],
• split classical groups [Mou, §5.3],
• principal series representations of split groups [ABPS4, §16].
Now we come to the main technique behind the above: generalizations of the
Springer correspondence. Let G◦ be a connected complex reductive group with a
maximal torus T and Weyl group W (G◦ , T ). Recall that the original Springer correspondence [Spr] is a bijection between the irreducible representations of W (G◦ , T )
and G◦ -conjugacy classes of pairs (u, η), where u ∈ G◦ is unipotent and η is an
irreducible representation of AG◦ (u) = π0 (ZG◦ (u)) which appears in the homology
of the variety of Borel subgroups of G◦ containing u.
Lusztig [Lus2] generalized this to a setup which includes all pairs (u, η) with
u ∈ G◦ unipotent and η ∈ Irr(AG◦ (u)). On the other side of the correspondence he
replaced Irr(W (G◦ , T )) by a disjoint union ⊔t◦ Irr(Wt◦ ), where t◦ = [L, v, ǫ]G◦ runs
through cuspidal pairs (v, ǫ) for Levi subgroups L of G◦ , and Wt◦ = W (G◦ , L) is the
Weyl group associated to t◦ .
More precisely, Lusztig first attaches to (u, η) a cuspidal support t◦ = ΨG◦ (u, η),
−1 ◦
and then he constructs a bijection Σt◦ between ΨG
◦ (t ) and Irr(Wt◦ ). In Section 2
we recall these constructions in more detail, and we prove:
Theorem 3. The maps ΨG◦ and Σt◦ are equivariant with respect to algebraic automorphisms of the group G◦ .
Given a Langlands parameter φ for H, we would like to apply this machinery
1 (φ(W )). However, we immediately run into the problem that this
to G = ZH
∨
F
sc
complex reductive group is usually not connected. Thus we need a generalization
of Lusztig’s correspondence to disconnected reductive groups. Although there exist
generalizations of the Springer correspondence in various directions [AcHe, AHJR,
AcSa, Lus2, Lus5, LuSp, Sor], this particular issue has not yet been addressed in
the literature.
We would like to have a version which transforms every pair (u, η) for G into an
irreducible representation of some Weyl group. But this turns out to be impossible!

The problem is illustrated by Example 3.2: we have to use twisted group algebras
of groups Wt which are not necessarily Weyl groups.
When G is disconnected, we define the cuspidal support map by
ΨG (u, η) = ΨG◦ (u, η ◦ )/G-conjugacy,
A (u)

where η ◦ is any constituent of ResAG◦ (u) η. This is well-defined by the Ad(G)G
equivariance of ΨG◦ from Theorem 3.
For a cuspidal support t = [L, v, ǫ]G (where L is a Levi subgroup of G◦ ), we put
Wt = NG (L, v, ǫ)/L

and

t◦ = [L, v, ǫ]G◦ .

Then Wt contains Wt◦ = W (G◦ , L) as a normal subgroup.
Theorem 4. (See Theorem 4.7 and Proposition 4.5)
Let t = [L, v, ǫ]G be a cuspidal support for G. There exist:
• a 2-cocycle ♮t : Wt /Wt◦ × Wt /Wt◦ → C× ,
• a twisted group algebra C[Wt , ♮t ],
• a bijection Ψ−1
G (t) → Irr(C[Wt , ♮t ]) which extends [Lus2].
C[W ,♮ ]

Moreover the composition of the bijection with ResC[Wt◦ ]t is canonical.
t

Of course the proof of Theorem 4 starts with Lusztig’s generalized Springer correspondence for G◦ . Ultimately it involves a substantial part of the techniques and
objects from [Lus2], in particular we consider similar varieties and sheafs. In Section 3 we provide an expression for the 2-cocycle ♮t , derived from the cuspidal case
L = G◦ .
Yet ΨG and Theorem 4 still do not suffice for our plans with Langlands parameters. Namely, suppose that (φ, ρ) is an enhanced L-parameter
for H and apply ΨG

1 (φ(W )) and (u, η) = φ(1, ( 1 1 )), ρ . We end up with t = [L, v, ǫ] ,
with G = ZH

◦
where L is a Levi subgroup of G . But the cuspidal support map for L-parameters
should produce an enhanced L-parameter for a Levi subgroup L of H, and that
would involve a possibly disconnected group ZL1 ∨sc (φ(WF )) instead of L.
To resolve this problem, we consider quasi-Levi subgroups of G. These are groups
of the form M = ZG (Z(L)◦ ), where L ⊂ G◦ is a Levi subgroup (and hence M ◦ =
L). With these one can define a quasi-cuspidal support, a triple (M, v, qǫ) with
A (v)
v ∈ M ◦ unipotent and qǫ ∈ Irr(AM (v)) such that ResAM ◦ (v) qǫ is a sum of cuspidal
M
representations. The cuspidal support map ΨG can be adjusted to a canonical quasicuspidal support map qΨG , see (64). It is this map that gives us the cuspidal support
of enhanced L-parameters.
To a quasi-cuspidal support qt = [M, v, qǫ]G we associate the group Wqt =
NG (M, v, qǫ)/M , which (again) contains Wt◦ = NG◦ (M ◦ )/M ◦ .
Theorem 5. (See Theorem 5.5 and Lemma 5.4)
Theorem 4 also holds with quasi-Levi subgroups and with the quasi-cuspidal support
qt instead of t. It gives a bijection qΨ−1
G (qt) → Irr(C[Wqt , κqt ]) which is canonical in
the same degree as for t.
The derivation of Theorem 5 from Theorem 4 relies to a large extent on (elementary) results about twisted group algebras, which we put in Section 1. The bijection
from Theorem 5 is extensively used in Section 9, for Theorem 1.

1. Twisted group algebras and normal subgroups
Throughout this section Γ is a finite group and K is an algebraically closed field
whose characteristic does not divide the order of Γ. Suppose that ♮ : Γ × Γ → K ×
is a 2-cocycle, that is,
(1)

♮(γ1 , γ2 γ3 )♮(γ2 , γ3 ) = ♮(γ1 , γ2 )♮(γ1 γ2 , γ3 )

∀γ1 , γ2 , γ3 ∈ Γ.

The ♮-twisted group algebra of Γ is defined to be the K-vector space K[Γ, ♮] with
basis {Tγ : γ ∈ Γ} and multiplication rules
(2)

Tγ Tγ ′ = ♮(γ, γ ′ )Tγγ ′

γ, γ ′ ∈ Γ.

Its representations can be considered as projective Γ-representations. Schur showed
(see [CuRe, Theorem 53.7]) that there exists a finite central extension Γ̃ of Γ, such
that
• char(K) does not divide |Γ̃|,
• every irreducible projective Γ-representation over K lifts to an irreducible
K-linear representation of Γ̃.
Then K[Γ, ♮] is a direct summand of K[Γ̃], namely the image of a minimal idempotent
in K[ker(Γ̃ → Γ)]. The condition on char(K) ensures that K[Γ̃] is semisimple, so
K[Γ, ♮] is also semisimple.
Let N be a normal subgroup of Γ and (π, Vπ ) an irreducible representation of
N over K. We abbreviate this to π ∈ IrrK (N ). We want to analyse the set of
irreducible Γ-representations whose restriction to N contains π.
More generally, suppose that ♮ is a 2-cocycle of Γ/N . We identify it with a 2cocycle Γ × Γ → K × that factors through (Γ/N )2 . We also want to analyse the
irreducible representations of K[Γ, ♮] that contain π.
For γ ∈ Γ we define γ · π ∈ IrrK (N ) by
(3)

(γ · π)(n) = π(γ −1 nγ).

This determines an action of Γ and of Γ/N on Irr(N ). Let Γπ be the isotropy group
of π in Γ. For every γ ∈ Γπ we choose a I γ = Iπγ ∈ AutK (Vπ ) such that
(4)

I γ ◦ π(γ −1 nγ) = π(n) ◦ I γ

∀n ∈ N.

Thus I γ ∈ HomN (γ ·π, π). Given another γ ′ ∈ Γ, we can regard I γ also as an element
′
of HomN (γ ′ ·γ ·π, γ ′ ·π), and then it can be composed with I γ ∈ HomN (γ ′ ·π, π). By
Schur’s lemma all these maps are unique up to scalars, so there exists a κπ (γ, γ ′ ) ∈
K × with
(5)

′

′

I γγ = κπ (γ, γ ′ )I γ ◦ I γ .

On comparing this with (1), one sees that κπ : Γπ × Γπ → K × is a 2-cocycle. Notice
γ
that the algebra K[Γπ , κ−1
π ] acts on Vπ by Tγ 7→ I . Let [Γπ /N ] ⊂ Γπ be a set of
representatives for Γπ /N . We may pick the I γ such that
(6)

I γ̃n = I γ̃ ◦ π(n) ∀γ̃ ∈ [Γπ /N ], n ∈ N.

It follows from (4) that I nγ̃ = π(n) ◦ I γ̃ and that κπ factors as
κπ : Γπ × Γπ → Γπ /N × Γπ /N → K ×
Let ♮ : Γ/N × Γ/N → K × be a 2-cocycle. Thus we can construct the twisted group
algebras K[Γ, ♮] and K[Γπ /N, ♮κπ ]. To avoid confusion we denote the standard basis
elements of K[Γ, ♮] by Sγ .
Proposition 1.1. Let (τ, M ) be a representation of K[Γπ /N, ♮κπ ].
(a) The algebra K[Γπ , ♮] acts on M ⊗K Vπ by
Sγ (m ⊗ v) = τ (TγN )m ⊗ I γ (v)

h ∈ K[Γπ /N, ♮κπ ], v ∈ Vπ .

(b) The K-linear map
K[Γ ,♮]

T : indK[Nπ] (Vπ ) → K[Γπ /N, ♮κπ ] ⊗K Vπ
Sγ̃ ⊗ v
7→
Tγ̃N ⊗ I γ̃ (v)

γ̃ ∈ [Γ/N ]

is an isomorphism of K[Γπ , ♮]-representations.
K[Γ,♮]
(c) The map M 7→ indK[Γπ ,♮] (T −1 (M ⊗ Vπ )) is an equivalence between the following
categories:
• subrepresentations of the left regular representation of K[Γπ /N, ♮κπ ];
K[Γ,♮]
• K[Γ, ♮]-subrepresentations of indK[N ] (Vπ ).
K[Γ,♮]

(d) We write τ ⋉ π := indK[Γπ ] (M ⊗ Vπ ). For any representation V of K[Γ, ♮] there
is an isomorphism
HomK[Γ,♮](τ ⋉ π, V ) ∼
= HomK[Γ /N,♮κ ] (τ, HomN (π, V )).

Proof. (a) By (4) and (5)

= ♮(γ, γ ′ )τ (Tγγ ′ N )m ⊗ I γγ (v)
= ♮(γ, γ ′ )Sγγ ′ (m ⊗ v) = (Sγ Sγ ′ )(m ⊗ v).
(b) Since every I γ̃ : Vπ → Vπ is bijective, so is T . For any n ∈ N :
(7) T (Sn (Sγ̃ ⊗ v)) = T (Sγ̃ ⊗ π(γ̃ −1 nγ̃)v) = Tγ̃N ⊗ I γ̃ ◦ π(γ̃ −1 nγ̃)(v) =
Tγ̃N ⊗ π(n)I γ̃ (v) = Sn (Tγ̃N ⊗ I γ̃ (v)) = Sn (T (Sγ̃ ⊗ v)),
so T is N -equivariant. Let γ1 ∈ Γ and write γ1 γ̃ = nγ̃2 with n ∈ N and γ̃2 ∈ [Γ/N ].
By (7)
T (Sγ1 (Sγ̃ ⊗ v)) = T (♮(γ1 , γ̃)Sn Sγ̃2 ⊗ v) = ♮(γ1 , γ̃)Sn T (Sγ̃2 ⊗ v)
= ♮(γ1 , γ̃)Sn (Tγ̃2 N ⊗ I γ̃2 (v)) = ♮(γ1 , γ̃)Tγ̃2 N ⊗ π(n)I γ̃2 (v)
= ♮(γ1 , γ̃)Tnγ̃2 N ⊗ I nγ̃2 (v) = ♮(γ1 , γ̃)Tγ1 γ̃N ⊗ I γ1 γ̃ (v)
= κπ (γ1 , γ̃)−1 Tγ1 N Tγ̃N ⊗ κπ (γ1 , γ̃)I γ1 I γ̃ (v) = Tγ1 N Tγ̃N ⊗ I γ1 I γ̃ (v)
= Sγ1 (Tγ̃N ⊗ I γ̃ (v)) = Sγ1 (T (Sγ̃ ⊗ v)).

(c) See [Sol2, Theorem 11.2.b]. The proof over there applies because we already
have established parts (a) and (b).
(d) We already saw that all these algebras are semisimple. In particular V is comK[Γ,♮]
pletely reducible. Let V ′ be the π-isotypical component of ResK[N ] (V ). Every
K[Γ, ♮]-homomorphism from τ ⋉ π has image in K[Γ, ♮] · V ′ , so we may assume that
K[Γ,♮]
V = K[Γ, ♮] · V ′ . Then V can be embedded in a direct sum of copies of indK[N ] (Vπ ).

This result leads to a version of Clifford theory. We will formulate it in terms of
extended quotients, see [ABPS4, §2] or [ABPS5, Appendix B]. We briefly recall the
necessary definitions.
Suppose that Γ acts on some set X. Let κ be a given function which assigns to
each x ∈ X a 2-cocycle κx : Γx × Γx → C× , where Γx = {γ ∈ Γ : γx = x}. It is
assumed that κγx and γ∗ κx define the same class in H 2 (Γx , K × ), where γ∗ : Γx →
Γγx , α 7→ γαγ −1 . Define
eκ := {(x, ρ) : x ∈ X, ρ ∈ Irr K[Γx , κx ]}.
X

We require, for every (γ, x) ∈ Γ × X, a definite algebra isomorphism
(12)

φγ,x : K[Γx , κx ] → K[Γγx , κγx ]

such that:
• φγ,x is inner if γx = x;
• φγ ′ ,γx ◦ φγ,x = φγ ′ γ,x for all γ ′ , γ ∈ Γ, x ∈ X.
We call these maps connecting homomorphisms, because they are reminiscent of a
eκ by
connection on a vector bundle. Then we can define Γ-action on X
γ · (x, ρ) = (γx, ρ ◦ φ−1
γ,x ).

Let us return to the setting of Proposition 1.1.

Theorem 1.2. Let κ♮ be the family of 2-cocycles which assigns κπ ♮ to π ∈ IrrK (N ).
There is a bijection

Proof. With Proposition 1.1, [Sol2, Appendix] becomes valid in our situation. The
theorem is a reformulation of parts (d) and (e) of [Sol2, Theorem 11.2]. For completeness we note that the connecting homomorphism
K[Γπ /N, κπ ♮] → K[Γγ·π /N, κγ·π ♮]
is given by conjugation with Iπγ , as in [ABPS4, (3)].

It will also be useful to analyse the structure of K[Γ, ♮] as a bimodule over itself.
Let K[Γ, ♮]op be the opposite algebra, and denote its standard basis elements by
Sγ (γ ∈ Γ).

2. The generalized Springer correspondence
Let G be a connected complex reductive group. The generalized Springer correspondence for G has been constructed by Lusztig. We will recall the main result of
[Lus2], and then we prove that Lusztig’s constructions are equivariant with respect
to automorphisms of algebraic groups.
Let l be a fixed prime number, and let Qℓ be an algebraic closure of Qℓ . For
compatibility with the literature we phrase our results with Qℓ -coefficients. However,
by their algebro-geometric nature everything works just as well with coefficients in
any other algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.
For u a unipotent element in G, we denote by AG (u) the group of components
ZG (u)/ZG (u)◦ of the centralizer in G of u. We set
NG+ := {(u, η) : u ∈ G unipotent, η ∈ IrrQℓ (AG (u))}/G-conjugacy.
The set NG+ is canonically in bijection with the set of pairs (CuG , F), where CuG is
the G-conjugacy class of a unipotent element u ∈ G and F is an irreducible Gequivariant local system on CuG . The bijection associates to (CuG , F) an element
u ∈ CuG and the representation of AG (u) on the stalk Fu .
Let P be a parabolic subgroup of G with unipotent radical U , and let L be a Levi
factor of P . Let v be a unipotent element in L. The group ZG (u) × ZL (v)U acts on
the variety

	
(16)
Yu,v := y ∈ G : y −1 uy ∈ vU
by (g, p) · y = gyp−1 , with g ∈ ZG (u), p ∈ ZL (v)U , and y ∈ Yu,v . We have
dim Yu,v ≤ du,v :=

1
(dim ZG (u) + dim ZL (v)) + dim U.
2

The group AG (u) × AL (v) acts on the set of irreducible components of Yu,v of dimension du,v ; we denote by σu,v the corresponding permutation representation.
Let h , iAG (u) be the usual scalar product of the set of class functions on the finite
group AG (u) with values in Qℓ . An irreducible representation η of AG (u) is called
cuspidal (see [Lus2, Definition 2.4] and [LuSp, §0.4]) if
(17)

hη, σu,v iAG (u) 6= 0 implies that P = G.

The set of irreducible cuspidal representations of AG (u) (over Qℓ ) is denoted by
Irrcusp (AG (u)), and we write
NG0 = {(u, η) : u ∈ G unipotent, η ∈ Irrcusp (AG (u))}/G-conjugacy.
Given a pair (u, η) ∈ NG+ , there exists a triple (P, L, v) as above and an
ǫ ∈ Irrcusp (AL (v))

such that hη ⊗ ǫ∗ , σu,v iAG (u)×AL (v) 6= 0,

where ǫ∗ is the dual of ǫ (see [Lus2, § 6.2] and [LuSp, §0.4]). Moreover (P, L, v, ǫ)
is unique up to G-conjugation (see [Lus2, Prop. 6.3] and [LuSp]). We denote by
t := [L, CvL , ǫ]G the G-conjugacy class of (L, v, ǫ) and we call it the cuspidal support
of the pair (u, η). The centre Z(G) maps naturally to AG (u) and to AL (v). By
construction [Lus2, Theorem 6.5.a]
(18)

η and ǫ have the same Z(G)-character.

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
11

Let SG denote the set consisting of all triples (L, CvL , ǫ) (up to G-conjugacy) where
L is a Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup of G, CvL is the L-conjugacy class of a
unipotent element v in L and ǫ ∈ Irrcusp (AL (v)). Let
ΨG : NG+ → SG

(19)

be the map defined by sending the G-conjugacy class of (u, η) to its cuspidal support.
By (18) this map preserves the Z(G)-characters of the involved representations.
In [Lus2, 3.1], Lusztig defined a partition of G in a finite number of irreducible,
smooth, locally closed subvarieties, stable under conjugation. For all g ∈ G, we
denote by gs the semisimple part of g. We say that g ∈ G (or its conjugacy class) is
isolated if ZG (gs )◦ is not contained in any proper Levi subgroup of G. After [Lus2,
2.7], if t = [L, CvL , E] ∈ SG , then CvL is isolated in L.
Let L be a Levi subgroup of G and S ⊂ L the inverse image of an isolated
conjugacy class of L/ZL◦ by the natural projection map L ։ L/ZL◦ . Denote by
Sreg = {g ∈ S, ZG (gs )◦ ⊂ L}
the set of regular elements in S. Consider the irreducible, smooth, locally closed
subvariety of G defined by
[
[
Y(L,S) =
gSreg g−1 =
CxG .
g∈G

x∈Sreg

We remark that Y(L,S) depends only on the G-conjugacy class of (L, S).
Now, let P = LUP a parabolic subgroup of G with Levi factor L, denote c =
(P, L, S), c = (L, S) and let
bc = {(g, x) ∈ G × G, x−1 gx ∈ S · UP },
X

Xc = {(g, xP ) ∈ G × G/P, x−1 gx ∈ S · UP },
where S is the closure of S. The subgroup P acts freely by translation on right on
bc /P = Xc . After [Lus2, 4.3], the
bc and X
the second coordinate of an element of X
projection on the first coordinate φc : Xc −→ G is proper and its image is Y c .
The group ZL◦ acts on S by translation and L acts on S by conjugation. This gives
rises to an action of ZL◦ × L on S. The orbits form a stratification of S, in which S
bc −→ S the map which associates to
is the unique open stratum. Denote by σc : X
−1
bc −→ Xc the map
(g, x) the projection of x gx ∈ S · UP on the factor S and ̟P : X
b
defined for all (g, x) ∈ Xc by ̟P (g, x) = (g, xP ). To sum up, we have the following

where DYc (resp. DG Yc ) is the bounded derived category of Qℓ -constructible sheaves

of) simple AE -modules and Qℓ the constant sheaf.
Let Kc = IC(Xc , E) the intersection cohomology complex of Deligne–Goresky–
MacPherson on Xc , with coefficients in E. Then (φc )! Kc is a complex on Y c .
Theorem 2.1. [Lus2, Theorem 6.5]
Let t = [L, CvL , E] ∈ SG , (S, E) = (ZL◦ · CvL , Qℓ ⊠ E) the corresponding cuspidal pair
for L and P a parabolic subgroup of G with Levi factor L. As before, we denote by
c = (P, L, S), c = (L, S) and (φc )! Kc the corresponding complex on Y c .
(1) Let (CuG , F) ∈ NG+ . Then ΨG (CuG , F) = (L, CvL , E), if and only if the following

(b) F is a direct summand of R CuG ,CvL (fc )! (E) CuG , where fc is the restriction
of φc to Xc,α ⊂ Xc , dCuG ,CvL = (νG − 21 dim CuG ) − (νL − 12 dim CvL ), and
νG (resp. νL ) is the number of positive roots of G (resp. de L).

Let Y c,un be the variety of unipotent elements in Y c . There exists an unique

(a) CuG ⊂ Y c ;
(b) ((φc )! Kc )ρ Y c,un is isomorphic to IC(CuG , F)[2dCuG ,CvL ] extended by 0 on

The relation of Theorem 2.1 with the classical Springer correspondence goes via
AE , which turns out to be isomorphic to the group algebra of a Weyl group. We
define
(20)

Wt := NG (t)/L = NG (L, CvL , E)/L.

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
13

Theorem 2.2. [Lus2, Theorem 9.2]
(a) Wt = NG (L)/L.
(b) NG (L)/L is the Weyl group of the root system R(G, Z(L)◦ ).
(c) There exists a canonical algebra isomorphism AE ∼
= Qℓ [Wt ]. Together with The−1
orem 2.1.(3) this gives a canonical bijection ΨG (t) → IrrQℓ (Wt ).
In fact there exist two such canonical algebra isomorphisms, for one can always
twist with the sign representation of Wt . When we employ generalized Springer
correspondences in relation with the local Langlands correspondence, we will always
use the isomorphism AE ∼
= Qℓ [Wt ] such that the trivial Wt -representation is the
image of (CuG , E) under Theorem 2.2. (Here we extend E G-equivariantly to CuG ,
compare with [Lus2, 9.5].)
Let H be a group which acts on the connected complex reductive group G by
algebraic automorphisms. Then H acts also on NG+ and SG . Indeed, let h ∈ H,
G
(CuG , F) ∈ NG+ , t = [L, CvL , E]G ∈ SG and ρ ∈ Irr(Wt ). Since h(G) = G, h CuG = Ch·u
is a unipotent orbit of G. Similarly, h L is a Levi subgroup of G, h CvL is a unipotent
orbit of h L, etc.
We denote by h∗ the pullback of sheaves along the isomorphism h−1 : G → G.

and

Σh·t (h · (CuG , F)) = h · Σt (CuG , F).

Proof. We keep the notations of Theorem 2.1. Let h ∈ H, (CuG , F) ∈ NG+ , P a
parabolic subgroup of G with Levi factor L, v ∈ L a unipotent element and E an
irreducible cuspidal L-equivariant local system on CvL such that
ΨG (CuG , F) = [L, CvL , E] ∈ SG .

3. Disconnected groups: the cuspidal case
First we recall Lusztig’s classification of unipotent cuspidal pairs for a connected
reductive group.
Theorem 3.1. (Lusztig)
Let G◦ be a connected complex reductive group and write Z = Z(G◦ )/Z(G◦ )◦ .
×

(a) Fix an Aut(G◦ )-orbit X of characters Z → Qℓ . There is at most one unipotent
◦
conjugacy class CuG which carries a cuspidal local system on which Z acts as an
◦
element of X. Moreover CuG is Aut(G◦ )-stable.

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
15
◦

(b) Every cuspidal local system E on CuG is uniquely determined by the character by
which Z acts on it.
(c) The dimension of the cuspidal representation Eu of AG◦ (u) is a power of two
(possibly 20 = 1). It is one if G◦ contains no factors which are isomorphic to
spin or half-spin groups.
Proof. In [Lus2, §2.10] it is explained how the classification can be reduced to simply
connected, almost simple groups. Namely, first one notes that dividing out Z(G◦ )◦
does not make an essential difference. Next everything is lifted to the simply connected cover G̃ of the semisimple group G◦ /Z(G◦ )◦ . Since every automorphism of
G◦ /Z(G◦ )◦ can be lifted to one of G̃, the canonical image of X is contained in a
unique Aut(G̃)-orbit X̃ on IrrQℓ (Z̃), where Z̃ is the Z for G̃. Furthermore G̃ is a
direct product of almost simple, simply connected groups, and X̃ decomposes as an
analogous product. Therefore it suffices to establish the theorem for simple, simply
connected groups Gsc .
(a) and (b) are shown in the case-by-case calculations in [Lus2, §10 and §14–15].
But (a) is not made explicit there, so let us comment on it. There are only few
cases in which one really needs an Aut(Gsc )-orbit Xsc in IrrQℓ (Z(Gsc )). Namely,
only the spin groups SpinN (C) where N > 1 is simultaneously a square and a
triangular number. These groups have precisely two unipotent conjugacy classes
that carry a cuspidal local system. One class, say C+ , supports precise the cuspidal
local systems which factor through SON (C), and the other, say C− , supports the
remaining cuspidal local systems.
Let {1, −1} be the kernel of SpinN (C) → SON (C), a characteristic subgroup of
SpinN (C). Lusztig’s classification shows that −1 acts as ǫ on every cuspidal local
system supported on Cǫ . As −1 is fixed by Aut(Gsc ), Xsc determines a unique
character of {1, −1} and thus specifies C+ or C− .
This proves the first part of (a). For the second part, we notice that every algebraic
automorphism of G◦ maps a cuspidal local system on a unipotent conjugacy class
in G◦ with Z-character in X to another such local system.
(c) is obvious in types An , Cn and E6 , for then AGsc (u) is abelian. For the root
systems E8 , F4 and G2 , AGsc (u) is a symmetric group and Eu is the sign representation [Lus2, §15]. In type E7 [Miz, Table 9] shows that AGsc (u) ∼
= S3 × S2 . According
to [Lus2, §15.6], (E)u again has dimension one (it is the tensor product of the sign
representations of S3 and S2 ).
In types Bn and Dn , Gsc = SpinN (C) is a spin group. All the cuspidal local systems E for which the action of Z(Gsc ) factors through Z(SON (C)) are onedimensional, for ASON (C) (u) is abelian. If the character by which Z(Gsc ) acts on
E is not of this kind, then [Lus2, Proposition 14.4] says that dim(Eu ) is a power
of two. In that case the original G◦ has an almost direct factor isomorphic to
SpinN (C) or to a half-spin group HSpinN (C) = SpinN (C)/{1, ω} (here N ∈ 4N and
ω ∈ Z(SpinN (C)) \ {1, −1}).

Let G be a disconnected complex reductive group with neutral component G◦ .
We want to classify unipotent cuspidal pairs for G in terms of those for G◦ .
First we define them properly. For u ∈ G◦ we call an irreducible representation
of AG (u) cuspidal if its restriction to AG◦ (u) is a direct sum of irreducible cuspidal
AG◦ (u)-representations. The set of irreducible cuspidal representations of AG (u)

16

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

(over Qℓ ) is denoted by Irrcusp (AG (u)). We write
NG0 = {(u, η) : u ∈ G unipotent, η ∈ Irrcusp (AG (u))}/G-conjugacy.
Notice that the unipotency forces u ∈ G◦ . Every (u, η) ∈ NG0 gives rise to a unique
G-equivariant local system F on CuG . We call any G-equivariant local system on CuG
cuspidal if and only if it arises in this way. Thus we may identify NG0 with the set
of pairs (CuG , F) where CuG is a unipotent conjugacy class in G and F is a cuspidal
local system on it. For example, if G◦ is a torus, then u = 1 and every irreducible
representation of AG (u) = G/G◦ is cuspidal.
It follows from (15) that there is a bijection


Irrcusp (AG (u)) ←→ Irrcusp (AG◦ (u))//AG (u)/AG◦ (u) .
κ

So we want to identify the 2-cocycles κǫ for ǫ ∈ Irrcusp (AG◦ (u)).
We note that there are natural isomorphisms
AG (u)/AG◦ (u) ← ZG (u)/ZG◦ (u) → G/G◦ .

(21)

◦

In fact Theorem 3.1.a implies that CuG = CuG , which accounts for the surjectivity of
the map to the right.
Recall from [ABPS4, Lemma 4.2] that the short exact sequence
1 → π0 (ZG◦ (u)/Z(G◦ )) → π0 (ZG (u)/Z(G◦ )) → G/G◦ → 1

(22)

is split. However, the short exact sequence
1 → π0 (ZG◦ (u)/Z(G◦ )◦ ) → π0 (ZG (u)/Z(G◦ )◦ ) → G/G◦ → 1

(23)

need not be split. We choose a map
s : G/G◦ → ZG (u)

(24)

such that the induced map G/G◦ → π0 (ZG (u)/Z(G◦ )) is a group homomorphism
that splits (22). The proof of [ABPS4, Lemma 4.2] shows that we can take s(gG◦ )
in ZG (G◦ ) whenever the conjugation action of g on G◦ is an inner automorphism of
G◦ . For all γ, γ ′ ∈ G/G◦
s(γ)s(γ ′ )s(γγ ′ )−1 ∈ Z(G◦ )ZG◦ (u)◦ ,
because it represents the neutral element of π0 (ZG (u)/Z(G◦ )).
◦
Let (CuG , E) ∈ NG0 ◦ . The group ZG◦ (u)◦ acts trivially on ǫ = (E)u and by cuspidality Z(G◦ ) ⊂ Z(L) acts according to a character. Therefore

(25)
♮E (γ, γ ′ ) := ǫ s(γ)s(γ ′ )s(γγ ′ )−1
×

lies in Qℓ . Comparing with (1), one checks easily that
(26)

♮E : G/G◦ × G/G◦ → Qℓ

×
×

is a 2-cocycle. It depends on the choice of s, but its class in H 2 (G/G◦ , Qℓ ) does
not. Another element u′ ∈ CuG would give the same cocycle: just conjugate s with
a g ∈ G◦ such that gug−1 = u′ and use the same formulas. Thus the cohomology
class of ♮E depends only on E. Via the isomorphism (21) we also get a 2-cocycle
×

♮E : AG (u)/AG◦ (u) × AG (u)/AG◦ (u) → Qℓ .
It will turn out that the 2-cocycles ♮E are trivial in many cases, in particular whenever
Z(G◦ ) acts trivially on E. But sometimes their cohomology class is nontrivial.

The twisted group algebra Qℓ [G/G◦ , ♮E ] is isomorphic with M2 (Qℓ ). In particular
it has precisely one irreducible representation. This agrees with the number of
representations of AG (u) that we want to obtain. Notice that, without the twisting,
Qℓ [G/G◦ ] would have four inequivalent irreducible representations, too many for
this situation.
We return to our general setup. Let GE be the subgroup of G that stabilizes E
(up to isomorphism). It contains G◦ and by Theorem 3.1.b it coincides with the
stabilizer of the Z(G◦ )-character of E. By (21) there are group isomorphisms

as 2-cocycles of
Lemma 3.3. Let (u, ǫ) ∈ NG0 ◦ . Then we can take κǫ = ♮−1
E
AG (u)ǫ /AG◦ (u).
Proof. With (28) we translate the lemma to a statement about cocycles of
ZG (u)ǫ /ZG◦ (u). For g ∈ ZG (u)ǫ we have to find Iǫg : Vǫ → Vǫ such that
(29)

Iǫg ◦ ǫ(h) ◦ (Iǫg )−1 = ǫ(ghg −1 )

∀h ∈ ZG◦ (u).
s(γ)
Iǫ

Since ZG (u) = s(G/G◦ )ZG◦ (u), it suffices to find
for γ ∈ GE /G◦ . Namely, then
s(γ)h
s(γ)
we can put Iǫ
= Iǫ ◦ ǫ(h) for h ∈ ZG◦ (u), as in (6).
◦
Let us consider (CuG , E) as a cuspidal local system for the simply connected cover
Gsc of G◦ /Z(G◦ )◦ . The action of G on G◦ by conjugation lifts to an action on
s(γ)
Gsc and Z(G◦ )◦ acts trivially on ǫ. Hence it suffices to construct Iǫ
for ǫ as a
representation of AGsc (u).
Then (AGsc (u), ǫ) decomposes as a direct product over almost simple factors of
Gsc . Factors with different cuspidal local systems have no interaction, so we may

18

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

assume that Gsc = H n , ǫ = σ ⊗n with H simply connected and almost simple. The
conjugation action of G on H n is a combination of permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} and
automorphisms of H. If g ∈ G permutes the factors of H n according to τ ∈ Sn ,
then we can construct Iσg⊗n as the permutation τ of Vσ⊗n , combined with some
automorphisms of the vector space Vσ . In this way we reduce to the case where Gsc
is almost simple.
Whenever ǫ is one-dimensional, we simply put
(30)

Iǫγ = Iǫg = IdVǫ

for g = s(γ) ∈ s(GE /G◦ ).

To deal with the remaining cases, we recall from Theorem 3.1.c that in all those
instances Gsc = SpinN (C) is a spin group and that the action of Z(Gsc ) on E does
not factor through Z(SON (C)).
Suppose first that N ≥ 3 is odd. Then Gsc is of type B(N −1)/2 and all its automorphisms are inner. As explained after (24), we can take s(GE /G◦ ) in ZGE (G◦ ).
Thus (29) can be fulfilled by defining Iǫg = IdVǫ .
Next we suppose that N is even, so Gsc is of type DN/2 . By [Lus2, Proposition
14.6] N = j(j + 1)/2 for some j ≥ 2, and in particular Gsc is not isomorphic to the
group Spin8 (C) of type D4 . Let us write Z(Gsc ) = {1, −1, ω, −ω}, where

{1, −1} = ker SpinN (C) → SON (C) .

Our assumptions entail that ǫ(−1) 6= 1. For both characters of Z(Gsc ) with ǫ(−1) =
−1 there is exactly one cuspidal pair (CuGsc , E) on which Z(Gsc ) acts in this way
[Lus2, Proposition 14.6]. The group of outer automorphisms of Gsc has precisely
two elements. It interchanges ω and −ω, and hence it interchanges the two cuspidal pairs in question. Therefore the conjugation action of GE on Gsc is by inner
automorphisms of Gsc . Now the same argument as in the N odd case shows that
we may take Iǫg = IdVǫ .
Thus (30) works in all cases under consideration. The defining property of s
entails that
(31)

′

′

Iǫγ ◦ Iǫγ = ♮E (γ, γ ′ )Iǫγγ .

Together (28) this shows that the lemma holds when Gsc is almost simple. In view
of our earlier reduction steps, that implies the general case.

Let Y ⊂ G◦ be the set of regular elements of CuG Z(G◦ )◦ , that is, the set of
y ∈ CuG Z(G◦ )◦ with dim ZG (y) = dim ZG (u). Tensoring E with the constant sheaf
on Z(G◦ )◦ , we obtain a G◦ -equivariant cuspidal local system on Y . We also denote
that by E.
Next we build a G-equivariant local system on Y which contains every extension
of ǫ to an irreducible representation of AG (u). The construction is the same as in
[Lus2, §3.2], only for a disconnected group. Via the map
Y × G → Y : (y, g) 7→ g −1 yg
we pull E back to a local system Eˆ on Y × G. It is G × G◦ -equivariant for the action

The G◦ action is free, so we can divide it out and obtain a G-equivariant local
system Ẽ on Y × G/G◦ such that its pull back under the natural quotient map
is isomorphic to Ê, see [BeLu, 2.6.3]. Let π : Y × G/G◦ → Y be the projection
on the first coordinate. It is a G-equivariant fibration, so the direct image π∗ E˜ is

In other words, we can consider π∗ Ẽ as the induction of (E)Y from G◦ to G.
Lemma 3.4. The G-endomorphism algebra of π∗ Ẽ is isomorphic with Qℓ [GE /G◦ , ♮E ].
Once ♮E has been chosen, the isomorphism is canonical up to twisting by characters
of GE /G◦ .
Proof. By [Lus2, Proposition 3.5], which applies also in the disconnected case,
EndG (π∗ Ẽ) is canonically a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces Aγ with γ ∈
GE /G◦ . We need to specify one element in each of these subspaces to obtain a
twisted group algebra. Recall the isomorphisms (28) and the map s from (24). For
g = s(γ) ∈ s(GE /G◦ ) we define
Iǫγ = Iǫg : (E)u → (E)u
as in the proof of Lemma 3.3. We already saw in (31) that the Iǫγ span an algebra
isomorphic to Qℓ [GE /G◦ , ♮E ]. Each Iǫγ extends uniquely to an isomorphism of Gequivariant local systems
(35)

IEγ : (E)Y → Ad(γ)∗ (E)Y .

We can consider this as a family of Qℓ -linear maps

IEγ : (E)
ˆ of Ẽ and of π∗ E.
˜ The latter
Consequently the IEγ induce automorphisms of E,
automorphism belongs to Aγ and we take it as element of the required basis of
EndG (π∗ Ẽ).
Any other choice of an isomorphism as in the lemma would differ from the first
one by an automorphism of Qℓ [GE /G◦ , ♮E ] which stabilizes each of the subspaces
Qℓ Tγ . Every such automorphism is induced by a character of GE /G◦ .

We note that the isomorphism in Lemma 3.4 is in general not canonical, because
s and the constructions in the proof of Lemma 3.3 are not. In the final result of this
section, we complete the classification of unipotent cuspidal local systems on G.

this way, for a unique ρ ∈ Irr(EndG (π∗ E)).

4. Disconnected groups: the non-cuspidal case
We would like to extend the generalized Springer correspondence for G◦ to G.
First we define the source and target properly.
Definition 4.1. For NG+ we use exactly the same definition as in the connected
case:
NG+ = {(u, η) : u ∈ G unipotent , η ∈ IrrQℓ (AG (u))}/G-conjugacy.
As SG we take the same set as for G◦ , but now considered up to G-conjugacy:
SG = {unipotent cuspidal supports for G◦ }/G-conjugacy.
For t = [L, CvL , E]G ∈ SG , let NG (t) be the stabilizer of (L, CvL , E) in G. We define
Wt as the component group of NG (t).
In the above notations, the group L stabilizes (L, CvL , E) and any element of G
which stabilizes (L, CvL , E) must normalize L. Hence L is the neutral component of
NG (t) and Wt = NG (t)/L is a subgroup of W (G, L) = NG (L)/L.
As in the connected case, NG+ is canonically in bijection with the set of pairs
(CuG , F), where CuG is the G-conjugacy class of a unipotent element u and F is an
irreducible G-equivariant local system on CuG .
We define a map ΨG : NG+ → SG in the following way. Let (u, η) ∈ NG+ . With
Theorem 1.2 we can write η = η ◦ ⋊τ with η ◦ ∈ Irr(AG◦ (u)). Moreover η ◦ is uniquely
determined by η up to AG (u)-conjugacy. Then (u, η ◦ ) ∈ NG+◦ . Using (19) we put
(38)

ΨG (u, η) := ΨG◦ (u, η ◦ )/G-conjugacy

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
21

By the G-equivariance of ΨG◦ (Theorem 2.3), ΨG (u, η) does not depend on the
choice of η ◦ . Write
t◦ = [L, CvL , E]G◦
and consider Σt◦ (u, η ◦ ) ∈ Irr(Wt◦ ). Just as in (38), (L, CvL , E, Σt◦ (u, η ◦ )) is uniquely
determined by (u, η), up to G-conjugacy.
We would like to define Σt such that Σt (u, η) is a representation of Wt whose
restriction to Wt◦ contains Σt◦ (u, η ◦ ). However, in general this does not work. It
turns out that we have to twist the group algebra Qℓ [Wt ] with a certain 2-cocycle,
which is trivial on Wt◦ . In fact we have already seen this in Section 3. Over there
L = G◦ , Wt◦ = 1, Wt = GE /G◦ and in Example 3.2 the group algebra of Wt had to
be twisted by a nontrivial 2-cocycle.
This twisting by nontrivial cocycles is only caused by the relation between irreducible representations of AG◦ (u) and AG (u). The next two results show that the
group Wt , considered on its own, would not need such twisting.
Lemma 4.2. There exists a subgroup Rt ⊂ Wt such that Wt = Rt ⋉ Wt◦ .
Proof. Thanks to Theorem 2.2, we know that Wt◦ equals W (G◦ , L) = NG◦ (L)/L. On
the other hand, Wt ⊂ W (G, L) acts on the root system R(G◦ , Z(L)◦ ). Fix a positive
subsystem and let Rt be its stabilizer in Wt . Since W (G◦ , L) is the Weyl group of
the root system R(G◦ , Z(L)◦ ) (see Theorem 2.2), it acts simply transitively on the
collection of positive systems in R(G◦ , Z(L)◦ ). As W (G◦ , L) is normal in W (G, L),
we obtain the decomposition of Wt as a semidirect product.

Proposition 4.3. Let π ∈ IrrQℓ (Wt◦ ). The cohomology class of κπ in
×

H 2 (Wt,π /Wt◦ , Qℓ ) is trivial.
Proof. This is the statement of [ABPS4, Proposition 4.3], which is applicable by
Lemma 4.2.

Let NG+ (t) be the inverse image of Rt in NG (t) ⊂ NG (L). Then L = NG+ (t)◦ and
Rt ∼
= NG+ (t)/NG+ (t)◦ . Thus (CvL , E) can be considered as a cuspidal pair for NG+ (t)◦ .
×
In (31) we constructed a 2-cocycle ♮E : Rt × Rt → Qℓ . With Lemma 4.2 we can
also consider it as a 2-cocycle of Wt , trivial on Wt◦ :
(39)

×

♮E : Wt /Wt◦ × Wt /Wt◦ → Qℓ .
◦

Lemma 4.4. Let F ◦ be the G◦ -equivariant local system on CuG corresponding to
η ◦ ∈ IrrQℓ (AG◦ (u)). There are natural isomorphisms
Wt,Σt◦ (u,η◦ ) /W (G◦ , L) → G(CuG◦ ,F ◦ ) /G◦ ← ZG (u)η◦ /ZG◦ (u) → AG (u)η◦ /AG◦ (u).
Proof. There is a natural injection
(40)
Wt /W (G◦ , L) ∼
= NG (L, C L , E)/NG◦ (L) → G/G◦ .

By Theorem 2.3 an element of Wt
stabilizes Σt◦ (u, η ◦ ) = Σt◦ (CuG , F ◦ ) if
◦
◦
G
and only if its image in G/G stabilizes (Cu , F ◦ ). The second isomorphism is a
direct consequence of the relation between F ◦ and η ◦ .

With this lemma we transfer (39) to a 2-cocycle
(41)

♮E : AG (u)η◦ /AG◦ (u) × AG (u)η◦ /AG◦ (u) → Qℓ .

22

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

Our construction of Σt will generalize that of Σt◦ in [Lus2], in particular we use
similar equivariant local systems. Recall that (L, CvL , E) is a cuspidal support. As
in [Lus2, §3.1] we put S = CvL Z(L)◦ and we extend E to a local system on S. We
say that an element y ∈ S is regular if its centralizer in G has minimal dimension,
that is, dim ZG (y) = dim ZG (v). Consider the variety Y = Y(L,S) which is the union
of all conjugacy classes in G that meet the set of regular elements Sreg . We build
equivariant local systems Eˆ on
Ŷ := {(y, g) ∈ Y × G : g −1 yg ∈ Sreg }
and Ẽ on Ỹ := Ŷ /L as in (32) and (33), only with L instead of G◦ . The projection
map Ỹ → Y : (y, g) 7→ y is a fibration with fibre NG (L)/L, so
π : Ỹ → Y gives a G-equivariant local system π∗ Ẽ on Y.
The stalk of π∗ E˜ at y ∈ Sreg is isomorphic, as ZL (y)-representation, to

On the part Y ◦ of Y that is G◦ -conjugate to Sreg , π∗ Ẽ can also be considered as a
˜ Y ◦ contains the analogous local system
G◦ -equivariant local system. As such (π∗ E)
◦
◦
π∗ Ẽ for G as a direct summand.
The following result generalizes Lemma 3.4.
Proposition 4.5. The G-endomorphism algebra of π∗ Ẽ is isomorphic with Qℓ [Wt , ♮E ].
Once ♮E has been chosen via (25), the isomorphism is canonical up to twisting by
characters of Wt /Wt◦ .
Proof. First we note that the results and proofs of [Lus2, §3] are also valid for the
disconnected group G. By [Lus2, Proposition 3.5] EndQℓ (π∗ Ẽ) = EndG (π∗ Ẽ), and
according to [Lus2, Remark 3.6] it is a twisted group algebra of Wt . It remains to
determine the 2-cocycle. Again by [Lus2, Proposition 3.5], EndG (π∗ Ẽ) is naturally a
direct sum of one-dimensional Qℓ -vector spaces AE,w (w ∈ Wt ). An element of AE,w
consists of a system of Qℓ -linear maps
(44)
E˜y,g = Eg−1 yg → Ẽy,gw−1 = Ewg−1 ygw−1
and is determined by a single L-intertwining map E → Ad(w)∗ E.
For w ∈ Wt◦ any element bw ∈ AE,w also acts on π∗ Ẽ ◦ . In [Lus2, Theorem 9.2.d]
a canonical isomorphism
∼ Qℓ [Wt◦ ],
(45)
EndG◦ (π∗ Ẽ ◦ ) =
was constructed. Via this isomorphism we pick the bw (w ∈ Wt◦ ), then
˜
(46)
w 7→ bw is a group homomorphism Wt◦ → AutG (π∗ E).
In view of Lemma 4.2, we still to have find suitable bγ ∈ AE,γ for γ ∈ Rt . Let
nγ ∈ NG+ (t) be a lift of γ ∈ NG+ (t)/L. By [Lus2, §3.4-3.5] the choice of bγ is
equivalent to the choice of an automorphism IEγ of (E)S that lifts the map
S → S : g 7→ nγ gn−1
γ .
Precisely such an automorphism was constructed (with the group NG+ (t) in the role
of G) in (35). We pick the unique bγ ∈ AE,γ corresponding to this IEγ . Then the

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
23

multiplication rules for the bγ are analogous to those for the IEγ , so by Lemma 3.4
we get
bγ · bγ ′ = ♮E (γ, γ ′ )bγγ ′

(47)

γ, γ ′ ∈ Rt .

Using Lemma 4.2 we define bγw = bγ bw for γ ∈ Rt , w ∈ Wt◦ . Now (46) and (47)
imply that bw · bw′ = ♮E (w, w′ )bww′ for all w, w′ ∈ Wt .
The only noncanonical part in the construction of the above isomorphism is the
choice of the bγ ∈ AE,γ with γ ∈ Rt . Any other choice would differ from the above by
an automorphism of Qℓ [Rt , ♮E ] which stabilizes each of the onedimensional subspaces
AE,w . Every such automorphism is induced by a character of Rt ∼

= Wt /Wt◦ .
Let (u, η ◦ ) ∈ NG+◦ . Recall the cocycle κη◦ of AG (u)η◦ /AG◦ (u) constructed from
η ◦ ∈ Irr(AG◦ (u)) in (5). Like ♮E it depends on some choices, but its cohomology
class does not.
Lemma 4.6. We can choose κη◦ equal to ♮−1
E from (41).
Proof. Let s : GCuG◦ /G◦ → ZG (u) be as in (24). As a G◦ -equivariant local system

The maps ΨG and Σt are compatible with restriction to Levi subgroups, in the
following sense. Let H ⊂ G be an algebraic subgroup such that H ∩ G◦ is a Levi
subgroup of G◦ . Suppose that u ∈ H ◦ is unipotent. By [Ree1, §3.2]
(60)

ZG (u)◦ ∩ H = ZG◦ (u)◦ ∩ H

equals

ZH ◦ (u)◦ = ZH (u)◦ .

Hence the natural map AH (u) → AG (u) is injective and we can regard AH (u) as a
H
subgroup of AG (u). Let π∗H Ef
H be the H-equivariant local system on Cu constructed
H
like π∗ Ẽ but for the group H. By Proposition 4.5 EndH (π∗ Ef

5. A version with quasi-Levi subgroups
For applications to Langlands parameters we need a version of the generalized
Springer correspondence which involves a disconnected version of Levi subgroups.
Recall that every Levi subgroup L of G◦ is of the form L = ZG◦ (Z(L)◦ ).
Definition 5.1. Let G be a possibly disconnected complex reductive algebraic
group, and let L ⊂ G◦ be a Levi subgroup. Then we call ZG (Z(L)◦ ) a quasi-Levi
subgroup of G.
Notice that ZG (Z(L)◦ ) also has neutral component L and connected centre Z(L)◦ .
Hence there is canonical bijection between Levi subgroups and quasi-Levi subgroups
of G. We will also need some variations on other previous notions.
Definition 5.2. A unipotent cuspidal quasi-support for G is a triple (M, v, qǫ) where
M ⊂ G is a quasi-Levi subgroup, v ∈ M ◦ is unipotent and qǫ ∈ Irrcusp (AM (v)). We
write
qSG = {cuspidal unipotent quasi-supports for G}/G-conjugacy.
Like before, we will also think of unipotent cuspidal quasi-supports as triples
(M, CvM , qE), where qE is a cuspidal local system on CvM . We want to define a
canonical map
qΨG : NG+ → qSG ,
and to analyse its fibers. Of course this map should just be ΨG if G is connected.
◦
Let t = [M ◦ , CvM , E]G and suppose that (u, η) ∈ NG+ with ΨG (u, η) = t. Obviously, the cuspidal quasi-support of (u, η) will involve the quasi-Levi subgroup
M = ZG (Z(M ◦ )◦ ). From Theorem 4.7 we get
˜
ρ = Σt (u, η) ∈ Irr(EndG (π∗ E)).
M
Let π∗M Ef
M be the M -equivariant local system on Cv built from E in the same way
as π∗ Ẽ, only with M instead of G. From Proposition 4.5 we see that EndG (π∗ Ẽ)
naturally contains a subalgebra

by (u, η), up to G-conjugacy. Thus we can canonically define

qΨG (u, η) = [M, CvM , qE]G .

It follows that the characterization of ΨG given in [Lus2, Theorem 6.5] remains valid
for qΨG . In particular F and qE have the same Z(G)-character and
(67)

qΨG preserves Z(G)-characters.

We abbreviate

qt = [M, CvM , qE]G .
Let NG (qt) be the stabilizer of (M, CvM , qE) in G. It normalizes M and contains M ,
because (qE)v ∈ Irr(AM (v)). Every element of NG (qt) maps E to a M -associate local
◦
system on CvM , because qE is a M -equivariant local system which, as M ◦ -equivariant
sheaf, contains E. Hence NG (qt) = NG (t, qE)M .
Analogous to Wt = NG (t)/M ◦ , we define
(68)

Wqt = NG (qt)/M.

There are natural isomorphisms
(69)
Wqt ∼
= NG (t, qE)M/M ∼
= NG (t, qE)/ME ∼
= StabWt (qE)/(ME /M ◦ ).
The group Wt◦ = NG◦ (M ◦ )/M ◦ is isomorphic to NG◦ (t◦ )M/M , and there is a
natural injection
(70)
Wt◦ ∼
= NG◦ (t)M/M → Wqt .
Lemma 5.3. There exists a 2-cocycle κqt of Wqt such that:
(a) there is a bijection

(b) κqt factors through Wqt /Wt◦ and Qℓ [Wt◦ ] is canonically embedded in Qℓ [Wqt , κqt ].

Proof. (a) Recall the bijection Ψ−1
G (t) → Irr Qℓ [Wt , ♮E ] from Theorem 4.7. With

Under the bijections from Theorem 4.7 and (74), the set

the right hand side of (74) to the corresponding ordinary quotient). By the definition

of extended quotients, this fiber is in bijection with Irr Qℓ [Wt,ρM /(ME /M ◦ ), κρM ] .
By the equivariance of the Springer correspondence, the stabilizer of ΣtM (CvM , qE) =
ρM in Wt /(ME /M ◦ ) is StabWt (qE)/(ME /M ◦ ), which by (69) is isomorphic with Wqt .
Thus the composition of Theorem 4.7 and (74) provides the required bijection, with

Hence Wt◦ stabilizes ρM and

Wt,ρM /(ME /M ◦ ).

It also follows from (75) that we can take IρwM = IdVρM . In view of Proposition
1.1.a, the 2-cocycle κρM on Wt◦ agrees with ♮E |Wt◦ = 1. Via (70) we consider Wt◦
as a subgroup of Wqt . Then the subalgebra of Qℓ [Wqt , κqt ] spanned by the Tw with
w ∈ Wt◦ is simply Qℓ [Wt◦ ].

We will make the bijection of Lemma 5.3.a canonical, by replacing Qℓ [Wqt , κqt ]
with the endomorphism algebra of the equivariant local system (65).
Lemma 5.4. Let κqt be as in Lemma 5.3. There is an isomorphism

f ∼
EndG π∗ (qE)

and it is canonical up to automorphisms of the right hand side which come from characters of Wqt /Wt◦ . Under this isomorphism Qℓ [Wt◦ ] to corresponds to EndG◦ (π∗ Ẽ),
f via (65).
which acts on π∗ (qE)

Proof. Like Proposition 4.5, the larger part of this result follows from [Lus2, §3].
The constructions over there apply equally well to quasi-Levi subgroups of the possibly disconnected group G. These arguments show that, as a Qℓ -vector space,
f is in a canonical way a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces qAw
EndG (π∗ (qE))
indexed by Wqt . Moreover, as an algebra it is a twisted group algebra of Wqt , with
respect to some 2-cocycle. To analyse the 2-cocycle, we relate it to objects appearing
in the proof of Lemma 5.3.a.

As concerns the index set for the sum, by Theorem 3.1.a the map ZG (v)/ZM (v) →
NG (M ◦ )/M is bijective.
The bw with w ∈ ME /M ◦ act only on the second tensor factor of (77), and
they span the algebra EndQℓ (VρM ). Let [Wqt ] ⊂ Wt be a set of representatives for
StabWt (qE)/(ME /M ◦ ). By (70) we may assume that it contains Wt◦ . From (44) we
see that the bw with w ∈ [Wqt ] permute the direct summands of (77) according to
the inclusion
Wqt = NG (qt)/M → NG (M ◦ )/M ∼
= ZG (v)/ZM (v).
In particular {bw : w ∈ [Wqt ]} is linearly independent over EndQℓ (VρM ). Since (76)
is spanned by the bw with w ∈ StabWt (ρM ), it follows that in fact {bw : w ∈ [Wqt ]}
is a basis of (76) over EndQℓ (VρM ).
f say to qbw ∈ qAw . For
We want to modify these bw to endomorphisms of π∗ (qE),
w ∈ Wt◦ there is an easy canonical choice, as (75) shows that Wt◦ commutes with
Qℓ [M/M ◦ , ♮E ]. Hence bw fixes ρM ∈ Irr(Qℓ [M/M ◦ , ♮E ]) pointwise. Therefore we
can take qbw = bw for w ∈ Wt◦ . By Theorem 2.2 these elements span the algebra
˜ ∼
EndG◦ (π∗ E)
= Qℓ [Wt◦ ].
For general w ∈ [Wqt ] the description given in (44) shows that the action of bw on
(77) consists of a permuation of the direct factors combined with a linear action on
ft and N be as in (71) and (73). Then (77) can be embedded in a sum
VρM . Let W
f

t
of copies of indW
N (VρM ).
Now Proposition 1.1.b shows that there is a unique qbw ∈ qAw such that the
action of bw on (77) can be identified with qbw ⊗ I w , where I w is as in (4). We may
choose the same I w as we did (implicitly) in the last part of the proof of Lemma
5.3.a, where we used them to determine the cocycle κρM = κqt . Then Proposition
1.1.b shows also that these qbw multiply as in the algebra Qℓ [Wqt , κρM ].
Finally, the claim about the uniqueness follows in the same way as in the last part
of the proof of Propostion 4.5.


Some remarks about the 2-cocycle κqt are in order. If Wqt is cyclic then κqt is
×
trivial because H 2 (Wqt , Qℓ ) = {1}. Furthermore
f = EndG (π∗ (E))
˜ ∼
if ME = M ◦ , then EndG (π∗ (qE))
= Qℓ [Wt , ♮E ]

by Proposition 4.5. However, in contrast with the cocycle ♮E appearing in Sections
3 and 4, it is in general rather difficult to obtain explicit information about κqt . One
reason for this is that the classification of cuspidal local systems on disconnected
reductive groups, as achieved in Theorem 3.1 and in Proposition 3.5, leaves many
possibilities. In particular the groups GE /G◦ can be very large.

6. Cuspidal Langlands parameters
We will introduce a notion of cuspidality for enhanced L-parameters. Before we
come to that, we recall some generalities about Langlands parameters and Levi
subgroups. For more background we refer to [Bor, Vog, ABPS6].
Let F be a local non-archimedean field with Weil group WF . Let H be a connected
reductive algebraic group over F and let H∨ be its complex dual group. The data
for H provide an action of WF on H∨ which preserves a pinning, and that gives the
Langlands dual group L H = H∨ ⋊ WF . (All these objects are determined by F and
H up to isomorphism.)
Definition 6.1. Let T ⊂ H∨ be a torus such that the projection ZH∨ ⋊WF (T ) →
WF is surjective. Then we call L L = ZH∨ ⋊WF (T ) a Levi L-subgroup of L H.
We remark that in [Bor] such groups are called Levi subgroups of L H. We prefer
to stick to the connectedness of Levi subgroups. An alternative characterization of
Levi L-subgroups of L H is as follows.

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
33

Lemma 6.2. Let L L be a Levi L-subgroup of L H. There exists a WF -stable Levi
subgroup L∨ of H∨ such that L L is H∨ -conjugate to L∨ ⋊ WF and L := L L ∩ H∨ is
conjugate to L∨ .
Conversely, every H∨ -conjugate of L∨ ⋊ WF is a Levi L-subgroup of L H.
Proof. By [Bor, Lemma 3.5] there exists a parabolic subgroup P ⊂ H∨ such that
• NH∨ ⋊WF (P ) → WF is surjective;
• L is a Levi factor of P ;
• L L = NH∨ ⋊WF (L) ∩ NH∨ ⋊WF (P ).
Choose a WF -stable pinning for H∨ and let PI = LI ⋊ UI be the unique standard
parabolic subgroup of H∨ conjugate to P . Here UI denotes the unipotent radical of
PI , and LI its standard Levi factor. Then NH∨ ⋊WF (PI ) → WF is still surjective,
so PI is WF -stable. Pick h ∈ H∨ with PI = hP h−1 . Then hLh−1 is a Levi factor
of PI and
h L Lh−1 = NPI ⋊WF (h L Lh−1 )
is a complement to UI in PI ⋊ WF . All Levi factors of PI are UI -conjugate, so there
exists a u ∈ UI with uh L Lh−1 u−1 = LI . Then
uh L Lh−1 u−1 = NPI ⋊WF (LI ) = LI ⋊ WF .
For the converse, let H∨ be a WF -stable Levi subgroup of H∨ . Consider the root
system R := R(H∨ , Z(L∨ )◦ ). Since Z(L∨ )◦ is WF -stable, WF acts on R. Let T
be the neutral component of Z(L∨ )WF . This is a WF -fixed torus which commutes
with L∨ and
α(t) = (w · α)(t)
∀t ∈ T, α ∈ R, w ∈ WF .
∨
No root α ∈ R becomes trivial on T . Namely, the Lie algebra tder of Z(L∨ )◦ ∩ Hder
is spanned by R and WF -stable. An element X ∈ tder which on all wα with
w ∈ WF takes the same value in R>0 , gives rise to an element exp(X) ∈ T with
α(exp X) = exp(α(X)) > 0.
The centralizer in H∨ of the torus T ⊂ Z(L∨ )◦ is generated by L∨ and by the
root subgroups Uα for which α becomes trivial on T . Hence
ZH∨ (T ) = L∨

and ZH∨ ⋊WF (T ) = L∨ ⋊ WF ,

which means that L∨ ⋊ WF is a Levi L-subgroup of L H in the sense of Definition
6.1. For any h ∈ H∨ :
h(L∨ ⋊ WF )h−1 = ZH∨ ⋊WF (hT h−1 ).
This group contains hWF h−1 , so it projects onto WF . Hence it is again a Levi
L-subgroup of L H.

Remark 6.3. Most Levi L-subgroups of L H are not quasi-Levi, and conversely. For
example, let U = U(n, E/F ) be a p-adic unitary group (E is a quadratic extension
of F ) and let L U be its dual L-group. The group WF acts on U ∨ = GL(n, C) via an
outer automorphism which preserves the diagonal torus T and the standard Borel
subgroup B. Then T ⋊ WF is a Levi L-subgroup of L U : it is the centralizer of T WF
in L U . However, it is not quasi-Levi. Namely ZL U (T ) = T ⋊ WE , which is an index
two subgroup of T ⋊ WF .
The following definitions are well-known, we repeat them here to facilitate comparison with later generalizations.

34

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

Definition 6.4. A L-parameter for L H is a continuous group homomorphism
φ : WF × SL2 (C) → L H such that:
• φ(w) ∈ H∨ w for all w ∈ WF ;
• φ(w) is semisimple for all w ∈ WF ;
• φ|SL2 (C) : SL2 (C) → H∨ is a homomorphism of complex algebraic groups.
Recall that all inner forms of H share the same Langlands dual group L H, so the
group H is not determined by the target L H of a L-parameter. Let us specify which
L-parameters are relevant for H, and which are bounded or discrete.
Definition 6.5. Let φ : WF × SL2 (C) → L H be a L-parameter. We say that φ is
bounded if φ(Frob) = (h, Frob) with h in some compact subgroup of H∨ .
Suppose that L L is a Levi L-subgroup of L H and that
• L L contains the image of φ;
• there is no smaller Levi L-subgroup of L H with this property.
Then we call φ relevant for H if and only if the conjugacy class of L L is relevant for
H, that is, it corresponds to a conjugacy class of Levi subgroups of H.
In this case we also say that φ is a discrete L-parameter for L L, and for any Levi
subgroup L ⊂ H in the associated class. In particular φ is discrete for H if and only
if there is no proper Levi L-subgroup of L H containing the image of φ.
The group H∨ acts on the set of relevant L-parameters for H. We denote
the set of relevant L-parameters modulo H∨ -conjugation by Φ(H). The subset of
bounded L-parameters (up to conjugacy) is denoted by Φbdd (H). The local Langlands correspondence predicts that Irr(H) is partitioned into finite L-packets Πφ (H),
parametrized by Φ(H). Under this correspondence Φbdd (H) should give rise to Lpackets consisting entirely of tempered representations, and that should account for
the entire tempered dual of H.
It is expected (and established in many cases) that the following conditions are
equivalent for φ ∈ Φ(H):
• φ is discrete;
• Πφ (H) contains an essentially square-integrable representation;
• all elements of Πφ (H) are essentially square-integrable.
In other words, “discrete” (respectively “bounded”) is the correct translation of
“essentially square-integrable” (respectively “tempered”) under the local Langlands
correspondence.
However, it is more difficult to characterize when Πφ (H) contains supercuspidal
H-representations. Of course φ has to be discrete, but even then. Sometimes Πφ (H)
consists entirely of supercuspidal representations, for example when H = SL2 (F )
and φ comes from an irreducible representation WF → GL2 (C). In other cases
Πφ (H) contains only non-supercuspidal essentially square-integrable representations,
for example when H = SL2 (F ), φ|WF = idWF and φ|SL2 (C) is an irreducible twodimensional representation of SL2 (C).
Moreover there are mixed cases, where Πφ (H) contains both supercuspidal and
non-supercuspidal representations. An example
is formed by a Langlands parameter

for a group of type G2 , with φ 1, ( 10 11 ) a subregular unipotent element of G2 (C).
Then Πφ (G2 (F )) has a unique supercuspidal element and contains two representations from the principal series of G2 (F ), see [Lus3].

To parametrize the representations in a given L-packet, we need more information

We note that both groups acting in (85) yield the same orbit space.
The notion of relevance for enhanced L-parameters is more subtle. Firstly, we
must specify H not only as an inner form of a quasi-split group H∗ , but even as
an inner twist. That is, we must fix an isomorphism H → H∗ of algebraic groups,
defined over a separable closure of F . The inner twists of H are parametrized by
the Galois cohomology group H 1 (F, Had ), where Had denotes the adjoint group
of H (considered as an algebraic group defined over F ). The parametrization is
canonically determined by requiring that H∗ corresponds to the trivial element of

Definition 6.6. Let (φ, ρ) be an enhanced L-parameter for L H. We say that (φ, ρ)
or ρ is H-relevant if ζρ parametrizes the inner twist H via (86).
By the next result, Definition 7.7 fits well with the earlier notion of relevance of
φ, as in Definition 6.5.
Proposition 6.7.
Let H be an inner twist of a quasi-split group and let ζ ∈

Proof. For the equivalence of (1) and (2) see [HiSa, Lemma 9.1] and [Art1, Corollary 2.3]. The equivalence of (2) and (3) is easy, it was already noted in [ABPS6,
Proposition 1.6].

∨ and the above relevance circumvents
Let us remark here that the usage of Hsc
some of the problems in [Vog, §2]. In particular it removes the need to consider
variations such as ”pure inner forms” or ”pure inner twists”.
We denote the set of H∨ -equivalence classes of enhanced relevant L-parameters
for H by Φe (H). Following [Art2] we choose an extension ζH of ζ to a character of

course we take ζH = triv if H is quasi-split. Since Sφ /Zφ ∼
= Rφ , we obtain

Φe,triv (H) = {(φ, ρ) : φ ∈ Φ(H), ρ ∈ Irr(Rφ )}

if H is quasi-split.

It is conjectured [Art2, ABPS6] that the local Langlands correspondence for H can
be enhanced to a bijection
Irr(H) ←→ Φe,ζH (H).

Based on many examples we believe that the following kind of enhanced Lparameters should parametrize supercuspidal representations.
Definition 6.8. An enhanced L-parameter (φ, ρ) for L H is cuspidal if φ is dis1 (φ|
crete and (uφ , ρ) is a cuspidal pair for G = ZH
∨
WF ). Here ρ is considered as a
sc
representation of π0 (ZG (uφ )) via (90).
We denote the set of H∨ -equivalence classes of H-relevant cuspidal L-parameters
by Φcusp (H). When ζH is as in (87), we put Φcusp,ζH (H) = Φcusp (H) ∩ Φe,ζH .
It is easy to see that every group H has cuspidal L-parameters. Let φ ∈ Φ(H)
be a discrete parameter which is trivial on SL2 (C). Then uφ = 1 and ZH∨ (φ)◦ =
1 (φ) is finite and every enhancement ρ of φ is cuspidal.

sc
By Proposition 6.7 we can choose a H-relevant ρ.
In the case of quasi-split groups we can also use enhanced L-parameters of the
form (φ, ρ) with ρ ∈ Irr(Rφ ), where Rφ is as in (80). Such a parameter is cuspidal
if and only if (uφ , ρ) is a cuspidal pair for ZH∨ (φ).
Now we check that in many cases where a local Langlands correspondence is
known, these cuspidal L-parameter do indeed parametrize supercuspidal representations.
Example 6.9. Let F be a p-adic field, D a division algebra over F such that
dimF D = d2 and H = GLm (D). Then H is an inner form of GLn (F ) with n = md.

Hence, we can write uφ = (uφ,π )π∈I . Since we assume that φ is cuspidal, this
implies that for all π ∈ I, uφ,π is in the regular unipotent class, corresponding to
the partition dπ and Z(SLdπ (C)) acts on ρ by a character of order dπ . But AG (uφ )
is a cyclic group of order gcd(dπ , π ∈ I). So, since its contains a subgroup of order
dπ and its cardinality is at most dπ , we get that all dπ are equal to some integer d′
and Sφ = Z/d′ Z. Moreover
ZSLn (C) (φ(WF )) ≃ (GLd′ (C))#I ∩ SLn (C).
Because we suppose that φ is discrete, I is a singleton. We obtain that φ = π ⊠ Sd′ .
In particular, the center of SLn (C) acts on SH∨sc (φ) by a character of order d, so
that d = d′ . Hence φ = π ⊠ Sd . We recover the case when D = F and φ = π
is an irreducible representation of WF . An other case is when H = GL1 (D) with
d = 2. We obtain that the supercuspidal representations of GL1 (D) are of the form
χ ⊠ S2 , with χ a character of WF . (This Langlands parameter is the parameter
of χStGL2 (F ) and the two representations are connected by the Jacquet–Langlands
correspondence).
Example 6.10. Let F be a p-adic field, and let H be a symplectic group Sp2n (F )
or a split special orthogonal group SOm (F ). We have L H = H∨ × WF . Then [Mou,
Proposition 4.14] shows, using results of Arthur and Mœglin, that the supercuspidal
irreducible representations of H correspond, via the local Langlands correspondence,
to cuspidal enhanced L-parameters.
Example 6.11. Let F be a p-adic field and E a quadratic extension of F . Let
H = Un (F ) be the quasi-split unitary group defined over F and split over E. We
have L H = GLn (C) ⋊ Gal(E/F ). Let φ : WF × SL2 (C) −→ L H be a discrete
Langlands parameter and fix σ ∈ WF such that WF /WE ≃ hσi. We use the
notions of conjugate-dual, conjugate-orthogonal and conjugate-symplectic defined
in [GGP, §3]. We can decompose the restriction of φ to WE as an n-dimensional

Every term mπ π in (91) can be decomposed as ⊕a π ⊠ Sa , where Sa denotes the adimensional irreducible representation of SL2 (C). Here a runs through some subset
of N – every a appears at most once because φ is discrete. For every such (π, a) we
choose an element zπ,a ∈ AGLn (C) (φ) which acts as −1 on π ⊠ Sa and as the identity

From now on we assume that φ can be enhanced to a cuspidal L-parameter. The

Moreover, in [Moe, Théorème 8.4.4], Mœglin classified the supercuspidal representations in an Arthur packet. In particular, for tempered Langlands parameters (which
are Arthur parameters trivial on the second copy of SL2 (C)), the description is given
in term of a Jordan block and a character defined by this Jordan block. Here the
Jordan block Jord(φ) of the Langlands parameter φ of a supercuspidal representation of H is the set of pairs (π, a), where π is an irreducible representation of WE
stable under the action of the composition of inverse-transpose and σ, and a is an
integer such that π ⊠ Sa is a subrepresentation of φ WE .
The condition on the Jordan block says that it has no holes (or is without jumps).
More explicitly, for all a > 2, if (π, a) ∈ Jord(φ) then (π, a−2) ∈ Jord(φ). The shape
of φ is then as (92). Moreover, the alternated characters are exactly the cuspidal
ones. More precisely, [Moe, p.194] gives the definition zπ,a as our zπ,a zπ,a−2 (or zπ,2
in the case of a = 2). But the cuspidal characters are exactly the characters which
are alternated, i.e. such that ε(zπ,a zπ,a−2 ) = −1.
Example 6.12. Let φ be a relevant discrete L-parameter which is trivial on the
wild inertia subgroup PF of the inertia group IF , and such that the centralizer of
φ(IF ) in H∨ is a torus. The latter condition forces φ to be trivial on SL2 (C). Hence
uφ = 1, and any enhancement of φ gives a cuspidal L-parameter. Let

Cφ = π0 ZH∨ (φ)/Z(L H)◦

and let ρ ∈ Irr(Cφ ). It is known from [DeRe] that these enhanced L-parameters (φ, ρ)
correspond to the depth-zero generic supercuspidal irreducible representations of H,
in the case where H is a pure inner form of an unramified reductive p-adic group.
We note that the component group Cφ is a quotient of our Sφ , namely by the kernel
∨ → H∨ . A priori in these references only a subset of our enhancements of φ
of Hsc
is considered. However, it boils down to the same, because the p-adic group H is
chosen such that ρ is relevant for it [DeRe, §2].
Example 6.13. Let (φ, ρ) be a relevant enhanced L-parameter such that φ is dis(r)
(r+1)
and nontrivial on PF for some integer r > 0, and such
crete and trivial on PF
(r)
that the centralizer in H∨ of φ(PF ) is a maximal torus of H∨ . Again any such
(φ, ρ) is cuspidal. The same argument as in Example 6.12 shows that the result of
Reeder in [Ree2, §6] implies that these enhanced L-parameters correspond to the
depth-zero generic supercuspidal irreducible representations of H, when H is a pure
inner form of an unramified reductive p-adic group.

sc
proved in [Lus4] that these enhanced L-parameters correspond to the unipotent
irreducible representations of H in the case when H is simple of adjoint type. Under
these conditions H∨ is simply connected and Sφ coincides with the component group
considered by Lusztig.
Recall that a representation π of H is said to be unipotent (or to have unipotent
reduction) if for some parahoric subgroup P of H, and some unipotent cuspidal
representation σ of the reductive quotient of P, the space HomP (σ, π) is nonzero
(where σ is viewed as a representation of P by inflation).
7. The cuspidal support of enhanced L-parameters
In the representation theory of p-adic groups Bernstein’s cuspidal support map
(see [BeDe, §2] or [Ren, VI.7.1]) plays an important role. It assigns to every irreducible smooth H-representation π a Levi subgroup L of H and a supercuspidal
L-representation σ, such that π is contained in the normalized parabolic induction
of σ. This condition determines (L, σ) uniquely up to H-conjugacy. It is common to
call (L, σ) a cuspidal pair for H. The cuspidal support of π ∈ Irr(H) is a H-conjugacy
class of cuspidal pairs, often denoted by Sc(π).
It is expected that Sc relates very well to the LLC. In fact this is a special case
of a conjecture about the relation with parabolic induction, see [Hai, Conjecture
5.22] and [ABPS6, §1.5]. Suppose that P = LUP is a parabolic subgroup of H, that
φ ∈ Φ(L) and σ ∈ Πφ (L). Then the L-packet Πφ (H) should consist of constituents
of the normalized parabolic induction IPH (σ).
We will define an analogue of Sc for enhanced L-parameters. In this setting a
cuspidal pair for L H should become a triple (L∨ ⋊ WF , φ, ρ), where L∨ ⋊ WF is
the L-group of a Levi subgroup L ⊂ H and (φ, ρ) is a cuspidal L-parameter for L.
However, the collection of such objects is not stable under H∨ -conjugation, because
hL∨ h−1 need not be WF -stable. To allow H∨ to act on these triples, we must
generalize Definition 6.8 in a less restrictive way.
Definition 7.1. Let L L be a Levi L-subgroup of L H. A Langlands parameter for
is a group homomorphism φ : WF × SL2 (C) → L L satisfying the requirements of
Definition 6.4. An enhancement of φ is an irreducible representation ρ of π0 (ZL1 sc (φ)),
where Lsc is the simply connected cover of the derived group of L = L L ∩ H∨ . The
group L acts on the collection of enhanced L-parameters for L L by (85).
 
We say that (φ, ρ) is cuspidal for L L if φ is discrete for L L and uφ = φ 1, ( 10 11 ) , ρ
is a cuspidal pair for ZL1 sc (φ|WF ). We denote the set of L-orbits by Φe (L L) and the
subset of cuspidal L-orbits by Φcusp (L L).

LL

We remark that in this definition it is not specified for which p-adic group an
enhanced L-parameter for L L is relevant. Hence Φe (L L) is in general strictly larger
than Φe (L), it also contains enhanced L-parameters for inner forms of L.

This depends only on the restriction of ζH to the subgroup Z(Lsc ) ⊂ Z(Hsc
∨
Often we will be interested in cuspidal data up to H -conjugacy. Upon fixing the
first ingredient of (L L, φ, ρ), we can consider (φ, ρ) as a cuspidal L-parameter for
L L, modulo L-conjugacy. Recall from (88) that φ is determined up to L-conjugacy
by φ|WF and uφ . Hence the quadruple

(L L, φ|WF , uφ , ρ)

(93)

determines a unique H∨ -conjugacy class of cuspidal data. Therefore we will also
regard quadruples of the form (93) as cuspidal data for L H.
Let Irrcusp (L) be the set of supercuspidal L-representations and let σ1 , σ2 ∈
Irrcusp (L). We note that the cuspidal pairs (L, σ1 ) and (L, σ2 ) are H-conjugate
if and only if σ1 and σ2 are in the same orbit under
W (H, L) = NH (L)/L.

(94)

Recall from [ABPS6, Proposition 3.1] that there is a canonical isomorphism
(95)
W (H, L) ∼
= NH∨ (L∨ ⋊ WF )/L∨ .
Motivated by (95) we write, for any Levi L-subgroup L L of L H:
W (L H, L L) := NH∨ (L L)/L.
This group acts naturally on the collection of cuspidal data for L H with first ingredient L L. Two cuspidal data
(96) (L L, φ1 , ρ1 ) and (L L, φ2 , ρ2 ) are H-conjugate

⇐⇒

L

(φ1 , ρ1 ), (φ2 , ρ2 ) ∈ Φcusp ( L) are in the same orbit for the action of W (L H, L L).
In the notation of (90), we use Section 5 (with complex representations and sheafs)
to write
qΨG (uφ , ρ) = [M, v, qǫ]G .
Proposition 7.3. Let (φ, ρ) ∈ Φe (H).
(a) (ZH∨ ⋊WF (Z(M )◦ ), φ|WF , v, qǫ) is a H-relevant cuspidal datum for L H.
(b) Upon replacing (φ, ρ) by a H∨ -conjugate representative L-parameter, there exists
a Levi subgroup L of H such that:

(c) The H-conjugacy class of L and the H∨ -conjugacy class of L∨ ⋊WF are uniquely
determined by (φ, ρ).

Proof. (a) and (b) The torus Z(M )◦ commutes with M , so ZH∨ (Z(M )◦ ) is a Levi

subgroup L∨ := ZH∨ (Z(M )◦ ) with
φ(WF ) ⊂ ZH∨ ⋊WF (Z(M )◦ ) = L∨ ⋊ WF .

Moreover L∨ contains v (or rather its image in H∨ , which we also denote by v).

Thus L contains a conjugate of L∨ . Equivalently L∨ ⋊ WF minimally contains

Hence the above F -group L has to be a Levi subgroup of H.

(98) or [Bor, Proposition 8.6] we see that L L is H-conjugate to L∨ ⋊ WF . Hence

It turns out that the cuspidal datum constructed in Proposition 7.3.a need not
have the same infinitesimal character as φ (in the sense of [Hai, Vog]). Since this
would be desirable for a cuspidal support map, we now work out some constructions
which compensate for this. See (106) for their effect.
Recall from (64) that the unipotent element v in qΨG (uφ , ρ) also appears as
ΨG◦ (uφ , ρ◦ ) = (M ◦ , v, ǫ), where ρ◦ is an irreducible AG◦ (uφ )-constituent of ρ. The
construction of ΨG◦ , which already started in (16), entails that there exists a parabolic subgroup P of G◦ such that
• M ◦ is a Levi factor of P ,
• uφ = vuP with uP in the unipotent radical UP of P .
Upon conjugating φ with

Lemma 7.6. Let (φ, ρ) be an enhanced L-parameter for H and write qΨG (uφ , ρ) =

Proof. Everything except the last claim was already checked above. Since (v, qǫ)
is cuspidal, [Lus2, Proposition 2.7] says that v is isolated. This means that its
connected centralizer does lie in any proper Levi subgroup of M ◦ . In other words,
every torus of M ◦ which centralizes v is contained in Z(M ◦ )◦ . Finally we note that,
as M is a quasi-Levi subgroup, Z(M )◦ = Z(M ◦ )◦ .

Notice that the cocharacter χφ,v : C× → Z(M )◦ has image commuting with both
γv (SL2 (C)) and φ(WF ).

We define a L-parameter ϕv : WF × SL2 (C) → ZH∨ ⋊WF (Z(M )◦ ) by
ϕv (w, x) = φ(w)χφ,v (kwk1/2 )γv (x).

The cuspidal support of (φ, ρ) is
Sc(φ, ρ) = (ZH∨ ⋊WF (Z(M )◦ ), ϕv , qǫ),
another H-relevant cuspidal datum for L H.
By parts (a) and (c) of Proposition 7.3 the map L Ψ is canonical in the sense
that its image is unique up to conjugation. By Lemma 7.6 Sc is also canonical.
Furthermore, the images of L Ψ and Sc are H-relevant by Proposition 7.3.b. In view
of Proposition 7.3.c, we can always represent L Ψ(φ, ρ) and Sc(φ, ρ) by a cuspidal
L-parameter for a Levi subgroup of H.

In the terminology from [Hai, Vog], this says that the cuspidal support map for
enhanced L-parameters preserves infinitesimal characters. It is interesting to compare the fibres of Sc with the variety constructed in [Vog, Corollary 4.6]. Vogan
considers the set of all L-parameters for L H with a fixed infinitesimal character (up
to conjugation). In [Vog, Proposition 4.5] he proves that this set has the structure
of a complex affine variety, on which H∨ acts naturally, with only finitely many
orbits. The same picture can be obtained from a fibre of Sc, upon neglecting all
enhancements of L-parameters.
More or less by definition Bernstein’s cuspidal support map for Irr(H) preserves
infinitesimal characters. That property is slightly less strong for our Sc on the Galois
side, for enhanced L-parameters with different cuspidal support can have the same
infinitesimal character. The map
L

Ψ : Φe (H) → {cuspidal data for H}/H∨ -conjugacy

f of Bernstein’s cuspidal support map
is an analogue of a modified version, say Sc,
L

for Irr(H). Neither Ψ nor Sc preserve infinitesimal characters, but they have other
advantages that the cuspidal support maps lack. For L Ψ this will become clear in the
f stems from its role in the ABPS conjecture.
Section 9, while the importance of Sc
To enable a comparison, we recall its definition from [ABPS6, §2.5]. Let P =
MUP be a parabolic subgroup of H and let ω ∈ Irr(M) be square-integrable modulo
centre. Suppose that πt ∈ Irr(H) is tempered and that it is a direct summand of
the normalized parabolic induction IPH (ω). Let (L, σ) be the cuspidal support of ω.
Then σ can be written uniquely as σ = σu ⊗ ν, with ν : L → R>0 an unramified
character and σu ∈ Irrcusp (L) unitary (and hence tempered). One defines
f t ) = (L, σu )/H-conjugacy.
Sc(π

f preserves temperedness of representations, in contrast with Sc.
Notice that Sc
More generally, by [Sol1, Theorem 2.15] every π ∈ Irr(H) can be written (in an
essentially unique way) as a Langlands quotient of IPH (ω ⊗ χ), where P = MUP and
ω are as above and χ ∈ Xnr (M). Then χ restricts to an unramified character of L
and the cuspidal support of ω ⊗ χ is (L, σ ⊗ χ). In this case one defines
f
Sc(π)
= (L, σu ⊗ χ)/H-conjugacy.

We note that the only difference with Sc(π) is ν|L , an unramified character L → R>0
which represents the absolute value of the infinitesimal central character of σ.
It has been believed for a long time that the (enhanced) L-parameters of π ∈
Irr(H) and Sc(π) are always related, but it was not clear how. With our new
notions we can make this precise. Let Lev(H) be a set of representatives for the
conjugacy classes of Levi subgroups of H, and recall (94) and (96).
Conjecture 7.8. Assume that a local Langlands correspondence exists for H and
for supercuspidal representations of its Levi subgroups. The following diagram should
commute:
LLC

Irr(H) o

Φe (H)

Sc

F



L∈Lev(H) Irrcusp (L)/W (H, L)

Sc

o

LLC

F



L∈Lev(H) Φcusp (L)/W (H, L).

Conjecture 7.8 is known to hold for many of the groups for which a LLC has been
established.
• For GLn (F ) it is a consequence of the Bernstein–Zelevinsky classification of
Irr(GLn (F )) [Zel] and the way it is used in the local Langlands correspondence for GLn (F ), see [Hen, §2].
• Irreducible representations of inner forms GLm (D) of GLn (F ) can also be
classified via a Zelevinsky-like scheme, see [Tad]. This is used in the LLC in
the same way as for GLn (F ) [ABPS2, §2], so the conjecture also holds for
these groups.
• The local Langlands correspondence for an inner form SLm (D) of SLn (F )
is derived directly from that for GLm (D): on the Galois side one lifts Lparameters WF × SL2 (C) → PGLn (C) to GLn (C), whereas on the p-adic
side one restricts irreducible representations of GLm (D) to SLm (D) to construct L-packets. These two operations do not really change the infinitesimal central characters of L-parameters or smooth representations, only on
Z(GLn (C)) ∼
= C× or Z(GLm (D)) ∼
= F × , respectively. Therefore Conjecture
7.8 for GLm (D) implies it for SLm (D).
• For the split classical groups Sp2n (F ) and SOm (F ) when F is a p-adic
field. The support cuspidal map specializes to the map defined in [Mou,
Théorème 4.27], and the commutativity of the diagram follows from [Mou,
Théorème 5.9].
• For principal series representations of split groups see [ABPS4, Theorem
15.1].
• For unipotent representations of simple p-adic groups H of adjoint type we
refer to [Lus4]. Although
 it isnot so easy to see, the
 essence is that Lusztig
uses the element f = φ Frob,

kFrobk1/2

0
kFrobk−1/2

to parametrize the cen-

tral character of a representation of a suitable affine Hecke algebra [Lus4,
§9.3]. By construction this also parametrizes the infinitesimal central character of the associated representation of H.
To support Conjecture 7.8, we check that the cuspidal support map is compatible
with the Langlands classification for L-parameters. The latter is a version of the

48

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

Langlands classification for Irr(H) on the Galois side of the LLC, it stems from
[SiZi].
We will describe first a Galois side analogue for unramified characters. Let IF ⊂
WF be as above the inertia subgroup and let Frob ∈ WF be a Frobenius element.
Recall from [Hai, §3.3.1] that there is a canonical isomorphism of complex tori
◦
(107)
Xnr (L) ∼
= Z(L∨ )IF Frob = Z(L∨ ⋊ IF )◦WF /IF = Z(L∨ ⋊ IF )◦L∨ ⋊WF .
The group Xnr (L) acts on Irr(L) by tensoring. This corresponds to an action of
◦
Z(L∨ )IF Frob on Φ(L) and on Φe (L). Namely, let φ : WF × SL2 (C) → L L be a
relevant L-parameter and let z ∈ Z(L∨ )IF . We define zφ ∈ Φ(L) by


(108)
(zφ)I ×SL2 (C) = φI ×SL2 (C) and (zφ)(Frob) = z φ(Frob).

Notice that zφ ∈ Φ(L) because z ∈ Z(L

represents the same element of Z(L ) Frob . Then z z = x−1 Frob(x) for some
x ∈ Z(L∨ )IF , and
z ′ φ = x−1 Frob(x)zφ = x−1 zφx.

Hence z ′ φ = zφ in Φ(L) and we obtain an action of Z(L∨ )IF Frob on Φ(L). As z
commutes with L∨ , Szφ = Sφ . This enables us to lift the action to Φe (L) by

(109)

z(φ, ρ) = (zφ, ρ).

To allow H∨ to act on the above objects, we also have to define them for Levi
L-subgroups L L of L H. Generalizing (107), we put

◦
(110)
Xnr L L = Z H∨ ⋊ IF ∩ L L Frob .
This group plays the role of unramified characters for L L, we will sometimes refer to
it as the unramified twists of L L. By the formula (108), Xnr (L L) acts on Langlands
parameters with image in L L. As in (109), that extends to an action on enhanced
L-parameters for L L.
The following notion replaces the data in the Langlands classification for H.
Definition 7.9. Fix a pinning of H and a WF -stable pinning of H∨ . A standard
triple for H consists of:
• a standard Levi subgroup L of H;
• a bounded L-parameter φt ∈ Φbdd (L);
• an unramified twist z ∈ Xnr (L L), which is strictly positive with respect to
the standard parabolic subgroup P with Levi factor L.
The last condition means that α∨ (z) > 1 for every root α of (UP , Z(L)◦ ), where UP
denotes the unipotent radical of P.
An enhancement of a standard triple (L, φt , z) is an L-relevant irreducible repreL . Let ζ and ζ L be as in Lemma 7.4. We say that (L, φ , z, ρ )
sentation ρt of Szφ

{enhanced standard triples for (H, ζH )} ←→ Φe,ζH (H)
(L, φt , z, ρ)
7→
(zφt , ρ).
Proof. (a) See [SiZi, Theorem 4.6]. The differences are only notational: we replaced
a standard parabolic subgroup P of H by its standard Levi factor L and we used
z ∈ Xnr (L L) instead of the presentation of Xnr (L) by elements of a∗L . The regularity
of ν ∈ a∗L in [SiZi] means that it lies in the open Weyl chamber of a∗L determined by
P. This translates to z being strictly positive with respect to P.
(b) Since z ∈ Z(L∨ ), φt and zφt have the same S-groups for L. In [SiZi, Proposition 7.1] it is shown that the natural map RL
zφt → Rzφt is a bijection. In Lemma
7.4 we constructed a natural injection

The dimensions of these spaces are, respectively, |RL

[SiZi, Proposition 7.1], so the above map is an algebra isomorphism.

The maps L Ψ and Sc from Definition 7.7 are compatible with Theorem 7.10 in
the sense that they factor through this Langlands classification.
Lemma 7.11. Let (φ, ρ) ∈ Φe,ζH (H) and let (L, φt , z, ρt ) be the enhanced standard
triple associated to it by Theorem 7.10. Then
L ΨH (φ, ρ)

ScL (zφt , ρt )

= z · L ΨL (φt , ρt ),
= z · ScL (φt , ρt ).

Proof. Because all the maps are well-defined on conjugacy classes of enhanced Lparameters, we may assume that φ = zφt and ρ = ρt . By definition L ΨH (zφt , ρt ) is
given in terms of qΨG (uφ , ρ) = [M, v, qǫ]G , as (ZL H (Z(M )◦ ), φ|WF , v, qǫ). Consider
◦

∨
Since L∨
(Z(L∨

c ) ) is a Levi subgroup of Hsc , G1 is a quasi-Levi subgroup of
sc
1
G = ZH∨sc (φ|WF ). By Proposition 5.6

qΨG1 (uφ , ρ) = qΨG (uφ , ρ).
In general G1 is a finite index subgroup of G2 = ZL1 ∨sc (φ|WF ). Since the quasi-cuspidal
support of (uφ , ρ) (for G1 ) is derived from the cuspidal support (for G◦1 = G◦2 ), Z(M )◦
is the same for G2 and G1 . Hence
qΨG2 (uφ , ρ) = [M2 , v, qǫ2 ]G2 ,

(111)

M2 = ZG2 (Z(M )◦ ),

where qǫ2 is an extension of qǫ ∈ Irr(AM (v)) to AM2 (v). By (104) and Proposition
7.3.b qǫ2 is obtained from qǫ by setting it equal to 1 on a suitable central subgroup.
As explained in the proof of Proposition 7.3 after (100), this means that as cuspidal
data
L

ΨL (φ, ρ) = (ZL L (Z(M )◦ ), φ|WF , v, qǫ2 ) = (ZL L (Z(M )◦ ), φ|WF , v, qǫ).

Now L L is a Levi L-subgroup of L H containing φ(WF ) ∪ {v}. In the proof of
Proposition 7.3.a we checked that L∨ ⋊ WF ⊃ ZL H (Z(M )◦ ). Hence
ZL H (Z(M )◦ ) = ZL L (Z(M )◦ )

and

The construction of χφ,v in Lemma 7.6 depends only on qΨGt (uφ , ρ), so ScH (φ, ρ) =
ScL (zφt , ρt ) = z · ScL (φt , ρt ) as well.

8. Inertial equivalence classes of L-parameters
In important ingredient in Bernstein’s theory of representations of p-adic groups
are inertial equivalence classes. Let L ⊂ H be a Levi subgroup and let Xnr (L) be the
group of unramified characters L → C× . Two cuspidal pairs (L1 , σ1 ) and (L2 , σ2 )
are said to be inertially equivalent if there exist an unramified character χ1 of L1
and an element h ∈ H such that
hL2 h−1 = L1

and h · σ2 = σ1 ⊗ χ1 .

We denote a typical inertial equivalence of cuspidal pairs by s = [L, σ]H , we let
B(H) be the set of such classes. With every s ∈ B(H) one can associate a set of
irreducible smooth H-representations:
Irr(H)s = {π ∈ Irr(H) : the cuspidal support of π lies in s}.
A (weak) version of the Bernstein decomposition says that
G
(112)
Irr(H) =
Irr(H)s .
s∈B(H)

We will establish a similar decomposition for enhanced Langlands parameters.
Our notion of inertial equivalence generalizes [Hai, Definition 5.33] from homomorphisms WF → L H to enhanced L-parameters.
Definition 8.1. Let (L L, φv , qǫ) and (L L′ , φ′v , qǫ′ ) be two cuspidal data for L H.
They are inertially equivalent if there exist z ∈ Xnr (L L) and h ∈ H∨ such that
h L L′ h−1 = L L

and (zφv , qǫ) = (hφ′v h−1 , h · qǫ′ ).

The class of (L L, φv , qǫ) modulo Xnr (L L) is denoted [L L, φv , qǫ]L L , and its inertial
equivalence class is denoted [L L, φv , qǫ]L H . We say that [L L, φv , qǫ]L H is H-relevant
if any of its elements is so. We write B∨ (L H) for the set of inertial equivalence
classes of cuspidal pairs for L H, and B∨ (H) for its subset of H-relevant classes.
Given an inertial equivalence class s∨ for L H, we write, using Definition 7.7,
∨

Φe (L H)s = {(φ, ρ) ∈ Φe (L H) : the cuspidal support of (φ, ρ) lies in s∨ }.
When s∨ is H-relevant, we put
∨

Φe (H)s = {(φ, ρ) ∈ Φe (H) : the cuspidal support of (φ, ρ) lies in s∨ }.

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
51

We note that s∨ as above determines a character of Z(Lsc ). In view of Proposition
∨ ) trivial on Z(L )◦ .
7.3.b, it extends in a unique way to a character of Z(Hsc
c
The above construction yields partitions analogous to (112):
G
G

∨
and Φe (H) =
Φe (H)s .
(113)
Φe (L H) =
Φe (L H)s
s∨ ∈B∨ (H)

s∨ ∈B∨ (L H)

∨

In this sense we consider Φe (L H)s as Bernstein components in the space of enhanced
L-parameters for L H. We note that by Lemma 7.6 the difference between Sc(φ, ρ)
and L Ψ(φ, ρ), namely the homomorphism

WF → Z(M )◦ : w 7→ χφ,v kwk1/2 ,

can be considered as an unramified twist of L L. Hence Sc(φ, ρ) and L Ψ(φ, ρ) belong
to the same inertial equivalence class, and we could equally well have used L Ψ to
∨
∨
define Φe (L H)s and Φe (H)s .
We return to p-adic groups, to consider other aspects of Bernstein’s work. Bernstein associated to each inertial equivalence class s = [L, σ]H ∈ B(H) a finite group
Ws . Let W (H, L) = NH (L)/L, the “Weyl” group of L. It acts on Irrcusp (L),
which induces an action on the collection of inertial equivalence classes [L, ω]L with
ω ∈ Irrcusp (L). Notice that
(L, ω1 ), (L, ω2 ) are H-conjugate ⇐⇒ there is a w ∈ W (H, L) with w · ω1 ∼
= ω2 .
The group Ws is defined to be the stabilizer of [L, σ]L in W (H, L). It keeps track of
which elements of [L, σ]L are H-conjugate. This group plays an important role in
the Bernstein centre.
Let Rep(H) be the category of smooth complex H-representations, and let Rep(H)s
be its subcategory generated by Irr(H)s . The strong form of the Bernstein decomposition says that
G
Rep(H) =
Rep(H)s .
s∈B(H)

By [BeDe, Proposition 3.14] the centre of the category Rep(H)s is canonically isomorphic to O([L, σ]L /Ws ). Here [L, σ]L is regarded as a complex affine variety via
the transitive action of Xnr (L). The centre of Rep(H) is isomorphic to
M

In other words, there are canonical bijections

[L, σ]L /Ws ,
(114)
Irr Z(Rep(H))

L∈Lev(H) Irrcusp (L)/W (H, L).
We want identify the correct analogue of Ws on the Galois side. From (110) we see
that NH∨ (L L) stabilizes Xnr (L L) and that L fixes Xnr (L L) pointwise. Therefore
W (L H, L L) also acts on classes [L L, φ, ρ]L L of cuspidal data modulo unramified
twists. We note that, like (94) and (96),
(115)

[L L, φv , qǫ]L H = [L L, φ′v , qǫ′ ]L H

⇐⇒

there is a w ∈ W (L H, L L) such that w · [L L, φv , qǫ]L L = [L L, φ′v , qǫ′ ]L L .

From (68) we get
Wqt = NG G ∩ Lc , CvG∩Lc , qE

(118)



(G ∩ Lc ).

Lemma 8.2. Wqt is canonically isomorphic to the isotropy group of (L L, φv , qǫ) in
W (L H, L L) and in Ws∨ .
Proof. Since Xnr (L L) is stable under W (L H, L L), any element of the latter group
which fixes (L L, φv , ρ) automatically stabilizes s∨
L . Therefore it does not matter
whether we determine the isotropy group in W (L H, L L) or in Ws∨ .
The proof of Proposition 7.3, with G ∩ Lc in the role of M , shows that
ZH∨ ⋊WF (Z(G ∩ Lc )◦ ) is a Levi L-subgroup of L H minimally containing the image
of φ. As Z(G ∩ Lc )◦ ⊃ Z(Lc )◦ ,
ZH∨ (Z(G ∩ Lc )◦ ) ⊂ ZH∨ (Z(L◦c )) = L.
But L L also contains the image of φ minimally, so

The only difference between the last two terms is that on the left hand side elements
of G have to normalize L L, whereas on the right hand side they only have to normalize G ∩ Lsc . Consider any g ∈ NG (G ∩ Lc ). It normalizes Z(G ∩ Lc ), so it also
normalizes ZH∨ ⋊WF (Z(G ∩ Lc )◦ ), which by (119) equals L L. Therefore (120) is also
surjective.

Assume for the remainder of this section that Z(L∨
sc ) is fixed by WF , for every
Levi subgroup L ⊂ H. (The general case is similar and can be obtained by including
L as in Lemma 7.4.) In view of Lemma 8.2, the analogue of the Bernstein

Let us agree that two enhanced L-parameters in the same Bernstein component are
inseparable if they have the same infinitesimal character. Then (121) can be regarded
as a maximal separable quotient of Φe (H). This fits nicely with the Dauns–Hofmann
theorem, which says that for many noncommutative algebras A the operation of
taking the maximal separable quotient of Irr(A) is dual to restriction from A to its
centre Z(A).
9. Extended quotients and L-parameters
The ABPS-conjecture from [ABPS1, §15] and [ABPS6, Conjecture 2] refines (114).
In its roughest form it asserts that it can be lifted to a bijection
Irr(H)s ←→ ([L, σ]L //Ws )♮ ,

(122)

for a suitable family of 2-cocycles ♮. Equivalently, this can be formulated as a
bijection


Irrcusp (L)//W (H, L) ♮ .

Irr(H) ←→

The main goal of this section is to prove an analogue of (122) and (123) for enhanced
Langlands parameters, which refines (121).
Fix a H-relevant cuspidal datum (L L, φv , qǫ) for L H, and write, in addition to the
notations (116) and (117),

(c) The H∨ -conjugacy class of (φ|WF , uφ , ρi ) is determined by any irreducible C[Wt◦ ]subrepresentation of L Σqt (φ, ρ).
Proof. (a) By Theorem 5.5 (with C-coefficients) every (φ, ρ) ∈ L Ψ−1 (L L, φv , qǫ) determines a unique irreducible representation qΣqt (uφ , ρ) of C[Wqt , κqt ]. Conversely,

every τ ∈ Irr(C[Wqt , κqt ]) gives rise to a unique qΣ−1

determines an enhanced L-parameter (φ|WF , uφ , ρ) for L H. It remains to see that
∨ )WF -character as qǫ. By
(φ|WF , uφ , ρ) is H-relevant. By (67) ρ has the same Z(Hsc
the assumed H-relevance of qǫ, ρ is H-relevant. By Definition 6.6, (φ|WF , uφ , ρ) is
also H-relevant.
(b) This is a direct consequence of Theorem 5.5.b.
(c) By the irreducibility of ρ, all the ρi are ZG (φ)-conjugate. Similarly the irreducibility of the C[Wqt , κqt ]-representation τ = L Σqt (φ, ρ) implies (with Theorem 1.2) that

all the irreducible C[Wt◦ ]-constituents τi of τ are Wqt -conjugate. By part (b) τi
determines a pair (uφ , ρi ) up to G◦ -conjugacy. Hence it determines (φ|WF , uφ , ρi )
up to H∨ -conjugacy.

We will promote Proposition 9.1 to a statement involving extended quotients. By
Lemma 8.2 Ws∨ ,φv ,qǫ = Wqt , so we can regard κqt as a 2-cocycle κφv ,qǫ of Ws∨ ,φv ,qǫ .
Then we can build

Comparing with (13), we see that we still need an action on Ws∨ on this set.

Lemma 9.2. Let w ∈ Ws∨ and z ∈ Xnr (L L) with w(φv , qǫ) ∼
= (zφ, qǫ). There exists
a family of algebra isomorphisms (for various such w, z)
ψw,φv ,qǫ : C[Ws∨ ,φv ,qǫ , κφv ,qǫ ] → C[Ws∨ ,zφv ,qǫ , κzφv ,qǫ ]

The canonicity in part (b) can be expressed as follows. Given (L, φv , qǫ, τ ◦ ) with
τ ◦ ∈ Irr(Wt◦ ), the set

L
s∨
(φv |WF , qΣ−1
: τ ∈ Irr(C[Ws∨ ,φv ,qǫ , κφv ,qǫ ]) contains τ ◦
qt (τ )) ∈ Φe ( H)
is canonically determined.
It would be interesting to know when the above 2-cocycles κ are trivial on Ws∨ .
Theorem 9.3.b shows that this happens quite often, in particular whenever Ws∨
fixes a point (L L, z ′ φv , qǫ) ∈ s∨ and at the same time Ws∨ equals the Weyl group
1 (z ′ φ|
W (G◦z ′ , L), where Gz ′ = ZH
∨
WF ).
sc

Example 9.4. Yet there are also cases in which κ is definitely not trivial. Take
H = SL5 (D), where D is a quaternion division algebra over F . This is an inner form
of SL10 (F ) and L H = PGL10 (C) × WF .
We will rephrase Example 3.2 with L-parameters. We can ignore the factor WF
of L H, because it acts trivially on H∨ . Let φ : WF → SL2 (C)5 be a group homomorphism whose image is the group Q from Example 3.2. It projects to a homomorphism φ|WF : WF → PGL10 (C). Let u and ǫ be as in the same example. These
data determine an enhanced L-parameter (φ, ǫ) for H. The group
G = NSL10 (C) (Q) = ZH∨sc (φ(WF ))
was considered in Example 3.2. We checked over there that Ws∨ ∼
= (Z/2Z)2 and that
its 2-cocycle κs∨ ,φ,ǫ is nontrivial. We remark that this fits with the non-triviality of
the 2-cocycle in [ABPS3, Example 5.5], which is essentially the same example, but
on the p-adic side of the LLC.
Just like L Ψ in Lemma 7.11, the maps from Theorem 9.3 are compatible with the
Langlands classification for L-parameters from Theorem 7.10.
Lemma 9.5. Let (φ, ρ) ∈ Φe (H) and let (L, φt , z, ρt ) be the enhanced standard triple
associated to it by Theorem 7.10.
(a) Write qΨG (uφ , ρ) = qt = [M, CvM , qǫ]G , G2 = ZL1 ∨sc (φ|WF ), M2 = ZG2 (Z(M )◦ )
and qtL = [M2 , CvM2 , qǫ2 ]Gt as in the proof of Lemma 7.11. Then Wqt ∼
= WqtL .
(b) The image of (φ, ρ) ∈ Φe (H) under Theorem 9.3.a equals the image of (zφt , ρt ) ∈
Φe (L). The latter can be expressed as z · (L ΨL (φt , ρt ), qΣqtL (uφt , ρt )).
Proof. Because all the maps are well-defined on conjugacy classes of enhanced Lparameters, we may assume that φ = zφt and ρ = ρt .
(a) Recall from Lemma 8.2 that
Wqt ∼
= W (L H, ZL H (Z(M )◦ ))φv ,qǫ ,
(131)
WqtL ∼
= W (L L, ZL H (Z(M )◦ ))φv ,qǫ2 .
The argument following (111) shows that we may replace qǫ2 by qǫ here. Let L∅ be
the unique minimal standard Levi subgroup of H∨ . Then
W (L H, ZL (Z(M )◦ )) ∼
= N L L (Z(M )◦ ))/W (ZL (Z(M )◦ ), L L∅ ),

58

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

W (L H, L L∅ ) is the group generated by the reflections that fix z, which is precisely
W (L L, L L∅ ).
Since φt is bounded and z determines an unramified character of L with values
in R>0 , every element of Wqt must fix both φt |WF and z. By the above Wqt ⊂
W (L L, L L∅ ), and then (131) shows that Wqt = WqtL .
(b) From Lemma 7.11 we know that L ΨH (φ, ρ) = L ΨL (φ, ρ). By Proposition 5.6
qΣqtL (uφ , ρ)

is a constituent of

Res

By Lemma 5.4

EndG (π∗ (qE))
= C[Wqt , κqt ] and EndGt (π∗Gt (qE

By Proposition 5.6.b κqt |WqtL = κqtL , so in view of part (a) these two algebras are
equal. Thus qΣqtL (uφ , ρ) = qΣqt (uφ , ρ). Together with Lemma 7.11 this shows that
the image of (φ, ρ) under Theorem 9.3.a is the same for H and for L.
Since z lifts to a central element of L∨ , qtL is the same for (φt , ρt ) and (zφt , ρt ).
That goes also for qΣqtL (uφt , ρt ). In combination with Lemma 7.11 we find that
(L ΨL (zφt , ρt ), qΣqtL (uφt , ρt )) = z · (L ΨL (φt , ρt ), qΣqtL (uφt , ρt )).
