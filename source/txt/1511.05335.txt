Abstract. Let H be any reductive p-adic group. We introduce a notion of cuspidality for enhanced Langlands parameters for H, which conjecturally puts supercuspidal H-representations in bijection with such L-parameters. We also define
a cuspidal support map and Bernstein components for enhanced L-parameters,
in analogy with Bernstein‚Äôs theory of representations of p-adic groups. We check
that for several well-known reductive groups these analogies are actually precise.
Furthermore we reveal a new structure in the space of enhanced L-parameters
for H, that of a disjoint union of twisted extended quotients. This is an analogue
of the ABPS conjecture (about irreducible H-representations) on the Galois side
of the local Langlands correspondence. Only, on the Galois side it is no longer
conjectural. These results will be useful to reduce the problem of finding a local
Langlands correspondence for H-representations to the corresponding problem for
supercuspidal representations of Levi subgroups of H.
The main machinery behind this comes from perverse sheaves on algebraic
groups. We extend Lusztig‚Äôs generalized Springer correspondence to disconnected
complex reductive groups G. It provides a bijection between, on the one hand,
pairs consisting of a unipotent element u in G and an irreducible representation
of the component group of the centralizer of u in G, and, on the other hand,
irreducible representations of a set of twisted group algebras of certain finite
groups. Each of these twisted group algebras contains the group algebra of a
Weyl group, which comes from the neutral component of G.

Introduction
As the title suggests, this paper consists of two parts. The first part is purely in
complex algebraic geometry, and is accessible without any knowledge of the Langlands program or p-adic groups. We start with discussing the second part though,
which is an application of and a motivation for the first part.
The local Langlands correspondence (LLC) predicts a relation between two rather
different kinds of objects: on the one hand irreducible representations of reductive
groups over a local field F , on the other hand some sort of representations of the
Weil‚ÄìDeligne group of F . According to the original setup [Bor, Lan], it should be
possible to associate to every L-parameter a finite packet of irreducible admissible
representations. Later this was improved by enhancing L-parameters [Lus1, KaLu],
and the modern interpretation [ABPS6, Vog] says that the LLC should be a bijection
(when formulated appropriately).
We consider only non-archimedean local fields F , and we speak of the Galois side
versus the p-adic side of the LLC. The conjectural bijectivity makes it possible to
transfer many notions and ideas from on side of the LLC to the other. Indeed,
a main goal of this paper is to introduce an analogue, on the Galois side, of the
Bernstein theory [BeDe] for smooth representations of reductive p-adic groups.
Bernstein‚Äôs starting point is the notion of a supercuspidal representation. For a
long time it has been unclear how to translate this to the Galois side. In [Mou,
Def. 4.12] the second author found the (probably) correct notion for split reductive
p-adic groups, which we generalize here.
For maximal generality, we adhere to the setup for L-parameters from [Art2].
Let WF be the Weil group of F , let H be a connected reductive group over F
‚à® be the adjoint group of
and let L H = H‚à® ‚ãä WF be its dual L-group. Let Had

‚à® and let G = Z 1 (œÜ(W )) be its inverse image in H‚à® .

H‚à®

We propose (see Definition 6.8) to call an enhanced L-parameter (œÜ, œÅ) for H
cuspidal if u = œÜ(1, ( 10 11 )) and œÅ, considered as data for the complex reductive
group G, form a cuspidal pair. This is turn means that the restriction of œÅ from
AG (u) = œÄ0 (ZG (u)) to AG‚ó¶ (u) is a direct sum of cuspidal representations in Lusztig‚Äôs
sense [Lus2]. We emphasize that it is essential to use L-parameters enhanced with
a representation of a suitable component group, for cuspidality cannot be detected
from the L-parameter alone.
Let Irrcusp (H) be the set of supercuspidal H-representations (up to isomorphism)
and let Œ¶cusp (H) be the set of H‚à® -conjugacy classes of cuspidal L-parameters for
H. It is known that in many cases such cuspidal L-parameters do indeed parametrize supercuspidal representations, and that moreover there is a nice bijection
Irrcusp (H) ‚Üí Œ¶cusp (H).
Based on this notion, we develop a cuspidal support map for enhanced L-parameters
(Definition 7.7). It assigns to every enhanced L-parameter for H a Levi subgroup
L ‚äÇ H and a cuspidal L-parameter for L, unique up to conjugation. We conjecture
that this map is a precise analogue of Bernstein‚Äôs cuspidal support map for irreducible H-representations, in the sense that these cuspidal support maps commute
with the respective local Langlands correspondences (assuming that these exist of
course).

A result for p-adic groups which has already been transferred to the Galois side
is the Langlands classification [SiZi]. On the p-adic side it reduces Irr(H) to the
tempered duals of Levi subgroups of H, while on the Galois side it reduces general
(enhanced) L-parameters to bounded L-parameters for Levi subgroups. We show
(Lemma 7.11) that our cuspidal support map factors through through the Langlands
classification on the Galois side, just like Bernstein‚Äôs cuspidal support map on the
p-adic side.
Recall that a crucial role in the Bernstein decomposition is played by inertial
equivalence classes of (super)cuspidal pairs for H. These consist of a Levi subgroup L ‚äÇ H and a supercuspidal representation thereof, up to equivalence by
H-conjugation and twists by unramified characters. Since the LLC for unramified
characters is known, we can easily translate this to a notion of inertial equivalence
classes of enhanced L-parameters (Definition 8.1). Using the cuspidal support map,
we can also partition the set of enhanced L-parameters Œ¶e (H) into countably many
‚à®
Bernstein components Œ¶e (H)s , parametrized by the inertial equivalence classes s‚à® ,
see (113).
Let L ‚äÇ H be a Levi subgroup, and let
W (H, L) = NH (L)/L
be its ‚ÄùWeyl‚Äù group. In [ABPS6] it was shown to be naturally isomorphic to
NH‚à® (L‚à® ‚ãä WF )/L‚à® , so it acts on both Irrcusp (L) and Œ¶cusp (L).
Our main result provides a complete description of the space of enhanced Lparameters Œ¶e (H) in terms of cuspidal L-parameters for Levi subgroups, and the
associated Weyl groups. It discovers a new structure in Œ¶e (H), that of a union of
extended quotients. It improves on both the Langlands classification and the theory
of the Bernstein centre (on the Galois side of the LLC).

in particular it is redundant for inner twists of split groups.

Let Lev(H) be a set of representatives for the conjugacy classes of Levi subgroups of
H. There exists a bijection

L‚ààLev(H)

Here (¬∑//¬∑)Œ∫ denotes a twisted extended quotient, as defined in (13). The bijection
is not entirely canonical, but we provide a sharp bound on the non-canonicity. We
note that the bijection is not based on the earlier cuspidal support map, but rather
on a modification thereof, which preserves boundedness of L-parameters.
We expect that Theorem 1 will turn out to be an analogue of the ABPS conjecture
[ABPS6] on the Galois side of the LLC. To phrase this precisely in general, we need
yet another ingredient.
Conjecture 2. Let H be a connected reductive group over a local non-archimedean
field, and let Irr(H) denote the set of its irreducible smooth representations. There

with the following maps:
‚Ä¢ The right hand side is Theorem 1.
‚Ä¢ The upper horizontal map is a local Langlands correspondence for H.
‚Ä¢ The lower horizontal map is obtained from local Langlands correspondences
for Irrcusp (L) by applying (¬∑//W (H, L))Œ∫ .
‚Ä¢ The left hand side is the bijection in the ABPS conjecture [ABPS6, ¬ß2].
With this conjecture one can reduce the problem of finding a LLC for H to that
of finding local Langlands correspondences for supercuspidal representations of its
Levi subgroups. Conjecture 2 is currently known in the following cases:
‚Ä¢ inner forms of GLn (F ) [ABPS5, Theorem 5.3],
‚Ä¢ inner forms of SLn (F ) [ABPS5, Theorem 5.6],
‚Ä¢ split classical groups [Mou, ¬ß5.3],
‚Ä¢ principal series representations of split groups [ABPS4, ¬ß16].
Now we come to the main technique behind the above: generalizations of the
Springer correspondence. Let G‚ó¶ be a connected complex reductive group with a
maximal torus T and Weyl group W (G‚ó¶ , T ). Recall that the original Springer correspondence [Spr] is a bijection between the irreducible representations of W (G‚ó¶ , T )
and G‚ó¶ -conjugacy classes of pairs (u, Œ∑), where u ‚àà G‚ó¶ is unipotent and Œ∑ is an
irreducible representation of AG‚ó¶ (u) = œÄ0 (ZG‚ó¶ (u)) which appears in the homology
of the variety of Borel subgroups of G‚ó¶ containing u.
Lusztig [Lus2] generalized this to a setup which includes all pairs (u, Œ∑) with
u ‚àà G‚ó¶ unipotent and Œ∑ ‚àà Irr(AG‚ó¶ (u)). On the other side of the correspondence he
replaced Irr(W (G‚ó¶ , T )) by a disjoint union ‚äît‚ó¶ Irr(Wt‚ó¶ ), where t‚ó¶ = [L, v, «´]G‚ó¶ runs
through cuspidal pairs (v, «´) for Levi subgroups L of G‚ó¶ , and Wt‚ó¶ = W (G‚ó¶ , L) is the
Weyl group associated to t‚ó¶ .
More precisely, Lusztig first attaches to (u, Œ∑) a cuspidal support t‚ó¶ = Œ®G‚ó¶ (u, Œ∑),
‚àí1 ‚ó¶
and then he constructs a bijection Œ£t‚ó¶ between Œ®G
‚ó¶ (t ) and Irr(Wt‚ó¶ ). In Section 2
we recall these constructions in more detail, and we prove:
Theorem 3. The maps Œ®G‚ó¶ and Œ£t‚ó¶ are equivariant with respect to algebraic automorphisms of the group G‚ó¶ .
Given a Langlands parameter œÜ for H, we would like to apply this machinery
1 (œÜ(W )). However, we immediately run into the problem that this
to G = ZH
‚à®
F
sc
complex reductive group is usually not connected. Thus we need a generalization
of Lusztig‚Äôs correspondence to disconnected reductive groups. Although there exist
generalizations of the Springer correspondence in various directions [AcHe, AHJR,
AcSa, Lus2, Lus5, LuSp, Sor], this particular issue has not yet been addressed in
the literature.
We would like to have a version which transforms every pair (u, Œ∑) for G into an
irreducible representation of some Weyl group. But this turns out to be impossible!

The problem is illustrated by Example 3.2: we have to use twisted group algebras
of groups Wt which are not necessarily Weyl groups.
When G is disconnected, we define the cuspidal support map by
Œ®G (u, Œ∑) = Œ®G‚ó¶ (u, Œ∑ ‚ó¶ )/G-conjugacy,
A (u)

where Œ∑ ‚ó¶ is any constituent of ResAG‚ó¶ (u) Œ∑. This is well-defined by the Ad(G)G
equivariance of Œ®G‚ó¶ from Theorem 3.
For a cuspidal support t = [L, v, «´]G (where L is a Levi subgroup of G‚ó¶ ), we put
Wt = NG (L, v, «´)/L

and

t‚ó¶ = [L, v, «´]G‚ó¶ .

Then Wt contains Wt‚ó¶ = W (G‚ó¶ , L) as a normal subgroup.
Theorem 4. (See Theorem 4.7 and Proposition 4.5)
Let t = [L, v, «´]G be a cuspidal support for G. There exist:
‚Ä¢ a 2-cocycle ‚ôÆt : Wt /Wt‚ó¶ √ó Wt /Wt‚ó¶ ‚Üí C√ó ,
‚Ä¢ a twisted group algebra C[Wt , ‚ôÆt ],
‚Ä¢ a bijection Œ®‚àí1
G (t) ‚Üí Irr(C[Wt , ‚ôÆt ]) which extends [Lus2].
C[W ,‚ôÆ ]

Moreover the composition of the bijection with ResC[Wt‚ó¶ ]t is canonical.
t

Of course the proof of Theorem 4 starts with Lusztig‚Äôs generalized Springer correspondence for G‚ó¶ . Ultimately it involves a substantial part of the techniques and
objects from [Lus2], in particular we consider similar varieties and sheafs. In Section 3 we provide an expression for the 2-cocycle ‚ôÆt , derived from the cuspidal case
L = G‚ó¶ .
Yet Œ®G and Theorem 4 still do not suffice for our plans with Langlands parameters. Namely, suppose that (œÜ, œÅ) is an enhanced L-parameter
for H and apply Œ®G

1 (œÜ(W )) and (u, Œ∑) = œÜ(1, ( 1 1 )), œÅ . We end up with t = [L, v, «´] ,
with G = ZH
‚à®
F
G

sc
‚ó¶
where L is a Levi subgroup of G . But the cuspidal support map for L-parameters
should produce an enhanced L-parameter for a Levi subgroup L of H, and that
would involve a possibly disconnected group ZL1 ‚à®sc (œÜ(WF )) instead of L.
To resolve this problem, we consider quasi-Levi subgroups of G. These are groups
of the form M = ZG (Z(L)‚ó¶ ), where L ‚äÇ G‚ó¶ is a Levi subgroup (and hence M ‚ó¶ =
L). With these one can define a quasi-cuspidal support, a triple (M, v, q«´) with
A (v)
v ‚àà M ‚ó¶ unipotent and q«´ ‚àà Irr(AM (v)) such that ResAM ‚ó¶ (v) q«´ is a sum of cuspidal
M
representations. The cuspidal support map Œ®G can be adjusted to a canonical quasicuspidal support map qŒ®G , see (64). It is this map that gives us the cuspidal support
of enhanced L-parameters.
To a quasi-cuspidal support qt = [M, v, q«´]G we associate the group Wqt =
NG (M, v, q«´)/M , which (again) contains Wt‚ó¶ = NG‚ó¶ (M ‚ó¶ )/M ‚ó¶ .
Theorem 5. (See Theorem 5.5 and Lemma 5.4)
Theorem 4 also holds with quasi-Levi subgroups and with the quasi-cuspidal support
qt instead of t. It gives a bijection qŒ®‚àí1
G (qt) ‚Üí Irr(C[Wqt , Œ∫qt ]) which is canonical in
the same degree as for t.
The derivation of Theorem 5 from Theorem 4 relies to a large extent on (elementary) results about twisted group algebras, which we put in Section 1. The bijection
from Theorem 5 is extensively used in Section 9, for Theorem 1.

1. Twisted group algebras and normal subgroups
Throughout this section Œì is a finite group and K is an algebraically closed field
whose characteristic does not divide the order of Œì. Suppose that ‚ôÆ : Œì √ó Œì ‚Üí K √ó
is a 2-cocycle, that is,
(1)

‚ôÆ(Œ≥1 , Œ≥2 Œ≥3 )‚ôÆ(Œ≥2 , Œ≥3 ) = ‚ôÆ(Œ≥1 , Œ≥2 )‚ôÆ(Œ≥1 Œ≥2 , Œ≥3 )

‚àÄŒ≥1 , Œ≥2 , Œ≥3 ‚àà Œì.

The ‚ôÆ-twisted group algebra of Œì is defined to be the K-vector space K[Œì, ‚ôÆ] with
basis {TŒ≥ : Œ≥ ‚àà Œì} and multiplication rules
(2)

TŒ≥ TŒ≥ ‚Ä≤ = ‚ôÆ(Œ≥, Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ )TŒ≥Œ≥ ‚Ä≤

Œ≥, Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà Œì.

Its representations can be considered as projective Œì-representations. Schur showed
(see [CuRe, Theorem 53.7]) that there exists a finite central extension ŒìÃÉ of Œì, such
that
‚Ä¢ char(K) does not divide |ŒìÃÉ|,
‚Ä¢ every irreducible projective Œì-representation over K lifts to an irreducible
K-linear representation of ŒìÃÉ.
Then K[Œì, ‚ôÆ] is a direct summand of K[ŒìÃÉ], namely the image of a minimal idempotent
in K[ker(ŒìÃÉ ‚Üí Œì)]. The condition on char(K) ensures that K[ŒìÃÉ] is semisimple, so
K[Œì, ‚ôÆ] is also semisimple.
Let N be a normal subgroup of Œì and (œÄ, VœÄ ) an irreducible representation of
N over K. We abbreviate this to œÄ ‚àà IrrK (N ). We want to analyse the set of
irreducible Œì-representations whose restriction to N contains œÄ.
More generally, suppose that ‚ôÆ is a 2-cocycle of Œì/N . We identify it with a 2cocycle Œì √ó Œì ‚Üí K √ó that factors through (Œì/N )2 . We also want to analyse the
irreducible representations of K[Œì, ‚ôÆ] that contain œÄ.
For Œ≥ ‚àà Œì we define Œ≥ ¬∑ œÄ ‚àà IrrK (N ) by
(3)

(Œ≥ ¬∑ œÄ)(n) = œÄ(Œ≥ ‚àí1 nŒ≥).

This determines an action of Œì and of Œì/N on Irr(N ). Let ŒìœÄ be the isotropy group
of œÄ in Œì. For every Œ≥ ‚àà ŒìœÄ we choose a I Œ≥ = IœÄŒ≥ ‚àà AutK (VœÄ ) such that
(4)

I Œ≥ ‚ó¶ œÄ(Œ≥ ‚àí1 nŒ≥) = œÄ(n) ‚ó¶ I Œ≥

‚àÄn ‚àà N.

Thus I Œ≥ ‚àà HomN (Œ≥ ¬∑œÄ, œÄ). Given another Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà Œì, we can regard I Œ≥ also as an element
‚Ä≤
of HomN (Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ ¬∑Œ≥ ¬∑œÄ, Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ ¬∑œÄ), and then it can be composed with I Œ≥ ‚àà HomN (Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ ¬∑œÄ, œÄ). By
Schur‚Äôs lemma all these maps are unique up to scalars, so there exists a Œ∫œÄ (Œ≥, Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ ) ‚àà
K √ó with
(5)

‚Ä≤

‚Ä≤

I Œ≥Œ≥ = Œ∫œÄ (Œ≥, Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ )I Œ≥ ‚ó¶ I Œ≥ .

On comparing this with (1), one sees that Œ∫œÄ : ŒìœÄ √ó ŒìœÄ ‚Üí K √ó is a 2-cocycle. Notice
Œ≥
that the algebra K[ŒìœÄ , Œ∫‚àí1
œÄ ] acts on VœÄ by TŒ≥ 7‚Üí I . Let [ŒìœÄ /N ] ‚äÇ ŒìœÄ be a set of
representatives for ŒìœÄ /N . We may pick the I Œ≥ such that
(6)

I Œ≥ÃÉn = I Œ≥ÃÉ ‚ó¶ œÄ(n) ‚àÄŒ≥ÃÉ ‚àà [ŒìœÄ /N ], n ‚àà N.

It follows from (4) that I nŒ≥ÃÉ = œÄ(n) ‚ó¶ I Œ≥ÃÉ and that Œ∫œÄ factors as
Œ∫œÄ : ŒìœÄ √ó ŒìœÄ ‚Üí ŒìœÄ /N √ó ŒìœÄ /N ‚Üí K √ó
Let ‚ôÆ : Œì/N √ó Œì/N ‚Üí K √ó be a 2-cocycle. Thus we can construct the twisted group
algebras K[Œì, ‚ôÆ] and K[ŒìœÄ /N, ‚ôÆŒ∫œÄ ]. To avoid confusion we denote the standard basis
elements of K[Œì, ‚ôÆ] by SŒ≥ .
Proposition 1.1. Let (œÑ, M ) be a representation of K[ŒìœÄ /N, ‚ôÆŒ∫œÄ ].

K[Œì,‚ôÆ]
‚Ä¢ K[Œì, ‚ôÆ]-subrepresentations of indK[N ] (VœÄ ).
K[Œì,‚ôÆ]

(d) We write œÑ ‚ãâ œÄ := indK[ŒìœÄ ] (M ‚äó VœÄ ). For any representation V of K[Œì, ‚ôÆ] there
is an isomorphism
HomK[Œì,‚ôÆ](œÑ ‚ãâ œÄ, V ) ‚àº

have established parts (a) and (b).
(d) We already saw that all these algebras are semisimple. In particular V is comK[Œì,‚ôÆ]

This result leads to a version of Clifford theory. We will formulate it in terms of
extended quotients, see [ABPS4, ¬ß2] or [ABPS5, Appendix B]. We briefly recall the
necessary definitions.
Suppose that Œì acts on some set X. Let Œ∫ be a given function which assigns to
each x ‚àà X a 2-cocycle Œ∫x : Œìx √ó Œìx ‚Üí C√ó , where Œìx = {Œ≥ ‚àà Œì : Œ≥x = x}. It is
assumed that Œ∫Œ≥x and Œ≥‚àó Œ∫x define the same class in H 2 (Œìx , K √ó ), where Œ≥‚àó : Œìx ‚Üí
ŒìŒ≥x , Œ± 7‚Üí Œ≥Œ±Œ≥ ‚àí1 . Define
eŒ∫ := {(x, œÅ) : x ‚àà X, œÅ ‚àà Irr K[Œìx , Œ∫x ]}.
X

We require, for every (Œ≥, x) ‚àà Œì √ó X, a definite algebra isomorphism
(12)

œÜŒ≥,x : K[Œìx , Œ∫x ] ‚Üí K[ŒìŒ≥x , Œ∫Œ≥x ]

such that:
‚Ä¢ œÜŒ≥,x is inner if Œ≥x = x;
‚Ä¢ œÜŒ≥ ‚Ä≤ ,Œ≥x ‚ó¶ œÜŒ≥,x = œÜŒ≥ ‚Ä≤ Œ≥,x for all Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ , Œ≥ ‚àà Œì, x ‚àà X.
We call these maps connecting homomorphisms, because they are reminiscent of a
eŒ∫ by
connection on a vector bundle. Then we can define Œì-action on X
Œ≥ ¬∑ (x, œÅ) = (Œ≥x, œÅ ‚ó¶ œÜ‚àí1
Œ≥,x ).

Let us return to the setting of Proposition 1.1.

Theorem 1.2. Let Œ∫‚ôÆ be the family of 2-cocycles which assigns Œ∫œÄ ‚ôÆ to œÄ ‚àà IrrK (N ).
There is a bijection

It will also be useful to analyse the structure of K[Œì, ‚ôÆ] as a bimodule over itself.
Let K[Œì, ‚ôÆ]op be the opposite algebra, and denote its standard basis elements by
SŒ≥ (Œ≥ ‚àà Œì).

‚àó : K[Œì, ‚ôÆ‚àí1 ] ‚Üí K[Œì, ‚ôÆ]op

where (h ¬∑ Œª)(v) = Œª(h‚àó ¬∑ v) for v ‚àà V, Œª ‚àà V ‚àó and h ‚àà K[Œì, ‚ôÆ‚àí1 ].
(c) Let K[Œì, ‚ôÆ] ‚äï K[Œì, ‚ôÆ‚àí1 ] act on K[Œì, ‚ôÆ] by (a, h) ¬∑ b = abh‚àó .

so * is an algebra homomorphism.
(b) Trivial, it holds for any finite dimensional algebra and its opposite.
(c) Let ŒìÃÉ be a Schur extension of Œì, as on page 6. As a representation of ŒìÃÉ √ó (ŒìÃÉ)op ,
K[ŒìÃÉ] decomposes in the asserted manner. Hence the same holds for its direct factor

2. The generalized Springer correspondence
Let G be a connected complex reductive group. The generalized Springer correspondence for G has been constructed by Lusztig. We will recall the main result of
[Lus2], and then we prove that Lusztig‚Äôs constructions are equivariant with respect
to automorphisms of algebraic groups.
Let l be a fixed prime number, and let Q‚Ñì be an algebraic closure of Q‚Ñì . For
compatibility with the literature we phrase our results with Q‚Ñì -coefficients. However,
by their algebro-geometric nature everything works just as well with coefficients in
any other algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.
For u a unipotent element in G, we denote by AG (u) the group of components
ZG (u)/ZG (u)‚ó¶ of the centralizer in G of u. We set
NG+ := {(u, Œ∑) : u ‚àà G unipotent, Œ∑ ‚àà IrrQ‚Ñì (AG (u))}/G-conjugacy.
The set NG+ is canonically in bijection with the set of pairs (CuG , F), where CuG is
the G-conjugacy class of a unipotent element u ‚àà G and F is an irreducible Gequivariant local system on CuG . The bijection associates to (CuG , F) an element
u ‚àà CuG and the representation of AG (u) on the stalk Fu .
Let P be a parabolic subgroup of G with unipotent radical U , and let L be a Levi
factor of P . Let v be a unipotent element in L. The group ZG (u) √ó ZL (v)U acts on
the variety

	
(16)
Yu,v := y ‚àà G : y ‚àí1 uy ‚àà vU
by (g, p) ¬∑ y = gyp‚àí1 , with g ‚àà ZG (u), p ‚àà ZL (v)U , and y ‚àà Yu,v . We have
dim Yu,v ‚â§ du,v :=

1
(dim ZG (u) + dim ZL (v)) + dim U.
2

The group AG (u) √ó AL (v) acts on the set of irreducible components of Yu,v of dimension du,v ; we denote by œÉu,v the corresponding permutation representation.
Let h , iAG (u) be the usual scalar product of the set of class functions on the finite
group AG (u) with values in Q‚Ñì . An irreducible representation Œ∑ of AG (u) is called
cuspidal (see [Lus2, Definition 2.4] and [LuSp, ¬ß0.4]) if
(17)

hŒ∑, œÉu,v iAG (u) 6= 0 implies that P = G.

The set of irreducible cuspidal representations of AG (u) (over Q‚Ñì ) is denoted by
Irrcusp (AG (u)), and we write
NG0 = {(u, Œ∑) : u ‚àà G unipotent, Œ∑ ‚àà Irrcusp (AG (u))}/G-conjugacy.
Given a pair (u, Œ∑) ‚àà NG+ , there exists a triple (P, L, v) as above and an
«´ ‚àà Irrcusp (AL (v))

such that hŒ∑ ‚äó «´‚àó , œÉu,v iAG (u)√óAL (v) 6= 0,

where «´‚àó is the dual of «´ (see [Lus2, ¬ß 6.2] and [LuSp, ¬ß0.4]). Moreover (P, L, v, «´)
is unique up to G-conjugation (see [Lus2, Prop. 6.3] and [LuSp]). We denote by
t := [L, CvL , «´]G the G-conjugacy class of (L, v, «´) and we call it the cuspidal support
of the pair (u, Œ∑). The centre Z(G) maps naturally to AG (u) and to AL (v). By
construction [Lus2, Theorem 6.5.a]
(18)

Œ∑ and «´ have the same Z(G)-character.

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
11

Let SG denote the set consisting of all triples (L, CvL , «´) (up to G-conjugacy) where
L is a Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup of G, CvL is the L-conjugacy class of a
unipotent element v in L and «´ ‚àà Irrcusp (AL (v)). Let
Œ®G : NG+ ‚Üí SG

(19)

be the map defined by sending the G-conjugacy class of (u, Œ∑) to its cuspidal support.
By (18) this map preserves the Z(G)-characters of the involved representations.
In [Lus2, 3.1], Lusztig defined a partition of G in a finite number of irreducible,
smooth, locally closed subvarieties, stable under conjugation. For all g ‚àà G, we
denote by gs the semisimple part of g. We say that g ‚àà G (or its conjugacy class) is
isolated if ZG (gs )‚ó¶ is not contained in any proper Levi subgroup of G. After [Lus2,
2.7], if t = [L, CvL , E] ‚àà SG , then CvL is isolated in L.
Let L be a Levi subgroup of G and S ‚äÇ L the inverse image of an isolated
conjugacy class of L/ZL‚ó¶ by the natural projection map L ÷â L/ZL‚ó¶ . Denote by
Sreg = {g ‚àà S, ZG (gs )‚ó¶ ‚äÇ L}
the set of regular elements in S. Consider the irreducible, smooth, locally closed
subvariety of G defined by
[
[
Y(L,S) =
gSreg g‚àí1 =
CxG .
g‚ààG

x‚ààSreg

We remark that Y(L,S) depends only on the G-conjugacy class of (L, S).
Now, let P = LUP a parabolic subgroup of G with Levi factor L, denote c =
(P, L, S), c = (L, S) and let
bc = {(g, x) ‚àà G √ó G, x‚àí1 gx ‚àà S ¬∑ UP },
X

Xc = {(g, xP ) ‚àà G √ó G/P, x‚àí1 gx ‚àà S ¬∑ UP },
where S is the closure of S. The subgroup P acts freely by translation on right on
bc /P = Xc . After [Lus2, 4.3], the
bc and X
the second coordinate of an element of X
projection on the first coordinate œÜc : Xc ‚àí‚Üí G is proper and its image is Y c .
The group ZL‚ó¶ acts on S by translation and L acts on S by conjugation. This gives
rises to an action of ZL‚ó¶ √ó L on S. The orbits form a stratification of S, in which S
bc ‚àí‚Üí S the map which associates to
is the unique open stratum. Denote by œÉc : X
‚àí1
bc ‚àí‚Üí Xc the map
(g, x) the projection of x gx ‚àà S ¬∑ UP on the factor S and ÃüP : X
b
defined for all (g, x) ‚àà Xc by ÃüP (g, x) = (g, xP ). To sum up, we have the following

where DYc (resp. DG Yc ) is the bounded derived category of Q‚Ñì -constructible sheaves
(resp. G-equivariant) on Yc . We denote by Irr(AE ) the set of (isomorphism classes
of) simple AE -modules and Q‚Ñì the constant sheaf.
Let Kc = IC(Xc , E) the intersection cohomology complex of Deligne‚ÄìGoresky‚Äì
MacPherson on Xc , with coefficients in E. Then (œÜc )! Kc is a complex on Y c .
Theorem 2.1. [Lus2, Theorem 6.5]
Let t = [L, CvL , E] ‚àà SG , (S, E) = (ZL‚ó¶ ¬∑ CvL , Q‚Ñì ‚ä† E) the corresponding cuspidal pair
for L and P a parabolic subgroup of G with Levi factor L. As before, we denote by
c = (P, L, S), c = (L, S) and (œÜc )! Kc the corresponding complex on Y c .
(1) Let (CuG , F) ‚àà NG+ . Then Œ®G (CuG , F) = (L, CvL , E), if and only if the following

(b) F is a direct summand of R CuG ,CvL (fc )! (E) CuG , where fc is the restriction
of œÜc to Xc,Œ± ‚äÇ Xc , dCuG ,CvL = (ŒΩG ‚àí 21 dim CuG ) ‚àí (ŒΩL ‚àí 12 dim CvL ), and
ŒΩG (resp. ŒΩL ) is the number of positive roots of G (resp. de L).

i.e.
M
(œÜc )! Kc =
œÅ ‚ä† ((œÜc )! Kc )œÅ .
œÅ‚ààIrr(AE )

Let Y c,un be the variety of unipotent elements in Y c . There exists an unique
pair (CuG , F) ‚àà NG+ which satisfies the following conditions:
(a) CuG ‚äÇ Y c ;
(b) ((œÜc )! Kc )œÅ Y c,un is isomorphic to IC(CuG , F)[2dCuG ,CvL ] extended by 0 on
Y c,un ‚àí CuG .

Œ£t : Œ®‚àí1

which associates œÅ to (CuG , F) is a bijection.
The relation of Theorem 2.1 with the classical Springer correspondence goes via
AE , which turns out to be isomorphic to the group algebra of a Weyl group. We
define
(20)

Wt := NG (t)/L = NG (L, CvL , E)/L.

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
13

Theorem 2.2. [Lus2, Theorem 9.2]
(a) Wt = NG (L)/L.
(b) NG (L)/L is the Weyl group of the root system R(G, Z(L)‚ó¶ ).
(c) There exists a canonical algebra isomorphism AE ‚àº
= Q‚Ñì [Wt ]. Together with The‚àí1
orem 2.1.(3) this gives a canonical bijection Œ®G (t) ‚Üí IrrQ‚Ñì (Wt ).
In fact there exist two such canonical algebra isomorphisms, for one can always
twist with the sign representation of Wt . When we employ generalized Springer
correspondences in relation with the local Langlands correspondence, we will always
use the isomorphism AE ‚àº
= Q‚Ñì [Wt ] such that the trivial Wt -representation is the
image of (CuG , E) under Theorem 2.2. (Here we extend E G-equivariantly to CuG ,
compare with [Lus2, 9.5].)
Let H be a group which acts on the connected complex reductive group G by
algebraic automorphisms. Then H acts also on NG+ and SG . Indeed, let h ‚àà H,
G
(CuG , F) ‚àà NG+ , t = [L, CvL , E]G ‚àà SG and œÅ ‚àà Irr(Wt ). Since h(G) = G, h CuG = Ch¬∑u
is a unipotent orbit of G. Similarly, h L is a Levi subgroup of G, h CvL is a unipotent
orbit of h L, etc.
We denote by h‚àó the pullback of sheaves along the isomorphism h‚àí1 : G ‚Üí G.

Œ£h¬∑t (h ¬∑ (CuG , F)) = h ¬∑ Œ£t (CuG , F).

Proof. We keep the notations of Theorem 2.1. Let h ‚àà H, (CuG , F) ‚àà NG+ , P a

irreducible cuspidal L-equivariant local system on CvL such that

By unicity, this shows that h‚àó E = h‚àó E. The third cartesian diagram shows, by the

3. Disconnected groups: the cuspidal case
First we recall Lusztig‚Äôs classification of unipotent cuspidal pairs for a connected
reductive group.
Theorem 3.1. (Lusztig)
Let G‚ó¶ be a connected complex reductive group and write Z = Z(G‚ó¶ )/Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ .
√ó

(a) Fix an Aut(G‚ó¶ )-orbit X of characters Z ‚Üí Q‚Ñì . There is at most one unipotent
‚ó¶
conjugacy class CuG which carries a cuspidal local system on which Z acts as an
‚ó¶
element of X. Moreover CuG is Aut(G‚ó¶ )-stable.

(b) Every cuspidal local system E on CuG is uniquely determined by the character by
which Z acts on it.
(c) The dimension of the cuspidal representation Eu of AG‚ó¶ (u) is a power of two
(possibly 20 = 1). It is one if G‚ó¶ contains no factors which are isomorphic to
spin or half-spin groups.
Proof. In [Lus2, ¬ß2.10] it is explained how the classification can be reduced to simply
connected, almost simple groups. Namely, first one notes that dividing out Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶
does not make an essential difference. Next everything is lifted to the simply connected cover GÃÉ of the semisimple group G‚ó¶ /Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ . Since every automorphism of
G‚ó¶ /Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ can be lifted to one of GÃÉ, the canonical image of X is contained in a
unique Aut(GÃÉ)-orbit XÃÉ on IrrQ‚Ñì (ZÃÉ), where ZÃÉ is the Z for GÃÉ. Furthermore GÃÉ is a
direct product of almost simple, simply connected groups, and XÃÉ decomposes as an
analogous product. Therefore it suffices to establish the theorem for simple, simply
connected groups Gsc .
(a) and (b) are shown in the case-by-case calculations in [Lus2, ¬ß10 and ¬ß14‚Äì15].
But (a) is not made explicit there, so let us comment on it. There are only few
cases in which one really needs an Aut(Gsc )-orbit Xsc in IrrQ‚Ñì (Z(Gsc )). Namely,
only the spin groups SpinN (C) where N > 1 is simultaneously a square and a
triangular number. These groups have precisely two unipotent conjugacy classes
that carry a cuspidal local system. One class, say C+ , supports precise the cuspidal
local systems which factor through SON (C), and the other, say C‚àí , supports the
remaining cuspidal local systems.
Let {1, ‚àí1} be the kernel of SpinN (C) ‚Üí SON (C), a characteristic subgroup of
SpinN (C). Lusztig‚Äôs classification shows that ‚àí1 acts as «´ on every cuspidal local
system supported on C«´ . As ‚àí1 is fixed by Aut(Gsc ), Xsc determines a unique
character of {1, ‚àí1} and thus specifies C+ or C‚àí .
This proves the first part of (a). For the second part, we notice that every algebraic
automorphism of G‚ó¶ maps a cuspidal local system on a unipotent conjugacy class
in G‚ó¶ with Z-character in X to another such local system.
(c) is obvious in types An , Cn and E6 , for then AGsc (u) is abelian. For the root
systems E8 , F4 and G2 , AGsc (u) is a symmetric group and Eu is the sign representation [Lus2, ¬ß15]. In type E7 [Miz, Table 9] shows that AGsc (u) ‚àº
= S3 √ó S2 . According
to [Lus2, ¬ß15.6], (E)u again has dimension one (it is the tensor product of the sign
representations of S3 and S2 ).
In types Bn and Dn , Gsc = SpinN (C) is a spin group. All the cuspidal local systems E for which the action of Z(Gsc ) factors through Z(SON (C)) are onedimensional, for ASON (C) (u) is abelian. If the character by which Z(Gsc ) acts on
E is not of this kind, then [Lus2, Proposition 14.4] says that dim(Eu ) is a power
of two. In that case the original G‚ó¶ has an almost direct factor isomorphic to
SpinN (C) or to a half-spin group HSpinN (C) = SpinN (C)/{1, œâ} (here N ‚àà 4N and
œâ ‚àà Z(SpinN (C)) \ {1, ‚àí1}).

Let G be a disconnected complex reductive group with neutral component G‚ó¶ .
We want to classify unipotent cuspidal pairs for G in terms of those for G‚ó¶ .
First we define them properly. For u ‚àà G‚ó¶ we call an irreducible representation
of AG (u) cuspidal if its restriction to AG‚ó¶ (u) is a direct sum of irreducible cuspidal
AG‚ó¶ (u)-representations. The set of irreducible cuspidal representations of AG (u)

16

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

(over Q‚Ñì ) is denoted by Irrcusp (AG (u)). We write
NG0 = {(u, Œ∑) : u ‚àà G unipotent, Œ∑ ‚àà Irrcusp (AG (u))}/G-conjugacy.
Notice that the unipotency forces u ‚àà G‚ó¶ . Every (u, Œ∑) ‚àà NG0 gives rise to a unique
G-equivariant local system F on CuG . We call any G-equivariant local system on CuG
cuspidal if and only if it arises in this way. Thus we may identify NG0 with the set
of pairs (CuG , F) where CuG is a unipotent conjugacy class in G and F is a cuspidal
local system on it. For example, if G‚ó¶ is a torus, then u = 1 and every irreducible
representation of AG (u) = G/G‚ó¶ is cuspidal.
It follows from (15) that there is a bijection


Irrcusp (AG (u)) ‚Üê‚Üí Irrcusp (AG‚ó¶ (u))//AG (u)/AG‚ó¶ (u) .
Œ∫

So we want to identify the 2-cocycles Œ∫«´ for «´ ‚àà Irrcusp (AG‚ó¶ (u)).
We note that there are natural isomorphisms
AG (u)/AG‚ó¶ (u) ‚Üê ZG (u)/ZG‚ó¶ (u) ‚Üí G/G‚ó¶ .

(21)

‚ó¶

In fact Theorem 3.1.a implies that CuG = CuG , which accounts for the surjectivity of
the map to the right.
Recall from [ABPS4, Lemma 4.2] that the short exact sequence
1 ‚Üí œÄ0 (ZG‚ó¶ (u)/Z(G‚ó¶ )) ‚Üí œÄ0 (ZG (u)/Z(G‚ó¶ )) ‚Üí G/G‚ó¶ ‚Üí 1

(22)

is split. However, the short exact sequence
1 ‚Üí œÄ0 (ZG‚ó¶ (u)/Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ ) ‚Üí œÄ0 (ZG (u)/Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ ) ‚Üí G/G‚ó¶ ‚Üí 1

(23)

need not be split. We choose a map
s : G/G‚ó¶ ‚Üí ZG (u)

(24)

such that the induced map G/G‚ó¶ ‚Üí œÄ0 (ZG (u)/Z(G‚ó¶ )) is a group homomorphism
that splits (22). The proof of [ABPS4, Lemma 4.2] shows that we can take s(gG‚ó¶ )
in ZG (G‚ó¶ ) whenever the conjugation action of g on G‚ó¶ is an inner automorphism of
G‚ó¶ . For all Œ≥, Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà G/G‚ó¶
s(Œ≥)s(Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ )s(Œ≥Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ )‚àí1 ‚àà Z(G‚ó¶ )ZG‚ó¶ (u)‚ó¶ ,
because it represents the neutral element of œÄ0 (ZG (u)/Z(G‚ó¶ )).
‚ó¶
Let (CuG , E) ‚àà NG0 ‚ó¶ . The group ZG‚ó¶ (u)‚ó¶ acts trivially on «´ = (E)u and by cuspidality Z(G‚ó¶ ) ‚äÇ Z(L) acts according to a character. Therefore

(26)

‚ôÆE : G/G‚ó¶ √ó G/G‚ó¶ ‚Üí Q‚Ñì

√ó
√ó

is a 2-cocycle. It depends on the choice of s, but its class in H 2 (G/G‚ó¶ , Q‚Ñì ) does
not. Another element u‚Ä≤ ‚àà CuG would give the same cocycle: just conjugate s with
a g ‚àà G‚ó¶ such that gug‚àí1 = u‚Ä≤ and use the same formulas. Thus the cohomology
class of ‚ôÆE depends only on E. Via the isomorphism (21) we also get a 2-cocycle
√ó

‚ôÆE : AG (u)/AG‚ó¶ (u) √ó AG (u)/AG‚ó¶ (u) ‚Üí Q‚Ñì .
It will turn out that the 2-cocycles ‚ôÆE are trivial in many cases, in particular whenever
Z(G‚ó¶ ) acts trivially on E. But sometimes their cohomology class is nontrivial.

The twisted group algebra Q‚Ñì [G/G‚ó¶ , ‚ôÆE ] is isomorphic with M2 (Q‚Ñì ). In particular
it has precisely one irreducible representation. This agrees with the number of
representations of AG (u) that we want to obtain. Notice that, without the twisting,
Q‚Ñì [G/G‚ó¶ ] would have four inequivalent irreducible representations, too many for
this situation.
We return to our general setup. Let GE be the subgroup of G that stabilizes E
(up to isomorphism). It contains G‚ó¶ and by Theorem 3.1.b it coincides with the
stabilizer of the Z(G‚ó¶ )-character of E. By (21) there are group isomorphisms

Lemma 3.3. Let (u, «´) ‚àà NG0 ‚ó¶ . Then we can take Œ∫«´ = ‚ôÆ‚àí1
E
AG (u)«´ /AG‚ó¶ (u).
Proof. With (28) we translate the lemma to a statement about cocycles of
ZG (u)«´ /ZG‚ó¶ (u). For g ‚àà ZG (u)«´ we have to find I«´g : V«´ ‚Üí V«´ such that

‚àÄh ‚àà ZG‚ó¶ (u).
s(Œ≥)
I«´

Since ZG (u) = s(G/G‚ó¶ )ZG‚ó¶ (u), it suffices to find
for Œ≥ ‚àà GE /G‚ó¶ . Namely, then
s(Œ≥)h
s(Œ≥)
we can put I«´
= I«´ ‚ó¶ «´(h) for h ‚àà ZG‚ó¶ (u), as in (6).
‚ó¶
Let us consider (CuG , E) as a cuspidal local system for the simply connected cover
Gsc of G‚ó¶ /Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ . The action of G on G‚ó¶ by conjugation lifts to an action on
s(Œ≥)
Gsc and Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ acts trivially on «´. Hence it suffices to construct I«´
for «´ as a
representation of AGsc (u).
Then (AGsc (u), «´) decomposes as a direct product over almost simple factors of
Gsc . Factors with different cuspidal local systems have no interaction, so we may

18

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

assume that Gsc = H n , «´ = œÉ ‚äón with H simply connected and almost simple. The
conjugation action of G on H n is a combination of permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} and
automorphisms of H. If g ‚àà G permutes the factors of H n according to œÑ ‚àà Sn ,
then we can construct IœÉg‚äón as the permutation œÑ of VœÉ‚äón , combined with some
automorphisms of the vector space VœÉ . In this way we reduce to the case where Gsc
is almost simple.
Whenever «´ is one-dimensional, we simply put
(30)

I«´Œ≥ = I«´g = IdV«´

for g = s(Œ≥) ‚àà s(GE /G‚ó¶ ).

To deal with the remaining cases, we recall from Theorem 3.1.c that in all those
instances Gsc = SpinN (C) is a spin group and that the action of Z(Gsc ) on E does
not factor through Z(SON (C)).
Suppose first that N ‚â• 3 is odd. Then Gsc is of type B(N ‚àí1)/2 and all its automorphisms are inner. As explained after (24), we can take s(GE /G‚ó¶ ) in ZGE (G‚ó¶ ).
Thus (29) can be fulfilled by defining I«´g = IdV«´ .
Next we suppose that N is even, so Gsc is of type DN/2 . By [Lus2, Proposition
14.6] N = j(j + 1)/2 for some j ‚â• 2, and in particular Gsc is not isomorphic to the
group Spin8 (C) of type D4 . Let us write Z(Gsc ) = {1, ‚àí1, œâ, ‚àíœâ}, where

{1, ‚àí1} = ker SpinN (C) ‚Üí SON (C) .

Our assumptions entail that «´(‚àí1) 6= 1. For both characters of Z(Gsc ) with «´(‚àí1) =
‚àí1 there is exactly one cuspidal pair (CuGsc , E) on which Z(Gsc ) acts in this way
[Lus2, Proposition 14.6]. The group of outer automorphisms of Gsc has precisely
two elements. It interchanges œâ and ‚àíœâ, and hence it interchanges the two cuspidal pairs in question. Therefore the conjugation action of GE on Gsc is by inner
automorphisms of Gsc . Now the same argument as in the N odd case shows that
we may take I«´g = IdV«´ .
Thus (30) works in all cases under consideration. The defining property of s
entails that
(31)

‚Ä≤

‚Ä≤

I«´Œ≥ ‚ó¶ I«´Œ≥ = ‚ôÆE (Œ≥, Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ )I«´Œ≥Œ≥ .

Together (28) this shows that the lemma holds when Gsc is almost simple. In view
of our earlier reduction steps, that implies the general case.

Let Y ‚äÇ G‚ó¶ be the set of regular elements of CuG Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ , that is, the set of
y ‚àà CuG Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ with dim ZG (y) = dim ZG (u). Tensoring E with the constant sheaf
on Z(G‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ , we obtain a G‚ó¶ -equivariant cuspidal local system on Y . We also denote
that by E.
Next we build a G-equivariant local system on Y which contains every extension
of «´ to an irreducible representation of AG (u). The construction is the same as in
[Lus2, ¬ß3.2], only for a disconnected group. Via the map
Y √ó G ‚Üí Y : (y, g) 7‚Üí g ‚àí1 yg
we pull E back to a local system EÀÜ on Y √ó G. It is G √ó G‚ó¶ -equivariant for the action

The G‚ó¶ action is free, so we can divide it out and obtain a G-equivariant local
system EÃÉ on Y √ó G/G‚ó¶ such that its pull back under the natural quotient map
is isomorphic to EÃÇ, see [BeLu, 2.6.3]. Let œÄ : Y √ó G/G‚ó¶ ‚Üí Y be the projection
on the first coordinate. It is a G-equivariant fibration, so the direct image œÄ‚àó EÀú is

In other words, we can consider œÄ‚àó EÃÉ as the induction of (E)Y from G‚ó¶ to G.
Lemma 3.4. The G-endomorphism algebra of œÄ‚àó EÃÉ is isomorphic with Q‚Ñì [GE /G‚ó¶ , ‚ôÆE ].
Once ‚ôÆE has been chosen, the isomorphism is canonical up to twisting by characters
of GE /G‚ó¶ .
Proof. By [Lus2, Proposition 3.5], which applies also in the disconnected case,
EndG (œÄ‚àó EÃÉ) is canonically a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces AŒ≥ with Œ≥ ‚àà
GE /G‚ó¶ . We need to specify one element in each of these subspaces to obtain a
twisted group algebra. Recall the isomorphisms (28) and the map s from (24). For
g = s(Œ≥) ‚àà s(GE /G‚ó¶ ) we define
I«´Œ≥ = I«´g : (E)u ‚Üí (E)u
as in the proof of Lemma 3.3. We already saw in (31) that the I«´Œ≥ span an algebra
isomorphic to Q‚Ñì [GE /G‚ó¶ , ‚ôÆE ]. Each I«´Œ≥ extends uniquely to an isomorphism of Gequivariant local systems
(35)

IEŒ≥ : (E)Y ‚Üí Ad(Œ≥)‚àó (E)Y .

We can consider this as a family of Q‚Ñì -linear maps
ÀÜ (y,g) = (E)g‚àí1 yg ‚Üí (EÃÇ)(y,gŒ≥ ‚àí1 ) = (E)Œ≥g‚àí1 ygŒ≥ ‚àí1 .
IEŒ≥ : (E)
ÀÜ of EÃÉ and of œÄ‚àó E.
Àú The latter
Consequently the IEŒ≥ induce automorphisms of E,
automorphism belongs to AŒ≥ and we take it as element of the required basis of
EndG (œÄ‚àó EÃÉ).
Any other choice of an isomorphism as in the lemma would differ from the first
one by an automorphism of Q‚Ñì [GE /G‚ó¶ , ‚ôÆE ] which stabilizes each of the subspaces
Q‚Ñì TŒ≥ . Every such automorphism is induced by a character of GE /G‚ó¶ .

We note that the isomorphism in Lemma 3.4 is in general not canonical, because
s and the constructions in the proof of Lemma 3.3 are not. In the final result of this
section, we complete the classification of unipotent cuspidal local systems on G.

Proof. The first map is canonical because its definition does not involve any arbitrary
choices. To show that it is a bijection, we fix an isomorphism as in Lemma 3.4. By
G-equivariance, it suffices to consider the claims at the stalk over u. Then we must

this way, for a unique œÅ ‚àà Irr(EndG (œÄ‚àó E)).

4. Disconnected groups: the non-cuspidal case
We would like to extend the generalized Springer correspondence for G‚ó¶ to G.
First we define the source and target properly.
Definition 4.1. For NG+ we use exactly the same definition as in the connected
case:
NG+ = {(u, Œ∑) : u ‚àà G unipotent , Œ∑ ‚àà IrrQ‚Ñì (AG (u))}/G-conjugacy.
As SG we take the same set as for G‚ó¶ , but now considered up to G-conjugacy:
SG = {unipotent cuspidal supports for G‚ó¶ }/G-conjugacy.
For t = [L, CvL , E]G ‚àà SG , let NG (t) be the stabilizer of (L, CvL , E) in G. We define
Wt as the component group of NG (t).
In the above notations, the group L stabilizes (L, CvL , E) and any element of G
which stabilizes (L, CvL , E) must normalize L. Hence L is the neutral component of
NG (t) and Wt = NG (t)/L is a subgroup of W (G, L) = NG (L)/L.
As in the connected case, NG+ is canonically in bijection with the set of pairs
(CuG , F), where CuG is the G-conjugacy class of a unipotent element u and F is an
irreducible G-equivariant local system on CuG .
We define a map Œ®G : NG+ ‚Üí SG in the following way. Let (u, Œ∑) ‚àà NG+ . With
Theorem 1.2 we can write Œ∑ = Œ∑ ‚ó¶ ‚ãäœÑ with Œ∑ ‚ó¶ ‚àà Irr(AG‚ó¶ (u)). Moreover Œ∑ ‚ó¶ is uniquely
determined by Œ∑ up to AG (u)-conjugacy. Then (u, Œ∑ ‚ó¶ ) ‚àà NG+‚ó¶ . Using (19) we put
(38)

Œ®G (u, Œ∑) := Œ®G‚ó¶ (u, Œ∑ ‚ó¶ )/G-conjugacy

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
21

By the G-equivariance of Œ®G‚ó¶ (Theorem 2.3), Œ®G (u, Œ∑) does not depend on the
choice of Œ∑ ‚ó¶ . Write
t‚ó¶ = [L, CvL , E]G‚ó¶
and consider Œ£t‚ó¶ (u, Œ∑ ‚ó¶ ) ‚àà Irr(Wt‚ó¶ ). Just as in (38), (L, CvL , E, Œ£t‚ó¶ (u, Œ∑ ‚ó¶ )) is uniquely
determined by (u, Œ∑), up to G-conjugacy.
We would like to define Œ£t such that Œ£t (u, Œ∑) is a representation of Wt whose
restriction to Wt‚ó¶ contains Œ£t‚ó¶ (u, Œ∑ ‚ó¶ ). However, in general this does not work. It
turns out that we have to twist the group algebra Q‚Ñì [Wt ] with a certain 2-cocycle,
which is trivial on Wt‚ó¶ . In fact we have already seen this in Section 3. Over there
L = G‚ó¶ , Wt‚ó¶ = 1, Wt = GE /G‚ó¶ and in Example 3.2 the group algebra of Wt had to
be twisted by a nontrivial 2-cocycle.
This twisting by nontrivial cocycles is only caused by the relation between irreducible representations of AG‚ó¶ (u) and AG (u). The next two results show that the
group Wt , considered on its own, would not need such twisting.
Lemma 4.2. There exists a subgroup Rt ‚äÇ Wt such that Wt = Rt ‚ãâ Wt‚ó¶ .
Proof. Thanks to Theorem 2.2, we know that Wt‚ó¶ equals W (G‚ó¶ , L) = NG‚ó¶ (L)/L. On
the other hand, Wt ‚äÇ W (G, L) acts on the root system R(G‚ó¶ , Z(L)‚ó¶ ). Fix a positive
subsystem and let Rt be its stabilizer in Wt . Since W (G‚ó¶ , L) is the Weyl group of
the root system R(G‚ó¶ , Z(L)‚ó¶ ) (see Theorem 2.2), it acts simply transitively on the
collection of positive systems in R(G‚ó¶ , Z(L)‚ó¶ ). As W (G‚ó¶ , L) is normal in W (G, L),
we obtain the decomposition of Wt as a semidirect product.

Proposition 4.3. Let œÄ ‚àà IrrQ‚Ñì (Wt‚ó¶ ). The cohomology class of Œ∫œÄ in
√ó

H 2 (Wt,œÄ /Wt‚ó¶ , Q‚Ñì ) is trivial.
Proof. This is the statement of [ABPS4, Proposition 4.3], which is applicable by
Lemma 4.2.

Let NG+ (t) be the inverse image of Rt in NG (t) ‚äÇ NG (L). Then L = NG+ (t)‚ó¶ and
Rt ‚àº
= NG+ (t)/NG+ (t)‚ó¶ . Thus (CvL , E) can be considered as a cuspidal pair for NG+ (t)‚ó¶ .
√ó
In (31) we constructed a 2-cocycle ‚ôÆE : Rt √ó Rt ‚Üí Q‚Ñì . With Lemma 4.2 we can
also consider it as a 2-cocycle of Wt , trivial on Wt‚ó¶ :

Lemma 4.4. Let F ‚ó¶ be the G‚ó¶ -equivariant local system on CuG corresponding to

Our construction of Œ£t will generalize that of Œ£t‚ó¶ in [Lus2], in particular we use
similar equivariant local systems. Recall that (L, CvL , E) is a cuspidal support. As
in [Lus2, ¬ß3.1] we put S = CvL Z(L)‚ó¶ and we extend E to a local system on S. We
say that an element y ‚àà S is regular if its centralizer in G has minimal dimension,
that is, dim ZG (y) = dim ZG (v). Consider the variety Y = Y(L,S) which is the union
of all conjugacy classes in G that meet the set of regular elements Sreg . We build
equivariant local systems EÀÜ on
YÃÇ := {(y, g) ‚àà Y √ó G : g ‚àí1 yg ‚àà Sreg }
and EÃÉ on YÃÉ := YÃÇ /L as in (32) and (33), only with L instead of G‚ó¶ . The projection
map YÃÉ ‚Üí Y : (y, g) 7‚Üí y is a fibration with fibre NG (L)/L, so
œÄ : YÃÉ ‚Üí Y gives a G-equivariant local system œÄ‚àó EÃÉ on Y.
The stalk of œÄ‚àó EÀú at y ‚àà Sreg is isomorphic, as ZL (y)-representation, to

On the part Y ‚ó¶ of Y that is G‚ó¶ -conjugate to Sreg , œÄ‚àó EÃÉ can also be considered as a
Àú Y ‚ó¶ contains the analogous local system
G‚ó¶ -equivariant local system. As such (œÄ‚àó E)
‚ó¶
‚ó¶
œÄ‚àó EÃÉ for G as a direct summand.
The following result generalizes Lemma 3.4.
Proposition 4.5. The G-endomorphism algebra of œÄ‚àó EÃÉ is isomorphic with Q‚Ñì [Wt , ‚ôÆE ].
Once ‚ôÆE has been chosen via (25), the isomorphism is canonical up to twisting by
characters of Wt /Wt‚ó¶ .
Proof. First we note that the results and proofs of [Lus2, ¬ß3] are also valid for the
disconnected group G. By [Lus2, Proposition 3.5] EndQ‚Ñì (œÄ‚àó EÃÉ) = EndG (œÄ‚àó EÃÉ), and
according to [Lus2, Remark 3.6] it is a twisted group algebra of Wt . It remains to
determine the 2-cocycle. Again by [Lus2, Proposition 3.5], EndG (œÄ‚àó EÃÉ) is naturally a
direct sum of one-dimensional Q‚Ñì -vector spaces AE,w (w ‚àà Wt ). An element of AE,w
consists of a system of Q‚Ñì -linear maps
(44)
EÀúy,g = Eg‚àí1 yg ‚Üí EÃÉy,gw‚àí1 = Ewg‚àí1 ygw‚àí1
and is determined by a single L-intertwining map E ‚Üí Ad(w)‚àó E.
For w ‚àà Wt‚ó¶ any element bw ‚àà AE,w also acts on œÄ‚àó EÃÉ ‚ó¶ . In [Lus2, Theorem 9.2.d]
a canonical isomorphism
‚àº Q‚Ñì [Wt‚ó¶ ],
(45)
EndG‚ó¶ (œÄ‚àó EÃÉ ‚ó¶ ) =
was constructed. Via this isomorphism we pick the bw (w ‚àà Wt‚ó¶ ), then
Àú
(46)
w 7‚Üí bw is a group homomorphism Wt‚ó¶ ‚Üí AutG (œÄ‚àó E).
In view of Lemma 4.2, we still to have find suitable bŒ≥ ‚àà AE,Œ≥ for Œ≥ ‚àà Rt . Let
nŒ≥ ‚àà NG+ (t) be a lift of Œ≥ ‚àà NG+ (t)/L. By [Lus2, ¬ß3.4-3.5] the choice of bŒ≥ is
equivalent to the choice of an automorphism IEŒ≥ of (E)S that lifts the map
S ‚Üí S : g 7‚Üí nŒ≥ gn‚àí1
Œ≥ .
Precisely such an automorphism was constructed (with the group NG+ (t) in the role
of G) in (35). We pick the unique bŒ≥ ‚àà AE,Œ≥ corresponding to this IEŒ≥ . Then the

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
23

multiplication rules for the bŒ≥ are analogous to those for the IEŒ≥ , so by Lemma 3.4
we get
bŒ≥ ¬∑ bŒ≥ ‚Ä≤ = ‚ôÆE (Œ≥, Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ )bŒ≥Œ≥ ‚Ä≤

(47)

Œ≥, Œ≥ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà Rt .

Using Lemma 4.2 we define bŒ≥w = bŒ≥ bw for Œ≥ ‚àà Rt , w ‚àà Wt‚ó¶ . Now (46) and (47)
imply that bw ¬∑ bw‚Ä≤ = ‚ôÆE (w, w‚Ä≤ )bww‚Ä≤ for all w, w‚Ä≤ ‚àà Wt .
The only noncanonical part in the construction of the above isomorphism is the
choice of the bŒ≥ ‚àà AE,Œ≥ with Œ≥ ‚àà Rt . Any other choice would differ from the above by
an automorphism of Q‚Ñì [Rt , ‚ôÆE ] which stabilizes each of the onedimensional subspaces
AE,w . Every such automorphism is induced by a character of Rt ‚àº

= Wt /Wt‚ó¶ .
Let (u, Œ∑ ‚ó¶ ) ‚àà NG+‚ó¶ . Recall the cocycle Œ∫Œ∑‚ó¶ of AG (u)Œ∑‚ó¶ /AG‚ó¶ (u) constructed from
Œ∑ ‚ó¶ ‚àà Irr(AG‚ó¶ (u)) in (5). Like ‚ôÆE it depends on some choices, but its cohomology
class does not.
Lemma 4.6. We can choose Œ∫Œ∑‚ó¶ equal to ‚ôÆ‚àí1
E from (41).
Proof. Let s : GCuG‚ó¶ /G‚ó¶ ‚Üí ZG (u) be as in (24). As a G‚ó¶ -equivariant local system
on Y ‚ó¶ ,
M
Àú Y‚ó¶ =

The maps Œ®G and Œ£t are compatible with restriction to Levi subgroups, in the
following sense. Let H ‚äÇ G be an algebraic subgroup such that H ‚à© G‚ó¶ is a Levi
subgroup of G‚ó¶ . Suppose that u ‚àà H ‚ó¶ is unipotent. By [Ree1, ¬ß3.2]
(60)

ZG (u)‚ó¶ ‚à© H = ZG‚ó¶ (u)‚ó¶ ‚à© H

equals

ZH ‚ó¶ (u)‚ó¶ = ZH (u)‚ó¶ .

Hence the natural map AH (u) ‚Üí AG (u) is injective and we can regard AH (u) as a
H
subgroup of AG (u). Let œÄ‚àóH Ef
H be the H-equivariant local system on Cu constructed
H
like œÄ‚àó EÃÉ but for the group H. By Proposition 4.5 EndH (œÄ‚àó Ef

5. A version with quasi-Levi subgroups
For applications to Langlands parameters we need a version of the generalized
Springer correspondence which involves a disconnected version of Levi subgroups.
Recall that every Levi subgroup L of G‚ó¶ is of the form L = ZG‚ó¶ (Z(L)‚ó¶ ).
Definition 5.1. Let G be a possibly disconnected complex reductive algebraic
group, and let L ‚äÇ G‚ó¶ be a Levi subgroup. Then we call ZG (Z(L)‚ó¶ ) a quasi-Levi
subgroup of G.
Notice that ZG (Z(L)‚ó¶ ) also has neutral component L and connected centre Z(L)‚ó¶ .
Hence there is canonical bijection between Levi subgroups and quasi-Levi subgroups
of G. We will also need some variations on other previous notions.
Definition 5.2. A unipotent cuspidal quasi-support for G is a triple (M, v, q«´) where
M ‚äÇ G is a quasi-Levi subgroup, v ‚àà M ‚ó¶ is unipotent and q«´ ‚àà Irrcusp (AM (v)). We
write
qSG = {cuspidal unipotent quasi-supports for G}/G-conjugacy.
Like before, we will also think of unipotent cuspidal quasi-supports as triples
(M, CvM , qE), where qE is a cuspidal local system on CvM . We want to define a
canonical map
qŒ®G : NG+ ‚Üí qSG ,
and to analyse its fibers. Of course this map should just be Œ®G if G is connected.
‚ó¶
Let t = [M ‚ó¶ , CvM , E]G and suppose that (u, Œ∑) ‚àà NG+ with Œ®G (u, Œ∑) = t. Obviously, the cuspidal quasi-support of (u, Œ∑) will involve the quasi-Levi subgroup
M = ZG (Z(M ‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ ). From Theorem 4.7 we get
Àú
œÅ = Œ£t (u, Œ∑) ‚àà Irr(EndG (œÄ‚àó E)).
M
Let œÄ‚àóM Ef
M be the M -equivariant local system on Cv built from E in the same way
as œÄ‚àó EÃÉ, only with M instead of G. From Proposition 4.5 we see that EndG (œÄ‚àó EÃÉ)
naturally contains a subalgebra

by (u, Œ∑), up to G-conjugacy. Thus we can canonically define

qŒ®G (u, Œ∑) = [M, CvM , qE]G .

It follows that the characterization of Œ®G given in [Lus2, Theorem 6.5] remains valid
for qŒ®G . In particular F and qE have the same Z(G)-character and
(67)

qŒ®G preserves Z(G)-characters.

We abbreviate

qt = [M, CvM , qE]G .
Let NG (qt) be the stabilizer of (M, CvM , qE) in G. It normalizes M and contains M ,
because (qE)v ‚àà Irr(AM (v)). Every element of NG (qt) maps E to a M -associate local
‚ó¶
system on CvM , because qE is a M -equivariant local system which, as M ‚ó¶ -equivariant
sheaf, contains E. Hence NG (qt) = NG (t, qE)M .
Analogous to Wt = NG (t)/M ‚ó¶ , we define
(68)

Wqt = NG (qt)/M.

There are natural isomorphisms
(69)
Wqt ‚àº
= NG (t, qE)M/M ‚àº
= NG (t, qE)/ME ‚àº
= StabWt (qE)/(ME /M ‚ó¶ ).
The group Wt‚ó¶ = NG‚ó¶ (M ‚ó¶ )/M ‚ó¶ is isomorphic to NG‚ó¶ (t‚ó¶ )M/M , and there is a
natural injection
(70)
Wt‚ó¶ ‚àº

Lemma 5.3. There exists a 2-cocycle Œ∫qt of Wqt such that:

Proof. (a) Recall the bijection Œ®‚àí1


of extended quotients, this fiber is in bijection with Irr Q‚Ñì [Wt,œÅM /(ME /M ‚ó¶ ), Œ∫œÅM ] .
By the equivariance of the Springer correspondence, the stabilizer of Œ£tM (CvM , qE) =
œÅM in Wt /(ME /M ‚ó¶ ) is StabWt (qE)/(ME /M ‚ó¶ ), which by (69) is isomorphic with Wqt .
Thus the composition of Theorem 4.7 and (74) provides the required bijection, with
Œ∫œÅM as cocycle.

Hence Wt‚ó¶ stabilizes œÅM and

Wt,œÅM /(ME /M ‚ó¶ ).

It also follows from (75) that we can take IœÅwM = IdVœÅM . In view of Proposition
1.1.a, the 2-cocycle Œ∫œÅM on Wt‚ó¶ agrees with ‚ôÆE |Wt‚ó¶ = 1. Via (70) we consider Wt‚ó¶
as a subgroup of Wqt . Then the subalgebra of Q‚Ñì [Wqt , Œ∫qt ] spanned by the Tw with
w ‚àà Wt‚ó¶ is simply Q‚Ñì [Wt‚ó¶ ].

We will make the bijection of Lemma 5.3.a canonical, by replacing Q‚Ñì [Wqt , Œ∫qt ]
with the endomorphism algebra of the equivariant local system (65).
Lemma 5.4. Let Œ∫qt be as in Lemma 5.3. There is an isomorphism

f via (65).
which acts on œÄ‚àó (qE)

Proof. Like Proposition 4.5, the larger part of this result follows from [Lus2, ¬ß3].
The constructions over there apply equally well to quasi-Levi subgroups of the possibly disconnected group G. These arguments show that, as a Q‚Ñì -vector space,
f is in a canonical way a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces qAw
EndG (œÄ‚àó (qE))
indexed by Wqt . Moreover, as an algebra it is a twisted group algebra of Wqt , with
respect to some 2-cocycle. To analyse the 2-cocycle, we relate it to objects appearing
in the proof of Lemma 5.3.a.
f with G acting trivially on VœÅ , is a direct summand of œÄ‚àó (E).

As concerns the index set for the sum, by Theorem 3.1.a the map ZG (v)/ZM (v) ‚Üí
NG (M ‚ó¶ )/M is bijective.
The bw with w ‚àà ME /M ‚ó¶ act only on the second tensor factor of (77), and
they span the algebra EndQ‚Ñì (VœÅM ). Let [Wqt ] ‚äÇ Wt be a set of representatives for
StabWt (qE)/(ME /M ‚ó¶ ). By (70) we may assume that it contains Wt‚ó¶ . From (44) we
see that the bw with w ‚àà [Wqt ] permute the direct summands of (77) according to
the inclusion
Wqt = NG (qt)/M ‚Üí NG (M ‚ó¶ )/M ‚àº
= ZG (v)/ZM (v).
In particular {bw : w ‚àà [Wqt ]} is linearly independent over EndQ‚Ñì (VœÅM ). Since (76)
is spanned by the bw with w ‚àà StabWt (œÅM ), it follows that in fact {bw : w ‚àà [Wqt ]}
is a basis of (76) over EndQ‚Ñì (VœÅM ).
f say to qbw ‚àà qAw . For
We want to modify these bw to endomorphisms of œÄ‚àó (qE),
w ‚àà Wt‚ó¶ there is an easy canonical choice, as (75) shows that Wt‚ó¶ commutes with
Q‚Ñì [M/M ‚ó¶ , ‚ôÆE ]. Hence bw fixes œÅM ‚àà Irr(Q‚Ñì [M/M ‚ó¶ , ‚ôÆE ]) pointwise. Therefore we
can take qbw = bw for w ‚àà Wt‚ó¶ . By Theorem 2.2 these elements span the algebra
Àú ‚àº
EndG‚ó¶ (œÄ‚àó E)
= Q‚Ñì [Wt‚ó¶ ].
For general w ‚àà [Wqt ] the description given in (44) shows that the action of bw on
(77) consists of a permuation of the direct factors combined with a linear action on
ft and N be as in (71) and (73). Then (77) can be embedded in a sum
VœÅM . Let W
f

t
of copies of indW
N (VœÅM ).
Now Proposition 1.1.b shows that there is a unique qbw ‚àà qAw such that the
action of bw on (77) can be identified with qbw ‚äó I w , where I w is as in (4). We may
choose the same I w as we did (implicitly) in the last part of the proof of Lemma
5.3.a, where we used them to determine the cocycle Œ∫œÅM = Œ∫qt . Then Proposition
1.1.b shows also that these qbw multiply as in the algebra Q‚Ñì [Wqt , Œ∫œÅM ].
Finally, the claim about the uniqueness follows in the same way as in the last part
of the proof of Propostion 4.5.


Some remarks about the 2-cocycle Œ∫qt are in order. If Wqt is cyclic then Œ∫qt is
√ó
trivial because H 2 (Wqt , Q‚Ñì ) = {1}. Furthermore
f = EndG (œÄ‚àó (E))
Àú ‚àº
if ME = M ‚ó¶ , then EndG (œÄ‚àó (qE))
= Q‚Ñì [Wt , ‚ôÆE ]

by Proposition 4.5. However, in contrast with the cocycle ‚ôÆE appearing in Sections
3 and 4, it is in general rather difficult to obtain explicit information about Œ∫qt . One
reason for this is that the classification of cuspidal local systems on disconnected
reductive groups, as achieved in Theorem 3.1 and in Proposition 3.5, leaves many
possibilities. In particular the groups GE /G‚ó¶ can be very large.

This concludes the part of the paper which deals exclusively with Springer correspondences. We remark once more that all the results from Sections 2‚Äì5 also hold

6. Cuspidal Langlands parameters
We will introduce a notion of cuspidality for enhanced L-parameters. Before we
come to that, we recall some generalities about Langlands parameters and Levi
subgroups. For more background we refer to [Bor, Vog, ABPS6].
Let F be a local non-archimedean field with Weil group WF . Let H be a connected
reductive algebraic group over F and let H‚à® be its complex dual group. The data
for H provide an action of WF on H‚à® which preserves a pinning, and that gives the
Langlands dual group L H = H‚à® ‚ãä WF . (All these objects are determined by F and
H up to isomorphism.)
Definition 6.1. Let T ‚äÇ H‚à® be a torus such that the projection ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (T ) ‚Üí
WF is surjective. Then we call L L = ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (T ) a Levi L-subgroup of L H.
We remark that in [Bor] such groups are called Levi subgroups of L H. We prefer
to stick to the connectedness of Levi subgroups. An alternative characterization of
Levi L-subgroups of L H is as follows.

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
33

Lemma 6.2. Let L L be a Levi L-subgroup of L H. There exists a WF -stable Levi
subgroup L‚à® of H‚à® such that L L is H‚à® -conjugate to L‚à® ‚ãä WF and L := L L ‚à© H‚à® is
conjugate to L‚à® .
Conversely, every H‚à® -conjugate of L‚à® ‚ãä WF is a Levi L-subgroup of L H.
Proof. By [Bor, Lemma 3.5] there exists a parabolic subgroup P ‚äÇ H‚à® such that
‚Ä¢ NH‚à® ‚ãäWF (P ) ‚Üí WF is surjective;
‚Ä¢ L is a Levi factor of P ;
‚Ä¢ L L = NH‚à® ‚ãäWF (L) ‚à© NH‚à® ‚ãäWF (P ).
Choose a WF -stable pinning for H‚à® and let PI = LI ‚ãä UI be the unique standard
parabolic subgroup of H‚à® conjugate to P . Here UI denotes the unipotent radical of
PI , and LI its standard Levi factor. Then NH‚à® ‚ãäWF (PI ) ‚Üí WF is still surjective,
so PI is WF -stable. Pick h ‚àà H‚à® with PI = hP h‚àí1 . Then hLh‚àí1 is a Levi factor
of PI and
h L Lh‚àí1 = NPI ‚ãäWF (h L Lh‚àí1 )
is a complement to UI in PI ‚ãä WF . All Levi factors of PI are UI -conjugate, so there
exists a u ‚àà UI with uh L Lh‚àí1 u‚àí1 = LI . Then
uh L Lh‚àí1 u‚àí1 = NPI ‚ãäWF (LI ) = LI ‚ãä WF .
For the converse, let H‚à® be a WF -stable Levi subgroup of H‚à® . Consider the root
system R := R(H‚à® , Z(L‚à® )‚ó¶ ). Since Z(L‚à® )‚ó¶ is WF -stable, WF acts on R. Let T
be the neutral component of Z(L‚à® )WF . This is a WF -fixed torus which commutes
with L‚à® and
Œ±(t) = (w ¬∑ Œ±)(t)
‚àÄt ‚àà T, Œ± ‚àà R, w ‚àà WF .
‚à®
No root Œ± ‚àà R becomes trivial on T . Namely, the Lie algebra tder of Z(L‚à® )‚ó¶ ‚à© Hder
is spanned by R and WF -stable. An element X ‚àà tder which on all wŒ± with
w ‚àà WF takes the same value in R>0 , gives rise to an element exp(X) ‚àà T with
Œ±(exp X) = exp(Œ±(X)) > 0.
The centralizer in H‚à® of the torus T ‚äÇ Z(L‚à® )‚ó¶ is generated by L‚à® and by the
root subgroups UŒ± for which Œ± becomes trivial on T . Hence
ZH‚à® (T ) = L‚à®

and ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (T ) = L‚à® ‚ãä WF ,

which means that L‚à® ‚ãä WF is a Levi L-subgroup of L H in the sense of Definition
6.1. For any h ‚àà H‚à® :
h(L‚à® ‚ãä WF )h‚àí1 = ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (hT h‚àí1 ).
This group contains hWF h‚àí1 , so it projects onto WF . Hence it is again a Levi
L-subgroup of L H.

Remark 6.3. Most Levi L-subgroups of L H are not quasi-Levi, and conversely. For
example, let U = U(n, E/F ) be a p-adic unitary group (E is a quadratic extension
of F ) and let L U be its dual L-group. The group WF acts on U ‚à® = GL(n, C) via an
outer automorphism which preserves the diagonal torus T and the standard Borel
subgroup B. Then T ‚ãä WF is a Levi L-subgroup of L U : it is the centralizer of T WF
in L U . However, it is not quasi-Levi. Namely ZL U (T ) = T ‚ãä WE , which is an index
two subgroup of T ‚ãä WF .
The following definitions are well-known, we repeat them here to facilitate comparison with later generalizations.

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

Definition 6.4. A L-parameter for L H is a continuous group homomorphism
œÜ : WF √ó SL2 (C) ‚Üí L H such that:
‚Ä¢ œÜ(w) ‚àà H‚à® w for all w ‚àà WF ;
‚Ä¢ œÜ(w) is semisimple for all w ‚àà WF ;
‚Ä¢ œÜ|SL2 (C) : SL2 (C) ‚Üí H‚à® is a homomorphism of complex algebraic groups.
Recall that all inner forms of H share the same Langlands dual group L H, so the
group H is not determined by the target L H of a L-parameter. Let us specify which
L-parameters are relevant for H, and which are bounded or discrete.
Definition 6.5. Let œÜ : WF √ó SL2 (C) ‚Üí L H be a L-parameter. We say that œÜ is
bounded if œÜ(Frob) = (h, Frob) with h in some compact subgroup of H‚à® .
Suppose that L L is a Levi L-subgroup of L H and that
‚Ä¢ L L contains the image of œÜ;
‚Ä¢ there is no smaller Levi L-subgroup of L H with this property.
Then we call œÜ relevant for H if and only if the conjugacy class of L L is relevant for
H, that is, it corresponds to a conjugacy class of Levi subgroups of H.
In this case we also say that œÜ is a discrete L-parameter for L L, and for any Levi
subgroup L ‚äÇ H in the associated class. In particular œÜ is discrete for H if and only
if there is no proper Levi L-subgroup of L H containing the image of œÜ.
The group H‚à® acts on the set of relevant L-parameters for H. We denote
the set of relevant L-parameters modulo H‚à® -conjugation by Œ¶(H). The subset of
bounded L-parameters (up to conjugacy) is denoted by Œ¶bdd (H). The local Langlands correspondence predicts that Irr(H) is partitioned into finite L-packets Œ†œÜ (H),
parametrized by Œ¶(H). Under this correspondence Œ¶bdd (H) should give rise to Lpackets consisting entirely of tempered representations, and that should account for
the entire tempered dual of H.
It is expected (and established in many cases) that the following conditions are
equivalent for œÜ ‚àà Œ¶(H):
‚Ä¢ œÜ is discrete;
‚Ä¢ Œ†œÜ (H) contains an essentially square-integrable representation;
‚Ä¢ all elements of Œ†œÜ (H) are essentially square-integrable.
In other words, ‚Äúdiscrete‚Äù (respectively ‚Äúbounded‚Äù) is the correct translation of
‚Äúessentially square-integrable‚Äù (respectively ‚Äútempered‚Äù) under the local Langlands
correspondence.
However, it is more difficult to characterize when Œ†œÜ (H) contains supercuspidal
H-representations. Of course œÜ has to be discrete, but even then. Sometimes Œ†œÜ (H)
consists entirely of supercuspidal representations, for example when H = SL2 (F )
and œÜ comes from an irreducible representation WF ‚Üí GL2 (C). In other cases
Œ†œÜ (H) contains only non-supercuspidal essentially square-integrable representations,
for example when H = SL2 (F ), œÜ|WF = idWF and œÜ|SL2 (C) is an irreducible twodimensional representation of SL2 (C).
Moreover there are mixed cases, where Œ†œÜ (H) contains both supercuspidal and
non-supercuspidal representations. An example
is formed by a Langlands parameter

for a group of type G2 , with œÜ 1, ( 10 11 ) a subregular unipotent element of G2 (C).
Then Œ†œÜ (G2 (F )) has a unique supercuspidal element and contains two representations from the principal series of G2 (F ), see [Lus3].

To parametrize the representations in a given L-packet, we need more information

We note that both groups acting in (85) yield the same orbit space.
The notion of relevance for enhanced L-parameters is more subtle. Firstly, we
must specify H not only as an inner form of a quasi-split group H‚àó , but even as
an inner twist. That is, we must fix an isomorphism H ‚Üí H‚àó of algebraic groups,
defined over a separable closure of F . The inner twists of H are parametrized by
the Galois cohomology group H 1 (F, Had ), where Had denotes the adjoint group
of H (considered as an algebraic group defined over F ). The parametrization is
canonically determined by requiring that H‚àó corresponds to the trivial element of
H 1 (F, Had ). Kottwitz found a natural group isomorphism

Definition 6.6. Let (œÜ, œÅ) be an enhanced L-parameter for L H. We say that (œÜ, œÅ)
or œÅ is H-relevant if Œ∂œÅ parametrizes the inner twist H via (86).
By the next result, Definition 7.7 fits well with the earlier notion of relevance of
œÜ, as in Definition 6.5.
Proposition 6.7.
Let H be an inner twist of a quasi-split group and let Œ∂ ‚àà

‚à® )WF be the associated character. Let œÜ be a Langlands parameter for
IrrC Z(Hsc
L H. The following are equivalent:
(1) œÜ is relevant for H;

(2) Z(Hsc

(3) there exists a œÅ ‚àà IrrC (SœÜ ) with Œ∂œÅ = Œ∂, that is, such that (œÜ, œÅ) is H-relevant.
Proof. For the equivalence of (1) and (2) see [HiSa, Lemma 9.1] and [Art1, Corollary 2.3]. The equivalence of (2) and (3) is easy, it was already noted in [ABPS6,
Proposition 1.6].

‚à® and the above relevance circumvents
Let us remark here that the usage of Hsc
some of the problems in [Vog, ¬ß2]. In particular it removes the need to consider
variations such as ‚Äùpure inner forms‚Äù or ‚Äùpure inner twists‚Äù.
We denote the set of H‚à® -equivalence classes of enhanced relevant L-parameters
for H by Œ¶e (H). Following [Art2] we choose an extension Œ∂H of Œ∂ to a character of

Z(Hsc

course we take Œ∂H = triv if H is quasi-split. Since SœÜ /ZœÜ ‚àº

Œ¶e,triv (H) = {(œÜ, œÅ) : œÜ ‚àà Œ¶(H), œÅ ‚àà Irr(RœÜ )}

if H is quasi-split.

It is conjectured [Art2, ABPS6] that the local Langlands correspondence for H can
be enhanced to a bijection

ZH‚à®sc (œÜ(WF ))‚ó¶ taking the value u at ( 10 11 ). Moreover, by [Kos, Theorem 3.6] this

in H‚à® and those in Hsc
œÜ
Based on many examples we believe that the following kind of enhanced Lparameters should parametrize supercuspidal representations.
Definition 6.8. An enhanced L-parameter (œÜ, œÅ) for L H is cuspidal if œÜ is dis1 (œÜ|
crete and (uœÜ , œÅ) is a cuspidal pair for G = ZH
‚à®
WF ). Here œÅ is considered as a
sc
representation of œÄ0 (ZG (uœÜ )) via (90).
We denote the set of H‚à® -equivalence classes of H-relevant cuspidal L-parameters
by Œ¶cusp (H). When Œ∂H is as in (87), we put Œ¶cusp,Œ∂H (H) = Œ¶cusp (H) ‚à© Œ¶e,Œ∂H .
It is easy to see that every group H has cuspidal L-parameters. Let œÜ ‚àà Œ¶(H)
be a discrete parameter which is trivial on SL2 (C). Then uœÜ = 1 and ZH‚à® (œÜ)‚ó¶ =
1 (œÜ) is finite and every enhancement œÅ of œÜ is cuspidal.
Z(H‚à® )WF ,‚ó¶ . Hence G = ZH
‚à®
sc
By Proposition 6.7 we can choose a H-relevant œÅ.
In the case of quasi-split groups we can also use enhanced L-parameters of the
form (œÜ, œÅ) with œÅ ‚àà Irr(RœÜ ), where RœÜ is as in (80). Such a parameter is cuspidal
if and only if (uœÜ , œÅ) is a cuspidal pair for ZH‚à® (œÜ).
Now we check that in many cases where a local Langlands correspondence is
known, these cuspidal L-parameter do indeed parametrize supercuspidal representations.
Example 6.9. Let F be a p-adic field, D a division algebra over F such that
dimF D = d2 and H = GLm (D). Then H is an inner form of GLn (F ) with n = md.

Hence, we can write uœÜ = (uœÜ,œÄ )œÄ‚ààI . Since we assume that œÜ is cuspidal, this
implies that for all œÄ ‚àà I, uœÜ,œÄ is in the regular unipotent class, corresponding to
the partition dœÄ and Z(SLdœÄ (C)) acts on œÅ by a character of order dœÄ . But AG (uœÜ )
is a cyclic group of order gcd(dœÄ , œÄ ‚àà I). So, since its contains a subgroup of order
dœÄ and its cardinality is at most dœÄ , we get that all dœÄ are equal to some integer d‚Ä≤
and SœÜ = Z/d‚Ä≤ Z. Moreover
ZSLn (C) (œÜ(WF )) ‚âÉ (GLd‚Ä≤ (C))#I ‚à© SLn (C).
Because we suppose that œÜ is discrete, I is a singleton. We obtain that œÜ = œÄ ‚ä† Sd‚Ä≤ .
In particular, the center of SLn (C) acts on SH‚à®sc (œÜ) by a character of order d, so
that d = d‚Ä≤ . Hence œÜ = œÄ ‚ä† Sd . We recover the case when D = F and œÜ = œÄ
is an irreducible representation of WF . An other case is when H = GL1 (D) with
d = 2. We obtain that the supercuspidal representations of GL1 (D) are of the form
œá ‚ä† S2 , with œá a character of WF . (This Langlands parameter is the parameter
of œáStGL2 (F ) and the two representations are connected by the Jacquet‚ÄìLanglands
correspondence).
Example 6.10. Let F be a p-adic field, and let H be a symplectic group Sp2n (F )
or a split special orthogonal group SOm (F ). We have L H = H‚à® √ó WF . Then [Mou,
Proposition 4.14] shows, using results of Arthur and M≈ìglin, that the supercuspidal
irreducible representations of H correspond, via the local Langlands correspondence,
to cuspidal enhanced L-parameters.
Example 6.11. Let F be a p-adic field and E a quadratic extension of F . Let
H = Un (F ) be the quasi-split unitary group defined over F and split over E. We
have L H = GLn (C) ‚ãä Gal(E/F ). Let œÜ : WF √ó SL2 (C) ‚àí‚Üí L H be a discrete
Langlands parameter and fix œÉ ‚àà WF such that WF /WE ‚âÉ hœÉi. We use the
notions of conjugate-dual, conjugate-orthogonal and conjugate-symplectic defined
in [GGP, ¬ß3]. We can decompose the restriction of œÜ to WE as an n-dimensional

Every term mœÄ œÄ in (91) can be decomposed as ‚äïa œÄ ‚ä† Sa , where Sa denotes the adimensional irreducible representation of SL2 (C). Here a runs through some subset
of N ‚Äì every a appears at most once because œÜ is discrete. For every such (œÄ, a) we
choose an element zœÄ,a ‚àà AGLn (C) (œÜ) which acts as ‚àí1 on œÄ ‚ä† Sa and as the identity
on all other factors œÄ ‚Ä≤ ‚ä† Sa‚Ä≤ .
From now on we assume that œÜ can be enhanced to a cuspidal L-parameter. The

Moreover, in [Moe, TheÃÅoreÃÄme 8.4.4], M≈ìglin classified the supercuspidal representations in an Arthur packet. In particular, for tempered Langlands parameters (which
are Arthur parameters trivial on the second copy of SL2 (C)), the description is given
in term of a Jordan block and a character defined by this Jordan block. Here the
Jordan block Jord(œÜ) of the Langlands parameter œÜ of a supercuspidal representation of H is the set of pairs (œÄ, a), where œÄ is an irreducible representation of WE
stable under the action of the composition of inverse-transpose and œÉ, and a is an
integer such that œÄ ‚ä† Sa is a subrepresentation of œÜ WE .
The condition on the Jordan block says that it has no holes (or is without jumps).
More explicitly, for all a > 2, if (œÄ, a) ‚àà Jord(œÜ) then (œÄ, a‚àí2) ‚àà Jord(œÜ). The shape
of œÜ is then as (92). Moreover, the alternated characters are exactly the cuspidal
ones. More precisely, [Moe, p.194] gives the definition zœÄ,a as our zœÄ,a zœÄ,a‚àí2 (or zœÄ,2
in the case of a = 2). But the cuspidal characters are exactly the characters which
are alternated, i.e. such that Œµ(zœÄ,a zœÄ,a‚àí2 ) = ‚àí1.
Example 6.12. Let œÜ be a relevant discrete L-parameter which is trivial on the
wild inertia subgroup PF of the inertia group IF , and such that the centralizer of
œÜ(IF ) in H‚à® is a torus. The latter condition forces œÜ to be trivial on SL2 (C). Hence
uœÜ = 1, and any enhancement of œÜ gives a cuspidal L-parameter. Let

CœÜ = œÄ0 ZH‚à® (œÜ)/Z(L H)‚ó¶

and let œÅ ‚àà Irr(CœÜ ). It is known from [DeRe] that these enhanced L-parameters (œÜ, œÅ)
correspond to the depth-zero generic supercuspidal irreducible representations of H,
in the case where H is a pure inner form of an unramified reductive p-adic group.
We note that the component group CœÜ is a quotient of our SœÜ , namely by the kernel
‚à® ‚Üí H‚à® . A priori in these references only a subset of our enhancements of œÜ
of Hsc
is considered. However, it boils down to the same, because the p-adic group H is
chosen such that œÅ is relevant for it [DeRe, ¬ß2].
Example 6.13. Let (œÜ, œÅ) be a relevant enhanced L-parameter such that œÜ is dis(r)
(r+1)
and nontrivial on PF for some integer r > 0, and such
crete and trivial on PF
(r)
that the centralizer in H‚à® of œÜ(PF ) is a maximal torus of H‚à® . Again any such
(œÜ, œÅ) is cuspidal. The same argument as in Example 6.12 shows that the result of
Reeder in [Ree2, ¬ß6] implies that these enhanced L-parameters correspond to the
depth-zero generic supercuspidal irreducible representations of H, when H is a pure
inner form of an unramified reductive p-adic group.

Example 6.14. Let (œÜ, œÅ) be a cuspidal relevant enhanced L-parameter such that

œÜ is trivial on the inertia group IF . We have G = ZH
‚à®
sc
proved in [Lus4] that these enhanced L-parameters correspond to the unipotent
irreducible representations of H in the case when H is simple of adjoint type. Under
these conditions H‚à® is simply connected and SœÜ coincides with the component group
considered by Lusztig.
Recall that a representation œÄ of H is said to be unipotent (or to have unipotent
reduction) if for some parahoric subgroup P of H, and some unipotent cuspidal
representation œÉ of the reductive quotient of P, the space HomP (œÉ, œÄ) is nonzero
(where œÉ is viewed as a representation of P by inflation).
7. The cuspidal support of enhanced L-parameters
In the representation theory of p-adic groups Bernstein‚Äôs cuspidal support map
(see [BeDe, ¬ß2] or [Ren, VI.7.1]) plays an important role. It assigns to every irreducible smooth H-representation œÄ a Levi subgroup L of H and a supercuspidal
L-representation œÉ, such that œÄ is contained in the normalized parabolic induction
of œÉ. This condition determines (L, œÉ) uniquely up to H-conjugacy. It is common to
call (L, œÉ) a cuspidal pair for H. The cuspidal support of œÄ ‚àà Irr(H) is a H-conjugacy
class of cuspidal pairs, often denoted by Sc(œÄ).
It is expected that Sc relates very well to the LLC. In fact this is a special case
of a conjecture about the relation with parabolic induction, see [Hai, Conjecture
5.22] and [ABPS6, ¬ß1.5]. Suppose that P = LUP is a parabolic subgroup of H, that
œÜ ‚àà Œ¶(L) and œÉ ‚àà Œ†œÜ (L). Then the L-packet Œ†œÜ (H) should consist of constituents
of the normalized parabolic induction IPH (œÉ).
We will define an analogue of Sc for enhanced L-parameters. In this setting a
cuspidal pair for L H should become a triple (L‚à® ‚ãä WF , œÜ, œÅ), where L‚à® ‚ãä WF is
the L-group of a Levi subgroup L ‚äÇ H and (œÜ, œÅ) is a cuspidal L-parameter for L.
However, the collection of such objects is not stable under H‚à® -conjugation, because
hL‚à® h‚àí1 need not be WF -stable. To allow H‚à® to act on these triples, we must
generalize Definition 6.8 in a less restrictive way.
Definition 7.1. Let L L be a Levi L-subgroup of L H. A Langlands parameter for
is a group homomorphism œÜ : WF √ó SL2 (C) ‚Üí L L satisfying the requirements of
Definition 6.4. An enhancement of œÜ is an irreducible representation œÅ of œÄ0 (ZL1 sc (œÜ)),
where Lsc is the simply connected cover of the derived group of L = L L ‚à© H‚à® . The
group L acts on the collection of enhanced L-parameters for L L by (85).
 
We say that (œÜ, œÅ) is cuspidal for L L if œÜ is discrete for L L and uœÜ = œÜ 1, ( 10 11 ) , œÅ
is a cuspidal pair for ZL1 sc (œÜ|WF ). We denote the set of L-orbits by Œ¶e (L L) and the
subset of cuspidal L-orbits by Œ¶cusp (L L).

LL

We remark that in this definition it is not specified for which p-adic group an
enhanced L-parameter for L L is relevant. Hence Œ¶e (L L) is in general strictly larger
than Œ¶e (L), it also contains enhanced L-parameters for inner forms of L.
‚à® ‚Üí H‚à® . Since L is a Levi subgroup
Let Lc be the pre-image of L under under Hsc

of H , the derived group of Lc is the simply connected cover of Lder . Thus we

identify Lsc with the inverse image of Lder under Hsc

‚à® ).
This depends only on the restriction of Œ∂H to the subgroup Z(Lsc ) ‚äÇ Z(Hsc
‚à®
Often we will be interested in cuspidal data up to H -conjugacy. Upon fixing the
first ingredient of (L L, œÜ, œÅ), we can consider (œÜ, œÅ) as a cuspidal L-parameter for
L L, modulo L-conjugacy. Recall from (88) that œÜ is determined up to L-conjugacy
by œÜ|WF and uœÜ . Hence the quadruple

(L L, œÜ|WF , uœÜ , œÅ)

(93)

determines a unique H‚à® -conjugacy class of cuspidal data. Therefore we will also
regard quadruples of the form (93) as cuspidal data for L H.
Let Irrcusp (L) be the set of supercuspidal L-representations and let œÉ1 , œÉ2 ‚àà
Irrcusp (L). We note that the cuspidal pairs (L, œÉ1 ) and (L, œÉ2 ) are H-conjugate
if and only if œÉ1 and œÉ2 are in the same orbit under
W (H, L) = NH (L)/L.

(94)

Recall from [ABPS6, Proposition 3.1] that there is a canonical isomorphism
(95)
W (H, L) ‚àº
= NH‚à® (L‚à® ‚ãä WF )/L‚à® .
Motivated by (95) we write, for any Levi L-subgroup L L of L H:
W (L H, L L) := NH‚à® (L L)/L.
This group acts naturally on the collection of cuspidal data for L H with first ingredient L L. Two cuspidal data
(96) (L L, œÜ1 , œÅ1 ) and (L L, œÜ2 , œÅ2 ) are H-conjugate

‚áê‚áí

L

(œÜ1 , œÅ1 ), (œÜ2 , œÅ2 ) ‚àà Œ¶cusp ( L) are in the same orbit for the action of W (L H, L L).
In the notation of (90), we use Section 5 (with complex representations and sheafs)
to write
qŒ®G (uœÜ , œÅ) = [M, v, q«´]G .
Proposition 7.3. Let (œÜ, œÅ) ‚àà Œ¶e (H).
(a) (ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (Z(M )‚ó¶ ), œÜ|WF , v, q«´) is a H-relevant cuspidal datum for L H.
(b) Upon replacing (œÜ, œÅ) by a H‚à® -conjugate representative L-parameter, there exists
a Levi subgroup L of H such that:

(c) The H-conjugacy class of L and the H‚à® -conjugacy class of L‚à® ‚ãäWF are uniquely

Proof. (a) and (b) The torus Z(M )‚ó¶ commutes with M , so ZH‚à® (Z(M )‚ó¶ ) is a Levi

‚à®
WF ),
sc
‚ó¶
‚à®
ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (Z(M ) ) is a Levi L-subgroup of H ‚ãä WF .
In view of Lemma 6.2 this implies that, upon conjugating (œÜ, œÅ) with a suitable
element of H‚à® , we may assume that the above construction yields a WF -stable Levi
subgroup L‚à® := ZH‚à® (Z(M )‚ó¶ ) with
œÜ(WF ) ‚äÇ ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (Z(M )‚ó¶ ) = L‚à® ‚ãä WF .

Moreover L‚à® contains v (or rather its image in H‚à® , which we also denote by v).
Suppose that L L is another Levi L-subgroup of L H which contains œÜ(WF ) ‚à™ {v}.
‚à® . Since (v, q«´) is a cuspidal pair
Let Lc be the inverse image of L = L L ‚à© H‚à® in Hsc
‚ó¶
for M , M is a Levi subgroup of G minimally containing v. Hence Lc ‚à© G contains
a ZG (v)-conjugate of M ‚ó¶ , say zM ‚ó¶ z ‚àí1 . Then Z(Lc )‚ó¶ ‚äÇ zZ(M )‚ó¶ z ‚àí1 , so
(98)

‚àí1
Lc = ZH‚à®sc (Z(Lc )‚ó¶ ) ‚äÉ ZH‚à®sc (zZ(M )‚ó¶ )z ‚àí1 ) = zL‚à®

Thus L contains a conjugate of L‚à® . Equivalently L‚à® ‚ãä WF minimally contains
œÜ(WF ) ‚à™ {v}. Hence (œÜ|WF , v) is a discrete L-parameter for L‚à® ‚ãä WF and for some

conclude that (œÜ|WF , v, q«´) is a cuspidal Langlands parameter for some inner form
of L.
‚à® )WF By Definition 7.2 relevance of cuspidal data can be read off from their Z(Hsc

Hence the above F -group L has to be a Levi subgroup of H.
(c) Suppose that L L is as above and that it minimally contains œÜ(WF ) ‚à™ {v}. From
(98) or [Bor, Proposition 8.6] we see that L L is H-conjugate to L‚à® ‚ãä WF . Hence

It turns out that the cuspidal datum constructed in Proposition 7.3.a need not
have the same infinitesimal character as œÜ (in the sense of [Hai, Vog]). Since this
would be desirable for a cuspidal support map, we now work out some constructions
which compensate for this. See (106) for their effect.
Recall from (64) that the unipotent element v in qŒ®G (uœÜ , œÅ) also appears as
Œ®G‚ó¶ (uœÜ , œÅ‚ó¶ ) = (M ‚ó¶ , v, «´), where œÅ‚ó¶ is an irreducible AG‚ó¶ (uœÜ )-constituent of œÅ. The
construction of Œ®G‚ó¶ , which already started in (16), entails that there exists a parabolic subgroup P of G‚ó¶ such that
‚Ä¢ M ‚ó¶ is a Levi factor of P ,
‚Ä¢ uœÜ = vuP with uP in the unipotent radical UP of P .
Upon conjugating œÜ with

Lemma 7.6. Let (œÜ, œÅ) be an enhanced L-parameter for H and write qŒ®G (uœÜ , œÅ) =
[M, v, q«´]G , using (90). Up to G-conjugacy there exists a unique Œ≥v : SL2 (C) ‚Üí M ‚ó¶

Proof. Everything except the last claim was already checked above. Since (v, q«´)
is cuspidal, [Lus2, Proposition 2.7] says that v is isolated. This means that its
connected centralizer does lie in any proper Levi subgroup of M ‚ó¶ . In other words,
every torus of M ‚ó¶ which centralizes v is contained in Z(M ‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ . Finally we note that,
as M is a quasi-Levi subgroup, Z(M )‚ó¶ = Z(M ‚ó¶ )‚ó¶ .

Notice that the cocharacter œáœÜ,v : C√ó ‚Üí Z(M )‚ó¶ has image commuting with both
Œ≥v (SL2 (C)) and œÜ(WF ).
Definition 7.7. In the setting of Lemma 7.6 we put
L

Œ®(œÜ, œÅ) = (ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (Z(M )‚ó¶ ), œÜ|WF , v, q«´),

a H-relevant cuspidal datum for L H.
Let k¬∑k : WF ‚Üí R>0 be the group homomorphism with kwk = q if w(f ) = f q for
all f in the algebraic closure of the residue field of F .
We define a L-parameter œïv : WF √ó SL2 (C) ‚Üí ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (Z(M )‚ó¶ ) by
œïv (w, x) = œÜ(w)œáœÜ,v (kwk1/2 )Œ≥v (x).

The cuspidal support of (œÜ, œÅ) is
Sc(œÜ, œÅ) = (ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (Z(M )‚ó¶ ), œïv , q«´),
another H-relevant cuspidal datum for L H.
By parts (a) and (c) of Proposition 7.3 the map L Œ® is canonical in the sense
that its image is unique up to conjugation. By Lemma 7.6 Sc is also canonical.
Furthermore, the images of L Œ® and Sc are H-relevant by Proposition 7.3.b. In view
of Proposition 7.3.c, we can always represent L Œ®(œÜ, œÅ) and Sc(œÜ, œÅ) by a cuspidal
L-parameter for a Levi subgroup of H.

In the terminology from [Hai, Vog], this says that the cuspidal support map for
enhanced L-parameters preserves infinitesimal characters. It is interesting to compare the fibres of Sc with the variety constructed in [Vog, Corollary 4.6]. Vogan
considers the set of all L-parameters for L H with a fixed infinitesimal character (up
to conjugation). In [Vog, Proposition 4.5] he proves that this set has the structure
of a complex affine variety, on which H‚à® acts naturally, with only finitely many
orbits. The same picture can be obtained from a fibre of Sc, upon neglecting all
enhancements of L-parameters.
More or less by definition Bernstein‚Äôs cuspidal support map for Irr(H) preserves
infinitesimal characters. That property is slightly less strong for our Sc on the Galois
side, for enhanced L-parameters with different cuspidal support can have the same
infinitesimal character. The map
L

f of Bernstein‚Äôs cuspidal support map
is an analogue of a modified version, say Sc,
L
f
for Irr(H). Neither Œ® nor Sc preserve infinitesimal characters, but they have other
advantages that the cuspidal support maps lack. For L Œ® this will become clear in the
f stems from its role in the ABPS conjecture.
Section 9, while the importance of Sc
To enable a comparison, we recall its definition from [ABPS6, ¬ß2.5]. Let P =
MUP be a parabolic subgroup of H and let œâ ‚àà Irr(M) be square-integrable modulo
centre. Suppose that œÄt ‚àà Irr(H) is tempered and that it is a direct summand of
the normalized parabolic induction IPH (œâ). Let (L, œÉ) be the cuspidal support of œâ.
Then œÉ can be written uniquely as œÉ = œÉu ‚äó ŒΩ, with ŒΩ : L ‚Üí R>0 an unramified
character and œÉu ‚àà Irrcusp (L) unitary (and hence tempered). One defines
f t ) = (L, œÉu )/H-conjugacy.
Sc(œÄ

f preserves temperedness of representations, in contrast with Sc.
Notice that Sc
More generally, by [Sol1, Theorem 2.15] every œÄ ‚àà Irr(H) can be written (in an
essentially unique way) as a Langlands quotient of IPH (œâ ‚äó œá), where P = MUP and
œâ are as above and œá ‚àà Xnr (M). Then œá restricts to an unramified character of L
and the cuspidal support of œâ ‚äó œá is (L, œÉ ‚äó œá). In this case one defines
f
Sc(œÄ)
= (L, œÉu ‚äó œá)/H-conjugacy.

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
47

We note that the only difference with Sc(œÄ) is ŒΩ|L , an unramified character L ‚Üí R>0
which represents the absolute value of the infinitesimal central character of œÉ.
It has been believed for a long time that the (enhanced) L-parameters of œÄ ‚àà
Irr(H) and Sc(œÄ) are always related, but it was not clear how. With our new
notions we can make this precise. Let Lev(H) be a set of representatives for the
conjugacy classes of Levi subgroups of H, and recall (94) and (96).
Conjecture 7.8. Assume that a local Langlands correspondence exists for H and
for supercuspidal representations of its Levi subgroups. The following diagram should
commute:
LLC

Irr(H) o

Œ¶e (H)

Sc

F



L‚ààLev(H) Irrcusp (L)/W (H, L)

Sc

o

LLC

F



L‚ààLev(H) Œ¶cusp (L)/W (H, L).

Conjecture 7.8 is known to hold for many of the groups for which a LLC has been
established.
‚Ä¢ For GLn (F ) it is a consequence of the Bernstein‚ÄìZelevinsky classification of
Irr(GLn (F )) [Zel] and the way it is used in the local Langlands correspondence for GLn (F ), see [Hen, ¬ß2].
‚Ä¢ Irreducible representations of inner forms GLm (D) of GLn (F ) can also be
classified via a Zelevinsky-like scheme, see [Tad]. This is used in the LLC in
the same way as for GLn (F ) [ABPS2, ¬ß2], so the conjecture also holds for
these groups.
‚Ä¢ The local Langlands correspondence for an inner form SLm (D) of SLn (F )
is derived directly from that for GLm (D): on the Galois side one lifts Lparameters WF √ó SL2 (C) ‚Üí PGLn (C) to GLn (C), whereas on the p-adic
side one restricts irreducible representations of GLm (D) to SLm (D) to construct L-packets. These two operations do not really change the infinitesimal central characters of L-parameters or smooth representations, only on
Z(GLn (C)) ‚àº
= C√ó or Z(GLm (D)) ‚àº
= F √ó , respectively. Therefore Conjecture
7.8 for GLm (D) implies it for SLm (D).
‚Ä¢ For the split classical groups Sp2n (F ) and SOm (F ) when F is a p-adic
field. The support cuspidal map specializes to the map defined in [Mou,
TheÃÅoreÃÄme 4.27], and the commutativity of the diagram follows from [Mou,
TheÃÅoreÃÄme 5.9].
‚Ä¢ For principal series representations of split groups see [ABPS4, Theorem
15.1].
‚Ä¢ For unipotent representations of simple p-adic groups H of adjoint type we
refer to [Lus4]. Although
 it isnot so easy to see, the
 essence is that Lusztig
uses the element f = œÜ Frob,

kFrobk1/2

kFrobk‚àí1/2

to parametrize the cen-

tral character of a representation of a suitable affine Hecke algebra [Lus4,
¬ß9.3]. By construction this also parametrizes the infinitesimal central character of the associated representation of H.
To support Conjecture 7.8, we check that the cuspidal support map is compatible
with the Langlands classification for L-parameters. The latter is a version of the

48

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

Langlands classification for Irr(H) on the Galois side of the LLC, it stems from
[SiZi].
We will describe first a Galois side analogue for unramified characters. Let IF ‚äÇ
WF be as above the inertia subgroup and let Frob ‚àà WF be a Frobenius element.
Recall from [Hai, ¬ß3.3.1] that there is a canonical isomorphism of complex tori
‚ó¶
(107)
Xnr (L) ‚àº
= Z(L‚à® )IF Frob = Z(L‚à® ‚ãä IF )‚ó¶WF /IF = Z(L‚à® ‚ãä IF )‚ó¶L‚à® ‚ãäWF .
The group Xnr (L) acts on Irr(L) by tensoring. This corresponds to an action of
‚ó¶
Z(L‚à® )IF Frob on Œ¶(L) and on Œ¶e (L). Namely, let œÜ : WF √ó SL2 (C) ‚Üí L L be a
relevant L-parameter and let z ‚àà Z(L‚à® )IF . We define zœÜ ‚àà Œ¶(L) by


(108)
(zœÜ)I √óSL2 (C) = œÜI √óSL2 (C) and (zœÜ)(Frob) = z œÜ(Frob).
F

‚à®
Notice that zœÜ ‚àà Œ¶(L) because z ‚àà Z(L

F
represents the same element of Z(L ) Frob . Then z z = x‚àí1 Frob(x) for some
x ‚àà Z(L‚à® )IF , and
z ‚Ä≤ œÜ = x‚àí1 Frob(x)zœÜ = x‚àí1 zœÜx.

Hence z ‚Ä≤ œÜ = zœÜ in Œ¶(L) and we obtain an action of Z(L‚à® )IF Frob on Œ¶(L). As z
commutes with L‚à® , SzœÜ = SœÜ . This enables us to lift the action to Œ¶e (L) by

(109)

z(œÜ, œÅ) = (zœÜ, œÅ).

To allow H‚à® to act on the above objects, we also have to define them for Levi
L-subgroups L L of L H. Generalizing (107), we put

‚ó¶
(110)
Xnr L L = Z H‚à® ‚ãä IF ‚à© L L Frob .
This group plays the role of unramified characters for L L, we will sometimes refer to
it as the unramified twists of L L. By the formula (108), Xnr (L L) acts on Langlands
parameters with image in L L. As in (109), that extends to an action on enhanced
L-parameters for L L.
The following notion replaces the data in the Langlands classification for H.
Definition 7.9. Fix a pinning of H and a WF -stable pinning of H‚à® . A standard
triple for H consists of:
‚Ä¢ a standard Levi subgroup L of H;
‚Ä¢ a bounded L-parameter œÜt ‚àà Œ¶bdd (L);
‚Ä¢ an unramified twist z ‚àà Xnr (L L), which is strictly positive with respect to
the standard parabolic subgroup P with Levi factor L.
The last condition means that Œ±‚à® (z) > 1 for every root Œ± of (UP , Z(L)‚ó¶ ), where UP
denotes the unipotent radical of P.
An enhancement of a standard triple (L, œÜt , z) is an L-relevant irreducible repreL . Let Œ∂ and Œ∂ L be as in Lemma 7.4. We say that (L, œÜ , z, œÅ )
sentation œÅt of SzœÜ

standard triples of H.

(L, œÜt , z, œÅ)

(zœÜt , œÅ).
Proof. (a) See [SiZi, Theorem 4.6]. The differences are only notational: we replaced
a standard parabolic subgroup P of H by its standard Levi factor L and we used
z ‚àà Xnr (L L) instead of the presentation of Xnr (L) by elements of a‚àóL . The regularity
of ŒΩ ‚àà a‚àóL in [SiZi] means that it lies in the open Weyl chamber of a‚àóL determined by
P. This translates to z being strictly positive with respect to P.
(b) Since z ‚àà Z(L‚à® ), œÜt and zœÜt have the same S-groups for L. In [SiZi, Proposition 7.1] it is shown that the natural map RL
zœÜt ‚Üí RzœÜt is a bijection. In Lemma

The dimensions of these spaces are, respectively, |RL

[SiZi, Proposition 7.1], so the above map is an algebra isomorphism.

The maps L Œ® and Sc from Definition 7.7 are compatible with Theorem 7.10 in
the sense that they factor through this Langlands classification.
Lemma 7.11. Let (œÜ, œÅ) ‚àà Œ¶e,Œ∂H (H) and let (L, œÜt , z, œÅt ) be the enhanced standard
triple associated to it by Theorem 7.10. Then

= z ¬∑ ScL (œÜt , œÅt ).

Proof. Because all the maps are well-defined on conjugacy classes of enhanced Lparameters, we may assume that œÜ = zœÜt and œÅ = œÅt . By definition L Œ®H (zœÜt , œÅt ) is
given in terms of qŒ®G (uœÜ , œÅ) = [M, v, q«´]G , as (ZL H (Z(M )‚ó¶ ), œÜ|WF , v, q«´). Consider

G1 := ZG (Z(L‚à®

(Z(L‚à®
c = ZH‚à®
c ) ) is a Levi subgroup of Hsc , G1 is a quasi-Levi subgroup of
sc
1
G = ZH‚à®sc (œÜ|WF ). By Proposition 5.6

qŒ®G1 (uœÜ , œÅ) = qŒ®G (uœÜ , œÅ).
In general G1 is a finite index subgroup of G2 = ZL1 ‚à®sc (œÜ|WF ). Since the quasi-cuspidal
support of (uœÜ , œÅ) (for G1 ) is derived from the cuspidal support (for G‚ó¶1 = G‚ó¶2 ), Z(M )‚ó¶
is the same for G2 and G1 . Hence
qŒ®G2 (uœÜ , œÅ) = [M2 , v, q«´2 ]G2 ,

(111)

M2 = ZG2 (Z(M )‚ó¶ ),

where q«´2 is an extension of q«´ ‚àà Irr(AM (v)) to AM2 (v). By (104) and Proposition
7.3.b q«´2 is obtained from q«´ by setting it equal to 1 on a suitable central subgroup.
As explained in the proof of Proposition 7.3 after (100), this means that as cuspidal
data
L

Œ®L (œÜ, œÅ) = (ZL L (Z(M )‚ó¶ ), œÜ|WF , v, q«´2 ) = (ZL L (Z(M )‚ó¶ ), œÜ|WF , v, q«´).

Now L L is a Levi L-subgroup of L H containing œÜ(WF ) ‚à™ {v}. In the proof of
Proposition 7.3.a we checked that L‚à® ‚ãä WF ‚äÉ ZL H (Z(M )‚ó¶ ). Hence
ZL H (Z(M )‚ó¶ ) = ZL L (Z(M )‚ó¶ )

and

8. Inertial equivalence classes of L-parameters
In important ingredient in Bernstein‚Äôs theory of representations of p-adic groups
are inertial equivalence classes. Let L ‚äÇ H be a Levi subgroup and let Xnr (L) be the
group of unramified characters L ‚Üí C√ó . Two cuspidal pairs (L1 , œÉ1 ) and (L2 , œÉ2 )
are said to be inertially equivalent if there exist an unramified character œá1 of L1
and an element h ‚àà H such that
hL2 h‚àí1 = L1

and h ¬∑ œÉ2 = œÉ1 ‚äó œá1 .

We denote a typical inertial equivalence of cuspidal pairs by s = [L, œÉ]H , we let
B(H) be the set of such classes. With every s ‚àà B(H) one can associate a set of
irreducible smooth H-representations:
Irr(H)s = {œÄ ‚àà Irr(H) : the cuspidal support of œÄ lies in s}.
A (weak) version of the Bernstein decomposition says that
G
(112)
Irr(H) =
Irr(H)s .
s‚ààB(H)

We will establish a similar decomposition for enhanced Langlands parameters.
Our notion of inertial equivalence generalizes [Hai, Definition 5.33] from homomorphisms WF ‚Üí L H to enhanced L-parameters.
Definition 8.1. Let (L L, œÜv , q«´) and (L L‚Ä≤ , œÜ‚Ä≤v , q«´‚Ä≤ ) be two cuspidal data for L H.
They are inertially equivalent if there exist z ‚àà Xnr (L L) and h ‚àà H‚à® such that
h L L‚Ä≤ h‚àí1 = L L

and (zœÜv , q«´) = (hœÜ‚Ä≤v h‚àí1 , h ¬∑ q«´‚Ä≤ ).

The class of (L L, œÜv , q«´) modulo Xnr (L L) is denoted [L L, œÜv , q«´]L L , and its inertial
equivalence class is denoted [L L, œÜv , q«´]L H . We say that [L L, œÜv , q«´]L H is H-relevant
if any of its elements is so. We write B‚à® (L H) for the set of inertial equivalence
classes of cuspidal pairs for L H, and B‚à® (H) for its subset of H-relevant classes.
Given an inertial equivalence class s‚à® for L H, we write, using Definition 7.7,
‚à®

Œ¶e (L H)s = {(œÜ, œÅ) ‚àà Œ¶e (L H) : the cuspidal support of (œÜ, œÅ) lies in s‚à® }.
When s‚à® is H-relevant, we put
‚à®

Œ¶e (H)s = {(œÜ, œÅ) ‚àà Œ¶e (H) : the cuspidal support of (œÜ, œÅ) lies in s‚à® }.

GENERALIZATIONS OF THE SPRINGER CORRESPONDENCE AND CUSPIDAL LANGLANDS PARAMETERS
51

We note that s‚à® as above determines a character of Z(Lsc ). In view of Proposition
‚à® ) trivial on Z(L )‚ó¶ .
7.3.b, it extends in a unique way to a character of Z(Hsc
c
The above construction yields partitions analogous to (112):
G
G
‚à®
‚à®
and Œ¶e (H) =
Œ¶e (H)s .
(113)
Œ¶e (L H) =
Œ¶e (L H)s
s‚à® ‚ààB‚à® (H)

s‚à® ‚ààB‚à® (L H)

‚à®

In this sense we consider Œ¶e (L H)s as Bernstein components in the space of enhanced
L-parameters for L H. We note that by Lemma 7.6 the difference between Sc(œÜ, œÅ)
and L Œ®(œÜ, œÅ), namely the homomorphism

WF ‚Üí Z(M )‚ó¶ : w 7‚Üí œáœÜ,v kwk1/2 ,

can be considered as an unramified twist of L L. Hence Sc(œÜ, œÅ) and L Œ®(œÜ, œÅ) belong
to the same inertial equivalence class, and we could equally well have used L Œ® to
‚à®
‚à®
define Œ¶e (L H)s and Œ¶e (H)s .
We return to p-adic groups, to consider other aspects of Bernstein‚Äôs work. Bernstein associated to each inertial equivalence class s = [L, œÉ]H ‚àà B(H) a finite group
Ws . Let W (H, L) = NH (L)/L, the ‚ÄúWeyl‚Äù group of L. It acts on Irrcusp (L),
which induces an action on the collection of inertial equivalence classes [L, œâ]L with
œâ ‚àà Irrcusp (L). Notice that
(L, œâ1 ), (L, œâ2 ) are H-conjugate ‚áê‚áí there is a w ‚àà W (H, L) with w ¬∑ œâ1 ‚àº
= œâ2 .
The group Ws is defined to be the stabilizer of [L, œÉ]L in W (H, L). It keeps track of
which elements of [L, œÉ]L are H-conjugate. This group plays an important role in
the Bernstein centre.
Let Rep(H) be the category of smooth complex H-representations, and let Rep(H)s
be its subcategory generated by Irr(H)s . The strong form of the Bernstein decomposition says that
G
Rep(H) =
Rep(H)s .
s‚ààB(H)

By [BeDe, Proposition 3.14] the centre of the category Rep(H)s is canonically isomorphic to O([L, œÉ]L /Ws ). Here [L, œÉ]L is regarded as a complex affine variety via
the transitive action of Xnr (L). The centre of Rep(H) is isomorphic to

We want identify the correct analogue of Ws on the Galois side. From (110) we see
that NH‚à® (L L) stabilizes Xnr (L L) and that L fixes Xnr (L L) pointwise. Therefore
W (L H, L L) also acts on classes [L L, œÜ, œÅ]L L of cuspidal data modulo unramified
twists. We note that, like (94) and (96),
(115)

[L L, œÜv , q«´]L H = [L L, œÜ‚Ä≤v , q«´‚Ä≤ ]L H

‚áê‚áí

there is a w ‚àà W (L H, L L) such that w ¬∑ [L L, œÜv , q«´]L L = [L L, œÜ‚Ä≤v , q«´‚Ä≤ ]L L .

Lemma 8.2. Wqt is canonically isomorphic to the isotropy group of (L L, œÜv , q«´) in
W (L H, L L) and in Ws‚à® .
Proof. Since Xnr (L L) is stable under W (L H, L L), any element of the latter group
which fixes (L L, œÜv , œÅ) automatically stabilizes s‚à®
L . Therefore it does not matter
whether we determine the isotropy group in W (L H, L L) or in Ws‚à® .

ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (Z(G ‚à© Lc )‚ó¶ ) is a Levi L-subgroup of L H minimally containing the image

The only difference between the last two terms is that on the left hand side elements
of G have to normalize L L, whereas on the right hand side they only have to normalize G ‚à© Lsc . Consider any g ‚àà NG (G ‚à© Lc ). It normalizes Z(G ‚à© Lc ), so it also
normalizes ZH‚à® ‚ãäWF (Z(G ‚à© Lc )‚ó¶ ), which by (119) equals L L. Therefore (120) is also
surjective.

Assume for the remainder of this section that Z(L‚à®

Levi subgroup L ‚äÇ H. (The general case is similar and can be obtained by including

Let us agree that two enhanced L-parameters in the same Bernstein component are
inseparable if they have the same infinitesimal character. Then (121) can be regarded
as a maximal separable quotient of Œ¶e (H). This fits nicely with the Dauns‚ÄìHofmann
theorem, which says that for many noncommutative algebras A the operation of
taking the maximal separable quotient of Irr(A) is dual to restriction from A to its
centre Z(A).
9. Extended quotients and L-parameters
The ABPS-conjecture from [ABPS1, ¬ß15] and [ABPS6, Conjecture 2] refines (114).
In its roughest form it asserts that it can be lifted to a bijection
Irr(H)s ‚Üê‚Üí ([L, œÉ]L //Ws )‚ôÆ ,

(122)

for a suitable family of 2-cocycles ‚ôÆ. Equivalently, this can be formulated as a
bijection

The main goal of this section is to prove an analogue of (122) and (123) for enhanced
Langlands parameters, which refines (121).
Fix a H-relevant cuspidal datum (L L, œÜv , q«´) for L H, and write, in addition to the
notations (116) and (117),
(124)

qt = [G ‚à© Lc , v, q«´]G ,

The next result is a version of the generalized Springer correspondence with enhanced
L-parameters.
Proposition 9.1. (a) There is a bijection

Àú and Œ®‚àí1‚ó¶ (t‚ó¶ ) ‚äÇ N +‚ó¶ . It relates to part (a) by

where œÅ = i œÅi is a decomposition into irreducible AG‚ó¶ (uœÜ )-subrepresentations.
(c) The H‚à® -conjugacy class of (œÜ|WF , uœÜ , œÅi ) is determined by any irreducible C[Wt‚ó¶ ]subrepresentation of L Œ£qt (œÜ, œÅ).
Proof. (a) By Theorem 5.5 (with C-coefficients) every (œÜ, œÅ) ‚àà L Œ®‚àí1 (L L, œÜv , q«´) determines a unique irreducible representation qŒ£qt (uœÜ , œÅ) of C[Wqt , Œ∫qt ]. Conversely,
+
every œÑ ‚àà Irr(C[Wqt , Œ∫qt ]) gives rise to a unique qŒ£‚àí1
qt (œÑ ) = (uœÜ , œÅ) ‚àà NG , and that
determines an enhanced L-parameter (œÜ|WF , uœÜ , œÅ) for L H. It remains to see that
‚à® )WF -character as q«´. By
(œÜ|WF , uœÜ , œÅ) is H-relevant. By (67) œÅ has the same Z(Hsc
the assumed H-relevance of q«´, œÅ is H-relevant. By Definition 6.6, (œÜ|WF , uœÜ , œÅ) is
also H-relevant.
(b) This is a direct consequence of Theorem 5.5.b.
(c) By the irreducibility of œÅ, all the œÅi are ZG (œÜ)-conjugate. Similarly the irreducibility of the C[Wqt , Œ∫qt ]-representation œÑ = L Œ£qt (œÜ, œÅ) implies (with Theorem 1.2) that

54

all the irreducible C[Wt‚ó¶ ]-constituents œÑi of œÑ are Wqt -conjugate. By part (b) œÑi
determines a pair (uœÜ , œÅi ) up to G‚ó¶ -conjugacy. Hence it determines (œÜ|WF , uœÜ , œÅi )
up to H‚à® -conjugacy.

We will promote Proposition 9.1 to a statement involving extended quotients. By
Lemma 8.2 Ws‚à® ,œÜv ,q«´ = Wqt , so we can regard Œ∫qt as a 2-cocycle Œ∫œÜv ,q«´ of Ws‚à® ,œÜv ,q«´ .
Then we can build

Comparing with (13), we see that we still need an action on Ws‚à® on this set.

Lemma 9.2. Let w ‚àà Ws‚à® and z ‚àà Xnr (L L) with w(œÜv , q«´) ‚àº
= (zœÜ, q«´). There exists
a family of algebra isomorphisms (for various such w, z)
œàw,œÜv ,q«´ : C[Ws‚à® ,œÜv ,q«´ , Œ∫œÜv ,q«´ ] ‚Üí C[Ws‚à® ,zœÜv ,q«´ , Œ∫zœÜv ,q«´ ]
such that:

Proof. (a) Recall from Lemma 5.4 that

C[Ws‚à® ,œÜv ,q«´ , Œ∫œÜv ,q«´ ] ‚àº

We fix such isomorphisms. For any n ‚àà NH‚à® (L L) representing w:

f now denotes a sheaf on nY n‚àí1 . By assumption there exists a Lsc where œÄ‚àó (qE)
intertwining map
qE ‚Üí Ad(n)‚àó qE,

(127)

and by the irreducibility of qE it is unique up to scalars. In the same way as in [Lus2,

local systems
^

We define œàw,œÜv ,q«´ as the composition of (125), œàÃÉw,œÜv ,q«´ and (126).
(b) The canonicity ensures that
œàÃÉw‚Ä≤ ,zœÜv ,q«´ ‚ó¶ œàÃÉw,œÜv ,q«´ = œàÃÉw‚Ä≤ w,œÜv ,q«´

which automatically leads to (b).
(c) For w ‚àà Ws‚à® ,œÜv ,q«´ we thus obtain conjugation by the image of qbw which by

The canonicity in part (b) can be expressed as follows. Given (L, œÜv , q«´, œÑ ‚ó¶ ) with
œÑ ‚ó¶ ‚àà Irr(Wt‚ó¶ ), the set

	
L
s‚à®
(œÜv |WF , qŒ£‚àí1
: œÑ ‚àà Irr(C[Ws‚à® ,œÜv ,q«´ , Œ∫œÜv ,q«´ ]) contains œÑ ‚ó¶
qt (œÑ )) ‚àà Œ¶e ( H)
is canonically determined.
It would be interesting to know when the above 2-cocycles Œ∫ are trivial on Ws‚à® .
Theorem 9.3.b shows that this happens quite often, in particular whenever Ws‚à®
fixes a point (L L, z ‚Ä≤ œÜv , q«´) ‚àà s‚à® and at the same time Ws‚à® equals the Weyl group
1 (z ‚Ä≤ œÜ|
W (G‚ó¶z ‚Ä≤ , L), where Gz ‚Ä≤ = ZH
‚à®
WF ).
sc

Example 9.4. Yet there are also cases in which Œ∫ is definitely not trivial. Take
H = SL5 (D), where D is a quaternion division algebra over F . This is an inner form
of SL10 (F ) and L H = PGL10 (C) √ó WF .
We will rephrase Example 3.2 with L-parameters. We can ignore the factor WF
of L H, because it acts trivially on H‚à® . Let œÜ : WF ‚Üí SL2 (C)5 be a group homomorphism whose image is the group Q from Example 3.2. It projects to a homomorphism œÜ|WF : WF ‚Üí PGL10 (C). Let u and «´ be as in the same example. These
data determine an enhanced L-parameter (œÜ, «´) for H. The group
G = NSL10 (C) (Q) = ZH‚à®sc (œÜ(WF ))
was considered in Example 3.2. We checked over there that Ws‚à® ‚àº
= (Z/2Z)2 and that
its 2-cocycle Œ∫s‚à® ,œÜ,«´ is nontrivial. We remark that this fits with the non-triviality of
the 2-cocycle in [ABPS3, Example 5.5], which is essentially the same example, but
on the p-adic side of the LLC.
Just like L Œ® in Lemma 7.11, the maps from Theorem 9.3 are compatible with the
Langlands classification for L-parameters from Theorem 7.10.
Lemma 9.5. Let (œÜ, œÅ) ‚àà Œ¶e (H) and let (L, œÜt , z, œÅt ) be the enhanced standard triple
associated to it by Theorem 7.10.
(a) Write qŒ®G (uœÜ , œÅ) = qt = [M, CvM , q«´]G , G2 = ZL1 ‚à®sc (œÜ|WF ), M2 = ZG2 (Z(M )‚ó¶ )
and qtL = [M2 , CvM2 , q«´2 ]Gt as in the proof of Lemma 7.11. Then Wqt ‚àº
= WqtL .
(b) The image of (œÜ, œÅ) ‚àà Œ¶e (H) under Theorem 9.3.a equals the image of (zœÜt , œÅt ) ‚àà
Œ¶e (L). The latter can be expressed as z ¬∑ (L Œ®L (œÜt , œÅt ), qŒ£qtL (uœÜt , œÅt )).
Proof. Because all the maps are well-defined on conjugacy classes of enhanced Lparameters, we may assume that œÜ = zœÜt and œÅ = œÅt .
(a) Recall from Lemma 8.2 that
Wqt ‚àº
= W (L H, ZL H (Z(M )‚ó¶ ))œÜv ,q«´ ,
(131)
WqtL ‚àº
= W (L L, ZL H (Z(M )‚ó¶ ))œÜv ,q«´2 .
The argument following (111) shows that we may replace q«´2 by q«´ here. Let L‚àÖ be
the unique minimal standard Levi subgroup of H‚à® . Then
W (L H, ZL (Z(M )‚ó¶ )) ‚àº
= N L L (Z(M )‚ó¶ ))/W (ZL (Z(M )‚ó¶ ), L L‚àÖ ),

‚ó¶

Recall from Definition 7.9 that œÜv |WF œÜ|WF = zœÜt |WF , where z ‚àà Xnr (L L) =
(Z(L‚à® )IF )‚ó¶Frob is strictly positive with respect to the standard parabolic subgroup
P of H having L as Levi factor. Hence the isotropy group of z in the Weyl group

58

A.-M. AUBERT, A. MOUSSAOUI, AND M. SOLLEVELD

W (L H, L L‚àÖ ) is the group generated by the reflections that fix z, which is precisely
W (L L, L L‚àÖ ).
Since œÜt is bounded and z determines an unramified character of L with values
in R>0 , every element of Wqt must fix both œÜt |WF and z. By the above Wqt ‚äÇ
W (L L, L L‚àÖ ), and then (131) shows that Wqt = WqtL .
(b) From Lemma 7.11 we know that L Œ®H (œÜ, œÅ) = L Œ®L (œÜ, œÅ). By Proposition 5.6
qŒ£qtL (uœÜ , œÅ)

is a constituent of

Res

qŒ£qt (u, Œ∑).

f ‚àº
g
EndG (œÄ‚àó (qE))
= C[Wqt , Œ∫qt ] and EndGt (œÄ‚àóGt (qE
Gt )) = C[WqtL , Œ∫qtL ].

By Proposition 5.6.b Œ∫qt |WqtL = Œ∫qtL , so in view of part (a) these two algebras are
equal. Thus qŒ£qtL (uœÜ , œÅ) = qŒ£qt (uœÜ , œÅ). Together with Lemma 7.11 this shows that
the image of (œÜ, œÅ) under Theorem 9.3.a is the same for H and for L.
Since z lifts to a central element of L‚à® , qtL is the same for (œÜt , œÅt ) and (zœÜt , œÅt ).
That goes also for qŒ£qtL (uœÜt , œÅt ). In combination with Lemma 7.11 we find that
(L Œ®L (zœÜt , œÅt ), qŒ£qtL (uœÜt , œÅt )) = z ¬∑ (L Œ®L (œÜt , œÅt ), qŒ£qtL (uœÜt , œÅt )).
