Abstract. Let M = [mij ] be an n × m real matrix, ρ be a nonzero real number, and A be a symmetric real
P
Pm
ρ
matrix. We denote by D(M ) the n × n diagonal matrix diag( m
j=1 m1j , . . . ,
j=1 mnj ) and denote by LA
the generalized Laplacian matrix D(A) − ρA. A well-known result of Grone et al. states that by connecting

one of the end-vertices of P3 to an arbitrary vertex of a graph, does not change the multiplicity of Laplacian
eigenvalue 1. We extend this theorem and some other results for a given generalized Laplacian eigenvalue µ.
Furthermore, we give two proofs for a conjecture by Saito and Woei on the relation between the multiplicity of
some Laplacian eigenvalues and pendant paths.

1. Introduction
Let A be a real symmetric matrix. There exists a unique weighted graph G such that the adjacency matrix
of G, is A; i.e. for i 6= j, Aij is the weight of the edge {i, j} and Aii is twice of the weight of the loop at the
vertex i. In this paper, we look at real symmetric matrices in this point of view.
For a positive integer n, we denote by Symn (R), the set of real symmetric matrices of order n and denote by
[n] the set {1, . . . , n}. The multiplicity of an eigenvalue λ of A is denoted by mA (λ) and a λ-eigenvector of A is
an eigenvector of A corresponding to λ. For two positive integers i and n, j n and e i , denote the all 1’s vector
and the vector with a 1 in the ith coordinate and 0’s elsewhere, respectively, in Rn . The restriction of a vector
x to any index set I is denoted by x |I and we denote the entry of x corresponding to an index u, by x (u). The
identity matrix is denoted by In or briefly I. The path, the cycle, and the star graph on n vertices are denoted
by Pn , Cn , and Sn , respectively.
Let M = [mij ] be an n × m real matrix. The transpose of M is denoted by M T and we denote by D(M ),
Pm
Pm
the n × n diagonal matrix diag( j=1 m1j , . . . , j=1 mnj ). For ρ ∈ R − {0}, we denote by LρA , the generalized
Laplacian matrix D(A) − ρA. If ρ = 1 (ρ = −1) and A(G) is the adjacency matrix of a given graph G, then we

have the Laplacian matrix L1A(G) = L(G) (signless Laplacian matrix L−1
A(G) = Q(G), respectively).

Let µ be a Laplacian eigenvalue of G. We consider the results about the relation between mL(G) (µ) and
mL(H) (µ), for a particular subgraph H of G. We recall some of these results:
Theorem 1. [6] If G′ is a graph obtained from G by connecting one of the end-vertices of P3 to an arbitrary
vertex of G, then we have mL(G) (1) = mL(G′ ) (1).
Theorem 2. [8] Let G be any graph with a simple Laplacian eigenvalue µ. Let u be a vertex of G such that an
eigenvector corresponding to µ is nonzero on u. Let H be any graph, and let G′ be the graph formed by joining
an arbitrary vertex of H to u. Then mL(H) (µ) = mL(G′ ) (µ).

A connected sum of two graphs G1 and G2 is any graph G where V (G) = V (G1 ) ∪ V (G2 ) and E(G) differs
from E(G1 ) ∪ E(G2 ) by the addition of a single edge joining some (arbitrary) vertex of V (G1 ) to some vertex
of V (G2 ), and is denoted by G = G1 #G2 [6].
Theorem 3. [6] Let G be a nonempty graph on n vertices. Let H = G#Sk be a connected sum of G with the
star on k > 1 vertices. Then mL(G) (k) = mL(H) (k)
A cluster of a graph G is an independent set of two or more vertices of G, each of which has the same set of
neighbours. The degree of a cluster is the cardinality of its shared set of neighbours, i.e., the common degree
of each vertex in the cluster. A d-cluster is a cluster of degree d. The number of vertices in a d-cluster is its
order. A collection of two or more d-clusters is independent if the sets of vertices comprising the d-clusters are
pairwise disjoint [5].
Theorem 4. [5] Let G be a graph with k independent d-clusters of orders r1 , . . . , rk . Then mL(G) (d) ≥
k.

Among other results, we generalize these results for weighted graphs and an arbitrary generalized Laplacian
eigenvalue µ.
A pendant path of a graph G is a path such that one of its end vertices has degree one and all the internal
vertices have degree two and other end vertex has degree greater than two. pk (G) denotes the number of
pendant paths of length k, and qk (G) n the number of vertices with degree greater than three which are an
end vertex of some pendant paths of length k. If k = 1, we have the well-known result of Faria [3] that
mL(G) (1) ≥ p1 (G) − q1 (G). Saito and Woei [9] conjectured that for any positive integer k, any graph G has
some Laplacian eigenvalue with multiplicity at least pk (G) − qk (G) and proved it for k = 2. The following
generalization of the conjecture has been proved in [4]. We give two proofs for this theorem in the next sections.
πi
) for any k ≥ 1 and i = 1, . . . , k, is both a Laplacian
2k + 1
and a signless Laplacian eigenvalue of G with multiplicity at least pk (G) − qk (G).
Theorem 5. [4] Let G be a graph. Then 4 cos2 (

Let A ∈ Symn (R) and λ be an eigenvalue of A of multiplicity k. A set U ⊆ [n] is a star set for λ (or λ-star
set) of A if |U | = k and λ is not an eigenvalue of the submatrix of A obtained by removing rows and columns
with index in U . It is known that for every eigenvalue λ there exists a λ-star set [2].
We recall the following theorem about star sets that we use in the next sections.
Theorem 6. [2, Theorem 7.2.6] Let U be a λ-star set of A. If mA (λ) = k, then there exists a basis of
αs : s ∈ U } such that α s (t) = δst , whenever s, t ∈ U and δ is the Kronecker delta function; its
eigenvectors {α
value is 1 if s = t, and 0 otherwise.
2. Type I Reductions: Edge Deleting
In this section, for a given eigenvalue µ, we remove a particular subgraph corresponding to µ and consider
the multiplicity of µ of remaining graph.
First, we state this following Edge Principle Theorem.
Theorem 7. [7] Let µ be a Laplacian eigenvalue of G afforded by eigenvector x . If xi = xj , then µ is an
eigenvalue of G′ afforded by x , where G′ is the graph obtained from G by deleting or adding e = {i, j} depending
on whether or not it is an edge of G.

Now, we state a weighted version of theorem above, for the Laplacian and the signless Laplacian of weighted
graphs:
Lemma 8. Let n ∈ N, ρ ∈ {−1, 1}, A ∈ Symn (R), and µ be an eigenvalue of LρA with a µ-eigenvector x .
Suppose that a ∈ R and xi = ρxj , for some i, j ∈ [n], i 6= j. If A′ is the matrix obtained from A by setting
A′ij = A′ji = Aij + a, then x is a µ-eigenvector of LρA′ .

In Theorem 9, by putting A = 0, we conclude the following corollary for the (signless) Laplacian matrix of
simple graphs:
Corollary 10. Let µ ∈ R, ρ ∈ {−1, 1}, and H be a graph and {u1 , . . . , ut } be a subset of a µ-star set of LρH .
If L is an arbitrary graph disjoint from H, and G is the graph formed by joining the vertex ui to an arbitrary
vertex vi of L (not necessarily disjoint), i ∈ [t], then mLρG (µ) = mLρL (µ) + mLρH (µ) − t.

As a particular case of Corollary 10 (t = 1), we have this theorem of [8]:
Corollary 11. [8] Let G be any graph with a simple Laplacian eigenvalue µ. Let u be a vertex of G such that an
eigenvector corresponding to µ is nonzero on u. Let H be any graph, and let G′ be the graph formed by joining
an arbitrary vertex of H to u. Then mL(H) (µ) = mL(G′ ) (µ).

Proof. Assume that LρG = V (G) − {u} x M and α is a µ-eigenvector of LρG such that α (u) 6= 0. It is sufficient
to show that {u} is a µ-star set of LρG . On the other hand, we show mM (µ) = 0. Suppose,
 by contradiction,
β (v) v 6= u,
. Since
M has a µ-eigenvector β . If x T β = 0, then y is a µ-eigenvector of LρG , where y (v) =
0
v=u
α (u) 6= 0, the vectors α and y are independent and we have a contradiction with mLρG (µ) = 1. If x T β 6= 0, then
β T x 6=0

α ⇒ α (u) x = (µI − M )α
α|V (G) − {u} ⇒ α (u)β
β T x = β T (µI − M )α
α|V (G) − {u} = 0 ====⇒ α (u) = 0,
0 = (µI − LρG )α
and we have a contradiction. This completes the proof.

Remark 12. By Corollary 10, since mL(P3 ) (1) = 1 and the value of a 1-eigenvector is nonzero on every pendant
vertex of P3 , we have Theorem 1. Also, mL(Sk ) (k) = 1 and every k-eigenvector of Sk is nowhere-zero, hence we
have Theorem 3.
2.1. Edge Switching. In the following theorem, for a given eigenvalue µ, a particular subgraph, and given
weights of the edges, we delete some edges and switch some weights from a section of graph to another section
and give the relation between the multiplicity of µ for two graphs.

for some matrices A and X, where D(A) = 0, AT α = 0 , for every µ-eigenvector α of H, and S ′ is a solution
of the equation LρS ′ + D(X T ) = ρ2 X T (LρS + D(X))−1 X, then mLρE (µ) = mLρG (µ) + |I1 |.
In particular, if LρS is invertible, then mLρc (µ) = mLρH (µ) − |I1 |.

For any ρ ∈ R \ {0, 1} and L ∈ Symn (R), it is easy to see that the equation L = LρM has a unique solution
M ∈ Symn (R). Thus, for given S ans X such that there exists (LρS + D(X))−1 , the equation LρS ′ + D(X T ) =
ρ2 X T (LρS + D(X))−1 X has a solution for S ′ .

Corollary 14 (Edge Switching). Let ρ2 = 1 and L, H be two disjoint graphs. With the notations of Theorem
13, put H = A(H), L = A(L), A = 0, and Consider the following two cases:
(1) X = I|I1 | and −S is a permutation matrix corresponding to an involution,
(2) for a given S, suppose that X is a solution of X = LρS + D(X).
Then, for both cases, S ′ = S is a solution and mLρG (µ) + |I1 | = mLρH (µ) + mLρb (µ).

Since for a non-bipartite graph H, the signless Laplacian matrix Q(H) is invertible, by a particular case of

Theorem 13, if we set S = ± 01 10 , then we can conclude the next corollary.
Corollary 15. Let H be a non-bipartite graph with a µ-star set U , for a signless Laplacian eigenvalue µ. If

u, v ∈ U and uv ∈ E(H) (uv ∈
/ E(H)), then removing (adding, resp.) the edge uv, decreases mQ(H) (µ) by 2
b
and U \ {u, v} is a µ-star set of Q(H).

Suppose that G is an r-regular graph and λ ∈ R. If mA(G) (λ) = k and U is a λ-star set of A(G), then U is an

(r − ρλ)-star set of LρG . So, we can conclude some results of Laplacian matrices similar to adjacency matrices
of regular subgraphs. For example, we state the following corollary on path subgraphs for Laplacian matrices
such that there is in [1] for adjacency matrices of graphs:
Corollary 16. A path with n vertices of valency 2 in a graph G can be replaced by an edge (see Figure 4)

Proof. We prove the corollary for ρ = 1, the other case is similar. The eigenvalues of L1Cn are (4sin2 ( kπ

(see [10]). If µ = 4sin2 ( kπ
n ) for an integer k, k ∈ [n − 1] and k 6=

n
2,

then mL1C (µ) = 2. Since every set of two
n

adjacent vertices of Cn is a (2 − µ)-star set of A(Cn ) [1], so it is a µ-star set of L1Cn . Thus, by Corollary 14, the
proof is complete.

without changing the Laplacian multiplicity of 3 and the signless Laplacian multiplicity of 1.
• n = 4 and k = 1: A path with four vertices of valency 2 in a graph G can be replaced by an edge,
without changing the (signless) Laplacian multiplicity of 2.

Proof. With the notations of Theorem 18, we put ρ = 1, H = Hi = [0]1×1 , Li = [0]d×d, and A = BiT = j d ,

then mLρE (d) = 1, for d 6= 2, and mLρE (d) = 2, for d = 2, and γ i = (1, 0, . . . , 0, −1)T is a d-eigenvector. Since

d-clusters are independent, by using Theorem 18, k times, we have mLρG (d) ≥ ki=1 (ri − 1) = ki=1 ri − k. 

Now, we give our first proof for Theorem 5. First, we need the following lemma on eigenvectors of the path

The following corollary is a straightforward consequence of Theorem 21 and Lemma 22.
Corollary 23. Let µ ∈ R, ρ ∈ R − {0} and H, L be two disjoint graphs and u ∈ V (H) and v ∈ V (L). Suppose
that H1 , . . . , Ht are t copies of H and E, K, G are graphs as shown below (see Figure 8). If mLρK (µ) = 1 and
β (v ′ ) = 0, for a µ-eigenvector β of LρK , then mLρG (µ) = mLρE (µ) + t − 1.

Second proof of Theorem 5: For brevity, we set qk (G) = q, pk (G) = p. With the notations of Corollary 23,
2tπ
we put µ = 4 cos2 ( 2(2k+1)

Example 24. µ = 4 cos2 ( 2k+1

Then mL(G) (µ) = mL(E) (µ) and mQ(G) (µ) = mQ(E) (µ).
