THE QUEST FOR
THE ULTIMATE ANISOTROPIC BANACH SPACE
VIVIANE BALADI
Dedicated to David Ruelle and Yasha Sinai on their 80th birthdays.
Abstract. We present a new scale Upt,s (s < −t < 0 and 1 ≤ p < ∞) of
anisotropic Banach spaces, defined via Paley–Littlewood, on which the transfer
operator Lg ϕ = (g · ϕ) ◦ T −1 associated to a hyperbolic dynamical system T
has good spectral properties. When p = 1 and t is an integer, the spaces
are analogous to the “geometric” spaces Bt,|s+t| considered by Gouëzel and
Liverani [26]. When p > 1 and −1 + 1/p < s < −t < 0 < t < 1/p, the
spaces are somewhat analogous to the geometric spaces considered by Demers
and Liverani [16]. In addition, just like for the “microlocal” spaces defined by
Baladi–Tsujii [10] (or Faure–Roy–Sjöstrand [19]), the transfer operator acting
on Upt,s can be decomposed into Lg,b + Lg,c , where Lg,b has a controlled norm
while a suitable power of Lg,c is nuclear. This “nuclear power decomposition”
enhances the Lasota–Yorke bounds and makes the spaces Upt,s amenable to
the kneading approach of Milnor–Thurson [34] (as revisited by Baladi–Ruelle
[8, 9, 2]) to study dynamical determinants and zeta functions.

1. Introduction
The goal of this note is to briefly present the various types of anisotropic Banach
spaces available in the dynamical systems literature, highlighting their strengths
and weaknesses, and to propose a new “microlocal” scale Upt,s which could address
the shortcomings of the existing spaces. We next explain what we mean by this.
Let T be1 a transitive C r Anosov diffeomorphism on a connected compact Riemann manifold M , with r > 1. For a complex-valued C r−1 weight function g on
M , define the Ruelle transfer operator by

Lg ϕ = (g · ϕ) ◦ T −1 .

Here, ϕ can be a function, for example in L1 (dm) or L2 (dm), with dm normalised
Lebesgue measure. It is however essential to let Lg act on Banach or Hilbert
spaces of distributions in order to obtain a spectrum with dynamical relevance. For

of the Anosov diffeomorphism T . Since the pioneering work of Blank–Keller–
Liverani [14] at the turn of the century, it has been established2 that the spectrum
of P on a suitable Banach space B of anisotropic distributions gives information on
the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measure: The spectral radius is equal to 1, where
the maximal eigenvalue is simple, while the corresponding eigenvector is in fact a
Radon measure µ, which is just the SRB measure µ of T . The rest of the spectrum
lies in a disc of radius strictly smaller than 1, which allows proving the exponential
rate of decay of the correlations

(as k → ∞) for Hölder observables ψ and ϕ. An important step towards establishing these facts is the obtention of an upper bound ρess < 1 for the essential
spectral radius of P on B. Exponential mixing of the SRB measure had of course
been obtained previously by Ruelle [37] (see also [15, (1.26)]) who worked with
a transfer operator associated to a symbolic model for the dynamics (via Markov
partitions), and used ideas from statistical mechanics. The importance of the early
contributions of Ruelle (and Sinai, see e.g. [43]) cannot be stressed enough, and
many fundamental results were obtained using the ideas they imported from statistical mechanics and the tools of Markov partitions. However, the introduction of
transfer operators acting on a Banach space B of anisotropic distributions allowed
to better exploit the C r smoothness of T . For example, working with an enhanced
version, due to Gouëzel and Liverani [26], of the anisotropic Banach space from
[14], Liverani [32] proved that, when g = | det DT |−1 , the dynamical determinant

admits an analytic extension to a disc of radius Rζ > 0 (this had been established
previously by Kitaev [30], for a larger value Rζ , by other methods), where its zeroes
are exactly the inverses of the eigenvalues of modulus ≥ Rζ−1 of Lg acting on B (this
was new). In addition, Liverani showed that Rζ can be made arbitrarily large if
r = ∞. This represented significant progress with respect to the pioneering results
of Ruelle [39] and Pollicott [36] on dynamical zeta functions and dynamical determinants for hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. (See also [33] and [11] for enhancements
of Liverani’s result on dg (z).) The anisotropic spaces are also convenient to establish statistical and stochastic stability as well as linear response [4] (simplifying the
proofs of Ruelle [40, 28]), and they could be used towards the theory of extreme
values [6].
A palette of Banach spaces of anisotropic distributions appropriate for hyperbolic
dynamics (without the need for Markov partitions nor assuming differentiability of
the dynamical foliations) have been introduced by dynamicists and semi-classical
analysts since the pioneering paper [14]. These spaces come in scales parametrised
by two real numbers v < 0 and t > 0, and, setting aside the spaces related to

the classical anisotropic spaces of Triebel [47], they can be roughly classified in two
groups: In the first, “geometric” group [14, 26], the norm of ϕ is obtained by taking
a supremum of averages (of derivatives ∂~t of ϕ, for integer t = |~t|, integrated against
C |v| test functions) over a class of admissible leaves (with tangent vectors in stable
cones for T ). Hölder versions of this space exist [16, 17] for small 0 < t < 1 and
|v| < 1. The shortcomings of this approach are that the bounds for of fractional
0 < t < 1 are cumbersome to obtain, and that (since the kneading approach of
[9, 11] is not available) the relation between the eigenvalues of the transfer operator
and the zeroes of a dynamical determinant can only be obtain in a reduced domain.
In the second group [10], the norm in charts of ϕ is the Lp average (for 1 < p < ∞)
of ∆t,v (ϕ), where the operator ∆t,v interpolates smoothly between (id + ∆)v/2
(in stable cones in the cotangent space) and (id + ∆)t/2 (in unstable cones in
the cotangent space), where ∆ is the Laplacian. This second “microlocal” (or
pseudodifferential, or Sobolev) approach is seductive since it allows using an array
of powerful techniques, in particular to study the dynamical determinant, especially
in the Hilbert case p = 2. It was embraced by the semiclassical community [19]. Its
main shortcoming is that it does not seem to be amenable to the study of piecewise
smooth systems (Appendix A, but see also Footnote 22). We mention here that
the recent proof [3] of exponential decay of correlations for Sinai billiard flows was
obtained by using the Hölder variant of the “geometric” spaces in the first group
[16, 17].
In this paper, we shall propose a new “microlocal” scale Upt,s . We expect that the
kneading operator strategy [11] can be implemented with this new norm, allowing
the study of dynamical determinants in larger domains than those accessible via
the “geometric” approach. More importantly, we believe that, contrarily to existing
“microlocal” spaces in the literature (see Appendix A), the spaces Upt,s can be used
for piecewise smooth systems (see Remark 3.9). In particular, we hope that the
new spaces can be used to obtain good bounds (in the spirit of the variational
principle type bound (25)) for the essential spectral radius of piecewise hyperbolic
maps in any dimension, if the boundaries of the smoothness domains satisfy some
transversality assumption with the stable cones, but without assuming bunching
conditions. We hope they can allow relating the eigenvalues of the transfer operator
Lg with poles of the weighted dynamical zeta function of a piecewise hyperbolic
map (in any dimension), adapting the kneading approach of [9, 11]. We expect
that similar spaces can also be introduced for piecewise hyperbolic flows, allowing
improvement of the results of [7]. Finally, spaces of the type Upt,s can perhaps
be used also for piecewise hyperbolic systems with billiard-type singularities in
any dimension. (For piecewise smooth dynamics, suitable assumptions relating
complexity and hyperbolicity will be needed, and we hope that thermodynamic
expressions like (25) will allow a formulation in terms of “pressure of the unstable
Jacobian on the boundary.”)
The anisotropic spaces Upt,s introduced below are based on Besov spaces with
different regularity exponents s < 0 < t, but replacing the spatial averaging Lp (Rd )
by supΓ Lp (Γ), for a suitable set of smooth submanifolds Γ. If the supremum were
taken over the leaves of a smooth foliation (e.g. Rds × {xdu }), this would be an
instance of a mixed (Lebesgue) norm anisotropic Besov space (see [13], see [29] for

invariance under diffeomorphisms, and see also [12, 35]). However3 we must take
in our definition below the supremum over leaves Γ ranging over a set which does
not form a foliation. Because of this difference, we will not use any mixed norms
results in the proof of the Lasota–Yorke estimates (they may be useful to show that
characteristic functions are bounded multipliers, see Remark 3.9).
A caveat is in order here: Even if the leaves Γ are all horizontal ds -dimensional
planes, the mixed norm supΓ L2 (Γ) is not associated to a scalar product. The norms
Upt,s introduced below also suffer from this handicap.
The paper is organised as follows: In Section 2, we present three types of existing anisotropic spaces (the classical Triebel spaces, the geometric spaces à la
Liverani, and the microlocal spaces) including their strong and weak points. In
Section 3.1, we explain the motivation for the new spaces Upt,s , with a recap of
the shortcoming of the existing spaces. Section 3.2 contains Definition 3.3 of Upt,s ,
and Section 3.3 is devoted to comments on this definition (Remark 3.9 there indicates why the new space could be used for piecewise smooth dynamics). Section 4
contains Theorem 4.1 which says that, if the stable dimension ds = 1, then the
essential spectral radius of the transfer operator Lg on U1t,s satisfies the same sharp
bounds as those obtained in [11]. (In Remark 4.5 we sketch a proof if ds ≥ 2.)
The proof of Theorem 4.1 hinges on the key Lasota–Yorke Lemma 4.2. We explain
in Remark 4.6 why this lemma should also imply a nuclear power decomposition.
Appendix A contains the argument of Gouëzel showing that multiplication by characteristic functions is not a bounded multiplier on the spaces of [10]. In Appendix B
we compare (heuristically) the spaces U1t,s with the spaces B t,|t+s| of [26]. Finally,
Appendix C contains some technical material regarding integration by parts, proper
support, and comparison with classical spaces.
2. A short tour in the jungle of anisotropic Banach spaces
In this section, we briefly describe the three types of existing anisotropic spaces
used for discrete-time C r hyperbolic dynamics with 1 < r ≤ ∞, listed in chronological order:
• In §2.1, Triebel-type “foliated” spaces, where invariant differentiable foliations, or invariant classes of foliations (assuming bunching), are used. (This
— classical — type was not discussed in the introduction.)
• In §2.2 “geometric” spaces due to Liverani and co-authors (Blank, Demers,
Gouëzel, Keller), where strictly invariant cones in the tangent space are
used to define admissible leaves. (This type belongs to the “geometric”
group mentioned in the introduction.)
• In §2.3 “microlocal” spaces due to Tsujii and co-authors (Baladi, Faure),
where strictly invariant cones in the cotangent space, are used, via Fourier
transforms and pseudo-differential operators. (This type belongs to the
“microlocal” group mentioned in the introduction.) The approach used by
the semi-classical community, see e.g. [19], is essentially the same.
Before we describe these three types of spaces, two observations should be made:
First, a remarkable feature of the new spaces Upt,s introduced in the following
section will involve cones both in the tangent and in the cotangent space: In the

tangent space for the definition and proofs, and in the cotangent spaces (only) in
the proofs.
Second, the situation of real-analytic hyperbolic dynamics is rather different, and
we shall not discuss it in this note. We just mention that the transfer operators are
then compact (in fact nuclear or trace class) when acting on suitable Banach (or
Hilbert) spaces, and that, very roughly, the analogues of the foliation-spaces in §2.1
are those introduced by Ruelle [38] and Fried [22], the analogues of the geometric
spaces of §2.2 are those of Rugh [41] and Fried [23], while the microlocal spaces of
§2.3 are analogous to those of Faure and Roy [18].
We now move to the definitions of the three types of spaces. As a preparation
for §2.1 and §2.3, we first recall the Fourier space description of the classical scale
of isotropic Sobolev spaces: For d ≥ 1 and x ∈ Rd , ξ ∈ Rd , we write xξ for the
scalar product of x and ξ. Then the Fourier transform F and its inverse F−1 are
defined on the space [42] of rapidly decreasing functions ϕ, ψ ∈ S by
Z

e−ixξ ϕ(x)dx , ξ ∈ Rd ,
F(ϕ)(ξ) =
Rd
Z

F−1 (ψ)(x) =
(4)
eixξ ψ(ξ)dξ , x ∈ Rd ,
(2π)d Rd
and then extended to the space [42] of temperate distributions ϕ, ψ ∈ S ′ as usual.
For x ∈ Rd , ξ ∈ Rd , and suitable a : R2d → R and ϕ : Rd → C, we shall use the
notation
aOp (ϕ)(x) = F−1 (a(x, ·) · F(ϕ))(x) , x ∈ Rd .
(We say that aOp is the operator associated to the “symbol” a.) Note that if the
function a only depends on ξ then
aOp (ϕ) = (F−1 a) ∗ ϕ ,

(5)

which implies kaOp ϕkLp ≤ kF−1 ak1 kϕkLp for all n, by Young’s inequality in Lp for
1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.
The classical Sobolev spaces Hpt for 1 < p < ∞ and t ∈ R can be defined by
Hpt (Rd ) := (id + ∆)−t/2 (Lp (Rd )) ,

(6)

(using fractional powers [44]) or, equivalently, as the Banach space of those distributions in S ′ so that
kϕkHpt := k((1 + |ξ|2 )t/2 )Op (ϕ)kLp (Rd ) < ∞ .
It is known that S is dense in Hpt (Rd ), so that Hpt (Rd ) coincides with the closure
of S for the norm kϕkHpt .
Finally, multiplier results imply that the norm kϕkHpt is equivalent to the following Paley–Littlewood norm: Fix a C ∞ function χ : R+ → [0, 1] with

Lp (R )

The norm above is a Triebel–Lizorkin-type norm: We first take an ℓ2 norm
over the indices n and then the Lp norm over the space Rd . The Besov(–Hölder–
Zygmund–Lipschitz) scales have a Paley–Littlewod description of Besov type, taking first the spatial Lp norm and then an ℓ∞ norm over indices. There are other
variants of the Besov and Triebel–Lizorkin scales [42].
We conclude with the obvious remark that if p = 2 then H2t (Rd ) is a Hilbert
space, otherwise Hpt (Rd ) is only a (complex) Banach space.
We now return to the Anosov situation. Let Rd = Rds × Rdu , with ds ≥ 1 and
du ≥ 1 the stable and unstable dimensions of our Anosov diffeomorphism T . Let
also λs < 1 < λu be the weakest asymptotic contraction and weakest asymptotic
expansion of T . Using an adapted Mather metric, we can assume that the expansion
of Dx T along Exu is stronger than λu , while its contraction along Exs is stronger
than λs , and that the angle between Exs and Exu is everywhere arbitrarily close to
π/2. We proceed with definitions of the main existing scales of anisotropic spaces
in the following subsections, emphasizing that the anisotropic spaces will involve
positive regularity in the unstable directions of T and negative regularity in the
stable directions of T .
2.1. Triebel-type “foliated” spaces [1, 4, 5, 7]. Denote the full Laplacian by
Pds 2

∂xj and ∆u =

j=ds +1 ∂xj . Triebel spaces such as
(10)

Hpt,s (Rd ) := (id + ∆)−t/2 (id + ∆s )−s/2 (Lp (Rd )) ,

for 1 < p < ∞ and t, s ∈ R have been well studied [47, 48]. The choices s < −t < 0
will be natural for us. The Triebel spaces4 Hpt,s , as well as the similar spaces
(11)

(id + ∆)−t/2 (id + ∆u )−u/2 (Lp (Rd ))

(with t < 0 fractional global derivatives and t + u > 0 unstable derivatives) and
(12)

(id + ∆s )−s/2 (id + ∆u )−u/2 (Lp (Rd ))

(with s < 0 fractional stable derivatives and u > 0 fractional unstable derivatives)
all have a definition using the Fourier transform. For Hpt,s , we have
kϕkHpt,s ≃ k((1 + |ξ|2 + |η|2 )t/2 (1 + |η|2 )s/2 )Op (ϕ)kLp (Rd ) ,
where ≃ means that the norms are equivalent, and where ξ ∈ Rdu and η ∈ Rds .
Finally, S is dense in each of the spaces just described [47], and each space has
a Paley–Littlewood description, by standard multiplier results.
Such Triebel spaces can be used for transfer operators under the (very strong)
assumption that at least one of the dynamical foliations of T (stable or unstable)
is at least C 1+ǫ . To define, e.g., Hpt,s (M ), assuming that the stable foliation of
T is C 1+ǫ , consider a finite system of C 1+ǫ local charts {(Vω , κω )}ω∈Ω , that is, a
cover V = {Vω } of M by open subsets Vω and diffeomorphisms κω : Uω → Vω
4Note that the total fractional derivative in the stable directions is t + s and not s.

such that M ⊂ ∪ω Vω , and Uω is a bounded open subset of Rd for each ω ∈ Ω,

Transfer operators acting on anisotropic Banach spaces based on Hpt,s were first
studied in [1] (under the stronger assumption that the foliations be C ∞ , see [4]
e s,t (M ) of the space allows working in more
for C 1+ǫ foliations). A modification H
p
generality, replacing the differentiability assumption on the foliations by a bunching
condition on the Lyapunov exponents [5, 7]. The idea is to consider a class of
foliations admissible with respect to stable cones (the class – but not the individual
foliations — being invariant under the dynamics).

Upper bound for the essential spectral radius of P: When T is an Anosov
diffeomorphism satisfying bunching conditions [5, (2.3)–(2.4)], the results of [4, 5]
imply, for the modified norm described above:
−t−s
ρess (P|Heps,t (M) ) ≤ lim sup(sup | det DT n |1/p−1 )1/n max{λ−t
},
u , λs
n→∞

where s < −t < 0 with t − s < r − 1. For the variant given by (11), we get, under
suitable bunching conditions,
lim sup(sup | det DT n |1/p−1 )1/n max{λu−t−u , λ−t
s },
n→∞

where u − t < r − 1. If both stable and unstable foliations are differentiable, we get
for the Triebel space given by (12),
−s
lim sup(sup | det DT n |1/p−1 )1/n max{λ−u
u , λs } ,
n→∞

where u − s < r − 1. These bounds give the best results when p → 1. See also
[4, 5, 2] for more general weighted operators Lg .
Advantages: For p = 2 we get a Hilbert space. Strichartz proved [45] that
Hpt (Rd ) is invariant under multiplication by characteristic functions of domains E
with piecewise smooth boundaries if −1 + 1/p < t < 1/p. This property is inherited
[4] by Hpt,s if −1 + 1/p < s ≤ t < 1/p, as long as the boundary of E satisfies some
transversality condition with respect to the stable foliation (and similarly for (11)
and (12), as well as the variants in [5, 7], mutatis mutandis). This allows the study
of piecewise cone hyperbolic systems satisfying bunching (as well as complexity and
transversality) conditions [4, 5, 7].
Limitations: The bunching condition is a strong limitation especially in high
dimensions. Also, the spaces in [5, 7] do not seem adapted5 to study systems such
as discrete-time billiards, where the derivatives of the map may (and do) blow up
at the boundaries of the smoothness domains.
5The compact embedding lemma causes problems, since it makes it necessary to require dynamically invariant bounds on the Jacobians of the charts which trivialise the admissible foliations.

2.2. Cones in the tangent space: The “geometric” spaces B t,v of Gouëzel–
Liverani. The idea for these spaces was introduced in [14] and perfected in [26, 27]
(in particular the averages over the whole manifold used in [14] were replaced there
by averages over admissible stable leaves, as in [31], and as described below). We
first recall the notion of admissible stable leaves from Gouëzel and Liverani [26, §3].
For κ > 0, we define the stable cone at x ∈ V by
C s (x) = {w1 + w2 ∈ Tx M | w1 ∈ E s (x) , w2 ⊥ E s (x) , kw2 k ≤ κkw1 k} .
If κ > 0 is small enough then Dx T −1 (C s (x) \ {0}) lies in the interior of C s (T (x)),
and Dx T −1 expands the vectors in C s (x) by λs−1 .
Definition 2.1 (Admissible charts). There exist an integer N , real numbers ǫω ∈
(0, 1), and C r coordinate charts κω defined on (−ǫω , ǫω )d ⊂ Rd , such that M is
covered by the open sets κω ((−ǫω /2, ǫω /2)d ) ω=1...N , and the following conditions

hold: Dκω (0) is an isometry, Dκω (0) · Rds × {0} = E s (κω (0)), and the C r -norms
of κω and its inverse are bounded by 1 + κ.
Pick cω ∈ (κ, 2κ) such that the cone in charts
Cωs = {w1 + w2 ∈ Rd | w1 ∈ Rds × {0}, w2 ∈ {0} × Rdu , kw2 k ≤ cω kw1 k}
satisfies Dx κω (Cωs ) ⊃ C s (κω (x)) and Dκω (x) T −1 (Dκω (x)Cωs ) ⊂ C s (T −1 (κω (x))) for
any x ∈ (−ǫω , ǫω )d . Let Gω (C0 ) be the set of graphs of C r maps γ : Uγ →
(−ǫω , ǫω )du defined on a subset Uγ of (−ǫω , ǫω )ds , with |Dγ| < cω and |γ|C r ≤ C0 .
(In particular, the tangent space to the graph of γ belongs to the interior of the
cone Cωs .) Uniform hyperbolicity of T implies (see [26, Lemma 3.1]) that if C0 is
large enough, then there exists C0′ < C0 such that, for any Γ ∈ Gω (C0 ) and any ω,
−1
(κω (Γ))) is included in Gω (C0′ ).

range(id, γ) ∈ Gω (C0 ). An admissible stable leaf is Γ = κω ◦ (id, γ)(B̄(w, δ)) where
γ : B̄(w, K1 δ) → Rdu is an admissible graph on Bω := (−2ǫω /3, 2ǫω /3)ds .

Advantages: One of the strong points of the approach above using admissible
leaves is that the norm can be modified to accommodate systems with singularities,
including discrete and continuous-time billiards. We refer to [16, 17, 3].
Limitations: There is no Hilbert space in these scales. The kneading approach
to dynamical determinants is not available and is replaced by other methods inspired from D. Dolgopyat’s thesis [33, 24]. Unfortunately, these methods give a
−1/2
value for Rζ which is of the order of ρess .
Since t > 0 must be an integer, the regularity assumption on T is C r for r > 2
and the constraint on v is v < r − 1 − t ≤ r − 2. The thermodynamic analysis in
[11, §3] giving the sharp bound (25) (see also [2]) is not available for these spaces.
The analogues of the spaces for piecewise smooth systems [16, 17, 3] are not
very easy to handle (stable and unstable norms must be handled separately, and the
unstable norm involves Hölder quotients for t < 1) and have only been implemented
in dimension two for maps and three for flows.

from [10]. We need some notation. A cone in Rd is a
subset which is invariant under scalar multiplication. For two cones C and C′
in Rd , we write C ⋐ C′ if C ⊂ interior (C′ ) ∪ {0}. We say that a cone C is
d′ -dimensional if d′ ≥ 1 is the maximal dimension of a linear subset of C.
Definition 2.3. A cone pair is C± = (C+ , C− ), where C+ and C− are closed
cones in Rd , with nonempty interiors, of respective dimensions du and ds and so
that C+ ∩ C− = {0}. A cone system is a quadruple
ϕ− = 1 − ϕ+ ,

Θ = (C± , ϕ+ , ϕ− ) ,
with C± = (C+ , C− ) a cone pair and ϕ± : S

Definition 2.5 (Admissible charts and partition of unity for T ). Admissible charts
and partition of unity for T are: A finite system of C ∞ local charts {(Vω , κω )}ω∈Ω ,
with open subsets Vω ⊂ M , and diffeomorphisms κω : Uω → Vω such that M ⊂
∪ω Vω , and Uω is a bounded open subset of Rd for each ω ∈ Ω, together with a finite
C ∞ partition of unity {θω } for M , subordinate to the cover V = {Vω }.
Definition 2.6 (Admissible cone systems for T ). Since T is Anosov, we may choose
local charts indexed by a finite set Ω as in Definition 2.5, and cone pairs {Cω,± =
(Cω,+ , Cω,− )}ω∈Ω , so that the following conditions hold7:
∗
• If x ∈ Vω , the cone (Dκ−1
ω )x (Cω,+ ) contains the (du -dimensional) nors
∗
mal subspace of E (x), and the cone (Dκ−1
ω )x (Cω,− ) contains the (ds u
dimensional) normal subspace of E (x).
• If Vω′ ω = T (Vω ) ∩ Vω′ 6= ∅, the C r map corresponding to T −1 in charts,
−1
F = κ−1

extends to a bilipschitz C 1 diffeomorphism of Rd so that, using Atr to
denote the transposition of a matrix A,
DFxtr (Rd \ Cω,+ ) ⋐ Cω′ ,− ,

∀x ∈ Rd .

(We say that F is cone hyperbolic from Cω,± to Cω′ ,± .)
• In addition, there exists, for each x, y, a linear transformation Lxy satisfying
(Lxy )tr (Rd \ C+ ) ⋐ C′− and Lxy (x − y) = F (x) − F (y). (We say that F is
regular cone hyperbolic from Cω,± to Cω′ ,± .)
The anisotropic spaces introduced8 in [11] and in [19] are variants of the spaces
(The semiclassical approach [19] takes p = 2 and uses “escape functions,”
which play the role of our cone systems.)

below.

Lyapunov exponent of a linear cocycle A over T . (For general operators Lg the
bound from [11] is stated below in (25).)
Advantages: The bound (25) for the essential spectral radius ρess of Lg on
the spaces of [11] is the sharpest known. (The proof uses thermodynamic sums via
suitable partitions of unity and fragmentation–reconstruction lemmas.)
The nuclear power decomposition obtained in [11, 2] allows implementing the
kneading operator approach to obtain the sharpest known estimate for Rζ , of the
order of ρ−1
ess (as in [30]) for the radius of holomorphy of the weighted dynamical
determinant (2).
For p = 2 we get a Hilbert space.
The variants introduced by the semi-classical community (following the work of
Faure–Roy–Sjöstrand, [19, 20]) have led to spectacular results on hyperbolic flows
which are beyond the scope of the present paper.
Limitations: Multiplication by the characteristic function of a domain (however smooth the boundary of that domain, and even if its boundary is transversal
t,s
to the cones) is in general not a bounded operator on the spaces Wp,†
from [10]
(see Appendix A). This fact, which was first noticed by Gouëzel [25], is a serious
obstruction to study piecewise smooth systems. The other spaces in [10, 11, 19]
also appear to suffer from this limitation.
Note also that the Leibniz9 bounds for the spaces in [10, 11] require different
cone systems in the left-hand and right-hand sides, see e.g. the proof of [10, Prop.
7.2] or [2].
We end with the limitations of the semi-classical variant of the spaces [19]: The
pseudodifferential tools used there only work if r is large enough, depending on d.
Also, the thermodynamic sums leading to the good bound (25) obtained in [11] for
the essential spectral radius are not explicitly available there.
3. A Paley–Littlewood avatar of the Demers–Gouëzel–Liverani
spaces: Upt,s
3.1. Motivation. In this section, we give a “microlocal” (Paley–Littlewood) definition of spaces Upt,s with s < −t < 0 which are inspired by the “geometric” spaces
(see Appendix B) B t,|s+t| from [26] discussed in §2.2.
Before defining the new spaces, we list the advantages of the new scale with
respect to the existing ones:
• Compared to the Triebel (foliation) norms [1, 4, 5] presented in §2.1 the advantage is that, since we replace the foliations by “free” admissible leaves
and use mixed Lebesgue-norms, we do not need bunching assumptions10
and we can also hope to study piecewise hyperbolic systems, even with
billiard-type singularities. Indeed, when iterating, we handle the global derivative ((id + ∆)t/2 with t > 0) and the foliated derivative (of the type
9A Leibniz bound is a bound on the norm of f ϕ, for smooth enough f , in terms of the norm
of ϕ and the derivatives or modulus of continuity of f .
10Iterating Triebel anisotropic spaces H t,s via admissible charts, even with a mixed norm —
supremum over verticals of an Lp norm over horizontals — requires bunching assumptions [5] to
obtain invariance of charts if the stable foliation of T is not smooth, and also control of Jacobians,
not available for Sinai billiards.

(id + ∆s )s/2 , with s < 0, along admissible stable leaves of T ) almost separately (except for the use of (35) to couple wave packets for Rd and for a
stable leaf Γ in the proof of Sublemma 4.4). (See also Remark 3.8.)
• With respect to the geometric norms B t,|v| discussed in §2.2 the advantage is
that we may now consider all real parameters t > 0, while Gouëzel–Liverani
[26, 27] were limited 11 to integer t ≥ 1. This gives sharper bounds, also in
view of the possibility of using thermodynamic sums as in [11].
Also, since the decomposition of the transfer operators given in the
Lasota–Yorke Lemma 4.2 (see Remark 4.6) is of “nuclear power” type, we
expect that we can carry out the kneading operator arguments of Milnor–
Thurston [34] as revisited in [9] and, especially, [11] (see also [2]). This
would allow improving on the results of Liverani et al. [33] (and the results
from the semiclassical community, which often require large differentiability
in large dimension) on the dynamical determinant (2), also potentially for
piecewise smooth systems and for continuous-time dynamics (flows) especially in high dimension or low regularity.
• With respect to the microlocal norms from [10, 11, 19] discussed in §2.3 (see
Appendix A), the advantage is that, for p > 1, t < 1/p, and s > −1 + 1/p,
we may hope to work with spaces Upt,s in piecewise smooth hyperbolic
situations (like in [16] or [17], see Remark B.2) and piecewise hyperbolic
systems with billiard-type singularities like [17, 3]. (See Remark 3.9.)
Linear response was recently obtained [6] for hyperbolic systems and
some discontinuous observables by using spaces B t,|s+t| from [26], and we
may hope to also prove this result by using Upt,s .
Other positive aspects with respect to the spaces of [10, 11] could be
a more straightforward Leibniz inequality, see the comment after Corollary 4.3, and a more direct [2] proof of the relation between maximal eigenvectors and Gibbs states for general positive weights g, in particular a better
understanding of induced measures on quasi-unstable leaves [27].
We end by mentioning that both the definition of the flat trace [11, 2] (which is
an ingredient of the kneading operator argument) and the Dolgopyat estimates [7]
(for flows) are essentially norm-independent.
3.2. Paley–Littlewood definition of Upt,s . We shall use the cone systems Θ from
Definition 2.3. The other key ingredient is adapted12 from [11]:
Definition 3.1 (Fake stable leaves). Let C+ be a cone, and let CF > 1. Let
F (C+ , CF ) (also noted simply F (C+ ) or F when the meaning is clear) be the set
of all C r (embedded) submanifolds Γ ⊂ Rd , of dimension ds , with C r norms of
submanifold charts bounded by CF , and so that the straight line connecting any
two distinct points in Γ is normal to a du -dimensional subspace contained in C+ .
If F is regular cone hyperbolic from C± to C′± (recall Definition 2.6) then,
assuming in addition13 that the extension of F to Rd is C r there exists CF < ∞ so
that this extension maps each element of F (C+ ) to an element of F (C′+ ).
11Demers–Liverani [16] only consider two-dimensional systems and require not very handy

Hölder-type ratios to handle regularity t < 1, see also [17, 3].
12The submanifolds Γ there were only assumed to be C 1 and the condition on C was absent.
F
13This is possible in the application, up to taking smaller charts.

THE QUEST FOR THE ULTIMATE ANISOTROPIC SPACE

We need some notation in view of performing dyadic decompositions in Fourier
space. We may assume that E− := Rds × {0} is included in C− , and we denote
by π = π− the orthogonal projection from Rd to the quotient Rds and by πΓ
its restriction to Γ. Our assumption on F implies that πΓ : Γ → Rds is a C r
diffeomorphism onto its image with a C r inverse. Letting π+ be the projection
from Rd to the quotient Rd \ E− = Rdu , we have that Γ is the graph of the C r map
γ = π+ ◦ πΓ−1 : Rds ∩ π− (Γ) → Rdu ,

(15)

and the C r norm of γ is bounded by a universal scalar multiple of CF .

We are considering admissible leaves on the manifolds like Liverani et al. [26, 16],
so for all practical purposes the cones live in the tangent space and not in the
cotangent space. To prove Lasota–Yorke estimates, however, it will be crucial to
also use cones in the cotangent space, see (35). (The reader was already warned in
Footnote 8 that the analogy with the norms [11] is misleading and superficial.)

only s, but also t, can be taken arbitrarily close to zero, the spaces Upt,s are also
somewhat similar to the Demers–Liverani spaces of [16] when p > 1 and −1 + 1/p <

but in view of the first paragraph of this remark, we expect that this would just make
the computations more painful without any benefit. Also, since it is convenient to
take the supremum over Γ at the very end of Definition 3.3, the choice q = ∞ is
most compatible with a Besov norm. (See however Appendix B.)

embedding and interpolation properties. The right-hand side in (22) is similar to
C ,t,s
Up ± , except that we restrict to Σ instead of considering all Γ ∈ F (C+ ). Now,
for each Γ ∈ F , we can construct a C r foliation of manifolds parallel to Γ (obtained
by trivial translations) by recalling (15) and setting

(23)

ΦΓ (x− , x+ ) = (x− , γ(x− ) + x+ ) ,

noting that ΦΓ maps the horizontal hyperplane through the origin Rds × {0} to Γ,
and ΦΓ maps each horizontal Rds × {x+ } to a parallel leaf Γx+ . Note also that the
jacobian of the holonomy x+ 7→ γ(x− ) + x+ is constant equal to 1. Each leaf Γx+
also belongs to F (C+ ), up to taking smaller chart neighbourhoods. Using ΦΓ as
a straightening chart for the parallel foliation, and noting that γΓ satisfies uniform
bounds by definition of F , we have argued that the norms
(24)

sup kϕ ◦ ΦΓ kB t,s

(∞,p),(∞,∞)

and kϕkUpt,s are similar. Beware however that when proving the Lasota–Yorke
.
bound we should use Upt,s , and not the equivalent norm supΓ kϕ ◦ ΦΓ kB t,s
(∞,p),(∞,∞)

In other words, working with Upt,s is the key to bypassing invariance of charts under
the dynamics (this invariance caused difficulties in [5, 7]). However, the theory of
mixed anisotropic Besov norms can perhaps be used to obtain other properties (see
e.g. Remark 3.9).
Remark 3.9 (Piecewise smooth systems). In the application to transfer operators
of C r Anosov diffeomorphisms, we take −(r − 1) < s < −t < 0. In view of considering piecewise smooth hyperbolic maps, we conjecture that multiplication by the
characteristic function of a domain E with piecewise smooth boundary (satisfying

16

VIVIANE BALADI

[4, 5] a suitable transversality condition with respect to the cone C− ) is a bounded
multiplier on Upt,s if
−1 + 1/p < s < −t < 0 < t < 1/p .
We sketch a possible argument involving interpolation (another strategy would be
to use paraproducts as in [42, §4.6.3]).
Recall (see e.g. [42, Thm 4.6.3/1]) that for any 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞, multiplication by the
characteristic function of a half-plane in Rn is a bounded multiplier on the Besov
s
space Bp,q
(Rn ) if p1 − 1 < s < p1 . For t = 0 and −1 + 1/p < s < 0, we may apply
s
this bounded multiplier property on each Bp,∞
(Rds ). (Assuming that the number
of connected components of E ∩ Γ is uniformly bounded: this is the transversality
condition.)
For s = 0 and 0 < t < 1/p, take a sequence of leaves Γn tending to the supremum
realising the norm (18) of χE ϕ. For each leaf Γn , we can construct a C r foliation of
leaves in F (C+ ) parallel to Γn (obtained by trivial translations), see (23). Then, the
supremum over the leaves of this foliation of the supremum over ℓ in (18) is similar
0
in spirit to a mixed Besov [13] norm , where supx+ kϕ(·, x+ )kBp,∞
(Rds ) replaces
t
d
kϕkLp(Rd ) in Bp,∞ (R ). So we can hope that the bounded multiplier property
extends to the case s = 0.
In view of the known interpolation results [13, §30], we can hope that interpolating between the cases t = 0 and s = 0 would give the desired bound for each
fixed Γn (as in [4, Lemma 23]).
As a final comment, note that in [16], [17], or [3], the fact that the systems are
only piecewise smooth is not16 handled by showing that multiplication by characteristic functions of suitable domains E is a bounded operator on the space. Instead,
the authors use a t-Hölder quotient in the transversal (i.e. unstable) direction,
where the leaves Γ must be “comparable,” i.e., both lie in a single domain E where
smoothness (including bounded distortion) holds.
4. Bounding the essential spectral radius of Lg on U1t,s
In this section, we prove the following result:
Theorem 4.1 (Essential spectral radius of Lg on U1t,s ). If ds = 1 then the essential
spectral radius of the transfer operator Lg (ϕ) = (g · ϕ) ◦ T −1 enjoys the same upper
bound when acting on U1t,s as on the space C t,v from [11] with v = t + s, that is:
Z
n

exp sup
µ∈Erg (T )

(25)

	o

+ max tχµ (DT −1 |E u ), |t + s|χµ (DT |E s ) .

The bound (25) is the best known [11, 2, 30] estimate on the essential spectral
radius in the hyperbolic case. The new norm U1t,s is thus at least as good as the
norm from [11] if ds = 1. We believe that Theorem 4.1 also holds if ds > 1:
Remark 4.5 in §4.2 contains the ideas needed for a proof. We refrain from spelling
this proof out in full detail, in order to keep the length of this note within reasonable
bounds.
16Lemma 3.7 of [17] shows that such characteristic functions belong to the space, which is in
general a weaker statement.

the Riemannian metric on each ds -dimensional linear subspace.
The key lemma follows:
Lemma 4.2 (Local Lasota–Yorke estimate). Let C and C′ be two cone pairs. and
let K ⊂ Rd be compact. For any −(r − 1) < s < −t < 0 there exists C > 0
so that for every C r−1 function f supported in the interior of K and every C r
diffeomorphism F defined on an open subset U of Rd containing K which is regular
cone hyperbolic from C± to C′± , and such that kF k− ≥ 1, the following holds: let
φ ∈ C ∞ be supported in K and ≡ 1 on the support of f . Set
M(ϕ) = f · (ϕ ◦ F ) ,
then there exists a decomposition M = Mb + Mc = φMb + φMc so that, denoting

We end this subsection with a Leibniz bound:

Lemma 4.3 (Leibniz bound on Upt,s ). Let r > 1, and let −r + 1 < s < −t < 0. If

We expect that M is a bounded operator even if F is not cone hyperbolic, and
that the Leibniz inequality above also holds without the conditions on C± and C′± .
4.2. Introducing cones — Sublemma 4.4. In the proof of Lemma 4.2, it will
be necessary to distinguish the frequencies in the cotangent space which are in
(DF tr )−1 (Rd \ C+ ). Towards this goal, recalling the function χ from (7), and
letting ξ ∈ Rd , define ψ̃0 (ξ) = χ(2−1 kξk) and
(33)

ψ̃ℓ (ξ)

= χ(2−ℓ−1 kξk) − χ(2−ℓ+2 kξk) ,

ℓ ≥ 1.

Note that the ψ̃ℓ satisfy (9) and, in addition, ψ̃ℓ (ξ) = 1 if ξ ∈ supp(ψℓ ) (where the
functions ψℓ , with “thinner supports,” giving a partition of unity were defined in
(8)). Next, for σ ∈ {+, −}, write

ψℓOp (ϕ)ksp,Γ + kψ̃Θ,ℓ,−

The first inequality is just the triangle inequality since ψℓ = (ϕ+ + ϕ− )ψ̃ℓ ψℓ . For
the second inequality, it is enough to show that for σ = ± and all ϕ

The bound (36) is a consequence of the easily proved fact that (see e.g. [10])
(37)

sup kF−1 (ψ̃Θ,ℓ,σ )kL1 (Rd ) < ∞ ,

(ℓ,σ)

together with the following version of Young’s inequality (which can be proved like
[11, Lemma 4.2], see also [2, Chapter 5], by using that any translation Γ + x of
Γ ∈ F also belongs to F ):

kψ̂ ∗ ϕksp,Γ ≤ kψ̂kL1 (Rd ) sup kϕksp,Γ+x ≤ kψ̂kL1 (Rd ) sup kϕksp,Γ̃ .

In the sequel, we shall sometimes abusively neglect to insert the operators ψ̃ℓOp

, to simplify notation. (In view of Young’s inequality (38) and the almost
orthogonality property ψnOp ◦ ψ̃ℓOp ≡ 0 if |n − ℓ| > 5, this does not create problems.)
The proof of Lemma 4.2 will be based on the following sublemma:
Sublemma 4.4. Let 1 ≤ p < ∞, let −(r − 1) < s < 0, and let Θ, Θ′ and F be
fixed. Then there exists C so that for any F , f , and M as in Lemma 4.2, there
exists m0 so that for all n ≥ m0 , all Γ ∈ F (C+ ), and all ϕ,

Postponing the proofs of Lemma 4.2 and Sublemma 4.4 to §4.3, we next prove
the theorem:
Proof of Theorem 4.1. If the local map F is T −m in charts, where T is a C r Anosov
diffeomorphism, the bound on Mb in Lemma 4.2 can be enhanced, as we explain
next. First, if m is large enough and K is small enough (the latter follows from
taking suitable m-dependent partitions of unity, as part of our pedestrian “microlocal” approach), we may assume in addition that F −1 is cone hyperbolic from C′±
to C± and, recalling (29), that
(41)

| det(DF |C⊥
)| > 1 , kF k−− ≥ kF k− > 1 , kF k+ < 1 , C(F, Γ, s) ≤ 2 .
+

Since ds = 1, we may in addition ensure that kF k− /kF k−− ≤ 1 be arbitrarily close
to 1, by taking K sufficiently small (via suitably refined partitions of unity). The
factor in the right-hand side of (30) in Lemma 4.2 can then be improved to
(42)

the bound (42). If p = 1, we claim that this is sufficient to get the claimed bound
(25) on the essential spectral radius when ds = 1: Indeed, we may proceed exactly
as in [2, Chapter 5, Proof of Thm 5.1] (see also [11]) using Hennion’s theorem, and
suitable charts to get bounds by thermodynamic sums (see [2, Appendix B]) via
partitions of unity (adapted to T m ). We refer to [2, Chapter 5, Proof of Thm 5.1] for
details. We just mention here that, in the present case, the “fragmentation lemma”
(used to expand along a partition of unity) is just the triangle inequality, while
the “reconstitution lemma”

P (used toP

variant of Corollary 4.3: If the θk are smooth functions, then supk kθk ϕkU t,s may be

Just like in the proof of Theorem 4.1 for ds = 1, we can make kF k− as close
(j)
as desired to kF k−− , so that (42) (and thus the bound from Theorem 4.1 on the
essential spectral radius) should also hold if ds > 1.
4.3. Proving Sublemma 4.4 and Lemma 4.2. We first prove the lemma and
then the sublemma (both proofs will use the modified Young inequality (38)):
Proof of Lemma 4.2. We shall use (35). We need more notation: For m0 ≥ 1
fixed large enough19, depending on F , F , and s, in Sublemma 4.4, we say that
(ℓ, τ ) ֒→ (n, σ) if (exactly) one of the following conditions holds:
• (τ, σ) = (+, +) and 2n ≤ kF k+ 2ℓ+4 ,
• (τ, σ) = (−, −) and 2m0 ≤ 2n ≤ 2ℓ+4 kF k−− ,
• (τ, σ) = (+, −) and 2m0 ≤ 2n ≤ 2ℓ+4 kF k−− .
Otherwise, we write (ℓ, τ ) 6֒→ (n, σ). (This is a variant of the notion used in [10, 11].)
By the definition of 6֒→ and by cone hyperbolicity, there exists an integer N (F ) >
0 such that, if (ℓ, τ ) 6֒→ (n, σ) and max{n, ℓ} ≥ N (F ), we have
(44)

d(supp(ψΘ′ ,n,σ ), DFxtr (supp(ψ̃Θ,ℓ,τ ))) ≥ 2max{n,ℓ}−N (F )

We decompose M = Mb + Mc where

If σ = +, we have for any (ℓ, τ ) ֒→ (n, +) that P
τ = +, and, since t > 0, the
definition ensures 2nt ≤ CkF kt+ 2ℓt . This implies (ℓ,+)֒→(n,+) 2nt−ℓt ≤ CkF kt+
and by (40) from Sublemma 4.4 and (36), we obtain the term with kF kt+ in (30).
If σ = − and τ = −, then since t > 0, it follows that for any (ℓ, −) ֒→ (n, −)
(45)

2nt ≤ CkF kt−− 2ℓt .

If σ = − and τ = +, since t > 0, it follows that for any (ℓ, +) ֒→ (n, −)
(46)

2nt ≤ CkF kt−− 2ℓt .

19The constant C
F,f,δ in (31) depends on m0 but the constant in (30) does not.

THE QUEST FOR THE ULTIMATE ANISOTROPIC SPACE

21

So, if σ = − then, by (39) from the Sublemma, we get the term with kF ks− kF kt−−
in (30) (if m0 is large enough).
Recall that for k ∈ Z∗+ the k-th approximation number of a bounded operator
Q : B → B ′ between Banach spaces is
ak (Q) = inf{kQ − RkB→B′ | rank (R) < k} .

(47)

Clearly, limk→∞ |ak (Q)| = 0 implies that Q is compact. Using the bound (31)
and Lemma 3.5 to control the approximation numbers of φMc (as in [11] and [2])
implies the compactness claim on φMc .
It remains to show the bound (31) on Mc . For this, we shall use integration by
parts as in [10, 11]: Recalling the functions ψ̃ℓ from (33), we claim that it is enough
to show that if (ℓ, τ ) 6֒→ (n, σ) then

Thus, using Corollary 4.3 in order to take into account20 the factor φ (this is

present proof), we get for any ϕ supported in F (K) that

of Mc . The estimate (49) also gives that Mc is bounded from Up ±
to Up ± .
To prove (48), we use (38) together with integration by parts: Since (48) is
obvious when max{n, ℓ} < N (F ), we shall assume max{n, ℓ} ≥ N (F ). We have

simplicity we disregard this operation.

Since kϕ ◦ F ksp,Γ ≤ C(F )kϕksp,F (Γ) , the bound (48) follows if we show that there

for some CF,f > 0 and all (ℓ, τ ) 6֒→ (n, σ). Indeed, as the right hand side of (54) is
written as a function of x − y, we can apply (38). Finally, (54) can be proved by
integrating (51) by parts (r − 1) times with respect to w in the sense of Appendix C
and using (44), just like in [10, 11].

The Leibniz bound is now straightforward:
Proof of Lemma 4.3. The claim is an immediate consequence of (30) and the bound
(48) in the first part of the proof of Lemma 4.2.

It remains to prove the sublemma:
Proof of Sublemma 4.4. Since −(r − 1) < s < 0, the bound (40) is not difficult
s
(Rds ) is the dual of little Besov space
to prove, using e.g. the fact that Bp,∞

bp/(p−1),1 (Rds ), and is left to the reader.
Fix φ, smooth, compactly supported and ≡ 1 on the support of f . To prove
(39), we shall show that there exists a constant C (depending only on the cone
systems, and on the support and the C r norm of φ) and for any δ > 0, there exists
a constant CF,f,δ so that, for any Γ̃ ∈ F and any C ∞ function ϕ on Rd , there exists
a decomposition

M(ϕ)(w) = Mb,Γ̃ (ϕ)(w) + Mc,Γ̃ (ϕ)(w) ,

This gives (55). We next check (56) and (57).
First, since s < 0, (56) follows from the definition of ֒→s combined with the fact
that

simplifying the argument in [10, 11, 2] (see also the proof of the parallel statement
on Mb in the proof of Lemma 4.2 above, in particular (48) and (49)).
Next, by definition of 6֒→s , there exists an integer N (F, F ) > 0 (depending on F
and the cones, but not Γ̃) such that if ℓs 6֒→s ns then
ℓs ≥ ns − N (F, F )
and

inf d(supp(ψns ), D(πF (Γ̃) ◦ F ◦ πΓ̃−1 )tr

.

The proof of (57) is then obtained by (r − 1) integration by parts, in the sense of

Lemma 4.2 above, this is a simplification of the argument in [10, 11, 2], so we do
not enter into details.
From now on, we fix Γ. To deduce (39) from (56–57), we shall need to couple
wave packets in the cotangent spaces of Rd and Γ̃ = Γ+ x for x ∈ Rd . (For this, it is
essential that we have (n, −) in the left-hand side of (39).) Recalling the functions
bm from (53), we claim that there exists a constant C0 > 1 depending only on CF
and C± so that, for any Γ ∈ F (C+ ) and all n, ns , the kernels Vnn,−

We finally conclude the proof of (39). Let n ≥ m0 and ϕ ∈ C ∞ . Recall (5). For
w ∈ Γ and x ∈ Rd , decomposing Mϕ = φMϕ via (55) for Γ̃ = Γ + x, we get
(F−1 ψΘ′ ,n,− )(−x) · (M(ϕ))(w + x) =
(F−1 ψΘ′ ,n,− )(−x) · (φMb,Γ+x (ϕ))(w + x)

(63)

+ (F−1 ψΘ′ ,n,− (−x)) · (φ − Rñs ,Γ+x )Mc,Γ+x (ϕ)(w + x) .

We average over x ∈ Rd . Then, recalling (38), the k · ksp,Γ -norm of the contribution
of (61) may be estimated by (56). Also, noting that if ñs is large enough (depending
on f , F , s, and F , but not on Γ), then
CF,f,δ 2−(r−1−δ−|s|)ñs ≤ C sup |f |

kF ks−
,
inf | det(DF |(C′+ )⊥ )|1/p

the k · ksp,Γ -norm of the contribution of the last term (63) may be controlled by (57).
It only remains to control the contribution of (62). Since we may combine (40)
with (56) to show that there exists a constant C̃1 depending only on f , F and F
(but not on Γ or x)
kMc,Γ+xϕksp,Γ+x = kMϕ − Mb,Γ+x ϕksp,Γ+x ≤ C̃1 kϕksp,F (Γ+x) ,
it suffices to establish, setting ϕ̃ = Mc,Γ+x (ϕ), that there exists a constant C1
depending only on F and F (but not on Γ) so that for any fixed ñs , if m0 is large
enough, then for any n ≥ m0

Remark 4.6 (Nuclear power decomposition). Using approximation numbers (47) as
in [11] and [2], Lemma 3.5 should imply, not only compactness of Mc , but also
that there exists an integer D ≥ 2 (depending only on r, s, t, and d) so that MD
c
is nuclear. (This is the desired “nuclear power decomposition.”) Also, we expect
that (adapting the arguments of [11, 2]) for any 0 < κ < 1 there exists Cκ > 1 so
that the flat trace [11] of the term Mb for the operator M associated to T −n and
g (−n) is smaller than Cκ κn .
Appendix A. Characteristic functions are not bounded multipliers
on the “microlocal” anisotropic spaces from §2.3
Θ,t,0
For simplicity, we only consider the scale W2,†
in dimension d = 2 for t > 0,
Θ,t,s
and ignore the charts completely, but the argument extends to all spaces Wp,†
,
to the other spaces in [10] and [11] (if s < 0 or t > 0), and to the spaces introduced
by Faure–Roy–Sjöstrand [19] and22 their variants. We shall outline the proof23 of
the following claim:

Proposition A.1 (Gouëzel [25]). Let 1E be the caracteristic function of a halfplane E in R2 . Let F be a linear transformation of R2 fixing two lines D+ and
e and Θ′ be two cone systems so that the corresponding cones C′ , C̃− ,
D− . Let Θ
−
and C̃+ , C′+ in R2 are centered on D− and D+ , respectively. Then for any t > 0,
′

e

Θ,2t,0
Θ ,2t,0
the operator E(ϕ) = 1E · (ϕ ◦ F ) does not map W2,†
into W2,†
.

The basic idea is that, in Fourier transform, multiplication by a Heaviside function becomes (essentially) a convolution with (iξ)−1 , and such a convolution may
transform a function with square integrable Fourier transform supported in C̃− ,
into a function with Fourier transform decaying slower than any ξ −t in C′+ . (The
main issue is that the support of the Fourier transform “leaks” from C̃− into C′+ ,
due to convolution with (iξ)−1 . This creates similar problems for the spaces introduced by Faure–Roy–Sjöstrand [19].)
Sketch of the proof of Proposition A.1. We claim that it is enough to show that the
Θ,2t,0
Θ′ ,2t,0
operator of multiplication by 1E does not map W2,†
into W2,†
for any quadruple of cones in R2 , centered on D− and D+ . Indeed, denote by MF the operator
mapping ϕ to ϕ ◦ F . If F maps C̃− and C̃+ into cones respectively included in C−
e
Θ,2t,0
Θ,2t,0
and containing C+ , then MF maps W2,†
continuously into W2,†
. Assume
e

′

Θ,2t,0
Θ ,2t,0
by contradiction that E maps W2,†
into W2,†
. Then, precomposing with
′

Θ,2t,0
Θ ,2t,0
MF −1 we would get that ϕ 7→ 1E · ϕ maps W2,†
into W2,†
, contradicting our
assumption and proving the claim.

From now on, we focus on the operator of multiplication by 1E . In order to
compute the Fourier transform F(1E ϕ), we compute the Fourier transform of 1E .
As a starting point, let χ̃ = 1[0,∞) in dimension 1. Then χ̃′ = δ0 the Dirac mass
22As we were finishing this paper, F. Faure and M. Tsujii [21] announced a new version of
microlocal anisotropic spaces for which the wave front set is more narrowly constrained. The
counter-example in this appendix may fail for these new spaces.
23We take F linear and a domain given by a half-plane for simplicity, the general case is similar.

at 0. Thus, since the Fourier transform of the Dirac mass is the constant function
equal to 1, we have, formally
(65)

F(χ̃)(ξ) =

F(χ̃′ )(ξ) = F(δ0 ) =

iξ

(In fact, F(χ̃) is the distribution obtained by summing a Dirac mass at 0 and the
“principal value of 1/ξ,”, but it will be sufficient to work with the approximation
above.)
Let now 1E be the characteristic function of a half-plane E bounded by a line
through the origin (we can reduce to this case by translation) directed by a unit
vector v. The function 1E restricted to any line orthogonal to v is just the characteristic function of a half-line. Since F(1E ϕ) = F(1E ) ∗ F(ϕ), we have for any
ξ ∈ R2 ,
Z
(Fϕ)(ξ + ωw)
dω + (Fϕ)(ξ) ,
(66)
F(1E ϕ)(ξ) ∼
ω
ω∈R
where w is the unit vector orthogonal to v pointing towards the interior of the
half-plane. (The symbol ∼ above means that we neglect unimportant factors such
as i.)
There are three main cases to consider, depending on the position of the boundary of the half-plane with respect to the cones: In the interior of C+ , in the interior
of C− , or in the complement of their union. (The remaining case when the boundary of the half-plane lies on the boundary of a cone is similar.) We discuss each
case by considering concrete examples of lines D+ and D− . The general situation
may be handled by analogous arguments.
For the first case, we take C− around the vertical axis, C+ around the horizontal
axis, and a left half-plane with vertical boundary through the origin, w = (−1, 0).
(The boundary of the half-plane thus lies inside C− .) Let ϕ ∈ L2 be so that
ϕ̂ := F(ϕ) ∈ L2 is supported in C− . In view of (66), the Fourier transform of
ψ = 1E ϕ is given by the following convolution (modulo trivial correcting factors
and terms)

ψ̂(ξ1 , ξ2 ) =

If t > 0, it is easy to find φ so that (68) holds but the integral above is infinite.
(This cannot be achieved when t = 0, reflecting the fact that multiplication by 1E
leaves L2 invariant.)
For the second case, we keep the same cones, but now take the upper half-plane
bounded by the horizontal axis through zero (i.e., w = (0, 1), and the boundary of
the half-plane lies inside C+ ). Then, taking the same ϕ, we have for (ξ1 , ξ2 ) ∈ C′+ ,

The above integral is infinite for t > 0, as claimed. (Like in the first example, the
integral converges for t = 0.)
Finally, for the third case, we consider C− = {−ξ2 ≤ ξ1 ≤ −ξ2 /2} and C′+ =
{ξ2 /2 ≤ ξ1 ≤ ξ2 }, taking the left half-plane with vertical boundary through the
origin (w = (−1, 0), like in the first case, but the boundary now lies in the complement of the union of the two cones). We take ϕ̂ as above. Then ϕ̂ ∈ L2 if and only

Appendix B. Heuristic comparison of U1t,s and the Gouëzel–Liverani
spaces
In this appendix, we discuss informally the relation between Upt,s when p = 1 and
the geometric spaces of Gouëzel–Liverani [26]. (We do not claim that the norms
are equivalent.)
s
For s ∈ R and 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞, let Bp,q
(Rds ) be the classical Besov space [42] on
t,s
ds
:
R . We introduce the local version of a new space Uep,q
C ,t,s
Definition B.1 (The local space Uep,q± (K)). Let K ⊂ Rd be a non-empty compact set. For a cone pair C± = (C+ , C− ), so that Rds × {0} is included in C− ,
real numbers 1 ≤ p < ∞, 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞, s ≤ 0, and integer t ≥ 1, we set

The space Uep,q
(T ) is then defined using admissible charts (like in Definition 3.6).

t,s
We claim that if s < −t, the spaces Ue1,1
are heuristically similar both to the
spaces B t,|s+t| of Gouëzel–Liverani [26, 27] and to our spaces U1t,s . Indeed, as
|s+t|
noticed above, the dual of the little Besov space bp/(p−1),q/(q−1) (Rds ) is the Besov

Taking p = 1 and q = 1 we find the dual of the little Besov space b∞,∞ (Rds ),
t,s
which is similar to the strong stable norm of Gouëzel and Liverani. So Ue1,1
is
t,|s+t|
related to the space B
of Gouëzel–Liverani. (We abusively disregard here the
fact that Gouëzel–Liverani take the sum over all |~t| ≤ t while we use the Lipschitz
quotient for the last derivative, recalling that we are taking the closure of C ∞ (K),
as well as Footnote 24.) Since t ≥ 1 is an integer, in view of the Paley–Littlewood

for p < ∞ and t > 0, the spaces U1 ±
and Ue1,1±
are similar.
(We explained in Remark 3.7 why we took q = ∞ instead of q = 1 and why we
expect our spaces would have the same qualitiative and quantitative features for
q = 1.)
Remark B.2 (The Demers–Liverani–Zhang spaces). It is more difficult to compare
our spaces Upt,s to the spaces of Demers–Liverani [16] (even heuristically) for p > 1
and −1 + 1/p < s < −t < 0 < t < 1/p. The main problem is that their stable norm
roughly involves the dual of the little Besov space bv1/α,∞ (abusively considering

|Γ|α kϕkbv∞,∞ ≃ kϕkbv1/α,∞ ) while the unstable norm involves25 the dual of b1∞,∞ . It
follows that, although one should set t = β, one cannot assign a value to s and
p depending on their parameters α, β, q. (Note however that setting p = 1/α we
recover the condition β ≤ α from [16] while their condition α ≤ 1 − q is reminiscent
of s > −1 + 1/p if in addition s = −q.) This also explains why one cannot
immediately compare our Lasota–Yorke estimates (30) with [16, Prop. 2.7].
Appendix C. Integration by parts and proof of Lemma 3.4
For the convenience of the reader, we recall what is meant by integration by
parts in the present context (see e.g. [4]).
Integration by parts. Let Φ : Rd → R be C 2 and let f : Rd → R be C 1 and
Pd

Regularised integration by parts. If Φ is C r for some r > 1, we can only
integrate by parts [r] − 1 times in the above sense, even if f is C r and compactly
supported. If r is not an integer, then to integrate by parts r − 1 times, we proceed
as follows: If Φ : Rd → R is C 1+δ and f : Rd → R is compactly supported and C δ ,
P
for δ ∈ (0, 1), and dj=1 (∂j Φ)2 6= 0 on supp(f ), we set, for k = 1, . . . , d

and satisfies υ(x)dx = 1. There is C, independent of Φ and f , so that for each

Proof of Lemma 3.4. We may assume for both claims that u > t is not an integer.
Then (see e.g. [50, §1.3.4, Rk. 3, and §2.3.2]) the C u norm is equivalent to the
norm kϕkC∗u := supn≥0 2un kψnOp ϕkL∞ .
Let K̃ be a compact neighbourhood of K. For the first claim, recalling (20),
since
k1K̃ ϕ̃ksp,q,Γ ≤ Ck1K̃ ϕ̃kLp (Γ) ≤ CK̃ kϕ̃kL∞ ,
and u > t, we find, using Young’s inequality in Lp that
(76)

2tn k1K̃ ψnOp ϕksp,q,Γ ≤ C(u, K̃) · kϕkC∗u

for any n and Γ .

Corrections and complements to:
The quest for the ultimate anisotropic Banach space
VIVIANE BALADI

We provide corrections and complements to [1, §4]: Formulas (29) (and (42))
and, especially, (31) must be amended, as explained below. None of the main
statements are changed, except that the condition −(r − 1) < s < −t < 0 must be
replaced by t − (r − 1) < s < −t < 0 in Lemma 4.2 and Theorem 4.1.

2. Proof of Theorem 4.1

To replace kf ◦ F kC r−1 (F (Γ)) by C sup |f | in (42), one uses that the bound

(43) also holds for fm (x) = m−1

acteristic function of a d-dimensional ball of fixed radius ǫ. (The partitions of unity
Q

adapted to T m are of the form m−1
.)
j=0 χj,ǫ ◦ T
The last sentence in the proof of Theorem 4.1 on p. 543 must be shortened
to: “We just mention here that, in the present case, the “fragmentation lemma”
(used to expand along a partition of unity) is just the triangle inequality, while the
“reconstitution lemma”

P (used to P
the trivial inequality
|ak ek | ≤ ( |ak |) sup |ek |.” Footnote 18. on the same page
must be suppressed.

where kvkW k′ = 0≤|α|≤k kDα vkLp′ and Z(w, x, y) = w(x + y) + w(x − y) − 2w(x).

Thus, since inf |DFΓ | ≥ kF k− ≥ 1, and using the“Zygmund derivation” in2 [3, §2]
Z(f h, x, y) = f (x)Z(h, x, y) + h(x)Z(f, x, y)
+ ·∆+ (f, x, y)∆+ (h, x, y) + ·∆− (f, x, y)∆− (h, x, y) ,

where ∆+ (υ, x, y) = (υ(x + y) − υ(x)) and ∆− (υ, x, y) = (υ(x) − υ(x − y)), and
recalling that for any noninteger σ > 0 [5, Prop 2.1.2, Prop 2.2.1]
kvkWpσ′ ,p′ ≤ C(p′ , σ)kvkBpσ′ ,p′ ≤ C 2 (p′ , |s|)kvkBpσ′ ,1 ,
(with Wpσ′ ,p′ the Slobodeckij norm), we find for any ǫ > 0 constants C(F , ) and
C(F , ǫ) so that

Finally, using inf | det(DF |(C+′ )⊥ )| ≥ C| det(D(F |Γ )|, we get (40), up to slightly
amending (29) as follows (ds and p are fixed):
(29*) C(F, Γ, s) = C ′ (F )|s|kD(F |Γ )−1 kC r−1 k| det(DFΓ−1 )|kC r−1 .
Similarly, in (42) one should replace supΓ kf ◦ F −1 kC r−1 (F (Γ)) by
sup kf ◦ F −1 kC r−1 (F (Γ)) k| det(D(F(C+′ )⊥ )−1 )|kC r−1 (F (Γ)) .

Therefore, one must replace −(r − 1) < s < −t < 0 by t − (r − 1) < s < −t < 0 in
Lemma 4.2, and thus in4 Theorem 4.1.
5. Fixing the end of the proof of Sublemma 4.4
The formulas for some kernels in the proof of Sublemma 4.4 (p. 548) are garbled.
The corrections are detailed below. The statement of the sublemma is unchanged.
Lines 9–14 and the footnote of p. 548 must be replaced by “Recalling the functions bm from (53), we claim that there exists a constant C0 > 1 depending only

where Π+ : Rds +du → Rdu is defined by Π+ (x− , x+ ) = x+ . Next just like in
[10, 11] (see also [Lemma 2.34, 2]), using that πΓ+x (w + x) = πΓ (w) + x− if x =
(x− , x+ ) ∈ Rds × Rdu and that Γ ∈ F , first integrate by parts (see Appendix 3)

There is a minor typo in the left-hand side of (64) on p. 549, which should read:
Z

Finally, (64) follows from (60) and the leafwise Young inequality (38).



6. Typos
On p. 537, the condition Rds × {0} ⊂ C− must be replaced by “Rds × {0} is
included in (Rd \ C+ ) ∪ {0}” (thrice, including Defs 3.2–3.3). Also, the assumptions
ensure that ΠΓ is surjective. Same page, 6 lines after (17), the norms are equivalent
uniformly in Γ, not equal, due to the Jacobian. In Lemma 4.2, one must assume
that F can be extended by a bilipschitz regular cone hyperbolic diffeomorphism F̃
of Rd , with kF̃ k+ , 1/kF̃ k− , 1/kF̃ k−− and 1/| det(DF̃ |(C′+ )⊥ )| controlled by twice
the corresponding constants for F . In lines 2–3 of p. 555, the sum is over all ℓ ≥ 0,
and in line 2, one of the (1 + kx− k)Q1 must be replaced by (1 + kx+ k)Q2 , while
ψℓOp υ(x) should be replaced by kψℓOp υkL∞ .
