Abstract. We consider graded artinian complete intersection algebras A =
C[x0 , . . . , xm ]/I with I generated by homogeneous forms of degree d ≥ 2. We
show that the general multiplication by a linear form µL : Ad−1 → Ad is
injective. We prove that the Weak Lefschetz Property for holds for any c.i.
algebra A as above with d = 2 and m ≤ 4.

1. Introduction
The Weak Lefschetz Property (in short WLP) of a graded algebra A, presented
as the quotient A = k[x0 , . . . , xmP
]/I, with I an homogeneous ideal, asserts that
for any general linear form L =
ai xi and any k ≥ 0, the multiplication map
µL : Ak → Ak+1 has maximal rank. It has been conjectured that if char(k) = 0 then
any complete intersection k-algebra, i.e. an algebra as above with I generated by a
regular sequence, has the WLP. It is also conjectured that such an algebra should
have the Strong Lefschetz Property, i.e. the analogous maximal rank property with
L replaced by Ld , for any d. The most significant case of these conjectures is the
case when A is artinian. These are considered to be very challenging problems,
despite affirmative answers for m ≤ 2, see [3], and in the monomial case, see [6]
and [7].
In this article we examine the case of a c.i. artinian algebra A with I generated in
degree d ≥ 2. The first main result of the present article is an easy and geometrical
proof of a generalization of the so called Injectivity Lemma of Proposition 4.3 of
[5]. More precisely we show the injectivity of the general multiplication map µL :
Ad−1 → Ad . This result is stated in Corollary 4. That result is also used in
Remark 3 to obtain a new and simple proof of the WLP for d = 2 and m = 3,
already covered in [5].
Then we examine the case d = 2 and m = 4, in which case we prove the WLP
by introducing some geometrical methods that seem to be new in the existing
literature. This is the content of the other main result of this paper, Theorem 1 of
Section 6.
Despite we are proposing only limited progress toward the WLP conjecture, we
hope that the methods of the present article can shed some light on the geometrical
aspects of the general problem and inspire further investigations.
The plan of the article is the following. In Section 2 we state the general results on
artinian Gorenstein and c.i. algebras that are common knowledge for commutative
algebraists and algebraic geometers. Then, in Section 3 we study some interesting
stratifications of the projective space P(Id ), associated to generating piece of the
ideal I. These results are immediately used to give a prof of the Injectivity Lemma

mentioned above. In Section 4 we introduce our general geometrical method for
approaching the WLP conjecture, that is we study the projectivization of variety
of pairs (z, Q) ∈ A1 × As such zQ = 0. We introduce some differential methods
to this purpose. In the final sections 5 and 6 we consider the case d = 2 of the
WLP conjecture for complete intersections in equal degrees, and give its solution
for m = 4, as already mentioned above.
2. General setup
Notations. Let f0 , . . . , fm be homogeneous polynomials in C[x0 , . . . , xm ] with no
common zeros and of equal degree d > 1, i.e. a regular sequence. We set I =
(f0 , . . . , fm ) ⊂ C[x0 , . . . , xm ] and we denote A = C[x0 , . . . , xm ]/I the artinian
L∞ quotient ring. We set U ∗ = hx0 , . . . , xm i, so that C[x0 , . . . , xm ] = S • U ∗ = i=0 S i U ∗ .
Observe that U ∗ ∼
= A1 , since we have d > 1.
Given a C-vector space V , we will denote P(V ) the projective space of the 1dimensional vector subspaces of V . It v ∈ V is a non-zero element, we will denote
[v] ∈ P(V ) its associated point.
Definition 1. A is said to have the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP), if for any k ∈
N and for any fixed general linear form L ∈ U ∗ the multiplication map µL : Ak −→
Ak+1 has maximal rank.
Note that the property holds trivially if k ≤ d − 2, since in these cases either
Ik = Ik+1 = 0 and hence Ak = S k U ∗ and Ak+1 = S k+1 U ∗ , or if k ≫ 0, since then
one has Ak+1 = 0 .
Definition 2. We say that A fails the WLP because of surjectivity in degree
k > 0 if one has dim Ak ≥ dim Ak+1 but the multiplication µL : Ak → Ak+1 is not
surjective for any linear form L. In analogous way one defines the failure of WLP
because of injectivity. In general we say that A has the WLP in degree k > 0 if for
a general linear form L the multiplication map µL : Ak → Ak+1 has maximal rank.
We collect a few well known facts in the following proposition.
Proposition 1. The following facts hold.
(1) If µL : Ak → Ak+1 is injective, then µL : Aj → Aj+1 is injective for any
j ≤ k.
(2) A is self-dual as it is Gorenstein. As a consequence it is enough to check
the WLP in the case of injectivity (resp. in the case of surjectivity).
(3) If A is a c.i. algebra of type (d, . . . , d) then socle(A) = A(m+1)(d−1) ∼
=C
and WLP holds for A if for a general linear form L the multiplication map
µL : As → As+1 is injective, with s = ⌈(m + 1)(d − 1)/2⌉ − 1.
2.1. The Macaulay inverse system I −1 . It is appropriate also to mention at
this point that the dual A∗ = ⊕A∗i is a sub S • U ∗ module of S • U , with respect
the derivation action of S • U ∗ on S • U . Indeed the action of a linear form L ∈ U ∗
defined as the traspose of the multiplication map turns out to be a derivation, and
indeed the Macaulay-Matlis duality more generally identifies S k U ∗ with the space
of homogeneous linear differential operators of degree k, with constant coefficients,
acting on S • U . Then it is also clear that A∗ = Ann(I) and it is usually indicated
with I −1 , which is known as the Macaulay inverse system associated to I. The
inverse system of any Gorenstein algebra A is generated by a single element g ∈
S M U as a S • U ∗ -module, with M equal to the socle degree of A. This means that
I −1 is linearly generated by derivatives of g of any order. In coordinates, setting
U = hu0 , . . . , um i, with (ui ) the dual basis of (xi ), then for any k ≥ 0 one has
(I −1 )M−k = h∂ui00 · · · ∂uimm (g) | i0 + · · · + im = ki.

COMPLETE INTERSECTIONS OF QUADRICS AND THE WEAK LEFSCHETZ PROPERTY 3

In our case we have M = (m + 1)(d − 1). A basic, and possibly known, result for
I −1 that will be useful for us is the following.
Proposition 2. The ideal I = (f0 , . . . , fm ) ⊂ C[x0 , . . . , xm ], with fi linearly independent and of degree d, is a c.i. ideal if and only if Id−1 does not contain any
non-zero power of a linear form pd ∈ S d U , and in this case Id−1 has dimension

m+d
− m − 1.
d

Proof. I is c.i. if and only if V (f0 , . . . , fm ) = ∅, if and only if there is no [p] ∈ P(U )
such that f0 (p) = · · · = fm (p) = 0. But it is well known that d!fi (p) = hfi , pd i,
with h , i : S d U ∗ ⊗ S d U → C the duality pairing. This shows that I is c.i. if and
only if there is no [pd ] ∈ P(Id−1 ). Moreover Id−1 = Ann(Id ) with respect to the
duality pairing, and this fact explains the dimension formula.


Remark 1. Observe that the non-zero homogeneous polynomials q ∈ S • U define
hypersurfaces V (q) ⊂ P(U ∗ ). To any L ∈ U ∗ we associate a derivative ∂L (q) = L(q),
defined by the action of S • U ∗ on S • U , and therefore L(q) = 0 means that the
hypersurface V (q) is a cone with a vertex point in [L] ∈ P(U ∗ ).
Remark 2. The inverse system I −1 in association to the study of the WLP of the
algebra A = S • U ∗ /I has been already considered in the literature, for example it
is a main theme of the article [4].
3. Stratifications of Id .
In this section we collect some easy results on the homogeneous part of the ideal
I in degree d. We will denote
νd (P(U ∗ )) = {[z d ] ∈ S d U ∗ | [z] ∈ P(U ∗ )}
.
S = {[Q] ∈ P(S d U ∗ ) | ∃z ∈ U ∗ , ∃P ∈ S d−1 U ∗ : Q = zP }
More generally, for any r ≥ 1, we denote
Secr−1 (S) = {[z1 P1 + · · · + zr Pr ] | zi ∈ U ∗ , Pi ∈ S d−1 U ∗ }.
Proposition 3. If I = (q0 , . . . , qm ) is a a c.i. ideal generated by forms of degree
d ≥ 2, then P(Id ) ∩ νd (P(U ∗ )) is a finite set and dim P(Id ) ∩ S ≤ 1. More generally
one has dim P(Id ) ∩ Secr−1 (S) ≤ min(2r − 1, m).
Proof. Assume dim P(I2 )∩ν2 (P(U ∗ )) ≥ 1. Consider a irreducible curve C contained
in that set, and consider a local analytic parametrization of this curve at a general
point of the form zλd = (z0 + λz1 + O(λ2 ))d = z0d + dλz0d−1 z1 + O(λ2 ). Then
z0d , z0d−1 z1 ∈ Id , impossible because otherwise they could be completed to a basis
of Id , so they should be a c.i., but they vanish on V (x0 ), a contradiction.
Similarly assume that dim P(Id ) ∩ S ≥ 2. Then there exists a local analytic
parametrization of a surface in P(Id ) of the form
zλ,µ Pλ,µ = (z0 + λz1 + µz2 )(P0 + λP1 + µP2 ) + o(λ, µ),
which would give
z0 P0 , z0 P1 + z1 P0 , z0 P2 + z2 P0 ∈ Id .
This produces a contradiction by similar reasons as above, since the three elements
above are not a c.i., as they vanish on V (z0 , P0 ). In the general case, let us assume m ≥ dim P(Id ) ∩ Secr−1 (S) ≥ 2r and let us write a bijective local analytic
parametrization of such a family at a general point

with λ = (λ1 , . . . , λ2r ). Then one may expand
P
zi (λ) = zi + j λj zij + o(λ)
P
Pi (λ) = Pi + j λj Pij + o(λ)
and find the relations
P
Pi zi Pi ∈ Id
i (zi Pij + zij Pi ) ∈ Id ,

∀ j = 1, . . . , 2r.

Now observe that the 2r + 1 forms above are independent by construction and
they all vanish on V (z1 , . . . , zr , P1 , . . . , Pr ), which has codimension ≤ 2r in Pm , a
contradiction, since they should be a complete intersection.

An immediate consequence of the proposition above significantly extends the
Injectivity Lemma of Proposition 4.3 of [5], proved in that paper in the case d = 2.
Corollary 4 (Injectivity Lemma). Let A = C[x0 , . . . , xm ]/I an artinian algebra,
with I generated by a regular sequence of forms of degree d. Then for general z ∈ A1
the multiplication map µz : Ad−1 −→ Ad is injective.
Proof. Otherwise for any general [z] ∈ P(U ∗ ) there exists some P ∈ S d−1 U ∗ such
that zP ∈ Id , (note that such factorization is unique) hence dim(P(Id ) ∩ S) ≥ m =
dim P(U ∗ ), but this contradicts the second dimension statement of Proposition
3.


Remark 3. In [5] it was observed that, as a consequence of the result above in the
case d = 2, the WLP holds for d = 2 and 2 ≤ m ≤ 3. Indeed in those cases one has
s = ⌈(m + 1)(d − 1)⌉ − 1 = 1.
Remark 4. Proposition 3 actually gives more precise information than Corollary
4 on the dimension so-called non Lefschetz locus, that is the locus of [z] ∈ P(A1 )
such that the moltiplication map µz : Ad−1 → Ad is not injective, by showing that
this locus has dimension at most 1. We refer the reader to the recent article [1] for
many other deep results in this context.
In the case of d = 2, since quadrics are classified by their rank up to projective
transformations, we can give a more precise and alternative form of Proposition 3,
which will be useful later to cover the case d = 2 and m = 4.
Proposition 5. Set Rr = {[Q] ∈ P(S 2 U ∗ ) | rk(Q) ≤ r} for any 1 ≤ r ≤ m,
that is, Rr is the projectivized set of quadrics of rank at most r. Let I a c.i. ideal
generated by m + 1 quadrics. Then dim P(I2 ) ∩ Rr ≤ r − 1.
Proof. We can use induction on r. The case r = 1 is covered already in Proposition
3. Assume that dim P(I2 ) ∩ Rr ≥ r > 1 and let Q be a general point in a r dimensional irreducible subvariety of that closed set. Hence, by the inductive hypothesis,
it must be rk(Q) = r and therefore we can write Q = L21 + · · · + L2r . Since the set
of quadratic forms of rank r is a single orbit under the action of GL(m + 1), we
can find a local analytical parametrization of the given r-dimensional component
of dim P(I2 ) ∩ Rr with parameters ǫ = (ǫ1 , . . . , ǫr ) such that
Qǫ =

(Li + ǫ1 Li1 + · · · + ǫr Lir )2 ∈ P(I2 ) ∩ Rr .

Moreover, by construction, we can assume that Q, F1 = ∂ǫ1 Qǫ |ǫ=0 , . . . , Fr =
∂ǫr Qǫ |ǫ=0 are independent. Then, computing the derivatives above, we find that

are r + 1 independent elements in P(I2 ) that vanish on V (L1 , . . . , Lr ) 6= ∅. Since
r ≤ m and any base of I2 must be a c.i., we obtain a contradiction.

Remark 5. The results of this section, although very simple, strongly depend on
the complete intersection hypothesis. They cannot in general be extended to the
case of Gorenstein algebras A, even when these algebras are presented by quadrics.
Indeed infinite series of counterexamples to the result in Corollary 4 in the Gorenstein case have been provided in [2], see for example their Corollary 3.8.
4. Differential lemmas
Set s = ⌈(m + 1)(d − 1)/2⌉ − 1 as above. We introduce the variety
Γ = {([z], [Q]) ∈ P(A1 ) × P(As ) | zQ = 0},
which inherits from P(A1 ) × P(As ) the projections π1 and π2 to P(A1 ) and P(As ),
respectively. Assuming that WLP does not hold for the algebra A, that is the
general multiplication map µz : As → As+1 is not injective, there exists a subvariety
W ⊂ Γ,
defined as the unique component of Γ with π1 (W) = P(A1 ). The uniqueness of W
comes from the fact that the fibers of the projections of the variety Γ are linear
spaces.
For general [z] ∈ P(A1 ) and [Q] ∈ π2 (W), we define the vector spaces
Q(z) = {Q ∈ As | zQ = 0}
.
Z(Q) = {z ∈ A1 | zQ = 0},
This means that π1−1 ([z]) = PQ(z) and π2−1 ([Q]) = PZ(Q). We set the following
notations, for general [z] ∈ P(A1 ) and general [Q] ∈ P(A1 ) such that zQ = 0.
δ = dim π2−1 ([Q]) = dim Z(Q) − 1,
ε = dim π1−1 ([z]) = dim Q(z) − 1.

(1)
We also set
(2)

N = dim W = m + ε = dim π2 (W) + δ.

Now consider a general point ([z̄], [Q̄]) ∈ W and a system of parameters λ =
(λ1 , . . . , λN ) for W centered at ([z̄], [Q̄]). We denote ([z], [Q]) a point in a neighborhood of ([z̄], [Q̄]), with the understanding that z = z(λ1 , . . . , λN ) and Q =
Q(λ1 , . . . , λN ) are analytic functions defined at λ = 0. Finally, we denote
zi = ∂λi z,

Qi = ∂λi Q,

i = 1, . . . , N.

Lemma 6. Under the notations above, one has dimhz1 , . . . , zN i = N − ε = m and
dimhQ1 , . . . , QN i = N − δ. In particular one has hz, z1 , . . . , zN i = U ∗ . Moreover,
the following relations hold, for any i, j = 0, . . . , N .

Proof. The first assertions of the Lemma are clear by the fact that π1 (W) = P(U ∗ ),

The following technical lemma will be useful later.

Lemma 7. Let A be a c.i. artinian algebra as above, with m ≥ 4. Then the
following properties hold.
(1) For any two distinct points [z], [w] ∈ P(U ) one has dimhz, wiA1 ≥ 2m − 1.
(2) Denoting Υ the subvariety of Gr(m − 2, P(U )) whose points are the (m − 2)planes Π = V (z, w) ∈ Gr(m − 2, P(U )) such that dimhz, wiA1 = 2m − 1,
then dim Υ ≤ 3.

COMPLETE INTERSECTIONS OF QUADRICS AND THE WEAK LEFSCHETZ PROPERTY 7

∼ hz, wiU ∗ /(hz, wiU ∗ ∩I2 ). Note
Proof. (1). One has hz, wiA1 = (hz, wiU ∗ +I2 )/I2 =
∗
that dimhz, wiU = 2(m + 1) − 1 = 2m + 1, as it is the degree 2 piece of the ideal
generated by z, w. Therefore, the general bound dimhz, wiA1 ≥ 2m−1 is equivalent
to dim(hz, wiU ∗ ∩I2 ) ≤ 2. But this latter fact is clearly true, because I2 is generated
by a complete intersection and therefore at most 2 independent element of I2 can
define hypersurfaces that contain the 2-codimensional linear space Π = V (z, w).
(2). By the calculations in the proof of statement (1), the only possibility for obtaining dimhz, wiA1 = 2m − 1 is
dim P(hz, wiU ∗ ∩ I2 ) = 1.
Let us introduce the incidence variety
Y = {(Π, [F ]) | Π ∈ Gr(m − 2, P(U )), [F ] ∈ P(I2 ), Π ⊂ V (F )},
endowed with the two projections
π1 (Π, [F ]) = Π,

π2 (Π, [F ]) = [F ]

to Gr(m − 2, P(U )) and P(I2 ), respectively. Let also introduce the subvariety
Υ = {(Π, [F ]) ∈ Y | dim π1−1 (Π) = 1}.
Then the variety in the statement is
Υ = π1 (Υ ).
Note that, setting Π = V (z, w), then P(hz, wiU ∗ ∩ I2 ) = π2 π1−1 (Π). As we have
shown above, these spaces are all lines for any Π ∈ Υ and hence the irreducible
components of Υ are the inverse images of the irreducible components of Υ = π1 (Υ ).
We denote
Υ = Υ 1 ∪ · · · ∪ Υ r,

Υ = Υ1 ∪ · · · ∪ Υr ,

Υi = π1−1 (Υ i )

the corresponding decomposition into irreducible components. Observe that dim Υi =
dim Υi + 1.
Note also that (Π, [F ]) ∈ Υ implies F = zL + wM , with Π = V (z, w), which
implies that [F ] ∈ R4 , and of course Π is one of the (m − 2)-planes contained in
V (F ). Hence π2 (Υ ) ⊆ P(I2 ) ∩ R4 and for any [F ] ∈ π2 (Υ ) one has
π1 (π2 |Υ )−1 ([F ]) ⊆ {Π | Π ⊂ V (F )}.
If for some Π ∈ Υ it were π2 π1−1 (Π) ⊆ R2 , then dim P(hz, wiU ∗ ∩ I2 ) =
dim π2 π1−1 (Π) = 1 means that Π = V (z, w) is contained in a pencil of rank 2 (and
hence reducible) quadrics Fλ,µ ∈ I2 . Such a pencil has the form either (λz + µw)L
or (αz + βw)Mλ,µ . In any case the given pencil has a fixed hyperplane component,
and therefore it cannot be contained in I2 , since this latter is generated by a complete intersection. So π2 π1−1 (Π) ⊆ R2 is impossible. Then we have that for any
component Υi of Υ a general point (Π, [F ]) ∈ Υi is such that rk(F ) ≥ 3.
It is well known that any quadric [F ] of rank 3 or 4 has the family of linear spaces
Π∼
= Pm−2 contained in V (F ) of dimension 1, hence for a general [F ] ∈ π2 (Υi ) one
has (dim π2 |Υ )−1 ([F ]) ≤ 1. Therefore we have shown that for any i = 1, . . . , r one
has
(4)

dim Υi = dim(Υ i ) + 1 ≤ dim π2 (Υi ) + 1.

By Proposition 5 we know that dim P(I2 ) ∩ R4 ≤ 3 and, since π2 (Υi ) ⊆ P(I2 ) ∩ R4 ,
we have dim π2 (Υi ) ≤ 3 and therefore dim Υi ≤ 4 and dim Υ i ≤ 3.

6. Application: the case d = 2 and m = 4
In this last section we apply the results obtained so far to prove that the WLP
holds for c.i. algebras presented by quadrics in P4 , that is we assume d = 2 and
m = 4. Even this simple case appears not to be covered in the existing literature.
For d = 2 and m = 4 the dimensions of Ai for i = 0, . . . , 5 are
1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1
By the results stated in Proposition 1, we only need to examine the general multiplication map
µz : A2 → A3 ,
as in the present case one has s = ⌈(m + 1)(d − 1)/2⌉ − 1 = 2.
Note that by letting [z] vary in P(A1 ), we can define a sheaf morphism
Φ

A2 ⊗ OP(A1 ) −→ A3 ⊗ OP(A1 ) (1),

(5)

with Φ defined fiberwise by Φ([z]) = µz . Note that Φ symmetric, that is, identifying
A3 ∼
= C, then one can
= A∗2 by means of the multiplication pairing A3 ⊗ A2 → A5 ∼
write Φ as a sheaf map Φ : A2 ⊗ OP1 → A∗2 ⊗ OP1 (1), and then Φ = Φ∗ (1) . In
particular Φ can be described a symmetric matrix of linear forms, with respect to
a choice of a basis for A2 and its dual basis for A3 ∼
= A∗2 .
Assuming that the WLP does not hold, let ([z], [Q]) ∈ W be a general element.
We consider the multiplication map
µQ : A2 −→ A4 ∼
= C5 .
Under the notations of Section 4, we have the following result.
Lemma 8. dim coker(µQ ) = dim Z(Q) = δ + 1.
Q

Q

Proof. The map A2 −→ A4 is dual to the map A1 −→ A3 by the perfect pairings
A4 ⊗A1 → A5 and A2 ⊗A3 → A5 defined by the multiplication. Hence coker(µQ ) ∼
=
Z(Q)∗ , which proves the statement.

We also have the following formula relating Z(Q) with the vector space spanned
by the derivatives of Q with respect to the parameters λ1 , . . . , λN , with N = dim W,
introduced in the previous section.
Lemma 9. For arbitrary m one has
dimhQ, Q1 , . . . , QN i = m + 1 + ε − δ.
In particular for m = 4 we have
dimhQ, Q1 , . . . , QN i = 5 + ε − δ.
Proof. The embedded tangent space to the image of the map π2 : W −→ P(A2 )
defined by ([z], [Q]) 7→ Q ∈ P(A2 ) is given by hQ, Q1 , . . . , QN i/hQi, hence it has
dimension equal to dimhQ, Q1 , . . . , QN i − 1. By Lemma 6 the same tangent space
has dimension N − δ = m + ε − δ, from which the statement follows.

We introduce one last preliminary result about the dimension of Z(Q). This
will be the only place in this paper where it turns out very useful to consider the
inverse system I −1 , mentioned in Section 2.
Lemma 10. If m = 4 one has δ ≤ 1, that is dim Z(Q) ≤ 2.
Proof. Assume that dim Z(Q) ≥ 3. Then consider g ∈ S 5 U such that I −1 is
generated by g as a S • U ∗ -module. Since zQ = 0 for any z ∈ Z(Q), then, by
Remark 1, the cubic Q(g) ∈ S 3 U is a cone with vertex space PZ(Q), and we are
assuming dim PZ(Q) ≥ 2. But then, in a suitable coordinate system, Q(g) is defined

by a degree three homogeneous polynomial in two variables, which therefore may
written in a suitable coordinate system as f (x, y) = x(α1 x + β1 y)(α2 x + β2 y). Then
one can easily see the vector space generated by fx and fy , contained in I2−1 by
the construction resumed in section 2.1, always contains the square of some linear
form, obtaining a contradiction by Proposition 2.

The spaces Z(Q) and hQ, Q1 , . . . , QN i are connected with µQ in the following
way.
Lemma 11. One has Z(Q)A1 + hQ, Q1 , . . . , QN i ⊆ ker µQ .
Proof. This is clear by definition of Z(Q) and by Lemma 6 (i) and (ii).

We can finally prove the following.
Theorem 1. The WLP holds for m = 4 and d = 2.
Proof. Assume that WLP does not hold. In view of Lemma 10, we have two cases.
Case 1: δ = 1. Then, by Lemma 8 we have
dim ker µQ = dim A2 − dim A4 + dim coker µQ = 5 + δ + 1 = 7.
Since Z(Q)A1 ⊆ ker µQ and dim Z(Q)A1 ≥ 7 by Lemma 7, we have
dim Z(Q)A1 = 7.
Then Lemma 7 applies to this case. The planes Π = V (z, w), with hz, wi =
P(Z(Q)) = π1−1 ([Q]), for Q varying in π2 (W), form a irreducible family of dimension equal to dim π2 (W) = 4 + ε − δ = 3 + ε, by formula (2) in Section 4. But
by (2) of Lemma 7, we know that such a family is actually 3-dimensional, hence
ε = 0. In this case we have dim π2 (W) = 3 and dim W = 4. A general fiber of
π1 : W → P(A1 ) = P4 is one point and for any [Q] ∈ π2 (W) one has π1 π2−1 ([Q]) a
line in P(A1 ). Moreover P(A1 ) is clearly covered with such lines.
Then we take [z] ∈ P(A1 ) general and consider the unique [Q] with ([z], [Q]) ∈ W.
Of course the line l = π1 π2−1 ([Q]) contains z.
Now let us consider the sheaf map Φ (5) described at the beginning of Section
6, and let us restrict it to l ∼
= P1 . We obtain an exact sequence of sheaves
Φ

l
0 → Kl → A2 ⊗ OP1 −→
A3 ⊗ OP1 (1) −→ Nl → 0,

with Kl and Nl defined as the sheaf kernel and cokernel of Φl , respectively.
Now, the fact that ε = 0 implies that Kl is a rank 1 torsion free sheaf on P1 ,
hence it is a line bundle Kl ∼
= OP1 (t) with t ≤ 0. A priori the sheaf inclusion
Kl ֒→ A2 ⊗ OP1 may not be a vector bundle embedding, i.e. the associated fiber
map Kl ([w]) → A2 may be 0 at some point [w] ∈ P1 . However, since the zero
constant Q ∈ A2 belongs to ker Φl ([w]) for any [w] ∈ l = π1 π2−1 ([Q]), we see that
Q

the vector bundle embedding OP1 −→ A2 ⊗ OP1 factors through Kl , which induces
an isomorphism OP1 ∼
= Kl . Then the exact sequence of sheaves above becomes a
vector bundle exact sequence
Φ

0 → OP1 → A2 ⊗ OP1 −→ A3 ⊗ OP1 (1) −→ Nl → 0.
The symmetry of Φ implies that Nl = Kl∗ (1) = OP1 (1) and this is impossible by
degree reasons, as dim A2 = dim A3 = 10.

Case 2: δ = 0. Then Z(Q) = hzi and, by Lemma 11, we have
zA1 + hQ, Q1 , . . . , QN i ⊆ ker µQ .
Since z is general and hence we can apply the result of Corollary 4, we have
dim zA1 = 5.
Moreover, by Lemma 8, we have
dim ker µQ = dim A2 − dim A4 + δ + 1 = 6
and finally, by Lemma 9, we have
dimhQ, Q1 , . . . , QN i = 5 + ε.
Then it is easy to conclude that
dim(zA1 ∩ hQ, Q1 , . . . , QN i) ≥ 4 + ε ≥ 4.
Now we consider a subspace V ⊆ µz−1 (zA1 ∩hQ, Q1 , . . . , QN i) ⊂ A1 with dim V = 4.
Claim. A2 = V A1 .
Proof of the Claim. Recalling that A1 = U ∗ /I1 = U ∗ , the claim is equivalent to
assert that V U ∗ +I2 = S 2 U ∗ . First of all, using the fact that V is the space of linear
forms vanishing on one point p ∈ Pm = P(U ), that is V = H 0 Ip (1), we see that
V U ∗ = H 0 Ip (2) and it has dimension dim S 2 U ∗ − 1 = 14. Then V U ∗ + I2 ( S 2 U ∗
if and only if
dim(V U ∗ ∩ I2 ) ≥ 1 + dim I2 + dim V U ∗ − dim S 2 U ∗ = 5.
But this means that in I2 ⊆ V U ∗ = H 0 Ip (2), which is impossible.



Then we have zA2 = zV A1 ⊂ hQ, Q1 , . . . , QN iA1 , which, by Lemma 6 (iv)
implies
z 3 A2 ⊂ z 2 hQ, Q1 , . . . , QN iA1 = {0},
hence, since the socle of A is generated in degree 5, one finds z 3 = 0. But this is
impossible for general z ∈ A1 , since the z 3 ’s with z general generate A3 .
