On the definition of spacetimes in
Noncommutative Geometry: Part I

March 14, 2017
Abstract
In this two-part paper we propose an extension of Connes’ notion of
even spectral triple to the Lorentzian setting. This extension, which we
call a spectral spacetime, is discussed in part II where several natural examples are given which are not covered by the previous approaches to the
problem. Part I only deals with the commutative and continuous case of
a manifold. It contains all the necessary material for the generalization to
come in part II, namely the characterization of the signature of the metric in terms of a time-orientation 1-form and a natural Krein product on
spinor fields. It turns out that all the data available in Noncommutative
Geometry (the algebra of functions, the Krein space of spinor fields, the
representation of the algebra on it, the Dirac operator, charge conjugation and chirality), but nothing more, play a role in this characterization.
Thus, only space and time oriented spin manifolds of even dimension are
considered for a noncommutative generalization in this approach. We observe that these are precisely the kind of manifolds on which the modern
theories of spacetime and matter are defined.

Introduction

Noncommutative geometry, as initiated by Alain Connes, is an operator algebraic framework which generalizes Riemannian manifolds in a way which harmoniously gathers continuous and discrete spaces, as well as truly noncommutative
examples. This generalization happens to be just enough to allow the recasting
of the Standard Model of particle physics as a noncommutative Kaluza-Klein
theory. This last application, thus far limited to the compact Riemannian case,
has been a strong motivation for the search of a semi-Riemannian extension of
Connes’ noncommutative geometry.
There have been several important attempts in that direction already, but
this endeavour is plagued with difficulties. Some are analytical: among them
we find the noncompactness issue and the definition of the spectral action. This
last problem is probably the most elusive for the time being. A different kind
of problem is the characterization of the physical Lorentzian signature among
the general semi-Riemannian ones. This has been investigated in particular in
[Bes 15a], [Fra 11]. The present paper exclusively deals with this last issue. We
will present a solution which, as we will see, is different from existing ones on
some essential points. However we will argue that this solution encompasses
both discrete and continuous spaces, as it should, whereas its predecessors did
not.
However, it should be stressed that the solution we will propose is incomplete. What we will do is discuss the commutative and continuous case, and
use it to motivate the general definition of a noncommutative structure which
should correspond to Lorentzian spacetimes in the same way spectral triples correspond to Riemannian manifolds. But in this definition we will totally ignore
the analytical aspects. Hence, in full rigor, it is only applicable to the finitedimensional (hence discrete) case. There are two reasons why we are being so
careless. The first and most important is to keep this work within reasonable

2

bounds. The second is that we think it is more urgent to present the reader
with a careful motivation of the general idea, followed by several examples, in
order to let him/her ponder the relevance of our approach, than elaborate the
subtler aspects of the question. These would only set us out of focus, as well
as, maybe, repell readers with a physicist background, who generally tend to
shun discussions which they think are too formal1 . That said, we believe that it
should be possible to use the work [D-P-R 13] by van den Dungen, Paschke and
Rennie to complete the work presented here. In fact our results are incomplete
in yet another way: we only deal here with the even (KO-)dimensional case.
Let us now be more specific about what we are going to do. We will argue
that in order to describe Lorentzian manifolds, we must replace a spectral triple
(A, H, D) with a structure (A, K, D) which we call a spectral spacetime. Though
we will not describe in this introduction the details of the definition, let us just
say first that the Hilbert space H appearing in the data of the spectral triple,
must be replaced with a Krein space K. There is no novelty here. We will point
out that this requires us to restrict to the class of space-oriented manifolds. Since
we are also given a total (space+time) orientation, the manifolds which can be
described in a spectral way are space and time oriented ones. More importantly,
we will propose a definition of time orientation in the noncommutative case: such
an orientation will be defined to be a noncommutative 1-form β which must be
real in some sense and turn the Krein product into a scalar product. Much more
importantly perhaps, we will argue that we must not ask A to be a C ∗ -algebra,
in fact not even a ∗-algebra, just an algebra of operators acting on K. This step is
not as radical as one might think: it is the natural consequence of the downplay
of the Hilbert structure in front of the Krein structure. However, without a
C ∗ -structure we take the risk of not being able to reconstruct a space out of the
algebra, and this is why we will propose a natural axiom of reconstructibility,
which is that the algebra is closed under the Hilbert adjunction defined by at
least one orientation form β. In such a case the algebra A may posses many
different, yet isomorphic, C ∗ -structures: one for each orientation form satisfying
the reconstructibility condition.
As we have alluded to above, the main arguments we will give in favour of our
notion of spectral spacetime are the continuous case on one hand, and discrete
examples on the other. These discrete examples are constructed over a finite
graph. The first, which we call the canonical antilorentzian spectral spacetime
over a positively weighted graph is just an appropriate Wick rotation of the usual
spectral triple one can build on such a graph to recover the geodesic distance
thanks to Connes’ distance formula. It is easily seen to be a spectral spacetime
but none of the structures proposed before by various authors. The second
example is an elaboration of the first, which we decorate with noncommutative
algebras on the vertices, and discrete parallel transport operators on the edges.
We call it the split Dirac structure over a graph. The Dirac operator in this
structure turns out to have an interesting relation with the discretization of the

questions will essentially go away.

Dirac operator proposed by Marcolli and van Suijlekom in [M-vS 14]: the latter
is obtained by acting with the former on special “graph states” and projecting
out the result on the space of these states. Moreover, we will see that for
the Dirac structure to be a spectral spacetime it is necessary that the discrete
parallel transport operators satisfy relations which are exactly2 those required
of a spin connection on a manifold. Finally, this example will also show us that
the reconstructibility condition, however natural it might be, is quite restrictive
in the noncommutative case since it is equivalent to the existence of a parallel
(i.e. covariantly constant) timelike vector field.
We have approached our subject in a very slow and (we hope) careful way
keeping these general principles in mind while writing the text: stack definitions,
lemmas and propositions until the time is ripe to state a theorem, stay as
geometric as possible, stay as general as possible unless it spoils clarity, always
be clear on what convention is used, be as self-contained as possible, display
(almost) every computation. The resulting pace is admittedly very slow, and
it would certainly have been possible to take some short cuts. This is why we
will give below a little guide for readers who wish to go directly to the main
points. We hope nonetheless that the material which may be skipped at first
could prove useful on a second read for those who wish to deepen some side
question.
The two parts of the paper can essentially be read independently. In the first
part, which is devoted to the classical (i.e. continuous and commutative) case,
we do not claim much originality. It can be seen mainly as a motivation for the
definition of spectral spacetimes coming in the second part. However, we have
tried to give a unified and, we think, new presentation of several subjects (real
structures on Clifford algebras, Wick rotations, canonical hermitian forms on
Clifford algebras and on spinors) which are otherwise treated in isolation from
one another in the literature. Moreover we have proven some results which are
probably known as “folk theorems” by some, but that we could not locate in
the literature. Finally the first part contains some technical lemmas used in the
second part. The second part provides the definition of spectral spacetimes as
well as the study of several examples, as explained above.
The first part of the paper is organized as follows: after this introduction,
we make a somewhat long excursion into Clifford algebras in section 2. The
goal there will be to give a characterization of the Lorentzian signature of the
metric with tools available in noncommutative geometry. To this end, we first
give a description of Wick rotations in terms of commuting real structures,
then we recall the existence of Krein structures on spinor modules which are
compatible with a given real structure, and use them to characterize the Wick
rotations to Euclidean signature (Robinson’s alternative, proposition 8). Finally
our goal is achieved in theorem 1, which characterizes the Lorentzian and antiLorentzian signatures by the possibility of using a single vector to turn the Krein
structure on a given spinor module into a Hilbert structure. This section also
2 There is actually a small difference, which does not show up in the most natural cases,
and is not worth explaining in this introduction.

makes the connection between the real structures on the Clifford algebra and
the charge conjugation operator which is used in noncommutative geometry,
and also contains some extra material on Clifford algebras, e.g. the σ-product,
which extends a given metric to the whole algebra.
In section 3 we globalize the notions introduced in section 2 to semi-riemannian manifolds: real structures on Clifford bundles, Krein structures on spinor
bundle. We point out that Krein structures compatible with a given real structure exist if and only if the manifold is space or time orientable, according to
the signature (theorem 2). We also give a detailed explanation of the way in
which the geometric properties of the spin connection are encoded in the algebraic properties of the Dirac operator and charge conjugation. Finally we recall
how the Dirac operator can be Wick rotated, and we translate our local characterization of Lorentzian signature from the previous section into global terms
(theorem 4), namely in terms of an orientation 1-form. We point out that the
exactness of this form amounts to a causality condition which is called stable
causality. This closes part I.
We advise the hurried reader to use the following strategy: read quickly
subsection 2.4 for the definition of Krein product on spinor space compatible
with a given real structure, then read subsection 2.5 to have theorem 1 in mind,
and skip to section 3.
In the whole paper some notions are defined in the bulk of the text. When
it happens, the name of the notion is always italicized.

Local constructions

2.1

General definitions and conventions

In this section we will be interested in the complex Clifford algebra generated by
a real vector space V of even dimension n = 2k equipped with a non-degenerate
quadratic form Q of signature (p, q). The bilinear form associated with Q will
be denoted by B. Our notations and conventions are summarized below:
• As is traditional in physics, what we call the signature of a real bilinear symmetric (or complex sesquilinear hermitian) form is the triple
(n+ , n− , n0 ), where n0 is the nullity, n− the negative and n+ the positive
indices of inertia. When the form is non-degenerate, we leave out n0 = 0
and write (n+ , n− ) instead.
• We give names to the following cases : Lorentz signature is (n − 1, 1), antiLorentz signature is (1, n − 1), Euclidean signature is (n, 0) and neutral
signature is (n, n).
• The real Clifford algebra Cl(V, Q) is defined using the following conven-

5

tion3
v 2 = +Q(v)
for all v ∈ V . In later sections, in the context of manifolds, we will put
the emphasis on the bilinear form and write Cl(V, B) instead of Cl(V, Q).
We let Cl(V ) = Cl(V, Q) ⊗ C be its complexification, and V C be the
complexification of V . We consider that V ⊂ Cl(V, Q) ⊂ Cl(V ) in the
natural way, i.e. we do not write down explicitly the embedding i : V →
Cl(V, Q). We still denote by Q the natural extension of Q such that
v 2 = Q(v) holds for all v ∈ V C .
• We let c : Cl(V ) → Cl(V ) be the real structure defined by c(a⊗λ) = a⊗ λ̄.
• We let T : Cl(V ) → Cl(V ) be the unique linear antiautomorphism which
restricts to the identity on V . It is called the principal anti-involution.
We often write aT instead of T (a).
• We note that c ◦ T = T ◦ c is the unique antilinear antiautomorphism of
Cl(V ) which extends IdV . We will write a× = c(aT ).
• We let γ be the principal involution, that is, the unique automorphism of
Cl(Q) which extends −IdV . This a grading operator which decomposes
the Clifford algebra into the sum Cl(V ) = Cl0 (V ) ⊕ Cl1 (V ) of its even
and odd parts.
• For any a and invertible g we write Lg (a) = ga, Rg (a) = ag, Adg (a) =
gag −1 . The (complex) Clifford group is defined by ΓC = {g ∈ Cl(V )|
Adg (V C ) ⊂ V C }, the Pin group is P in(Q) = {g ∈ ΓC |c(g) = g and gg T =
±1}, and the Spin group is Spin(Q) = P in(Q) ∩ Cl(V, Q)0 . Remember
that the Clifford group is generated by non-isotropic vectors, and that its
elements satisfy gg × ∈ R.
• Let e1 , . . . , en be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of V . Then we denote by
ω = e1 . . . en the volume element. It depends on the pseudo-orthonormal
basis chosen only up to a sign, which we can fix by chosing an orientation
of V . The volume element anticommutes with every odd element of Cl(V ).
It has the following properties :
n

n

ω T = (−1) 2 ω, ω 2 = (−1) 2 +q
n

• If ρ is a spinor representation, we set χ := (−i) 2 +q ρ(ω). It is called the
chirality operator and always satisfies χ2 = 1. When the representation is
c-admissible (to be defined later), it will also satisfy χ× = (−1)q χ.
Our general reference on Clifford algebras is [Cru 90]. For future use we note
the following fact : let φ : Cl(V ) → Cl(V ) be an automorphism or antiautomorphism which stabilizes V C . Then φ ◦ T and T ◦ φ coincide on V C , hence on the
whole algebra. Thus T and φ commute.
3 We suggest the name “anti-Clifford” for the algebra defined using the convention v 2 =
−Q(v). We think that making the sign conventions explicit by using the words anti-Clifford
and antilorentzian would be greatly beneficial to the mathematical physics community.

2.2

Real structures and local Wick rotations

What we wish to do in this section is to understand Wick rotations algebraically.
We are given at the start the vector space V equipped with a quadratic form
Q. The piece of data (V, Q) is equivalent to Cl(V, Q). We stress that the
Clifford algebra is not to be seen only as a real algebra, but as a real algebra
equipped with a particular set of generators, namely V . Since we want to
change the signature of the quadratic form, it is natural to embed Cl(V, Q) in its
complexification Cl(V ) which will remain constant when Q is varied. Recovering
Q from Cl(V ) amounts to fix a particular real form for the complex algebra
Cl(V ), by way of a real structure, i.e. an involutive antilinear automorphism
which stabilizes V C . The real structure which has Cl(V, Q) as its set of fixed
points will be denoted by c throughout the text. Clearly, the data (V, Q) and
(Cl(V ), c) are equivalent. Given a general real structure σ we define:
• The real subspace of σ-real vectors Vσ := {v ∈ V C |σ(v) = v}.
• The map uσ : v 7→ v+σ(v)
+ i v−σ(v)
, which is easily seen to be an isomor2
2
phism of real vector spaces from V onto Vσ .
• The bilinear form Bσ (v, v ′ ) := 21 (B(σ(v), v ′ ) + B(σ(v ′ ), v)) on V , and its
associated quadratic form Qσ (v) := B(σ(v), v).
Since σ(v) does not in general belong to V it is not obvious at first sight that
Bσ (v, v ′ ) is real. However we can observe that Bσ (v, v ′ ) = 12 (σ(v)v ′ + v ′ σ(v) +
σ(v ′ )v + vσ(v ′ )) and on this form it is clear that σ(Bσ (v, v ′ )) = Bσ (v, v ′ ), hence
this complex number is in fact real.
We also note that the restriction of the quadratic form Q to Vσ is real, since
σ(w2 ) = σ(w)2 = w2 for every w ∈ Vσ . Furthermore, since Vσ + iVσ = V C ,
the complex algebra generated by Vσ is Cl(V ), which we can then identify with
Cl(Vσ , Q|Vσ ) ⊗ C. In particular we note that Q|Vσ is non-degenerate.
Finally the calculation Q(uσ (v)) = uσ (v)2 = 12 (vσ(v) + σ(v)v) = Qσ (v)
shows that uσ is an isometry from (V, Qσ ) to (Vσ , Q).
Hence we have defined from σ a non-degenerate quadratic form Qσ on V
and a real subspace Vσ of V C such that Vσ ⊕ iVσ = V C and Q|Vσ is real.
This construction can be inversed. Consider a n-dimensional real vector
space W of V C such that Q is real on W . Then W ⊕ iW = V C (indeed, if
there exists a nonzero w ∈ W such that iw ∈ W then Q(w + iw) is not real).
Define σ : V C → V C to be antilinear and satisfy σ|W = IdW . It is easy to check
that σ(v1 v2 + v2 v1 ) = σ(v1 )σ(v2 ) + σ(v2 )σ(v1 ), hence σ extends as an antilinear
algebra automorphism.
Hence we have the following one-to-one correspondence:
{ real structures on Cl(V )}

≃

{n − dimensional real subspaces
W ⊂ V C such that Q|W is real}

7

Since c is a fixed “background” structure, it is natural to be particularly
interested in real structures which commute with it, and we will call them
admissible real structures. They turn out to correspond to Wick rotations of
the quadratic form Q.
Lemma 1 The following are equivalent.
1. The real structure σ is admissible.
2. The subspace Vσ is stable by c.
3. The subspace V is stable by σ.
4. The real structure σ restricts to a Q-orthogonal symmetry of V .
5. The subspaces V+ := V ∩ Vσ and V− := V ∩ iVσ form a Q-orthogonal
decomposition of V .
Proof: It is immediate that (1)⇒(3), and for the converse it suffices to observe
that σ ◦ c and c ◦ σ are two algebra automorphisms of Cl(V ) which coincide on
V . The equivalence between (1) and (2) is obtained by symmetry.
Of course (4)⇒(3) is trivial, and to see that (3)⇒(4) we observe that Q(σ(v)) =
σ(v)2 = σ(v 2 ) = σ(Q(v)) = Q(v), hence σ restricts to a Q-orthogonal transformation of V which is moreover involutive.
Finally we see that V+ is the +1-eigenspace and V− is the −1-eigenspace of
the R-linear operator σ|V , hence (5) and (4) are equivalent.
¶
Let us consider an admissible real structure σ. Using the decomposition
V = V+ ⊕ V− given by point 5 above, we see that if v = v+ + v− , with v± ∈ V± ,
then the isometry
uσ : (V, Qσ ) −→ (Vσ , Q|Vσ )
takes the simple form
v 7−→ v+ + iv−
Hence uσ “puts an i” in front of the elements of V− : this is what is called
a Wick rotation. Clearly Qσ is positive definite iff Q is positive definite on V+
and negative definite on V− . In this latter case we say that u is a rotation “to
Euclidean signature”.
As the proposition below shows, admissible real structures can be expressed
in terms of particular elements of the Clifford group.
Proposition 1
1. The real structures are of the form σ = Adb ◦c with b ∈ ΓC
such that bc(b) = λ ∈ R. We also have bT = αb, α = ±1, b× = αc(b).
2. The real structure σ = Adb ◦c with b ∈ ΓC is admissible iff c(b) = eiθ b, with
θ ∈ R. In this case we can choose b to satisfy c(b) = b and b2 = λ = ±1,
in which case we say that it is real and normalized. Then b× = αb, b
belongs to P in(Q), and is unique up to a sign.
8

Proof: It is obvious that σ is an antilinear automorphism which preserves V C
when it is of the form Adb ◦ c with b in the Clifford group. If bc(b) = λ ∈ R it
is moreover an involution since σ 2 (a) = bc(b)ac(b)−1 b−1 = a for all a ∈ Cl(V ).
Conversely, if σ is a real structure, then σ ◦ c is an automorphism of the
Clifford algebra which preserves V C , and it is then of the form Adb with b ∈ ΓC .
Hence σ = Adb ◦ c. Since σ is an involution we have bc(b) = λ ∈ C by the
calculation above. Since c(b) is then equal to b−1 up to a constant, it commutes
with b, from which we obtain that λ is real.
The other properties follow from the ones just proved: since b ∈ ΓC , bb× is
a constant, hence c(b)bT is a constant, and from c(b)b = λ ∈ R we get that b
is proportional to bT . The involutory property of T forces the proportionality
constant to be a sign α. Then b× = c(bT ) = αc(b).
Now it is easy to check that σ commtutes with c iff c(b) = eiθ b for some
eiθ/2
θ ∈ R. Then b′ = √
b is normalized and real and one has Adb = Adb′ . If b′′ is
|λ|

another normalized and real element such that Adb′′ = Adb then b′′ = µb′ with
µ ∈ C. From reality one has µ ∈ R, and from normalization one has µ2 = 1.
Since b′ satisfies b′ (b′ )× = ±1 and is real it is in the Pin group.
¶

At this point one might like to have an example of a non-admissible real structure.
For this, consider R2 with an Euclidean metric and (e1 , e2 ) an orthonormal basis.
Then for t ∈ R, let bt be the Clifford group element bt = cosh t + i(sinh t)e1 e2 . Then
c(bt ) = b−t = b−1
t . Hence bt satisfies the hypotheses of the first part of proposition 1,
but not the second (except if t = 0). If we denote by V the vector of components of
v ∈ V C in the chosen basis, then the real structure σt = Adbt ◦ c is given matricially
by V 7→ Ot V̄ where Ot is the matrix


cosh 2t
i sinh 2t
Ot =
−i sinh 2t cosh 2t
One then easily shows that the metric Bσt associated to the real structure σt =
Adbt ◦ c is cosh 2t times the original metric. More generally, one can show in (even)
dimension n and in the Euclidean case that there always exists an orthonormal basis
of V in which a general real structure is given by a matrix which is a direct sum of Ip ,
−Iq , and 2 × 2 blocks ±Otk with Otk as above.

2.3

Hermitian forms on the complex Clifford algebra

Wick rotations to Euclidean signature are very special. This can be best seen
by extending the quadratic form Qσ to the whole Clifford algebra. The automorphism σ ◦ T will then appear naturally as an adjunction, and its exceptional
character when Qσ is positive definite will be made manifest.
Let (ei )1≤i≤n be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of V C . For any subset I ⊂
{1; . . . , n} we write eI = ei1 . . . eik where i1 < . . . < ik are the elements of I.
We know that (eI )I⊂{1;...,n} is a basis of Cl(V ). Hence there is a projection map
τn : Cl(V ) → C which sends an element of Cl(V ) to its coordinate on 1 = e∅ .
The map τn is called the normalized trace, a name justified by the following
proposition (we refer to [Gar 11] p. 100 for the proof).

9

Proposition 2 The projection τn does not depend on the chosen pseudo-orthonormal basis. It is the unique linear form τn : Cl(V ) → R such that τn (ab) =
τn (ba) for all a, b ∈ Cl(V ) and τn (1) = 1. It also satisfies τn (aT ) = τn (a).
It is also easy to see that if a ∈ Cl(V ), then τn (γ(a)) = τn (a), and if σ is a
real structure, then τn (σ(a)) = τn (a).
Remark: We can see the above proposition as the reason behind the fact that a
product of distinct gamma-matrices is always traceless.

Given the normalized trace and a real structure, it is very natural to define
(a, b)σ := τn (σ(aT )b)

(1)

for all a, b ∈ Cl(V ). We call it the σ-product. It has remarkable properties.
Proposition 3 The σ-product is a non-degenerate hermitian form on Cl(V ).
The associated quadratic form restricts to Qσ on V and to Q on Vσ . It satisfies
(w1 . . . wk , w1 . . . wk )σ = Q(w1 ) . . . Q(wk )

(2)

for any vectors w1 , . . . , wk ∈ Vσ . Moreover if (ei )1≤i≤n is a pseudo-orthonormal
basis of Vσ for Q then (eI )I⊂{1;...;n} is a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Cl(V ) for
the σ-product.
Proof: It is obvious that (., .)σ is sesquilinear. Moreover we have (b, a)σ =
τn (σ(bT )a) = τn (σ(b)T a) = τn (aT σ(b)) = τn (σ(aT )b) = (a, b)σ .
If v ∈ V , then (v, v)σ = τn (σ(v)v) = 12 τn (σ(v)v + vσ(v)) = Qσ (v).
Let us prove (2). We have :
(w1 . . . wk , w1 . . . wk )σ

=
=
=
=

τn (σ(wkT ) . . . σ(w1T )w1 . . . wk )
τn (wk . . . w1 w1 . . . wk )
w12 . . . wk2
Q(w1 ) . . . Q(wk )

Let (ei )1≤i≤n be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Vσ . Then (eI , eI )σ = ±1 by
property (2). Moreover if I 6= J, (eI , eJ )σ = τn (eTI eJ ) = ±τn (eI∆J ) = 0. Hence
(eI )I⊂{1;...;n} is a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Cl(V ), which shows that (., .)σ
is not degenerate.
¶
Note that the multiplicative property (2) of the σ-product does not generalize
to elements of V . The correct symmetrical statement which apply to elements
of V uses the c-product instead of the σ-product.
Here is an elegant (and useful) property of the σ-product.
Lemma 2 Let φ : (V, B) → (V ′ , B ′ ) be an isometry between two real vector
spaces equipped with nondegenerate bilinear forms. Let c, c′ be the canonical
real structures on Cl(V, B) and Cl(V ′ , B ′ ) respectively. Then the isomorphism
φ̃ : Cl(V, B) → Cl(V ′ , B ′ ) which canonically extends φ transforms (., .)c into
(., .)c′ .

τn′ ◦ φ̃(c(aT )b)
τn (c(aT )b) = (a, b)c

where the last step follows from the uniqueness of the normalized trace.

¶

Remark: Care must be taken in applying this lemma. For instance if we use
it on uσ we obtain (ũσ (a), ũσ (b))σ = τn (c(aT ) ∗σ b), where ∗σ is the Clifford product corresponding to the quadratic form Qσ . In particular if a = b = v we obtain
(uσ (v), uσ (v))σ = τn (v ∗σ v) = Qσ (v) = Q(uσ (v)) which is correct.

Taking a Q-pseudo-orthonormal basis (ei )1≤i≤n in V , then the decomposition
n
M

V k = Cl(V, Q)

(3)

k=0

where V k = Vect{eI |, |I| = k} is immediately seen to be orthogonal for the cproduct. The following proposition shows in particular that this decomposition
is independent of the chosen basis.
Proposition 4 Let φ : (V, B) → (V, B) be an isometry. Then φ̃(V k ) = V k for
all k.
Proof: Clearly φ̃(V k ) = V k for k = 0, 1. Let us suppose that φ̃(V j ) = V j for
j ≤ k. The sum V 0 ⊕ . . . ⊕ V k ⊕ V k+1 is orthogonal for the c-product, hence by
the lemma the sum φ̃(V 0 ) ⊕ . . . ⊕ φ̃(V k ) ⊕ φ̃(V k+1 ) = V0 ⊕ . . . ⊕ V k ⊕ φ̃(V k+1 )
also is. Since we obviously have φ̃(V k+1 ) ⊂ V 0 ⊕ . . . ⊕ V k+1 we obtain that
φ̃(V k+1 ) = V k+1 .
¶
Here is another way to understand why the decomposition (3) is independent
of the chosen basis. There is a well-known vector space isomorphism Θ from
the exterior algebra ΛV to the Clifford algebra which is defined by
ΛV
v1 ∧ . . . ∧ vr

−→ Cl(V, Q)
1 X
7−→
ǫ(σ)vσ(1) . . . vσ(r)
r! σ

(4)

Since Θ(ei1 ∧ . . . ∧ eik ) = ei1 . . . eik for distinct elements ei1 , . . . , eik of the
pseudo-orthonormal basis, we see that V k = Θ(Λk V ). Moreover, there is a
well-known way to extend the bilinear form B to the exterior algebra, which is
to decree that Λj V and Λk V are orthogonal for j 6= k and to define
(u1 ∧ . . . ∧ uk , v1 ∧ . . . ∧ vk )B := det((B(ui , vj ))1≤i,j≤k )
11

It is left to reader to check that Θ is an isometry from (ΛV, (., .)B ) to
(Cl(V, Q), (., .)c ). Of course what we have described using c can be extended
to a general real structure σ. However, when passing to the complexification,
the reference to the real structure, or quadratic form, vanishes, so that the
decomposition
n
M
k=0

V k ⊗ C = Cl(V )

(5)

is orthogonal for all σ-products. The vector space V k ⊗ C is described in
a basis-independent way as V k ⊗ C = Θ(Λk V C ), where we still write Θ the
natural extension of the isomorphism (4) to complex scalars.
Remark: When g is an element of the Clifford group, (g, g)c = τn (g × g) = g × g
because g × g is real. It is then customary to write N (g) = g × g and call it the spinor
norm.

If U : Cl(V ) → Cl(V ) is a linear map, we will write U ×σ for its adjoint
relative to the σ-product. We will also write
a×σ := σ(aT )
for an element a ∈ Cl(V ). The two notations are consistent thanks to the
property
σ
L×
a = L a× σ

(6)

which is easily checked. We will now see a simple yet important result which
tells us how the signature of (., .)σ depends on that of Qσ . We call it Garling’s
alternative, since the only place where we could locate it is [Gar 11] (p 101),
where a direct combinatorial proof is given. We give below a slightly different
proof based on the following lemma.
Lemma 3 Let (K, (., .)) be a finite dimensional space equipped with a nondegenerate hermitian form. If there exists U ∈ End(K) such that U × U = −IdK ,
then (., .) is neutral.
Proof: We have (U ψ, U η) = (ψ, U × U η) = −(ψ, η) for all ψ, η ∈ K. Thus
if K = K+ ⊕ K− is an orthogonal decomposition of K into subspaces where
(., .) is positive definite and negative definite respectively, we see that K =
U K+ ⊕ U K− is an orthogonal decomposition where the signs are swapped.
Since dim(U K± ) = dim K± we conclude by Sylvester’s law of inertia.
¶
Proposition 5 (Garling’s alternative) The σ-product on Cl(V ) is positive definite whenever Qσ is. It is neutral in every other case.
Proof: Let (ei )1≤i≤n be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Vσ . Using property (2)
of proposition 1 on the basis (eI ) we see that (., .)σ is positive definite if Q|Vσ
is, and we know that Q|Vσ and Qσ have the same signature.

12

If Qσ (or equivalently Q|Vσ ) is not positive definite, then there exists i such
that e2i = −1. Let U = Lei . Since Le×iσ = Le×σ = Lei , hence U U × = −IdCl(V )
i
and we conclude by lemma 3.
¶
We can now characterize Wick rotations to Euclidean signature in terms of
the corresponding real structure. The notations are the same as in lemma 1.
Proposition 6 Let σ be an admissible real structure. The following properties
are equivalent.
1. The couple (V+ , V− ) of Q-orthogonal supplementary subspaces of V is such
that Q is positive definite on V+ and negative definite on V− .
2. The quadratic form Qσ on V is positive definite.
3. The restriction of the quadratic form Q to Vσ is positive definite.
4. The σ-product (., .)σ is positive definite.
When these properties are satisfied we say that σ is an Euclidean real structure. Notice that when σ = Adb ◦ c is an Euclidean real structure, and b is
normalized, the signs such that b× = ±b and b2 = ±1 are no longer independent. Indeed, b×σ = b−1 b× b = b× , hence bb× is a positive operator and can only
be equal to 1.
Remark: Another specific feature of Euclidean real structures is that the involution a 7→ a×σ and the norm kak∞,σ = supkbkσ =1 kabkσ turn Cl(V ) into a C ∗ -algebra.
For more on this, see appendix B.

2.4

Krein products on spinor spaces

In the rest of this section we let ρ : Cl(V ) → End(K) be a representation of
Cl(V ) on a finite dimensional complex vector space K equipped with a nondegenerate hermitian form (., .)K . We call such a form a Krein product. Remember that a Krein space (see [Bog 74]) is a vector space equipped with a a
non-degenerate hermitian form (., .) and at least one operator β, called a fundamental symmetry such that β 2 = 1 and (., β.) is positive definite and induces
a complete topology. In finite dimension the existence of β is obvious, thus K
equipped with a Krein product is a Krein space.
We will say that ρ is σ-compatible iff
∀a ∈ Cl(V ), ∀ψ, φ ∈ K, (ρ(a)ψ, φ) = (ψ, ρ(a×σ )φ)
This is clearly equivalent to ask ρ(v) to be Krein-self adjoint for all v ∈ V .
When the Krein product is σ-compatible we will denote by A×σ the Krein
adjoint of A ∈ End(K).
We can always build a σ-compatible Krein product on K. First we can
suppose without loss of generality that ρ is irreducible. Then we can use ρ
to tranfer ×σ from Cl(V ) to an antilinear antiautomormphism A 7→ A×σ of
13

End(K). Such an antiautomorphism is necessarily the adjoint operation for
some non-degenerate hermitian form (., .)K
σ . To see this, use the simplicity of
End(K) to pick a β such that A×σ = βA† β −1 where A† is the adjoint for some
−1
scalar product h., .i. Then it is a simple matter to verify that (., .)K
.i
σ := h., β
has the required property.
Since this procedure is essentially in [Rob 88], we will call it Robinson’s
transfert principle.
Proposition 7 There exists a non-degenerate hermitian form (., .)K
σ on K such
that ρ is σ-compatible, and when ρ is irreducible it is unique up to multiplication
by a non-zero real number.
We haven’t proven the uniqueness part yet. It is a simple consequence of
Riesz’ representation theorem, but we state it here as a separate lemma for
future reference. The proof is left to the reader.
Lemma 4 Let (K, (., .)) be a space equipped with a non-degenerate hermitian
form, and let (., .)′ be a hermitian form such that for all ψ, φ ∈ K, and for all
A ∈ B(K), one has (Aψ, φ)′ = (ψ, A× φ)′ , where A× is the adjoint of A for
(., .). Then there exists λ ∈ R such that (., .)′ = λ(., .).
Every minimal left ideal of Cl(V ) is an irreducible module for the representation of Cl(V ) by left multiplication. Such a module is of the form Se := Cl(V )e
where e is a primitive idempotent of Cl(V ), that is an idempotent which cannot
be decomposed as a sum of two others. The module Se is sometimes called
an algebraic spinor module, and its elements are algebraic spinors. It is then
natural to restrict (., .)σ to Se and ask if it defines a σ-compatible Krein product. In fact σ-compatibility is immediate, but the restriction of (., .)σ can be
degenerate. Of course when Qσ is positive definite everything works fine : (., .)σ
is positive definite and its restriction to every algebraic spinor module is a σcompatible scalar product. We will use this fact in the following proposition,
which is implicit in [Rob 88].
Remark: The positive definite case is all we really need, but we can wonder what
happens in general. It turns out that we just need to compute ee×σ : either it is zero,
in which case (., .)σ vanishes on Se , or it is not, in which case (., .)σ restricts to a
σ-compatible Krein product on Se . Moreover, is this latter case, there exists a unique
primitive idempotent f ∈ Cl(V ) such that f ×σ = f and Se = Sf . The proof of this
claim is given in appendix A for the interested reader.

Proposition 8 (Robinson’s alternative) Let K be an irreducible spinor module
and (., .)K be a σ-compatible Krein spinor product.
If Qσ is positive definite, then (., .)K is definite, if Qσ is not positive definite,
then (., .)K is neutral.
Proof: Let us call ρ : Cl(V ) → End(K) the representation homomorphism.
If Qσ is not positive definite, let ei ∈ Vσ be such that e2i = −1, set U = ρ(ei )
and use lemma 3.

14

If Qσ is positive definite, then let U : K → Se , where Se is a minimal left
ideal in Cl(V ), be a Clifford-module isomorphism, which we know exists by
irreducibility of K. By Garling’s alternative, (., .)σ is positive definite, hence
its restriction to Se also is. We now transport (., .)σ to K thanks to U by the
formula (ψ, η)U := (U ψ, U η)σ , for all ψ, η ∈ K. Let us check that (., .)U is
σ-compatible:
∀a ∈ Cl(V ), (ρ(a)ψ, η)U

=
=
=
=
=

(U ρ(a)ψ, U η)σ
(La U ψ, U η)σ by the intertwining property of U
(U ψ, La×σ U η)σ
(U ψ, U ρ(a×σ )η)σ
(ψ, ρ(a×σ )η)U

Now (ψ, ψ)U = 0 ⇒ (U ψ, U ψ)σ = 0 ⇒ U ψ = 0 ⇒ ψ = 0, hence (., .)U is
definite, therefore (., .)K is by lemma 4.
¶
Of course multiplication by −1 turns σ-compatible Krein products into σcompatible Krein products. Putting together Robinson’s alternative and proposition 7, we can therefore characterize the Euclidean signature of Qσ in the
following way.
Corollary 1 If the form Qσ is positive definite then there exists a σ-compatible
scalar product on every irreducible spinor module. If there exists at least one
σ-compatible scalar product on at least one irreducible spinor module then Qσ
is positive definite.
We now turn our attention to the case where σ is admissible.
Lemma 5 Let ρ be a c-compatible representation of Cl(V ) on a Krein space
(K, (., .)). Let σ = Adb ◦ c be an admissible real structure. Let x ∈ Cl(V ) and let
(., .)x = (., ρ(x).). Then (., .)x is a σ-compatible Krein product on K iff x = x×
and x is proportional to b−1 .
Proof: The two properties are easily seen to be sufficient. Let us prove that
they are necessary. First we note that since Cl(V ) is simple and ρ 6= 0, then ρ
is injective. For (., .)x to be sesquilinear x must satisfy ρ(x) = ρ(x)× which is
equivalent to x = x× since ρ is injective and c-compatible. Now we note that
a×σ = σ(aT ) = σ ◦ c ◦ c(aT ) = Adb (a× ) = ba× b−1 .
We must have ρ(a×σ ) = ρ(a)×σ = ρ(x)−1 ρ(a)× ρ(x) and we obtain that xb
is a scalar by the injectivity of ρ.
¶

Now if b is real then b× = ±b according to proposition 1, and we can take
x = b−1 or x = ib−1 in the above lemma. Let us store the result we obtain as a
proposition.
Proposition 9 Let ρ be a c-compatible representation of Cl(V ) on a Krein
space (K, (., .)). Let σ = Adb ◦ c be an admissible real structure with b real.
1. If b× = b, (., .)b := (., ρ(b)−1 .) is a σ-compatible Krein product on K.

2. If b× = −b, (., .)b := (., iρ(b)−1 .) is a σ-compatible Krein product on K.

2.5

Characterization of the Lorentz and anti-Lorentz signatures

First we fix some terminology. If Q has the Lorentz signature, the open light
cone C of V is the non-convex cone of those v such that Q(v) < 0. It consists
of two connected components which we arbitrarily call C+ and C− . If Q has
the anti-Lorentz signature, the open light cone C is defined by Q(v) > 0 and
C+ /C− are defined accordingly.
Let L be a subspace in V and sL be the orthogonal symmetry with respect
to L. That is, if V = L ⊕ W is an orthogonal decomposition, then sL is the
identity on L and minus the identity on W .
Our starting point will be the following evident observation:
• Q has the Lorentz signature iff there exists a line L such that B(−sL (.), .)
has Euclidean signature.
• Q has the anti-Lorentz signature iff there exists a line L such that B(sL (.), .)
has Euclidean signature.
Note that in both cases the line will belong to the open light cone.
Now all we have to do is to translate this observation in terms of admissible
real structures, and use the characterization of Euclidean signature we arrived
at in the previous subsection. In order to do this we first review some basic facts
about the implementation of orthogonal symmetries with the adjoint action of
vectors in Clifford algebras. Special care is needed about the signs.
1
v. The
Let v be a non-zero vector in V . Then v is invertible and v −1 = Q(v)
−1
adjoint action of v on a vector u ∈ V satisfies Adv (v) = vvv = v and if w ⊥ v,
Adv (w) = vwv −1 = −wvv −1 = −w. Thus Adv = sL where L is the line Rv.
Now notice that for any u ∈ V , Adω (u) = ωuω −1 = −uωω −1 = −u since u
is odd. Thus Adωv = Adω ◦ Adv = −sL .
Moreover, since c(ω) = ω and c(v) = v, the real structures σv := Adv ◦ c and
σωv := Adωv ◦ c are admissible. We have thus obtained the following:
Lemma 6 Let L be a line in V . Then
• The unique admissible real structure which restricts to sL is σv := Adv ◦ c,
where v ∈ L is a non-zero vector.
• The unique admissible real structure which restricts to −sL is σωv :=
Adωv ◦ c, where v ∈ L is a non-zero vector.
Putting together what we have learned so far, we obtain:
Theorem 1 Let V be a finite dimensional real vector space of even dimension
with non-degenerate quadratic form Q. Let ρ be a c-compatible irreducible representation on the Krein space (K, (., .)). Then:
1. The signature of Q is anti-Lorentzian iff there exists v ∈ V such that
(., .)v := (., ρ(v)−1 .) is definite.
16

2. If n = 2 or n = 6 modulo 8, then the signature of Q is Lorentzian iff there
exists v ∈ V such that (., .)v := (., ρ(ωv)−1 .) is definite.
3. If n = 0 or n = 4 modulo 8, then the signature is Lorentzian iff there
exists v ∈ V such that (., .)v := (., iρ(ωv)−1 .) is definite.
In every case, (., .)v is definite ⇔ v ∈ C, and there exists λ = ±1 such that
λ(., .)v positive definite ⇔ v ∈ C+ and λ(., .)v negative definite ⇔ v ∈ C− .
Proof:
1. We know that Q has anti-Lorentz signature iff there exists a line
L such that B(sL (.), .) is positive definite. Observe that B(sL (.), .) = Qσ ,
where σ = Adv ◦ c, for any non-zero v ∈ L. We also know that (., .)v is a
σ-compatible Krein product on K by proposition 9, and we conclude by
Robinson’s alternative.
2. Case 2 and 3 are similar to case 1 with the extra complication that b = ωv
satisfies b× = b for n = 2, 6 mod 8 and b× = −b for n = 0, 4 mod 8.
It is obvious that a line L is such that B(sL (.), .) is positive definite iff
L \ {0} lies inside the light cone. Moreover multiplication by −1 exchanges C+
with C− and (., .)v with −(., .)v , so that it only remains to show that (ψ, ψ)v
keeps a constant sign for a fixed non-zero ψ and v varying continuously in one
component of C, which is immediate by continuity of ρ.
¶
Cases 2 and 3 can be put together by saying that the signature is Lorentzian
iff there exists v ∈ V such that (., .)v := (χρ(v)., .) is definite, where χ is chirality
operator of noncommutative geometry.
Remark: Even if we could simplify the above theorem by taking ρ(v) instead
of ρ(v)−1 and so on, since they differ only by a non-zero constant, it could prove
misleading in the noncommutative situation. We will come back to this issue later.

We will not delve much into such matters, but the above characterization
of the Lorentzian/antilorentzian signature can be generalized easily. If Q is of
signature (p, q) and p is odd, then we can find p vectors v1 , . . . , vp such that
σ = Adg ◦ c, with g = v1 . . . vq , is an Euclidean real structure. The converse is
also true, and these vectors will then automatically satisfy vi2 > 0. If p is even
we have to take g = v1 . . . vq and we will have vi2 < 0. The problem now is
to characterize the elements of the Clifford group which are of this form. For
this we can use the canonical isomorphism Θ : ΛV → Cl(V ). Thus we need to
consider two different classes of quadratic forms: even and odd ones, meaning
that p and q are both even or both odd, according to the case. We can then say
that:
• If Q is odd, then p is the only integer such that ∃g ∈ Θ(Λp V ), Adg ◦ c is
an Euclidean real structure.
• If Q is even then q is the only integer such that ∃g ∈ Θ(Λq V ), Adg ◦ c is
an Euclidean real structure.

17

We could then translate these properties in terms of the Krein structures on
spinor modules. However, in order to generalize to noncommutative geometry,
we would have to use noncommutative p-forms or q-forms instead of elements
of the exterior algebra over V , and this raises the issue of junk forms when p
(resp. q) is > 1. We leave this question open for the moment, but we note that
in the Lorentz case we have used the trick of composing with the chirality in
order to stick with 1-forms. It remains to see, using a more general approach,
if this trick is legal. This is the main reason, besides simplicity, why we will
mostly deal with the antilorentzian signature in this paper.

2.6

Some Krein positive operators on spinor modules

In this subsection the quadratic form Q is supposed to be antilorentzian. We
consider a c-compatible irreducible representation ρ of Cl(V ) into a Krein space
(K, (., .)), which we decompose as K = KL ⊕KR where KL (resp. KR ) is the −1eigenspace (resp. +1-eigenspace) of the chirality operator χ. It is immediately
seen by computing (ψ, χ2 φ) and using χ× = −χ that KL and KR are selforthogonal for the Krein product (., .).
An operator A on K will be said to be Krein-positive iff (ψ, Aψ) > 0 for all
non-zero ψ ∈ K. We gather here some observations which will be useful later.
For brevity, we do not write explicitly the representation ρ.
We already know that if e is a timelike vector, (., .)e is definite, and we will
suppose here that the definition of the future light-cone and the Krein product
are compatible in the sense that e is future-directed iff it is Krein-positive. The
next lemma indicates what happens if we take a spacelike vector instead.
Lemma 7 Let w be a spacelike non-zero element of V and let (ψ, ψ)w :=
(ψ, wψ). Then KL and KR are orhogonal to each other for (., .)w . If n > 2, the
form (., .)w is neutral on each half-spinor module KL and KR .
Proof: First, since multiplication by w changes chirality, it is obvious that KL
and KR are orthogonal to each other for (., .)w since they are self-orthogonal
for (., .). If n > 2 we can find a spacelike vector e such that e2 = −1 and
B(e, w) = 0. Let Ue : KL → KR be the map ψ 7→ eψ. Since (eψ, eψ)w =
(eψ, weψ) = −(eψ, ewψ) = (ψ, ψ)w , Ue is an isometry for (., .)w . Thus (., .)w ,
which is globally neutral, must have the same signature on KR and KL , hence
the result.
¶
If n = 2 the form (., .)w has opposite signature on the 1-dimensional halfspinor modules.
There are other Krein-positive operators besides future-directed vectors. An
important example is given in the following lemma.
Lemma 8 Let u, v ∈ V . If n > 2, u + χv is Krein positive iff u + v and u − v
are both timelike and future-directed.

18

Proof: First, using the fact that KL and KR are self-orthogonal we have
(ψ, (u + χv)ψ) = (ψL , (u − v)ψL ) + (ψR , (u + v)ψR )
with ψ = ψL + ψR , ψL/R ∈ KL/R . If u ± v are timelike and future-directed then
(., (u ± v).) are both scalar products, hence the two summands are positive.
Conversely, if u + v is timelike and past-directed, we can take ψL = 0 and
ψR 6= 0 to obtain a negative result. Similarly u − v cannot be past-directed. If
u + v is spacelike we can use lemma 7 to see that there exists a ψR such that
(ψR , (u + v)ψR ) < 0. A similar conclusion holds if u − v is spacelike.
¶
If n > 2, a general ×-self-adjoint odd element of End(K) will have the form
u + χv + r, where u, v ∈ V and the remainder r is a linear combination of eI ,
I ⊂ {1; . . . ; n}, 1 < |I| < n − 1, with (ei )1≤i≤n is some pseudo-orthogonal basis.
Let us suppose that u + χv + r is Krein-positive. Let us observe that if a, b are
Krein-positive then τn (ab) > 0. Indeed, for all non-zero ψ ∈ K, (abψ, bψ) > 0
by the Krein-positivity of a and the invertibility of b. Hence ab is a positive
operator for the scalar product (., .)b , thus it must have a positive normalized
trace. Using this principle with a = u + χv + r and b a future-directed timelike
vector, we see that τn (ub + χvb + rb) > 0. However τn (χvb) = τn (rb) = 0
since χv and r are both orthogonal to b with respect to the c-product. Hence
we obtain that τn (ub) = B(u, b) > 0 for all future-directed timelike vectors b,
which proves that u is itself future-directed timelike. We state this result as a
lemma.
Lemma 9 If u + χv + r is Krein-positive, then u is timelike and future-directed.
As an example of such a Krein-positive operator with a non-zero r, one can
consider a pseudo-orthonormal basis (e1 , . . . , e4 ) of R1,3 and let p = e1 + ite2 e3
for t ∈] − 1; 1[.

2.7

Real structure and charge conjugation. KO-dimension
tables

In noncommutative geometry, the real structure is defined as an antilinear operator on the Krein space which is the abstract substitute of the space of sections
of the spinor bundle. When it is viewed in this way, it is sometimes called the
charge conjugation, and we will adopt this terminology in order to distinguish
it from its Clifford counterpart. To begin this section let us see how the two
notions relate locally.
Proposition 10 Let ρ : Cl(V ) → End(K) be an irreducible c-compatible representation. Then there exists an antilinear operator C : K → K implementing
c, i.e. such that
ρ(c(a)) = Cρ(a)C −1

for all a ∈ Cl(V ). This operator can be chosen to satisfy C 2 = ǫ̃ and C × C = κ̃,
with ǫ̃ and κ̃ some signs, and in that case is unique up to multiplication by eiθ ,
θ ∈ R.
19

Let σ = Adb ◦ c be an admissible real structure, with b in the Clifford group
such that b2 = λ = ±1, b× = λ′ b, λ′ = ±1, and c(b) = b. Let B = ρ(b). Then σ
is implemented on K by Cσ = BC = CB.
We have Cσ2 = λǫ̃, Cσ× Cσ = λλ′ κ̃, and if (., .)σ is a σ-compatible Krein product
on K, then (Cσ )×σ = λCσ× and (Cσ )×σ Cσ = λ′ C × C.
Proof: Fix any basis of K and denote by c.c. : ψ 7→ ψ̄ the complex conjugation
of coordinates with respect to this basis. We also denote by c.c. : A 7→ Ā the
antilinear involution on operators induced by complex conjugation of coordinates, that is : Āψ = Aψ̄. Let us write c̃ = ρ ◦ c ◦ ρ−1 . Since c̃ is an antilinear
involution of End(K), c̃ ◦ c.c. is a linear (involutive) automorphism and is thus
of the form AdC for some C ∈ End(K). We let C = C ◦ c.c. and we obtain that
ρ(c(a)) = Cρ(a)C −1 .
The fact that c is an involution translates as C 2 = ǫ̃, with ǫ̃ a constant. Let
ψ ∈ K be such that Cψ 6= 0. Then C 3 ψ = ǫ̃Cψ = C(ǫ̃ψ), which shows that ǫ̃ is
real. From the fact that ρ is c-compatible we obtain that ρ(c(a))× = ρ(c(a)× ) =
ρ(c(a× )) and it boils down to CC × = κ̃, with κ̃ a constant,pwhich must be real.
Calculating C 2 (C × )2 we find that κ̃2 = ǫ̃2 . Dividing C by |κ̃| we can suppose
that κ̃ = ±1 and ǫ̃ = ±1. It is now easy to prove the uniqueness up to a phase.
The second part is an obvious consequence of proposition 1. We have Cσ× Cσ =
× ×
C B BC = λλ′ C × C = λλ′ κ̃. If λ = 1 then (Cσ )×σ = B −1 Cσ× B = Cσ× (see
proposition 9), and if λ = −1, then (Cσ )×σ = (iB)−1 Cσ× (iB) = −Cσ× .
Hence we have (Cσ )×σ Cσ = λCσ× Cσ = λC × B × BC = λλ′ C × B 2 C = λ′ C × C. ¶
If the representation is not irreducible, we can break it up into irreducible
parts and use the proposition on each one of them. The signs ǫ̃ and κ̃ can still be
defined globally since they do not depend on the representation, but the phase
θ can vary from block to block.
Let us use proposition 10 to see how the KO table of signs change when we
perform a Wick rotation.
If we start from an antilorentzian quadratic form Q, a Wick rotation to
Euclidean signature corresponds to b = v with v 2 = 1, v × = v, hence λ′ = λ = 1.

and b = v ω = (−1) 2 vω = (−1) 2 b. Hence one has λ = λ = (−1) 2
in
this case.
We introduce the hopefully obvious notations CL , χL , CE , χE , CAL , χAL .
Then CE = CAL ρ(v) = CL ρ(ωv). According to the above proposition we then

When going from antilorentzian/Lorentzian to Euclidean signature, the volume element changes in the following way : ωAL/L = e1 . . . en 7→ ωE :=

uσ (ωAL/L ) = iq ωAL/L . But the Euclidean chirality element is χE = (−i) 2 ρ(ωE )
n
whereas χAL/L = (−i) 2 +q ρ(ωAL/L ). Hence the two expressions only differ by
a minus sign:
χE = −χL , χE = −χAL
Finally we note that in both cases CE has an additional −1 factor in its
commutation relation with χE with respect to the one of CAL/L .
Summarizing we have:
• Antilorentzian → Euclidean : ǫ̃ 7→ ǫ̃, κ̃ 7→ κ̃, ǫ̃′′ 7→ −ǫ̃′′
n

n

• Lorentzian → Euclidean : ǫ̃ 7→ (−1) 2 +1 ǫ̃, κ̃ 7→ (−1) 2 +1 κ̃, ǫ̃′′ 7→ −ǫ̃′′
These rules permit to fill the Lorentzian and antilorentzian KO table of signs
from the Euclidean one, using the fact that the metric dimension modulo 8 is
preserved by a Wick rotation (the KO dimension, of course, is not).
The real Clifford algebra Cl(V, Q) can be directly recovered as the algebra of
all a ∈ Cl(V ) such that [C, ρ(a)] = 0. In noncommutative geometry, one generally uses the operator J which selects Cl(V, −Q) (as originally in [Connes 95]).
To pass from one to the other is easy:
J = χC
We call C the ungraded charge conjugation and J the graded charge conjugation operator. In this work it is generally more convenient to use C, but we
stick to the traditional J in definitions and statements of theorem.
The signs ǫ, ǫ′ , ǫ′′ which are given in the definition of spectral triples correspond to the commutation rules of J with D and χ and to the square of J. In
the Lorentzian/antilorentzian context there is also a sign arising from J × J.
When we pass from the C convention (signs with tildes) to the J convention
(signs without tildes) and vice versa we must use the following rules:
• ǫ̃′′ = ǫ′′ (J and C have the same commutation rules with χ).
• ǫ̃′ = −ǫ′ (J and D have a commutation sign opposite to the one of C and
D). In even dimension ǫ′ = 1 and ǫ̃′ = −1 always. Hence we do not let
these signs appear in the table.
• ǫ̃ = ǫ′′ ǫ (because J 2 = χCχC = ǫ′′ C 2 ).
• In the Lorentzian/antilorentzian case : κ̃ = −κ (since J × J = (χC)× χC =
−C × C), in the Euclidean case, κ̃ = κ.

Examples

In this section, which is optional, we derive the compatible Krein products on
spinors in some usual representations. We illustrate how the light cone appears
in each of the three different cases of theorem 1 in concrete computations with
gamma matrices. Let us fix the notations. In each case we take V = Rn ,
with a pseudo-orthonormal basis (eµ )µ=0,...,n−1 . We have raised the indices to
be consistent with physicists conventions. We will have B(e0 , e0 ) = −1 in the
Lorentz case and B(e0 , e0 ) = 1 in the anti-Lorentz case, and e0 will belong to
C + in both cases.
We will use a representation (for instance Dirac or Majorana4) in which the
gamma matrices γ µ := ρ(eµ ) satisfy (γ µ )† = ±γ µ where the sign is the same as
in (γ µ )2 = ±1, and † is the adjoint relatively to the canonical scalar product on
K = CN , N = 2n/2 .
We will consider a c-compatible Krein product on K denoted by (., .). Its
adjunction operation is denoted A 7→ A× . We denote by β the matrix of the
form (., .) in the canonical basis, that is, (., .) = h., β.i where h., .i is the canonical
scalar product. We know that (., .) is determined up to a constant, which we
reduce to a sign by requiring that β 2 = 1.
The c-compatibility of ρ is equivalent to the requirement that (γ µ )× = γ µ
for all µ, which is in turn equivalent to β(γ µ )† β −1 = γ µ . We see then that :
• In the anti-Lorentz case, β is determined up to a sign by :
βγ 0 β −1 = γ 0 ,

βγ k β −1 = −γ k , k = 1, . . . , n − 1,

β † = β, β 2 = 1 (7)

• In the Lorentz case, β is determined up to a sign by :
βγ 0 β −1 = −γ 0 ,

βγ k β −1 = γ k , k = 1, . . . , n − 1,

β † = β, β 2 = 1 (8)

The obvious solution to (7) is β = ±γ 0 . The more or less obvious solution
to (8) is β = ±γ 0 ρ(ω) if n = 2, 6 [8] and β = ±iγ 0 ρ(ω) if n = 0, 4 [8]. In
other words in either case β = ±γ 0 χ where χ is the chirality operator (the “γ 5
matrix” in this context).
Now the part about the light cone in theorem 1 tells us in the anti-Lorentz
case that v ∈ C if and only if βρ(v) is a definite hermitian matrix. In the
Lorentz case it is βχρ(v) which must be definite, but since the two χ cancel, we
obtain in both cases that v ∈ C ⇔ γ 0 ρ(v) is a definite hermitian matrix.

Global constructions

Let (M, g) be a connected orientable semi-Riemannian manifold of dimension n
and signature (p, q). In this section the notion of spacelike (resp. timelike) will
be associated with the positive (resp. negative) index of inertia. Note that this
4 In fact the Dirac representation is more natural, since the Dirac basis is at the same time
orthonormal for the scalar product h., .ie0 and pseudo-orthonormal for the Krein-product.

23

clashes with the relativistic convention in the antilorentzian case ! We see no
way of avoiding this problem. We will warn the reader when a confusion could
arise. We will revert to the usual convention in the following sections when we
are exclusively concerned with the antilorentzian/Lorentzian cases.
Given the Clifford bundle Cl(M, g) and its complexification Cl(M ) we now
seek to make the constructions of the preceding section global. We start with
real structures.

3.1

Global real structures

A (global) real structure σ on Cl(M ) is an involutive bundle map which is
antilinear and respect products over each fibre. Since Cl(M ) is given as the
complexification of Cl(M, g), we start with a given real structure c. We will
be interested in real structures σ commuting with c and such that the metric
g(σ(.), .) is Euclidean, i.e. Euclidean real structures. In view of proposition 6
such a real structure σ defines an orthogonal splitting T M = Es ⊕ Et of the
tangent bundle of M into spacelike and timelike subbundles, and the restriction
of σ to T M is the orthogonal symmetry with respect to Es . Conversely, given
such a splitting (which always exists, see [F-N 12], section 3), we can define the
spatial orthogonal symmetry globally, and extend it by the universal property
of the Clifford bundle. If we compose the result with c we obtain an Euclidean
real structure. Hence there is no obstruction to the existence of such objects.
However, σ is given at each point x ∈ M by σx = Adbx ◦ cx where bx in
an element of the Clifford group at x. Hence globally we will have σ = Adb ◦ c
where b is a section of the Clifford group such that Adb is smooth. But it is
clear that there will generally be an obstruction to the existence of a smooth b.
To get a feel of what this obstruction might be let us consider the antilorentzian
case. We know that σ defines an orthogonal splitting T M = Es ⊕ Et of the
tangent bundle, and in view of lemma 6, b itself is a section of Es . Asking this
section to be smooth is asking for the existence of a time-orientation5 , that is a
nonvanishing timelike (in the sense of relativity) vector field ([Beem 81], p 5).
To deal with the general case we need a formal definition of space and time
orientations in the semi-Riemannian case6 . Recall that the kernel of a p-form
ωx is the subspace of Tx M consisting of those vectors v such that ω(v, ., . . . , .)
is the null p − 1-form.
Lemma 10 The following claims are equivalent.
1. There exists a p-form ω such that Ker(ωx ) is a timelike q-dimensional
subspace of Tx M for all x ∈ M .
2. There exists a p-form ω such that for every linearly independent family
(v1 , . . . , vp ) of spacelike tangent vectors at x, ωx (v1 , . . . , vp ) 6= 0.
5 Reader beware ! What we have called spacelike in this semi-Riemannian context is what
is called timelike in Relativity when the mostly plus convention is adopted.
6 Surprisingly we could not locate any in the literature.

24

3. Given any decomposition T M = Es ⊕ Et of the tangent bundle into the
sum of a spacelike and timelike subbundle, there exists a non-vanishing
top form ω s of Es .
Proof: To see that (1) entails (2) consider any family F = (v1 , . . . , vp ) of spacelike tangent vectors at x and let Sx ⊂ Tx M be the linear subspace they span.
Since Kerωx is timelike and q-dimensional, one has Kerωx ⊕ Sx = Tx M . Call
πx the projection onto Sx defined by this decomposition. It is immediate that
ωx (u1 , . . . , up ) = λ detF (πx (u1 ), . . . , πx (up )) for any vectors u1 , . . . , up , where
detF is the determinant in the basis F of Sx and λ ∈ R. Clearly λ 6= 0 since ωx
does not vanish identically. Hence ωx (v1 , . . . , vp ) 6= 0.
The proof that (2) entails (3) is immediate. To obtain (1) from (3), consider
the projection π on Es defined by T M = Es ⊕ Et , and extend ω s by the formula
ωx (u1 , . . . , up ) := ωxs (π(u1 ), . . . , π(up ))
Then ω is a p-form on T M and its kernel at x is clearly (Et )x .

¶

A similar lemma clearly holds with timelike/spacelike reversed. When the
properties stated in the lemma hold, we will say (M, g) is space (respectively)
time orientable. A form on T M with the two first properties will be called a
space (resp. time) orientation.
If ω ′ is a space orientation p-form on M , a linearly independent family
(v1 , . . . , vp ) of spacelike vectors at x will be said to be positively oriented iff
ωx′ (v1 , . . . , vp ) > 0. A similar definition can be given with time-orientations.
Note that space/time orientation forms actually provide more information than
the notion of orientation on families of spacelike/timelike vectors just defined.
For example, suppose a Lorentz manifold is time-orientable and consider a 1form ω ′′ with spacelike kernel. Then a timelike vector v at x will be said
to be positively oriented, or future-directed iff ωx′′ (v) > 0. Using the musical
isomorphism ♯ provided by g one can define a vector field ξ = (ω ′′ )♯ , which is
timelike, since it is orthogonal to the distribution of spacelike subspaces Ker(ω ′′ ),
and non-vanishing. This is indeed the usual definition of time-orientation for
Lorentz manifolds, even if the notion of future/past directed timelike vectors
would just require the continuous choice of a half light-cone at each point of the
manifold.
In the same vein we say that M is (totally) orientable if there exists a n-form
ω such that ωx has zero kernel (that is, ω is non-vanishing) for all x.
Now the canonical isomorphism Θx : ΛTx M ≃ Cl(Tx M, gx ) gives rises to a
bundle isomorphism (see for instance [L-M 89], prop. 3.5, chap. 2). We can
compose it with the musical isomorphism and obtain a canonical isomorphism
of vector bundles Θ : ΛT ∗ M ≃ Cl(M, g). If ω is a space orientation form,
then at each x we can decompose Tx M into an orthogonal sum Ker(ωx ) ⊕ Sx ,
where Sx is spacelike. If B = (v1 , . . . , vp ) is an orthonormal basis of Sx , we
obtain immediately that ωx (u1 , . . . , up ) = λx detB (π(u1 ), . . . , π(up )) with π the
orthogonal projection on Sx . Hence bx := Θx (ωx ) = λx v1 . . . vp is seen to be an
element of the Clifford group at x. Thus b = θ(ω) is a smooth section of the
25

Clifford group bundle. Conversely if b is smooth section of the Clifford group
bundle which is locally of the form v1 . . . vp , with vi spacelike, we easily see that
θ−1 (b) is a spatial orientation. Similar consideration apply to time orientations.
We can use these observations to globalize the discussion at the end of subsection 2.5. Moreover since we have assumed M to be orientable, space orientations
can be converted into time orientations, saving us the trouble distinguishing the
even and odd cases, and of translating the words timelike/spacelike when we
revert to the traditional convention. We can thus answer our question about
the obstruction to the definition of real structure through smooth sections of
the Clifford group bundle in the following way:
• An orientable semi-Riemannian manifold admits Euclidean real structures
defined through smooth sections of the Clifford group bundle iff it is time
and space orientable.
Now recall that a time-oriented Lorentzian/antilorentzian manifold is called
a spacetime. Hence an oriented Lorentzian/antilorentzian manifold admits Euclidean real structures defined through smooth sections of the Clifford bundle
iff it is a spacetime.

3.2

Hermitian forms on the spinor bundle

In this subsection we consider a spin-c manifold M with metric g of signature
(p, q) and spinor bundle S. We call ρ the representation ρ : Cl(M ) → End(S).
We will often write a.Ψ instead of ρ(a)Ψ in order to simplify notations. Let
H : x 7→ Hx be a smooth field of nowhere degenerate hermitian forms on S.
We call this object a spinor metric. For any A ∈ End(S) we denote by A×
the map x 7→ A(x)× , where A(x)× is the adjoint relatively to H(x). As in the
local case, we say that H is c-compatible if ρ(a)× = ρ(a× ) for all sections a of
Cl(M ). This is equivalent to ask that ρ(ξ) be self-adjoint for all vector fields
ξ ∈ Γ(T M ). What we want now is to globalize Robinson’s transfert principle.
The following theorem extends results in [Baum 80].
Theorem 2 There exists a c-compatible spinor metric iff (M, g) is time orientable when p, q are even, and iff (M, g) is space orientable when p, q are odd.
Proof: We deal with the odd case only, the even case being completely similar.
Let us suppose that there exists a c-compatible spinor metric H. Consider
a covering of M by open sets (Uα )α∈A such that T M and S are trivial over Uα ,
and a subordinate partition of unity (fα )α∈A . For each x ∈ M we let Ix be the
finite set of indices α such that fα (x) 6= 0. On each Uα let us choose a section ψα
n/2
of the spinor bundle which is constant in some trivialization S|Uα ≃ Uα × C2
and non-vanishing.
Let us define the p-form
X
ω(X1 , . . . , Xp ) =
fα (x)Hx (ψα , ir Θ(X1 ∧ . . . ∧ Xs )ψα )
(9)

The integer r is [ p2 ]. It ensures that ω is a real p-form. Indeed:

(−1)r Θ(X1 ∧ . . . ∧ Xp )

where (−1)r is the signature of the reversal permutation (1, . . . , p) 7→ (p, . . . , 1).
Let (e1 , . . . , ep , ep+1 , . . . , en ) be a pseudo-orthonormal basis of Tx M such that
e1 , . . . , ep are spacelike. Then we know that Hx (., ir (e1 . . . ep )−1 .) is definite.
Since (e1 . . . ep )−1 = ep . . . e1 = (−1)r e1 . . . ep , we have either:
∀α ∈ Ix , Hx (ψα , ir e1 . . . ep ψα ) > 0
or
∀α ∈ Ix , Hx (ψα , ir e1 . . . ep ψα ) < 0
In both cases we have ωx (e1 , . . . , ep ) 6= 0. Now, since ω is multilinear alternate, we have for any vectors u1 . . . , up ∈ Span(e1 , . . . , ep ):
ωx (u1 , . . . , up ) = det(uji )1≤i,j≤p ωx (e1 , . . . , ep )

(10)

where uji is the j-th component of ui in the basis (e1 , . . . , ep ). Since (e1 , . . . , ep ) is
any orthonormal family of spatial vectors, this shows that ωx (u1 , . . . , up ) 6= 0 for
any linearly independent family of spatial vectors. Thus ω is a space orientation.
Conversely, since M is space-orientable, there exists a Euclidean real structure σ = Adb ◦c where b is a smooth section of the Clifford group bundle. On the
Riemannian manifold (M, gσ ) it is well-known that there exists a σ-compatible
spinor metric. Let us call H̃ such a spinor metric. Then H(., .) = H̃(., ir b.)
defines a c-compatible spinor metric for M .
¶
Of course a c-compatible spinor metric is unique only up to multiplication
by a nonvanishing real function.
In view of the above theorem we come to the conclusion that the framework
we will have a chance to generalize to the noncommutative world is that of
space and time-orientable spin manifolds. We think it noteworthy that these
purely mathematical considerations have led us to manifolds which are “physics
friendly” in the sense that 1) we can put matter fields on them, 2) we can define
an arrow of time, 3) particles will not change their chirality if transported around
the universe.

3.3

The Dirac operator and c-compatibility

In the case of a manifold we have seen that we can express neatly the ccompatibility of a spinor metric by saying that vector fields are self-adjoint.
27

Unfortunately this cannot be directly generalized in the noncommutative setting. It is therefore important to have an alternative formulation which is better
suited to this generalization. This formulation is quite simple: the Dirac operator has to be self-adjoint. We could close this section there, but we prefer to
develop a little bit in order to be completely precise and also because it will be
useful later on.
We will need to consider a spin manifold. Our definition of a spin structure
on a spin-c manifold (M, g, S) is the algebraic one, which is directly applicable in
noncommutative geometry: it is antilinear bundle map J : S → S which satisfies
Jρ(a)J −1 = −ρ(c(a)) and J 2 = ±IdS . If S is equipped with a c-compatible
spinor metric H, we will also have JJ × = ±IdS (see proposition 10). We refer
to [Sch 00] for the equivalence of this definition and the traditional one involving
the possibility of lifting the frame bundle to a spin bundle.
By progressively enriching the structure we can define various kinds of connections on S. We will use the notation
Z
p
′
(Ψ, Ψ )H =
Hx (Ψ(x), Ψ′ (x)) | det(g)|dx
(11)
M

We call this the Krein product on spinor fields, a name which will be justified
later on.
Definition 1 Let (M, g, S) be a spin-c manifold and H be a spinor metric on
S. Let ∇ be a connection on S .
1. If ∇X (a · Ψ) = (∇LC
X a) · Ψ + a · ∇X Ψ, for all sections a of the Clifford
bundle, vector fields X and spinor fields Ψ, Ψ′ with compact support, then
∇ is said to be a Clifford connection.
2. If X · (Ψ, Ψ′ )H = (∇X Ψ, Ψ′ )H + (Ψ, ∇X Ψ′ )H , for all X, Ψ, Ψ′ as above,
∇ is said to be metric.
3. If in addition M is a spin manifold and J is a spin structure on it, then
∇ is said to preserves spin if ∇X J = J∇X for all vector field X.
4. If M is a spin manifold and is space and time oriented, J is a spin structure on it, and H is a c-compatible metric on S, then ∇ is said to be a
spin connection if it is a Clifford connection which is metric and preserves
spin.
Let x, y ∈ M , let λ be a curve joining these points. Let hλ : Sx → Sy
be the parallel transport operator of ∇ along λ. Similarly, we denote by hLC
λ
the parallel transport of the Levi-Civita connection along λ. Since this is an
isometry from (Tx M, gx ) onto (Ty M, gy ) we can consider its canonical extension
h̃LC
which is an isomorphism between Cl(Tx M ) and Cl(Ty M ). The above
λ
infinitesimal definitions can be given integrated forms. More precisely, with the
same hypotheses as in definition 1, we can say that

28

1. ∇ is a Clifford connection iff for all x, y, λ, hλ intertwines the action of the
Clifford algebras at x and at y on the spinors. More precisely, this means
that for all a ∈ Cl(Tx M ) the following diagram commutes
Sx

2. ∇ is metric iff the parallel transport hλ is an isometry from (Sx , Hx ) onto

3. ∇ preserves spin iff the following diagram commutes for all x, y, λ:

Going back and forth from the infinitesimal to the integrated properies is
not difficult using the formula
h−1
λ (Ψ(λ(t)) − Ψ(x)
t→0

(∇X Ψ)(x) = lim

d
where λ : [0; 1] → M is a curve such that λ(0) = x and ( dt
λ)(0) = X, and
LC
the similar formula for ∇ . The integrated versions continue to make sense in
the discrete context, as we will see.

Remark: It is immediate that the holonomy operators of a Clifford (resp. spin)
connection belong to the Clifford (resp. spin) group. A Clifford connection which
is metric for a c-compatible spinor metric would have its holonomies in the spin-c
group and would deserve to be called a spin-c connection. Such objects play a role
in the theory of Seiberg-Witten invariants and are indeed called that way. Clifford
connections were defined in [B-G-V 92].

Two connections on S differ by an End(S)-valued 1-form, and it is easy to
see that this 1-form must be scalar-valued in the case of Clifford connections. If
the connections are also metric, the 1-form has values in iR, and if they commute
with J it has values in R, so we obtain the uniqueness of the spin connection.
Moreover the spin connection always exists (see theorem 9.8 in [GB-V-F 01] for
the Riemannian case, [Bizi XX] for the general case).
Every Clifford connection
gives rise to a Dirac operator which will have the
P
local form D = −i µ γ(dxµ )∇∂µ , where γ : T ∗ M → End(S) is the composition of the musical isomorphism defined by g, and the representation ρ (hence
γ(dxµ )ψ = ρ((dxµ )♯ )ψ).

29

In noncommutative geometry we will be left with (an abstract version of) the
sections of the spinor bundle, Krein product, Dirac operator and spin structure,
with no direct hold on the connection, Clifford algebra and vector fields. The
following facts are then crucial:
1. The the Dirac operator commutes with the spin structure iff the latter
commutes with the Clifford connection and anti-commutes with vector
fields.
2. The Dirac operator is essentially self-adjoint with respect to the Krein
product (., .)H iff the spinor metric H is c-compatible and the Clifford
connection is metric with respect to it.
We prove these claims in appendix C.
We can conclude from this that the Dirac operator of a Clifford connection
∇ is essentially self-adjoint and commutes with J iff ∇ is the spin connection.
We will recover a discrete analog of this result in section 3.4 of [Bes 16].

3.4

The canonical spectral “triple” of a semi-Riemannian
manifold

In this section we consider a space and time orientable spin manifold M , with
a given spinor bundle S equipped with c-compatible spinor metric H and representation ρ, charge conjugation J, and the canonical Dirac operator D corresponding to the spin connection ∇.
3.4.1

The Krein space of spinor fields

We let Γ∞
c (S) denotes the space of smooth sections of S with compact support.
On this space we have already defined the hermitian form (., .)H . Since (M, g)
is space orientable we can consider a space-orientation7 form β, and the corresponding smooth field of Clifford group elements b = θ(β). In fact we can
suppose without loss of generality that bx lies in the Pin group for all
p x, since
here c(bx ) = bx and we have b2x ∈ R. Hence we can replace b with b/ |b2 | (see
proposition 1 for details). We set B = ρ ◦ b, and we recall that we can define a
definite spinor metric (., .)b by premultiplying spinors by B −1 or iB −1 according
to the negativity index of the metric g (see proposition 9). For instance in case
B = B×
Z
√
Hx (Ψ(x), Bx−1 Φ(x)) −gdx

M

is a definite hermitian form on Γ∞
c (S). Since M is connected we can suppose
that it is positive definite up to an overall change of sign when choosing β. We
call K the Hilbert space obtained by completing Γ∞
c (S) with respect to this
scalar product. It turns out that this completion does not depend on the choice

again, in the antilorentzian convention this is a time-orientation !

of β (see [Baum 80] section 3.3.1 or [Bizi XX]). Moreover, as we have already
noticed at the end of section 2.3, since Adb ◦ c is an Euclidean real structure,
2
×

we have b2x = 1 if b×
x = bx and bx = −1 if bx = −bx . In either case B = 1. We
then obtain canonically a Krein space K with fundamental symmetry B.
The canonical spectral “triple” of a Riemannian spin manifold of even dimension is the following bunch of objects : the pre-C ∗ -algebra A = C ∞ (M ),
Hilbert space of L2 -spinor fields H, representation π of A on H by pointwise
multiplication, canonical Dirac operator D, charge conjugation operator J and
chirality operator χ. We see that in the semi-Riemannian space and time orientable context we must replace H with the Krein space K described above, but
without fixing a particular fundamental symmetry: doing so would be equivalent to fix a particular space orientation. We will see later that the C ∗ -structure
on A has to be dropped too. But for the moment we turn to the question of the
characterization of the signature in the Lorentzian and antilorentzian cases.
3.4.2

The antilorentzian and Lorentzian cases

Given what we have done just above, characterizing the Lorentzian/antilorentzian
signature of a manifold metric purely in terms of the data available in noncommutative geometry is easy. Beware that we now, and for the rest of the
paper, revert to the usual convetion of calling “timelike” the vectors such that
g(v, v) > 0 in the antilorentzian case. Recall that if ω is a 1-form we denote by
γ(ω) the Clifford multiplication by ω, that is γ(ω) = ρ(γ ♯ ).
Theorem 3 Let (M, g) be a semi-Riemannian space and time orientable spin
manifold of even dimension, with given c-compatible spinor metric H, spin
structure J and chirality operator χ. Let K be the Krein space of spinor fields
equipped with the Krein product (., .)H . Then (M, g) is
1. antilorentzian iff there exists a never vanishing 1-form β such that JβJ −1 =
−β and (., γ(β)−1 .)H is positive definite.
2. Lorentzian iff there exists a never vanishing 1-form β such that JβJ −1 =
−β and (., γ(β)−1 χ.)H is positive definite.
3.4.3

Causality conditions

A very specific feature of the Lorentzian/antilorentzian signature is the existence
of a local causal structure. Two approaches which aim at using precisely this
feature in noncommutative geometry are reviewed in [Bes 15b]. Though we will
not follow this strategy, it is natural to interpret one of the many global causality
conditions one can put on a spacetime in the terms of theorem 3, namely stable
causality.
Stable causality is the fourth stronger causality condition distinguished in
[M-S 08], with global hyperbolicity on top. Intuitively a spacetime (M, g) is
stably causal if (M, gǫ ) is causal for every small enough perturbation gǫ of the

31

metric. For the rigorous definition see [M-S 08]. Any simply connected 2dimensional spacetime satisfies this property. The following theorem gives a
caracterization of stable causality in terms of some classes of functions.
Theorem 4 ([Sán 05]) Let (M, g) be a spacetime. Then the following are equivalent
1. There exists a time function.
2. There exists a temporal function.
3. (M, g) is stably causal.
Recall that a time function is a continuous strictly increasing function, and
a temporal function is a smooth function on a spacetime with a past-directed
timelike gradient ([M-S 08], def 3.48).
Remark: The consequences of this theorem for both noncommutative geometry
and quantum gravity might prove far-reaching. First, since causality is defined through
(noncommutative) time functions in noncommutative geometry ([Bes 15b]), the equivalence of the first two points is important since it shows that one looses nothing when
using the pre-C ∗ -algebra C ∞ (M ) instead of its C ∗ -completion C(M ). Moreover, the
resilience of a stably causal metric under small fluctuations could mean that this condition alone stands a chance of defining a notion a causality in the quantum regime.

Putting together theorems 3 and 4, one sees immediately that stably causal
spacetimes are those on which the 1-form β can be chosen to be exact.

3.5

Wick rotation of the gamma matrices and Dirac operator

We take the same hypotheses and notations as in the previous subsection, except that it will be more convenient here to work with the ungraded charge
conjugation operator C. Also it will be important to consider a normalized
space-orientation form β, so that BB × = 1 and B 2 = ±1.
We know then that σ = Adb ◦ c is a Euclidean real structure on the Clifford
bundle Cl(M ), and we have seen how σ can induce a Wick rotation of the
metric. Namely, we have a new metric gσ (., .) = g(σ(.), .), and an isometry
1−i
uσ = 1+i
2 Id + 2 σ from (T M, gσ ), to the subbundle Vσ of Cl(M ) equipped
with the quadratic form Q(w) = w2 . This isometry extends to an isomorphism
ũσ : Cl(M, gσ ) → Clσ = {(x, a) ∈ Cl(M )|σ(a) = a} ⊂ Cl(M ). What we would
like to do is to use this isometry to “Wick rotate” the Dirac operator directly,
short-circuiting the metric, since we do not have a direct access to the metric
in noncommutative geometry. The strategy, which, as far as we know, was first
used in section 3.4 of [Dun 15], is to Wick rotate the gamma matrices appearing
in the Dirac operator.
We note first that ρ ◦ ũσ is a representation of Cl(M, gσ ). Moreover Cσ :=
BC = CB is an ungraded charge conjugation operator corresponding to σ (see
proposition 10).
32

Let us use σ to decompose the tangent bundle T M into a g-orthogonal sum
T M+ ⊕ T M−, corresponding at each point to the decomposition given in lemma
1 (hence v is a section of T M+ iff σ(v) = v). Then if (eµ ) is a local g-pseudoorthonormal frame such that eµ (x) lies either in Tx M+ or in Tx M− , then (eµ )
will also be a gσ -pseudo-orthonormal frame.
We can then define gamma matrices with respect to ρ and ρ ◦ ũσ :
• γµ := ρ(eµ ), which satisfy {γµ , γν } = 2g(eµ , eν ),
• γµσ := ρ(uσ (eµ )) which satisfy {γµσ , γνσ } = 2gσ (eµ , eν )
Since ρ(σ(a)) = Cσ ρ(a)Cσ−1 , we have

Let ×σ be the adjunction in End(S) for the σ-compatible Krein product
given by proposition 9. We use the same symbol to denote the adjunction in
End(K) with respect to (., .)b . Then for any operator A on S or End(K) we
have A×σ = BA× B −1 . Hence we can also write
γµσ =

γµσ =

We must also consider the gamma matrices γ µ = ρ((e∗µ )♯ ) = g(eµ , eµ )γµ ,
and similarly γσµ = gσ (eµ , eµ )γµσ . We have

Observe that gσ (eµ , eµ ) = g(σ(eµ ), eµ )) = κ(µ)g(eµ , eµ ), where κ(µ) = ±1

γσµ = gσ (eµ , eµ )

γσµ = g(eµ , eµ )

In the last line of this expression we have stressed that even though the
Wick rotated Dirac operator Dσ is not, except for very special metrics, the
Dirac operator of the Wick rotated metric gσ , it has the same principal symbol.
In particular, the metric on M defined by Connes’ distance formula from Dσ is
gσ .
The conclusion of this discussion is that Dσ has all the algebraic properties
required to form a spectral triple, together with the Hilbert space (K, (., .)b ),
charge conjugation Jσ , chirality −χ, and the representation π of C ∞ (M ) by
pointwise multiplication. (We have been very uncaring about the analytical
properties. For more on this question see [D-P-R 13]).
Hence if we set S = (C(M ), K, (., .), π, D, J, χ) and Sβ = (C(M ), K, (., .)b , π,
Dσ , Jσ , −χ) the map Wβ : S 7→ Sβ is defined without reference to the Clifford
bundle as long as we know how to let β act on K. In the Lorentzian and
antilorentzian cases this action can indeed be defined thanks to π and D only.
The target of Wβ is a spectral triple, and the nature of the source is to be
defined in [Bes 16].
If we want to go in the other direction, we must provide a distinguished form
β (or equivalently b, c = Adb ◦ σ or J = B −1 Jσ ). From

This is is readily checked (with the first formula we need to use the fact
that (D×σ )× = (D× )×σ which is true because BB × is constant, and with the
second formula we need to use BDB −1 = B −1 DB which is true because B 2 is
constant).
Example : We start from M = R2k with the constant Euclidean metric. The
k
spinor bundle is trivial and identified with M × C2 . We let eµ = ∂µ . To Wick
rotate to antilorentzian signature we take g = e0 (for instance). Then Vσ is the
vector subspace generated by e0 and iea , a = 1..2k, and G = γ0 is constant.
Then (14) gives

In this simple example Dσ is the canonical Dirac operator of gσ , since the

Krein products on algebraic spinors

Proposition 11 Let Se be an algebraic spinor module.
1. If ee×σ = 0 then (., .)σ is zero on Se , hence is not a Krein product.
2. If ee×σ 6= 0 then :

(a) There exists a unique primitive idempotent f ∈
Cl(V ) such that f ×σ = f and Se = Sf .
(b) The left representation L
(Se , (., .)σ ) is σ-compatible.

of

Cl(V )

on

Proof: Suppose ee×σ = 0. Then for all a, b ∈ Cl(V ), (ae, be)σ = τn (e×σ a×σ be) =
τn (a×σ bee×σ ) = 0.
Now suppose ee×σ 6= 0. Let (., .)a be a σ-compatible Krein spinor product
on Se , which exists by proposition (7).
Since e is a primitive idempotent, p := Le ∈ End(Se ) is a rank one projection. Note that p(e) = e2 = e, hence e ∈ Im(p), so that Im(p) = Ce. Observe
also that (Kerp)⊥ = Im(p× ) (the orthogonal and adjoint are relative to (, )a ) is
one-dimensional8 . Let us call v a non-zero vector in this space.
8 Proof

of these relations : see appendix.

35

If v were isotropic, then for all ψ, η ∈ Se one would have (p× (ψ), p× (η))a =
(ψ, pp× (η))a = 0. By the non-degeneracy of (., .)a this would imply pp× = 0
which is excluded since ee×σ 6= 0.
Then we can suppose that (v, v) = ǫ = ±1. Let us call q ∈ Se the orthogonal
projection on Cv = (Kerp)⊥ . Explicitly one has q(ψ) = ǫ(v, ψ)v, and it is easy
to check that q 2 = q = q × . Moreover, Kerq = v ⊥ = Kerp. Since v is not
isotropic, v ∈
/ Ker(q), hence Se = Ker(q) ⊕ Cv. If ψ ∈ Ker(q), then ψ ∈ Kerp,
hence pq(ψ) = p(ψ) = 0. Moreover pq(v) = p(v). Thus p = pq. Similarly it is
easy to check that qp = q using Se = Kerp ⊕ Ce.
Let us call f = L−1 (q) ∈ Cl(V ). Using L one sees that f 2 = f , f ×σ = f ,
e = ef , f = f e. This shows a). The uniqueness is easy to prove.
Let us show b). Since we know that (aψ, φ)σ = (ψ, a×σ φ)σ for all a ∈ Cl(V )
and φ, ψ ∈ Se by (6), then by lemma 4 there exists λ ∈ R such that (., .)σ =
λ(., .)a on Se . There thus suffices to show that λ 6= 0.
Let us consider f as an element of Se . Then (f, f )σ = τn (f ×σ f ) = τn (f ).
Now f being a non zero projection, its normalized trace is not zero. On the
other hand we have (f, f )σ = λ(f, f )a . This shows that λ 6= 0, and that (., .)σ
is σ-compatible.
¶
Let Sf be an algebraic spinor module with f a primitive idempotent such
that f ×σ = f . Then for each x = af and y = bf one has x×σ y = f a×σ bf ∈
f Cl(V )f . But remember that in any finite-dimensional algebra A over k, if f is
a primitive idempotent then f Af is a division algebra over k. Hence we see that
the range of the map (x, y) 7→ x×σ y defined on Se × Se is a division algebra over
R, hence is isomorphic to R, C or H. Such a map is called9 a spinor product
in [Lou 81]. Thus we see that the σ-compatible Krein product on algebraic
spinor modules are just the composition of Lounesto’s spinor product with the
normalized trace. It should certainly be possible to relate the properties of these
two kinds of products.
Remark: Given a σ-compatible representation ρ in a Krein space K, we see that
ρ(Se ) is the set of operators a such that Im(a× ) ⊂ L where L is a line. The set of
n/2
minimal left ideals Se has thus the structure of P (C2 ). Moreover, the ideals on
which (., .)σ vanishes are exactly those whose corresponding line is isotropic. They
form a submanifold of the projective space which is the image by the quotient map of
the isotropic cone of the Krein product.

C ∗-algebra structures on Cl(V )

Let σ be an Euclidean real structure. Let K be an irreducible spinor module
and h., .iσ a σ-compatible scalar product on K. Then let
kakρσ := sup

ψ6=0

Obviously, (Cl(V ), ×σ , k.kρσ ) is a C ∗ -algebra isomorphic to M2n/2 (C) with the
usual involution ∗ and operator norm k.k associated with the canonical scalar
product. Hence if we equip Cl(V ) with σ we obtain an algebra with two commuting involutions, × and ×σ , one of them being a C ∗ -involution. This kind of
structure is called a Krein C ∗ -algebra in [Kawa 06] (see also [B-R 13]). Thus,
defining a Wick rotation of the metric to Euclidean signature exactly corresponds to giving Cl(V ) a Krein C ∗ -algebra structure. Note that we used a
particular representation to make this remark (in example 4.10 of [Kawa 06],
where this point is also emphasized, the natural representation of the Clifford
algebra on the exterior algebra is used). However if we use the σ-product there
is no need to leave the Clifford algebra.
Indeed, notice that the σ-product (a, b)σ = τn (a×σ b) is transported by ρ to
the Hilbert-Schmidt scalar product on M2n/2 (C). In particular one has kak2σ =
Tr(ρ(a)∗ ρ(a)). Now write kAkHS := [Tr(A∗ A)]1/2 for the Hilbert-Schmidt norm
of a matrix A and define kAk∞,HS = sup{kABkHS | kBkHS = 1}. Then it is
easy to see that kAk∞,HS is in fact equal to kAk. Hence the C ∗ -norm on
Cl(V ) corresponding to the involution ×σ can be defined without using the
representation ρ by
kak∞,σ := sup{kabkσ | kbkσ = 1}

(21)

Conversely, if ∗ is a C ∗ -involution which commutes with × and stabilizes
V C then it is of the form ×σ for some Euclidean real structure σ. Moreover if σ ′ is another Euclidean real structure, then (Cl(V ), ×σ , k.k∞,σ ) and
(Cl(V ), ×σ′ , k.k∞,σ′ ) are isomorphic. In fact this isomorphism is canonical and
is just Adbb′ −1 .

C

Proofs of the claims in subsection 3.3

Let (M, g) be a semi-riemannian spin manifold, with spinor bundle S and spin
structure J. Let ∇ be a Clifford connection and D be the Dirac operator D
associated to it. We write ∇µ := ∇ ∂ .
∂µ

Proposition 12 The Dirac operator and spin structure commute if and only if
{J, X} = [J, ∇X ] = 0 for all X ∈ Γ(T M ).
Proof: The fact that {J, X} = [J, ∇X ] = 0 are sufficient conditions is a
straightforward calculation.
Let us prove that they are necessary. Let f be a smooth real-valued function.
Since [J, D] = [J, f ] = 0, we deduce that J commutes with [D, f ] = −iγ(df ).
We infer easily that J anti-commutes with any real vector field or differential
form. Next we consider the differential operator ∇′ = J −1 ∇J. This operator is
a Clifford connection. Indeed, for any X, Y ∈ Γ(T M ), ψ ∈ Γ(S):
∇′X (Y · ψ)

= J −1 ∇X J(Y · ψ)
37

= −J −1 ∇X (Y · Jψ)
= −J −1 (∇LC
X Y ) · Jψ + Y · ∇X (Jψ)
= (∇LC
Y
)
· ψ + Y · ∇′X ψ
X

(22)

There thus exists a complex-valued one-form ω such that: ∇′X −∇X = ω(X).
This can also be written: ω(X) = J −1 [∇X , J]. We have:

This implies that ω = 0, and thus that [∇X , J] = 0.

¶

Let H be a spinor metric and (., .)H be the associated product on spinor
fields defined by (11).
Proposition 13 The Dirac operator is essentially self-adjoint if and only if
X × = X for all X ∈ Γ(T M ), and the Clifford connection ∇ is metric for H.
Remark: Our spinor bundle S thus has to be a Dirac bundle (see [L-M 89], p
114).

Proof: Let us assume that the Dirac operator is self-adjoint. Let f be a realvalued smooth function. Then f is self-adjoint. This implies that [D, f ] =
−iγ(df ) is anti-self-adjoint. We easily conclude from this that all real vector
fields and all real-valued 1-forms are self-adjoint. In particular, the γ(dxµ ) are
self-adjoint. Let ψ, φ be spinor fields with compact support. We have:

for all ψ, φ ∈ Γc (S). Now, the expression between brackets can be proven to be
C ∞ (M, C)-linear in φ (and anti-linear in ψ as well). Indeed, H(∇µ ψ, γ(dxµ )φ) is
clearly linear in φ. let f ∈ C ∞ (M, C). We replace φ by f φ in the two remaining
terms:
H(ψ, ∇µ (γ(dxµ )f φ)) − ∂µ H(ψ, γ(dxµ )f φ) =

f [H(ψ, ∇µ (γ(dxµ )φ)) − ∂µ H(ψ, γ(dxµ )φ)]

Thus, for all f ∈ C ∞ (M, C) and ψ, φ ∈ Γc (S):

[H(∇µ ψ, γ(dxµ )φ) + H(ψ, ∇µ (γ(dxµ )φ)) − ∂µ H(ψ, γ(dxµ )φ)] = 0

at every x. Now suppose that ∇0 is a local spin connection defined around
x. We know that ∇ = ∇0 + A where A is a scalar 1-form, and that ∇ is metric
if and only if A has pure imaginary values. Using (23) we find that
X
(Aµ + Āµ )H(ψ, γ(dxµ )φ) = 0
(24)
µ

for all spinor fields ψ, φ with small enough compact support containing x.
Since H is non-degenerate the orthogonal of {γ(dx2 )φ, . . . , γ(dxn )φ} for H is
n
a subbundle of dimension 2 2 − n + 1 ≥ 1 of the spinor bundle. Since the
orthogonal of {γ(dx1 )φ, . . . , γ(dxn )φ} has codimension 1 in it, we can, at least
locally, consider a spinor field ψ such that H(ψ, γ(dxµ )φ) = 0 for µ = 2, . . . , n
and H(ψ, γ(dx1 )φ) 6= 0. Hence A1 + Ā1 = 0, and of course the same can be
done for the other indices. The Clifford connection ∇ is thus metric.
The converse can be proven easily following the same steps. It is in fact a
standard result of spin geometry. See for example [L-M 89].
