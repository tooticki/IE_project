Abstract
We show that a variant of a function defined by Cholamjiak and Suantai can be used to
characterize 2-uniform smoothness. We then obtain greatly simplified proofs of a convergence
theorem of Marino and Xu and of one of Zhou using a generalization of a lemma of Browder
and Petryshyn and the aforementioned characterization. We also obtain more easily rates of
asymptotic regularity corresponding to the studied iterations. Finally, we derive a way to
relate two constants which are characteristic to 2-uniformly smooth spaces.

Introduction

The class of k-strict pseudocontractions was introduced by Browder and Petryshyn in [1] for
Hilbert spaces. If H is a Hilbert space, C ⊆ H is a convex subset and k ∈ [0, 1), then a mapping
T : C → H is called a k-strict pseudocontraction if for all x, y ∈ C we have that:
kT x − T yk2 ≤ kx − yk2 + kk(x − T x) − (y − T y)k2 .

(1)

If we set k := 0 in the above, we obtain the condition kT x − T yk ≤ kx − yk, which states that
the mapping T is nonexpansive. The search of algorithms for finding fixed points of nonexpansive
self-mappings of subsets of metric spaces belonging to various established classes has been a
longstanding research program. In the sequel, we will restrict ourselves to classes of Banach
spaces. We denote the unit sphere of a Banach space E by S(E). A Banach space E is called
smooth if for any u ∈ S(E), its norm is Gâteaux differentiable at u, i.e. for any v ∈ S(E), the
limit
ku + hvk − kuk
lim
h→0
h
exists. This condition has been proven to be equivalent to the fact that the normalized duality
∗
mapping of the space, J : E → 2E , is single-valued – and we shall denote its unique section by
∗
j : E → E . Therefore, for all x ∈ E, j(x)(x) = kxk2 and kj(x)k = kxk. Moreover, E has a
Fréchet differentiable norm if, in addition, the limit above is attained uniformly in the variable
v ∈ S(E) and it is uniformly smooth (or has a uniformly Fréchet differentiable norm) if
the limit is attained uniformly in the pair of variables (u, v) ∈ S(E) × S(E). One can also define
the modulus of smoothness of E to be the map ρE : (0, ∞) → R, defined, for all τ ∈ (0, ∞), by



ku + τ vk + ku − τ vk

ρE (τ ) := sup

It is known that a space E is uniformly smooth iff
ρE (τ )
= 0.
τ →0
τ
lim

This can happen, for example, if there are c > 0 and q > 1 such that for all τ , ρE (τ ) ≤ cτ q . In
that case, E is said to be q-uniformly smooth.
We define now the modulus of convexity of a space E to be the map δE : [0, 2] → R+ ,
defined, for all ε ∈ [0, 2], by

δE (ε) := inf 1 −

A Banach space E is called uniformly convex iff for all ε > 0, δE (ε) > 0 – or, equivalently, if
for any ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that for any u, v ∈ S(E) such that ku − vk ≥ ε we have that
ku+vk
≤ 1 − δ. If η : R → R is a function such that for any ε > 0, η(ε) is such a δ, we call η a
2
valid modulus of uniform convexity for the space. We remark that the modulus of convexity
from above is, in a sense, the “optimal” valid modulus of uniform convexity.
The algorithms mentioned above are usually iterative in nature – a typical example is the
Mann iteration associated to such a self-mapping T : C → C, an initial point x ∈ C and a
sequence (tn )n∈N ⊆ (0, 1), which is the sequence (xn )n∈N ⊆ C defined1 by:
x0 := x
xn+1 := tn T xn + (1 − tn )xn
A result on the Mann iteration for nonexpansive mappings is the following theorem of Reich,
which will be needed in the sequel.
Theorem 1.1 (Reich (1979), [11, Theorem 2]). Let E be a uniformly convex Banach space with
a Fréchet differentiable norm, C ⊆ E a convex, closed set and T : C → C. Suppose that T is
nonexpansive with F ix(T ) 6= ∅. Let x ∈ C and (tn )n∈N ⊆ (0, 1) such that
∞
X

n=0

tn (1 − tn ) = ∞

Then the Mann iteration corresponding to T , x and (tn )n∈N weakly converges to a fixed point of
T.
The class of k-strict pseudocontractions has been less readily amenable to classical iterative
schemas. Still, in 2007, Marino and Xu proved2 the following theorem.
Theorem 1.2 (Marino and Xu (2007), [9, Theorem 3.1]). Let H be a Hilbert space, C ⊆ H a convex, closed set and T : C → C. Let k be in (0, 1) and suppose that T is a k-strict pseudocontraction
with F ix(T ) 6= ∅. Let x ∈ C and (tn )n∈N ⊆ (0, 1 − k) such that
∞
X

n=0

tn (1 − k − tn ) = ∞

Then the Mann iteration corresponding to T , x and (tn )n∈N weakly converges to a fixed point of
T.
1 We

note that for the definition to make sense, C should be presupposed to be convex.
P
and Xu use the notation αn := 1−tn ∈ (k, 1), so that the condition becomes ∞
n=0 (αn −k)(1−αn ) = ∞.
We have chosen to present it as above in order to maintain uniformity with Reich’s approach.

Marino and Xu asked in their paper whether this result can be generalized to uniformly convex
Banach space with a Fréchet differentiable norm, in the same vein as Reich’s. Since then, various
authors have tried to solve this problem to some degree.
The first issue that arises is that of the proper generalization of k-strict pseudocontractions
to the case of Banach spaces. The solution (used, for example, in [2, 13]) comes from the initial
observation ([1, Theorem 1.(2)]) that condition (1) is equivalent to the following:
h(x − T x) − (y − T y), x − yi ≥

1−k
k(x − T x) − (y − T y)k2 .
2

Now, if E is a smooth Banach space, as we said above, it admits a single-valued normalized duality
mapping j : E → E ∗ . Hence the natural extension of the condition above in this framework is the
following one, which we will take as our official definition of k-strict pseudocontractions in Banach
spaces:
1−k
k(x − T x) − (y − T y)k2 .
j(x − y)((x − T x) − (y − T y)) ≥
2
A significant advance in this direction was made by Zhou in 2014, who, using a variant3 of a
function previously defined by Cholamjiak and Suantai – namely, for any Banach space E with a
∗
Fréchet differentiable norm, one can define the function βE
: E × (0, ∞) → R by:




kx + tvk2 − kxk2
∗

− 2j(x)(v)  v ∈ S(E) ,
βE (x, t) := sup
t

for any x ∈ E and t ∈ (0, ∞) – proved the following result, which is implicitly contained in [13,
Theorem 3.1].

Theorem 1.3 (Zhou (2014), [13]). Let E be a uniformly convex Banach space which is also
uniformly smooth, C ⊆ E a convex, closed set and T : C → C. Let d ∈ [1, ∞) be such that for
any x ∈ E and t ∈ (0, ∞),
∗
βE
(x, t) ≤ dt.
(2)
Let k be in (0, 1) and suppose that T is a k-strict pseudocontraction with F ix(T ) 6= ∅. Let x ∈ C
and (tn )n∈N ⊆ (0, 1−k
2d ) such that
∞
X
tn = ∞.
n=0

Then the Mann iteration corresponding to T , x and (tn )n∈N weakly converges to a fixed point of
T.

Our aim is to show that condition (2) above is actually equivalent to 2-uniform smoothness
and then to give simpler and immediate proofs of both Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.3.

The main results

∗
By convention, we will set for any space E and any x ∈ E, βE
(x, 0) := 0. We first note that for
∗
any Hilbert space H, any x ∈ H and any t ≥ 0, βH (x, t) = t. Indeed, in that case, for any x ∈ H,
t > 0 and v ∈ S(H), we have that:

kx + tvk2 − kxk2 − 2hx, tvi
kx + tv − xk2
kx + tvk2 − kxk2
− 2j(x)(v) =

= t.

The characterization lemma is the following.

original definition in [2, Lemma 3.2] was:

(x, t) := sup

which would make Zhou’s condition (2) unnecessarily stronger.

 v ∈ S(E) .


Lemma 2.1. Let E be a smooth Banach space. The following statements are equivalent:
(i) E is 2-uniformly smooth, i.e. there is a c > 0 such that for all τ , ρE (τ ) ≤ cτ 2 ;
(ii) there is a d > 0 such that for all x, y ∈ E we have that kx + yk2 ≤ kxk2 + 2j(x)(y) + dkyk2 ;
∗
(iii) there is a d > 0 such that for all x ∈ E and t ≥ 0 we have that βE
(x, t) ≤ dt.

Moreover, the constants in (ii) and (iii) may be taken to be the same (and hence we have used the
same designator).
Proof. The equivalence between (i) and (ii) is given by [12, Corollary 1’].
Suppose now that (ii) holds. Let x ∈ E and t ≥ 0. If t = 0, there is nothing to prove, so
suppose t > 0. Let v be in S(E). Then, by (ii), setting y := tv, we get that:
kx + tvk2 ≤ kxk2 + 2tj(x)(v) + dt2 ,
so

kx + tvk2 − kxk2
− 2j(x)(v) ≤ dt,
t
from which, by taking the supremum, the conclusion follows.
Suppose now that (iii) holds. Let x, y ∈ E. Again, if y = 0, there is nothing to prove. If y 6= 0,
1
· y and t := kyk, so tv = y. Then we get that:
set v := kyk
2
kx + yk2 − kxk2
∗
−
· j(x)(y) ≤ βE
(x, kyk) ≤ dkyk,
kyk
kyk
and by multiplying by kyk we obtain our desired result.
We have therefore established the equivalence of Zhou’s condition with 2-uniform smoothness,
which was mentioned as a special case in [13, p. 762]. We note that it is immediate that if d
satisfies the two equivalent conditions, and d ≤ d′ , then d′ also satisfies the condition. Hence we
can always take d ≥ 1. In addition to that, we will also sketch in Section 4 a way to compute the
constant d – and that specific choice of d for a given c will be denoted by dc from now on (and its
value is already greater than 1).
The other ingredient of our result is the following generalization of [1, Theorem 2]. For a given
self-mapping of a convex set, T : C → C, and a t ∈ (0, 1), set Tt := tT + (1 − t)idC – that is, for
all x ∈ C, Tt x = tT x + (1 − t)x. It is immediate that for all t1 , t2 ∈ (0, 1), (Tt1 )t2 = Tt1 ·t2 . Also
note that, for any t, T and Tt have the same fixed points.
Lemma 2.2. Let E be a Banach space, C ⊆ E a convex subset and d ≥ 1 such that for any x ∈ E
∗
and t ≤ 0, βE
(x, t) ≤ dt. Let k ∈ (0, 1) and T : C → C a k-strict pseudocontraction.
Let t ∈ (0, 1−k
d ]. Then Tt is nonexpansive. (In particular, T 1−k is nonexpansive.)
d

1−k
d ,

Proof. Since t ≤
we have that dt − (1 − k) ≤ 0.
Let x, y ∈ E. We have that:
kTt x − Tt yk2 = ktT x + (1 − t)x − tT y − (1 − t)yk2

= k(x − y) + (−t)((x − T x) − (y − T y))k2

≤ kx − yk2 − 2tj(x − y)((x − T x) − (y − T y)) + dt2 k(x − T x) − (y − T y)k2

≤ kx − yk2 − t(1 − k)k(x − T x) − (y − T y)k2 + dt2 k(x − T x) − (y − T y)k2
= kx − yk2 + t(dt − (1 − k))k(x − T x) − (y − T y)k2

≤ kx − yk2 .

Now we can prove the main convergence result.
Theorem 2.3. Let E be a uniformly convex Banach space which is also 2-uniformly smooth,
C ⊆ E a convex, closed set and T : C → C. Let, therefore, d ≥ 1 be a constant satisfying
conditions (ii) and (iii) from Lemma 2.1 (if, for example, ρE (τ ) ≤ cτ 2 , for all τ , take d := dc ).
Let k be in (0, 1) and suppose that T is a k-strict pseudocontraction with F ix(T ) 6= ∅. Let x ∈ C
and (tn )n∈N ⊆ (0, 1−k
d ) such that

Then the Mann iteration corresponding to T , x and (tn )n∈N weakly converges to a fixed point of

d
Proof. By Lemma 2.2, we have that T 1−k is nonexpansive. For every n ≥ 0, set t′n := tn · 1−k

d
Denote by (xn )n∈N the Mann iteration corresponding to T , x and (tn )n∈N . Let n ≥ 0. We have
that:

d
to apply Theorem 1.1. For that we do the following verification:

We are therefore in the hypothesis of Theorem 2.3.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. We have shown in the beginning of this section that one can take for a
Hilbert space d := 1. The conclusion immediately follows.
Note that for directly establishing the truth of Theorem 1.2, we would not have needed the full
machinery of the lemmas, but only the result of [1, Theorem 2]. Also take into consideration, as
a reviewer pointed out, that our results above can be considered special cases of the results of [3],
specifically Lemma 3 and Theorem 12 (modulo different notations). Still, we feel that the above
exposition, not being burdened by the extraneous details of the cyclic algorithm considered in [3],
can shed light on the way in which earlier results on strict pseudocontractions, like the one in [9],
can be deduced from older results like Reich’s without rebuilding from the ground up the whole
machinery on demiclosedness and monotonicity.

Quantitative results

Proof mining is a research program introduced by U. Kohlenbach in the 1990s ([7] is a comprehensive reference), which aims to obtain explicit quantitative information (witnesses and bounds)
from proofs of an apparently ineffective nature. This paradigm in applied logic has successfully led
so far to obtaining some previously unknown effective bounds, primarily in nonlinear analysis and
ergodic theory. A large number of these are guaranteed to exist by a series of logical metatheorems
which cover general classes of bounded or unbounded metric structures.
An example of such a piece of quantitative information is the following.
For any metric space (X, d), any T : X → X and any (xn )n∈N , we say that the sequence
(xn )n∈N is T -asymptotically regular if
lim d(xn , T xn ) = 0.

n→∞

We call a rate of T -asymptotic regularity for (xn )n∈N a rate of convergence for the sequence
above, i.e. a function h : (0, ∞) → N such that for any ε > 0 and any n ≥ h(ε),
d(xn , T xn ) ≤ ε.
Kohlenbach has computed, using proof mining techniques, in [6, Theorem 3.4] that the Mann
iteration of the conclusion of Theorem 1.1 has a rate of T -asymptotic regularity of:
'!

3(b + 1)

hb,θ,η (ε) := θ

2ε · η( b+1

where η is a valid modulus of uniform convexity for the space, b is a bound on the minimum
distance between the initial point x and a fixed point of T and θ : N → N is such that for any N ,
θ(N )

X

n=0

tn (1 − tn ) ≥ N.

Such a θ is called a rate of divergence for the series.
Moreover, using the remarks from the statement of the theorem in [6] it can be shown that in
2
the case of Hilbert spaces, which have the well-known modulus of uniform convexity of η(ε) := ε8 ,
one can simplify the above rate to:

Computing the constant

We proceed to derive a formula for dc . Let E be a 2-uniformly smooth Banach space and let,
therefore, c > 0 be such that ρE (τ ) ≤ cτ 2 , for all τ . We shall use Lindenstrauss’s classical formula
from [8]:


1
ρE (t) = sup
εt − δE ∗ (ε) .
2
ε∈[0,2]
So for any suitable ε and t, we get that:
δE ∗ (ε) ≥

1
εt − ct2 .
2

The term on the right hand side is a quadratic function of t, which has as its maximum the value
ε2
16c . So for all ε, we have that:
1
δE ∗ (ε) ≥
· ε2 .
16c
Lemma 1 from [4] states that in this case, for any x, y ∈ E ∗ with
kxk2 + kyk2 = 2
the following holds:
1
kx + yk ≤ 1 − k1
2
7

where k1 is given by the minimum of

1
16c

and α, the constant α being such that

p
2 − (1 − t)2 − 1 − t

= −α < 0.
t2
t∈(0,1]
The function to be maximized here can be seen to be equal to

t+1+

√−2

2−(1−t)2

, which increases

along with its obviously increasing
denominator. So the original function
attains its maximum at
√
√
t := 1, the maximum being 2 − 2. The value of α is therefore 2 − 2.
We denote by L2 (E ∗ ) the space of all functions f : [0, 1] → E ∗ such that:
Z

kf (t)k2 dt < ∞.

By Proposition 1 and “Added in proof” of [4], we get that for all ε ∈ [0, 2],
δL2 (E ∗ ) (ε) ≥ k2 ε2 ,
where k2 is computed by

By the statement and proof of Lemma 2.1 from [10], we get that for all x, y ∈ E ∗ and all
t ∈ (0, 1),
ktx + (1 − t)yk2 ≤ tkxk2 + (1 − t)kyk2 − k2 t(1 − t)kx − yk2 ,
which corresponds to equation (3.1) from [12].
Then, using the proof of the implication (i) ⇒ (ii) from [12, Corollary 1], we get that for all
x, y ∈ E ∗ and all f ∈ J(x),
kx + yk2 ≥ kxk2 + 2f (y) + k2 kyk2 .
Finally, from the first lines of the proof of [12, Theorem 1’], we obtain that for all x, y ∈ E,
kx + yk2 ≤ kxk2 + 2j(x)(y) + k2−1 kyk2 .
We can therefore set
dc := k2−1 =

We note that this bound is by no means an optimal one – we saw that for a Hilbert space
one can simply take d := 1, whereas the formula would give dc := 64 (using c := 12 , taken from
√
2
the usual modulus of smoothness ρ(τ ) := 1 + τ 2 − 1 ≤ τ2 ). Still, the above argument shows
that there is a simple method one can use to readily obtain a suitable d ≥ 1 given the original
smoothness constant c.
