Let G be a reductive group defined over a p-adic field F , that is G = F -points of a reductive group defined
over F . A representation (π, V ) of G is called smooth if for every v ∈ V there exists an open compact subgroup
K < G such that π(g)v = v for every g ∈ K. Let us denote by V K the subspace of all K-fixed vectors in V . A
representation is called admissible if V K is finite-dimensional for every open compact subgroup K < G. In this
work we consider only smooth admissible representations of G. Also, algebras are associative and with unit.
Let K be a fixed open compact subgroup of G. In [Ber], Bernstein proved the following
Theorem 1 (Uniform Admissibility Theorem). There exists a uniform constant N (G, K) such that for every
irreducible representation (π, V ) of G there is an inequality dim V K ≤ N (G, K).
In this work we reprove one of the two lemmas (Lemma 3) in Bernstein’s original proof. As a result we obtain a
sharper estimate for the bound N (G, K) in the theorem. For the convenience of the reader we sketch here (almost
without proofs) the main steps in Bernstein’s proof. We will demonstrate the new bound on dim V K only in the
case G = GLn (F ). The case of a general reductive group is similar.
Let us reformulate the theorem in terms of Hecke algebras. Denote by H(G, K) the Hecke algebra consisting of all
compactly supported functions f : G → C such that f (k1 gk2 ) = f (g) for all g ∈ G and k ∈ K. Denote by H(G)
the Hecke algebra consisting of all locally constant and compactly supported functions f : G → C. Let (π, V ) be
an irreducible representation of G such that V K 6= 0. The Hecke algebra H(G) acts on (π, V ). Note that the space
V K is an irreducible representation of H(G, K). Indeed, let 0 6= v ∈ V K , 0 6= w ∈ V K . The representation (π, V )
is irreducible, hence there exists a function f ∈ H(G) such that π(f )v = w. Obviously π(1K ∗ f ∗ 1K )v = w and
the convolution 1K ∗ f ∗ 1K ∈ H(G, K). Thus we can reformulate Theorem 1 as the following
Theorem 2. There exists a uniform constant N (G, K) such that for every irreducible finite-dimensional H(G, K)module W there is an inequality dim W ≤ N (G, K).
The theorem follows from the following lemmas.
Lemma 3. [Ber, Proposition 2] Let A1 , A2 , ..., Al be a commuting family of matrices in Mn×n (C). Let F be the
algebra of matrices in Mn×n (C) generated by A1 , A2 , ..., Al and the identity. Then
2

dim F ≤ (l + 1)n2− l+1 .
We will prove this lemma later.
Lemma 4. [Ber, Proposition 1] Let L be an algebra over C, A, Z commutative subalgebras in L, A1 , A2 , ..., Al ∈ A,
X1 , ..., Xp , Y1 , ..., Yq ∈ L. Let us assume that Z lies in the center of the algebra L, Z ⊂ A, A is the commutative
P
algebra generated by A1 , ..., Al and Z, and that any element X ∈ L can be written in the form X =
Xi Pij Yj ,
where Pij ∈ A ,(i = 1, ..., p; j = 1, ..., q). Then any irreducible finite dimensional representation of the algebra L
has dimension at most (pq)(l+1)/2 (l + 1)(l+1)/2 .
Proof. If ρ : L → End(V ) is an irreducible representation, dim V = n, then ρ(Z) = C · 1 (by Schur’s Lemma),
dim ρ(L) = n2 (by Burnside’s theorem). By the conditions of Lemma 4,
dim ρ(L) ≤ pq dim ρ(A) ≤ pq (l + 1)n2−2/(l+1) .
Hence n2 ≤ pq(l + 1)n2−2/(l+1) , that is n ≤ (pq)(l+1)/2 (l + 1)(l+1)/2 .
Lemma 5. The Hecke algebra H(G, K) satisfies the conditions of Lemma 4.
For the proof see [Ber, Lemma]. We only note that l is the F -semi-simple rank of the group G and the numbers
p, q depend linearly on [K0 : K] where K0 is a maximal compact subgroup of G such that K ⊂ K0 . Let us
demonstrate the choices of p, q, xi , and yj in the case G = GLn (F ). Let O = {x ∈ F | |x| ≤ 1} and let ̟ be a
1

generator of the maximal ideal in O. Then K0 = GLn (O) is a maximal compact subgroup of G. Let K be a “good
enough” compact open subgroup of GLn (OF ), for example a congruence subgroup of GLn (OF ),
K = Km := {x ∈ G | ||1 − x|| ≤ ||̟||m } ,
where m ≥ 1 and ||x|| = max |xij |. In this case one can take aj (j = 1, ..., n − 1) to be a diagonal matrix, (aj )ii = 1
for i ≤ j and (aj )ii = ̟ for i > j and define Aj = 1Kaj K . Let Z be the algebra generated by 1Kg for g ∈ Z(G). Let
A be the algebra generated by Z and Aj , j = 1, ..., n − 1. Let p = q = [K0 : K], decompose K0 = ∪Kgi i = 1, ..., p
and choose xi = yi = 1Kgi K . The elements xi , yj , i, j = 1, ..., p and the algebras A, Z, and H(G, K) satisfy the
conditions of Lemma 4. As a consequence, we obtain
dim V K ≤ [GLn (OF ) : K]n · nn/2
for every irreducible representation (π, V ) of GLn (F ). This improves Bernstein’s bound

See [Ber] for more details. In the proof of Lemma 3 we need the following
Lemma 6. Let A ∈ Mn×n (C) be a nilpotent matrix and let m ≥ 1. Then

Proof. Suppose A = diag(Jl1 , Jl2 , ..., Jlk ) where Ji is a Jordan block of dimension i × i. The assertion AC = CA
for Cn×n = (Cij ) with Cij a block of dimension li × lk means
dim (Span {Am B | AB = BA}) ≤

Jli Cij = Cij Jlj .
The dimension spanned by such blocks is min(li , lj ). Let us call this dimension dij and note that
dij ≤

li lj

max(li , lj )

The matrix Am kills every Jordan cell of size ≤ m. Thus, the dimension of the vector space spanned by the matrices
of the form Am B less than

Proof of Lemma 3 . By a standard agrument, we can assume that the matrices A1 , ..., Al are nilpotent. Namely, let
us view the matrices A1 , ..., Al as operators on V = Cn . Since the algebra F is commutative, we can decompose the
space V into the direct sum of F -invariant subspaces Vj such that for every A ∈ F and every j, the eigenvalues of
A|Vj coincide. We can restrict ourselves to the case V = Vj , and substracting suitable constants from the operators
Ai , we may assume that all the Ai are nilpotent.
Let x < n2 , we will choose it later. Divide matrices of the form Aj11 Aj22 ...Ajl l into two families. One with ji < x for
every 1 ≤ i ≤ l and the other with at least one of the powers ji ≥ x. The first family consists of xl matrices. Let
us estimate the dimension of the subspace generated by the second family. Suppose j1 ≥ x. The number of linearly

independent matrices of the form Ax1 B where A1 B = BA1 is at most nx by Lemma 6. Thus dim F is bounded by
f (x) :=

ln2
+ xl .
x

The minimum is achieved for f ′ (x0 ) = 0, x0 = n2/(l+1) . We obtain
2

dim F ≤ ln2−2/(l+1) + n2l/(l+1) = (l + 1)n2− l+1 .
