Abstract
In this paper we investigate the critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (cFK) random map model. For each
q ∈ [0, ∞] and integer n ≥ 1, this model chooses a planar map of n edges with a probability
proportional to the partition function of critical q-Potts model on that map. Sheffield introduced
the hamburger-cheeseburger bijection which maps the cFK random maps to a family of random
words, and remarked that one can construct infinite cFK random maps using this bijection. We
make this idea precise by a detailed proof of the local convergence. When q = 1, this provides an
alternative construction of the UIPQ. In addition, we show that the limit is almost surely one-ended
and recurrent for the simple random walk for any q, and mutually singular in distribution for different
values of q.

Introduction

Planar maps. Random planar maps has been the focus of intensive research in recent years. We
refer to [1] for the physics background and motivations, and to [27] for a survey of recent results in
the field.
A finite planar map is a proper embedding of a finite connected graph into the two-dimensional
sphere, viewed up to orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. Self-loops and multiple edges are
allowed in the graph. In this paper we will not deal with non-planar maps, and thus we drop the
adjective “planar” sometimes. The faces of a map are the connected components of the complement
of the embedding in the sphere and the degree of a face is the number of edges incident to it. A map
is a triangulation (resp. a quadrangulation) if all of its faces are of degree three (resp. four). The
dual map M† of a planar map M has one vertex associated to each face of M and there is an edge
between two vertices if and only if their corresponding faces in M are adjacent.
A corner in a planar map is the angular section delimited by two consecutive half-edges around
a vertex. It can be identified with an oriented edge using the orientation of the sphere. A rooted
map is a map with a distinguished oriented edge or, equivalently, a corner. We call root edge the
distinguished oriented edge, and root vertex (resp. root face) the vertex (resp. face) incident to
the distinguished corner. Rooting a map on a corner (instead of the more traditional choice of
rooting on an oriented edge) allows a canonical choice of the root for the dual map: the dual root
is obtained by exchanging the root face and the root vertex. A subgraph of a planar map is a graph
consisting of a subset of its edges and all of its vertices. Given a subgraph G of a map M, the
dual subgraph of G, denoted by G† , is the subgraph of M† consisting of all the edges that do not
intersect G. Following the terminology in [6], we call subgraph-rooted map a rooted planar map with
a distinguished subgraph. Fig. 1(a) gives an example of a subgraph-rooted map with its dual map.

Local limit. For subgraph-rooted maps, the local distance is defined by

o

dloc ((M, G), (M0 , G0 )) = inf 2−R  R ∈ N, BR (M, G) = BR (M0 , G0 )

(1)

where BR (M, G), the ball of radius R in (M, G), is the subgraph-rooted map consisting of all vertices
of M at graph distance at most R from the root vertex and the edges between them. An edge of
BR (M, G) belongs to the distinguished subgraph of BR (M, G) if and only if it is in G. The space
of all finite subgraph-rooted maps is not complete with respect to dloc and we denote by M its
Cauchy completion. We call infinite subgraph-rooted map the elements of M which are not finite
subgraph-rooted map. Note that with this definition all infinite maps are locally finite, that is, every
vertex is of finite degree.
The study of infinite random maps goes back to the works of Angel, Benjamini and Schramm
on the Uniform Infinite Planar Triangulation (UIPT) [4, 2] obtained as the local limit of uniform

triangulations of size tending to infinity. Since then variants of this theorem have been proved for
different classes of maps [13, 25, 26, 15, 8]. A common point of the these infinite random lattices is
that they are constructed from the uniform distribution on some finite sets of planar maps. In this
work, we consider a different type of distribution.

cFK random map. For n ≥ 1 we write Mn for the set of all subgraph-rooted maps with n edges.
Recall that in a dual subgraph-rooted maps, the distinguished subgraph G and its dual subgraph
G† do not intersect. Therefore we can draw a set of loops tracing the boundary between them, as

By taking appropriate limits, we can define Qn for q ∈ {0, ∞}. A critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (cFK)

random map of size n and of parameter q is a random variable of law Qn (see Equation (5) below
for the connection with the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster model). From the definition of the

• (M, G) = (M† , G† ) in distribution,

So far two classes of methods have been developed to prove local convergence of finite random
maps. The first one, initially used in [2] is based on precise asymptotic enumeration formulas for
certain classes of maps. Although enumeration results about (a generalization of) cFK decorated
maps have been obtained using combinatorial techniques [24, 17, 7, 19, 11, 10, 9], we are not going to
follow this approach here. Instead, we will first transform our finite map model through a bijection
into simpler objects. The archetype of such bijection is the famous Cori-Vauqulin-Schaeffer bijection
and its generalizations [28, 12]. Then we take local limits of these simpler objects and construct the
limit of the maps directly from the latter. This technique has been used e.g. in [13, 15, 8]. In this
work the role of the Schaeffer bijection will be played by Sheffield’s hamburger-cheeseburger bijection
[29] which maps a cFK random map to a random word in a measure-preserving way. We will then
construct the local limit of cFK random maps by showing that the random word converges locally
to a limit, and that the hamburger-cheeseburger bijection has an almost surely continuous extension
for that limit.
The cFK random maps have also been the subject of the recent works [5] and [21, 22, 23]. These
works focused on finer properties of the infinite cFK random map such as exact scaling exponents
or scaling limit of the model. In particular, the scaling exponents associated with the length and
the enclosed area of a loop in the infinite cFK random map were derived independently. The main
purpose of the present paper is to prove the local convergence of finite cFK maps to the infinite

cFK map. We offer a detailed proof and construct explicitly the infinite-volume version of the
hamburger-cheeseburger bijection. The one-endedness and recurrence of the infinite cFK random
map are obtained as a by-product of this bijection. The fact that the joint law of (M, G) is mutually
singular for different q follows from the various scaling exponents computed in [5] and [21]. By
replacing the law of (M, G) by its marginal in M, we improve slightly the result. Our proof is based
on an ergodicity result of the cFK random maps, which is of independent interest (See Appendix A).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the law of the cFK random
map in more details and examine three interesting special cases. In Section 3 we first define the
random word model underlying the hamburger-cheeseburger bijection. Then we show that the model
has an explicit local limit, and we prove some properties of the limit. In Section 4 we construct the
hamburger-cheeseburger bijection and prove Theorem 1 by translating the properties of the infinite
random word in terms of the maps.

More on cFK random map

Let (M, G) be a subgraph-rooted map and denote by c(G) the number of connected components
in G. Recalling the definition of `(M, G) given in the introduction, it is not difficult to see that
`(M, G) = c(G) + c(G† ) − 1. However c(G† ) is nothing but the number of faces of G, therefore by
Euler’s relation we have
`(M, G) = e(G) + 2c(G) − v(M),
(4)
where e(G) is the number of edges G, and v(M) is the number of vertices in M. This gives the
(q)
following expression of the first marginal of Qn : for all rooted map M with n edges, we have
1 v(M) X √ e(G) c(G)
−2
Q(q)
q
q
.
(5)
n (M) ∝ q
G⊂M

The sum on the right-hand side over all the subgraphs of M is precisely the partition function of the
Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster model or, equivalenty, of the Potts model on the map M (The two
partition functions are equal. See e.g. [18, Section 1.4]. See also [9, Section 2.1] for a review of their
connection with loop models on planar lattices). For this reason, the cFK random map is used as a
model of quantum gravity theory in which the geometry of the space interacts with the matter (spins
1
in the Potts model). Note that the “temperature” in the Potts model and the prefactor q − 2 v(M) in
(5) are tuned to ensure self-duality, which is crucial for our result to hold.
Three values of the parameter q deserve special attention, since the cFK random map has nice
combinatorial interpretations in these cases.

q = 0: Q(0)
n is the uniform measure on the elements of Mn which minimize the number of loops
`. The minimum is `min = 1 and it is achieved if and only if the subgraph G is a spanning tree of
(0)
M. Therefore under Qn , the map M is chosen with probability proportional to the number of its
spanning trees, and conditionally on M, G is a uniform spanning tree of M.
(0)
At the limit, the marginal law of G under Q∞ will be that of a critical geometric Galton-Walton
tree conditioned to survive. This will be clear once we defined the hamburger-cheeseburger bijection.
In fact when q = 0, the hamburger-cheeseburger bijection is reduced to a bijection between treerooted maps and excursions of simple random walk on Z2 introduced earlier by Bernardi [6].
n
q = 1: Q(1)
n is the uniform measure on Mn . Since each planar map with n edges has 2 subgraphs,

M is a uniform planar map chosen among the maps with n edges. Thus in the case q = 1, Theorem
1 can be seen as a construction of the Uniform Infinite Planar Map or of the Uniform Infinite Planar
Quadrangulation via Tutte’s bijection. It is a curious fact that with this approach, one has to first
decorate a uniform planar map with a random subgraph in order to show the local convergence of
the map. As we will see later, the couple (M, G) is encoded by the hamburger-cheeseburger bijection
in an entangled way.

q = ∞: Similarly to the case q = 0, the probability Qn(∞) is the uniform measure on the elements

of Mn which maximize `. To see what are these elements, remark that each connected component
of G contains at least one vertex, therefore
c(G) ≤ v(M)

3

(6)

And, at least one edge must be removed from M to create a new connected component, so
c(G) ≤ c(M) + e(M) − e(G) = n + 1 − e(G)

(7)

Summing the two relations, we see that the maximal number of loops is `max = n+1 and it is achieved
if and only if each connected component of G contains exactly one vertex (i.e. all edges of G are
self-loops) and that the complementary subgraph M\G is a tree. Fig. 2(a) gives an example of such
couple (M, G).

Colors are used only to illutrate the bijection. (b) The percolation configuration on
a rooted tree associated to this map by the bijection. The divided vertices, as well
as the replaced edges, are drawn in the same color before and after the bijection.

This model of loop-decorated tree is in bijection with bond percolation of parameter 1/2 on a
uniform random plane tree with n edges, as we now explain. For a couple (M, G) satisfying the
above conditions, consider a self-loop e in G. This self-loop separates the rest of the map M into
two parts which share only the vertex of e. We divide this vertex in two, and replace the self-loop e
by an edge joining the two child vertices. The new edge is always considered part of G. By repeating
this operation for all self-loops in the subgraph G in an arbitrary order, we transform the map M
(∞)
into a rooted plane tree, see Fig. 2. This gives a bijection from the support of Qn to the set of
rooted plane tree of n edges with a distinguished subgraph. The latter object converges locally to
a critical geometric Galton-Watson tree conditioned to survive, in which each edge belongs to the
distinguished subgraph with probability 1/2 independently from other edges. Using the inverse of
(∞)
the bijection above (which is almost surely continuous at the limit), we can explicit the law Q∞ .
In particular, it is easily seen that M is almost surely a one-ended tree plus finitely many self-loops
at each vertex. Therefore it is one-ended and recurrent.

Local limit of random words

In this section we define the random word model underlying the hamburger-cheeseburger bijection,
and establish its local limit.
We consider words on the alphabet Θ = {a, b, A, B, F}. Formally, a word w is a mapping from an
interval I of integers to Θ. We write w ∈ ΘI and we call I the domain of w. Let W be the space of
all words, that is,
[ I
W=
Θ
(8)
I

where I runs over all subintervals of Z. Note that a word can be finite, semi-infinite or bi-infinite.
We denote by ∅ the empty word. Given a word w of domain I and k ∈ I, we denote by wk the letter
of index k in w. More generally, if J is an (integer or real) interval, we denote by wJ the restriction
of the word w to I ∩ J. For example, if w = bAbaFABa ∈ Θ{0,...,7} , then w[2,6) = baFA ∈ Θ{2,3,4,5} .
We endow W with the local distance

o

Dloc (w, w0 ) = inf 2−R  R ∈ N, w[−R,R) = w[−R,R)
(9)

Note that the equality w[−R,R) = w[−R,R)
implies that I ∩ [−R, R) = I 0 ∩ [−R, R), where I (resp. I 0 )
0
is the domain of the word w (resp. w ). It is easily seen that (W, Dloc ) is a compact metric space.

3.1

Reduction of words

Now we define the reduction operation on the words. For each word w, this operation specifies a
pairing between letters in the word called matching, and returns two shorter words wλ and wΛ .

4

We follow the exposition given in [29]. The letters a, b, A, B, F are interpreted as, respectively, a
hamburger, a cheeseburger, a hamburger order, a cheeseburger order and a flexible order. They obey
the following order fulfillment relation: a hamburger order A can only be fulfilled by a hamburger
a, a cheeseburger order B by a cheeseburger b, while a flexible order F can be fulfilled either by a
hamburger a or by a cheeseburger b. We write λ = {a, b} and Λ = {A, B, F} for the set of lowercase
letters (burgers) and uppercase letters (orders).

Finite case. A finite word w ∈ ΘI can be seen from left to right as a sequence of events that
happen in a restaurant with time indexed by I. Namely, at each time k ∈ I, either a burger is
produced, or an order is placed. The restaurant puts all its burgers on a stack S, and takes note of
unfulfilled orders in a list L. Both S and L start as the empty string. When a burger is produced, it
is appended at the end of the stack. When an order arrives, we check if it can be fulfilled by one of
the burgers in the stack. If so, we take the last such burger in the stack and fulfills the order. (That
is, the stack is last-in-first-out.) Otherwise, the order goes to the end of the list L. Fig. 3 illustrates
this dynamics with an example.

Figure 3: The reduction procedure of a word and the associated arch diagram
We encode the matching of w by a function φw : I → I ∪ {−∞, ∞}. If the burger produced at
time j is consumed by an order placed at time k, then the letters wj and wk are said to be matched,
and we set φw (j) = k and φw (k) = j. On the other hand, if a letter wk corresponds to a unfulfilled
order or a leftover burger, then it is unmatched, and we set φw (k) = ∞ if it is a burger (wk ∈ λ) and
φw (k) = −∞ if it is an order (wk ∈ Λ).
Moreover, let us denote by wΛ (resp. wλ ) the state of the list L (resp. the stack S) at the end of
the day. Together they give the reduced form of the word w.
Definition 2 (reduced word). The reduced word associated to a finite word w is the concatenation
w = wΛ wλ . That is, it is the list of unmatched uppercase letters in w, followed by the list of
unmatched lowercase letters in w.
The matching and the reduced word can be represented as an arch diagram as follows. For each
letter wj in the word w, draw a vertex in the complex plane at position j. For each pair of matched
letters wj and wk , draw a semi-circular arch that links the corresponding pair of vertices. This arch
is drawn in the upper half plane if it is incident to an a-vertex, and in the lower half plane if it is
incident to a b-vertex. For an unmatched letter wj , we draw an open arch from j tending to the left
if φw (j) = −∞, or to the right if φw (j) = ∞. See Fig. 3.
It should be clear from the definition of matching operation that the arches in this diagram
do not intersect each other. We shall come back to this diagram in Section 4 to construct the
hamburger-cheeseburger bijection.

Infinite case. Remark that a hamburger produced at time j is consumed by a hamburger order
at time k > j if and only if 1) all the hamburgers produced during the interval [j + 1, k − 1] are
consumed strictly before time k, and 2) all the hamburger or flexible orders placed during [j +1, k −1]
are fulfilled by a burger produced strictly after time j. In terms of the reduced word, this means
that two letters wj = a and wk = A are matched if and only if w(j,k) does not contain any a, A or F.
This can be generalized to any pair of burger/order.
Proposition 3 ([29]). For j < k, assume that wj ∈ λ and wk ∈ Λ can be matched. Then they are
matched in w if and only if w(j,k) does not contain any letter that can be matched to either wj or
wk .
This shows that the matching rule is entirely determined by the reduction operator. More importantly, we see that the matching rule is local, that is, whether φw (j) = k or not only depends on
w[j,k] . From this we deduce that the reduction operator is compatible with string concatenation,
that is, uv = uv = uv for any pair of finite words u, v.
This locality property allows us to define φw for infinite words w. Then, we can also read wλ
(resp. wΛ ) from φw as the (possibly infinite) sequence of unmatched lowercase (resp. uppercase)
letters. However w is not defined in general, since the concatenation wΛ wλ does not always make
sense.

Here p should be interpreted as the proportion of flexible orders among all the orders. Remark that,

We follow the approach proposed by Sheffield in [29, Section 4.2]. Let W (p) be a random word of

law P∞ , so that W[0,n) is a word of length n with i.i.d. letters. By compactness of (W, Dloc ), it
(p)

(p)

suffices to show that for any ball Bloc in this space, we have Pn (Bloc ) −→ P∞ (Bloc ). Note that
Dloc is an ultrametric and the ball Bloc (w, 2−R ) of radius 2−R around w is the set of words which
are identical to w when restricted to [−R, R). In the rest of the proof, we fix an integer R ≥ 1 and a
(p)
word w ∈ Θ[−R,R)∩Z . Recall that W (p) has law P∞ . In the following we omit the parameter p from
the superscripts to keep simple notations.


	
Recall that the space Wn is made up of 2n copies of the set w ∈ Θ2n  w = ∅ differing from each
other by translation of the indices. Therefore Pn can be seen as the conditional law of W[−K,2n−K) on
the event {W[−K,2n−K) = ∅}, where K is a uniform random variable on {0, . . . , 2n − 1} independent
from W . Moreover, for the word W[−K,2n−K) to have w as its restriction to [−R, R), one must to
have R ≤ K ≤ 2n − R. Hence,

Some properties of the limiting random word

In this section we show two properties of the infinite random word W (p) which will be the wordcounterpart of Theorem 1. Both properties are true for general p ∈ [0, 1]. However we will only write
proofs for p < 1, since the case p = 1 corresponds to cFK random maps with parameter q = ∞, for
which the local limit is explicit. (The proofs for p = 1 are actually easier, but they require different
arguments.)
Proposition 5 (Sheffield [29]). For all p ∈ [0, 1], almost surely,
1. W (p) = ∅, that is, every letter in W (p) is matched.
(p)

λ

Proof. The first assertion is proved as Proposition 2.2 in [29]. For the second assertion, recall that

all the N + 1 letters in W[k,k+N ] are A. This will leave the A at position k + N unmatched in W ,
which happens with zero probability according to the first assertion. This gives a contradiction when
p < 1.

By Proposition 5, Zk is almost surely well-defined for all k ∈ Z. A lot of information about the
random word W can be read from Z. The main result of [29] shows that under diffusive rescaling, Z
converges to a Brownian motion in R2 with a diffusivity matrix that depends on p, demonstrating a
phase transition at p = 1/2.
Let (X, Y ) = Z. Then X represents the net hamburger count and Y the net cheeseburger count.
Set i0 = sup {i < 0 | Xi = −1} and j0 = inf {j > 0 | Xj = −1}. Let N0 be the number of times that
X visits the state 0 between time i0 and j0 . We shall see in Section 4.2 that N0 is exactly the degree
of root vertex in the infinite cFK-random map. Below we prove that the distribution of N0 has an
exponential tail, that is, there exists constants A and c > 0 such that P(N0 ≥ x) ≤ Ae−cx for all
x ≥ 0.
Proposition 6. N0 has an exponential tail distribution for all p ∈ [0, 1].
Proof. First let us consider N0+ , the number of times that X visits the state 0 between time 0 and
j0 . Remark that at positive time, the process X is adapted to the natural filtration (Fk )k≥0 , where

Fk is the σ-algebra generated by W[0,k) . Define two sequences of F-stopping times (Sm )m≥0 and

Therefore the total number of visits of the state 0 between time 0 and Tm is
i=0 (Ti − Si ), see

On the other hand, M is the smallest m such that, starting from time Sm , an A comes before an a.
Therefore M is a geometric random variable of mean 1−p

Assume p < 1 so that M is almost surely finite. Fix an integer m ≥ 0. By the strong Markov
property, conditionally to {M = m}, the sequence (Ti − Si , i = 0 . . . m − 1) is i.i.d., and each term
in the sequence has the same law as the first arrival time of a in the sequence (Wk )k≥0 conditioned
not to contain A. In other words, conditionally to {M = m}, (Ti − Si , i = 0 . . . m − 1) is an i.i.d.

+

Then, a direct computation shows that the exponential moment E[eλN0 ] is finite for some γ > 0.
And by Markov’s inequality, the distribution of N0+ has an exponential tail when p < 1.
Now we claim that conditionally to the value of N0 , the variable N0+ is uniform on {1, . . . , N0 }
which implies that N0 also has an exponential tail distribution. To see why the conditional law is
(p)
uniform, consider N0 and N0+ for finite words defined in the same way as for the infinite word W∞ .
Note that for a finite word w the process X does not necessarily hit −1 at negative (resp. positive)
times. In this case we just replace i0 (resp. j0 ) by the infimum (resp. supremum) of the domain
of w. Then, w 7→ (N0 , N0+ ) is a Dloc -continuous function defined on the union of ∪n≥0 Wn and the

The hamburger-cheeseburger bijection
Construction

In this section we present (a slight variant of) the hamburger-cheeseburger bijection of Sheffield. We
refer to [29] for the proof of bijectivity and for historical notes.

e on a subset of the space W, and it takes values
We define the hamburger-cheeseburger bijection Ψ
f of doubly-rooted planar maps with a distinguished subgraph, that is, planar maps with
in the space M
two distinguished corners and one distinguished subgraph. We can write this space as
f = {(M, G, s) | (M, G) ∈ M and s is a corner of M}
M

Note that the second root s may be equal to or different from the root of M. We define in the same
fn , the doubly-rooted version of the space Mn . Its cardinal is 2n times that of Mn .
way M
e : Wn → M
fn in three steps. The first step transforms a word in Wn
We start by constructing Ψ
into a decorated planar map called arch graph. The second and the third step apply graph duality
and local transformations to the arch graph to get a tree-rooted map, and then a subgraph-rooted
fn .
map in M

Step 1: from words to arch graphs. Fix a word w ∈ Wn . Recall from Section 3 the
construction of the non-crossing arch diagram associated to w. In particular since w = ∅, there is
no half-arch. We link neighboring vertices by unit segments [j − 1, j] and link the first vertex to the
last vertex by an edge that wires around the whole picture on either side of the real axis, without
intersecting any other edges. This defines a planar map A of 2n vertices and 2n edges. In A we
distinguish edges coming from arches and the other edges. The latter forms a simple loop passing
through all the vertices.
We further decorate A with additional pieces of information. Recall that the word w is indexed
by an interval of the form Ik = {−k, . . . , 2n − 1 − k} where 0 ≤ k < 2n. We will mark the oriented
edge r from the vertex 0 to the vertex −1, and the oriented edge s from the first vertex (−k) to the
last vertex (2n − 1 − k). If k = 0, then r and s coincide. Furthermore, we mark each arch incident
to an F-vertex by a star ∗. (See Fig. 5) We call the decorated planar map A the arch graph of w.
One can check that it completely determines the underlying word w.

Step 2: from arch graphs to tree-rooted maps. We now consider the dual map ∆ of the
arch graph A. Let Q be the subgraph of ∆ consisting of edges whose dual edge is on the loop in
A. We denote by ∆\Q the set of remaining edges of ∆ (that is, the edges intersecting one of the
arches).
Proposition 7. The map ∆ is a triangulation, the map Q is a quadrangulation with n faces and
∆\Q consists of two trees.
We denote by T and T† the two trees in ∆\Q, with T corresponding to faces of the arch graph
in the upper half plane. Then Q, T and T† form a partition of edges in the triangulation ∆. Note
that T and T† give the (unique) bipartition of vertices of Q. Let M be the planar map associated to
Q by Tutte’s bijection, such that M has the same vertex set as T. (The latter prescription allows us
to bypass the root, and define Tutte’s bijection from unrooted quadrangulations to unrooted maps.)
We thus obtain a couple (M, T) in which M is a map with n edges and T is spanning tree of M.
Remark that T† is the dual spanning tree of T in the dual map M† . This relates the duality of maps
with the duality on words which consists of exchanging a with b and A with B.
Fig. 5(a) summarizes the mapping from words to tree-rooted maps (Step 1 and 2) with an
example. Note that we have omitted the two roots and the stars on the arch graph in the above
discussion. But since graph duality and Tutte’s bijection provide canonical bijections between edges,
the roots and stars can be simply transferred from the arches in A to the edges in M. With the roots
and stars taken into account, it is clear that w 7→ (M, T) is a bijection from Wn onto its image.

Step 3: from tree-rooted maps to subgraph-rooted maps. Now we “switch the status”
of every starred edge in M relative to the spanning tree T. That is, if a starred edge is not in T, we
add it to T; if it is already in T, we remove it from T. Let G be the resulting subgraph. See Fig.
5(b) for an example.
Recall that there are two marked corners r and s in the map M. By an abuse of notation,
from now on we denote by M the rooted map with root corner r. Then, the hamburger-cheeseburger
e
bijection is defined by Ψ(w)
= (M, G, s). Let Ψ(w) = (M, G) be its projection obtained by forgetting
the second root corner. We denote by (#F)w the number of letters F in w, and by ` the number of
loops associated to the corresponding subgraph-rooted map (M, G).
e : Wn → M
fn is a bijection such that ` = 1 + (#F)w for

Proposition 9. We can extend the mapping Ψ to W → M so that it is P∞ -almost surely continuous
with respect to Dloc and dloc , for all p ∈ [0, 1].
Proof. Observe that if we do not care about the location of the second root s, then the word w used
in the construction of Ψ does not have to be finite. Set



 w = ∅ and for all k ∈ Z, w(−∞,k) λ contains
W∞ = w ∈ ΘZ 
(20)
infinitely many a and infinitely many b
We claim that indeed, for each w ∈ W∞ , Step 1, 2 and 3 of the construction define a (locally finite)
infinite subgraph-rooted map: as in the case of finite words, the condition w = ∅ ensures that the
arch graph A of w is a well-defined infinite planar map (that is, all the arches are closed). To see
that its dual map ∆ is a locally finite, infinite triangulation, we only need to check that each face of
A has finite degree. Observe that a letter a in w appears in w(−∞,k) λ if and only if it is on the left of
wk , and that its partner is on the right of wk . This corresponds to an arch passing above the vertex
k. Therefore, the remaining condition in the definition of W∞ says that there are infinitely many
arches which pass above and below each vertex of A. This guarantees that A has no unbounded
face. The rest of the construction consists of local operations only. So the resulting subgraph-rooted
map (M, G) = Ψ(w) is a locally finite subgraph-rooted map.

Also, by Proposition

S 5, we have P∞ (W

continuous on W = n Wn ∪ W∞ . Let w(n) , w ∈ W 0 so that w(n) → w for Dloc . If w is finite, there
is nothing to prove. Otherwise, let (M, G) = Ψ(w) and consider a ball B of finite radius r around
the root in the map M. By locality of the mapping ∆
M, the ball B can be determined by a
ball B 0 of finite radius r0 (which may depend on M) in ∆. But each triangle in ∆ corresponds to a
(n)
letter in the word, so there exists r00 (which may depend on M) such that if w[−r00 ,r00 ] = w[−r00 ,r00 ]
0
then the balls of radius r in ∆ coincide. This proves that Ψ is continuous on W∞ .

4.2

Proof of Theorem 1

Combining Proposition 4, Theorem 8 and Proposition 9 yields the convergence statement of the
theorem. The self-duality of the infinite cFK random map follows from the finite self-duality. It
remains to show that the infinite cFK random maps are almost surely one-ended and recurrent for
all q, and that their laws are mutually singular for different values of q.

One-endedness. Recall that a graph G = (V, E) is said to be one-ended if for any finite subset
of vertices U, V\U has exactly one infinite connected component. We will prove that for a word
w ∈ W∞ , Ψ(w) is one-ended. Let A (resp. ∆) be the arch graph (resp. triangulation) associated to
w, and let (M, G) = Ψ(w). By the second condition in the definition of W∞ (see (20)), there exist
arches that connect vertices on the left of w−R to vertices on the right of wR for any finite number
R. Therefore the arch graph A is one-ended. It is then an easy exercise to deduce from this that the
triangulation ∆ and then the map M are also one-ended.
Recurrence. To prove the recurrence of M we use the general criterion established by Gurel(q)

Gurevich and Nachmias [20]. Notice first that under Qn , the random maps are uniformly rooted,
that is, conditionally on the map, the root vertex ρ is chosen with probability proportional to its
degree. By [20] it thus suffices to check that the distribution of deg(ρ) has an exponential tail. For
this we claim that the variable N0 studied in Lemma 6 exactly corresponds to the degree of the root
in an infinite cFK random map. From the construction of the hamburger-cheeseburger bijection, we
see that the vertices of the map M corresponds to the faces of the arch graph in the upper half plane.
In particular, the root vertex ρ corresponds to the face above the interval [−1, 0], and deg(ρ) is the
number of unit intervals on the real axis which are also on the boundary of this face. On the other
hand, Xk is the net number of arches that one enters to get from the face above [−1, 0] to the face
above [k − 1, k], see Fig. 6. So N0 exactly counts the above number of intervals.

Mutual singularity. The basic idea is to construct a measurable function f on infinite rooted
planar maps such that f (M) is almost surely constant for each q ∈ [0, ∞], and that f (M) = f (q) is
an injective function of q. One such function can be defined as follows. Consider the simple random

Ergodicity of cFK random maps

Here we use the framework set up by Benjamini and Curien in [3] and we follow the exposition in [14,
−
→
Sec 3.1]. Consider the space M of all locally finite rooted maps endowed with a path ~e = (~en )n≥0
−
→
starting from the root edge. Let d~loc be the natural local distance on M

n
o

d~loc ((M, ~e), (M0 , ~e 0 )) = inf 2−R  BR (M) = BR (M0 ) and ~ek = ~e 0k for 0 ≤ k ≤ R
and consider the associated Borel σ-algebra. If M is a rooted map, let QM be the law of the simple
random walk starting from the root edge of M. We denote by Q ⊗ Q the probability measure
Z
Q ⊗ Q(A) = QM (AM ) Q(d M)
−
→
on M, where AM = {(~en )n≥0 | (M, (~en )n≥0 ) ∈ A}. To simplify notation, we will write QM (A) instead
of QM (AM ) in the sequel.
If ~e is an oriented edge of M, we write M|~e for the map obtained by re-rooting M at ~e. Observe
~ n )n≥0 ) is a random variable of law Q ⊗ Q, then
that if (M, (E
M = M|E~ 1
in distribution. (Remark that the left-hand-side is the same as M|E~ 0 .) This is a consequence of the
fact that M is the local limit of a sequence of uniformly rooted finite maps. It follows that the shift
operator
τ : (M, (~en )n≥0 ) 7→ (M|~e1 , (~en+1 )n≥0 )
preserves the measure Q ⊗ Q.
Proposition 10. The shift operator τ is ergodic for Q ⊗ Q.
Proof. Let A be a τ -invariant event for Q ⊗ Q, that is, Q ⊗ Q(A∆τ −1 (A)) = 0, where ∆ denotes the
symmetric difference: A∆B = (A\B) ∪ (B\A). We do the proof in three steps:
(a) Q-almost surely, QM (A) ∈ {0, 1}.
Recall that the simple random walk on M is Q-almost surely recurrent. Therefore, it can be decomposed into an i.i.d. sequence of excursions from the root edge. An event invariant by τ is also
invariant by the shift operator associated to this i.i.d. sequence. Thus (a) follows from Kolmogorov’s
zero-one law.
(b) Q-almost surely, the value of QM (A) is invariant under any re-rooting of the map M.
First let us fix a rooted map M. Let x be the vertex to which the root edge points. Denote by d
the degree of x, and ρ
~1 , . . . , ρ
~d the d oriented edges that point away from x. We deduce from the
Markov property of the simple random walk that

But according to (a), QM (A) and QM|ρ~ (A) (k = 1, . . . , d) are either 0 or 1. Thus Q-almost surely,
k
QM (A) = 1 if and only if for all k = 1, . . . , d, QM|ρ~ (A) = 1. In other words, the value of QM (A)
k
is unchanged when re-rooting at a neighbor of the root edge. But since the maps are connected, we
obtain (b) by iterating the above argument.

12

(c) If an event Â on the space of (locally finite) rooted maps is Q-almost surely invariant under
re-rooting, then Q(Â) ∈ {0, 1}.
Consider the measure-preserving mapping Φ̂ : w 7→ M, where (M, G) = Φ(w) for some subgraph G.
Via this mapping, a translation of indices in a word w give rise to a re-rooting of the corresponding
map M. Therefore if an event Â is Q-almost surely invariant under re-rooting, then Φ̂−1Â is Palmost surely invariant under translation of the indices. But, under P the letters of w are i.i.d.
random variables, so we have Q(Â) = P(Φ̂−1 Â) ∈ {0, 1}.
Finally, considering Â = {M : QM (A) = 1} shows that Q ⊗ Q(A) ∈ {0, 1}, as desired.

Remark. Only the step (c) of the proof uses specific features of the cFK random maps, namely,
their representation by an i.i.d. sequence of letters. For any infinite random map whose law is
stationary under τ , the proof of (a) and (b) goes through provided that the random map is almost
surely recurrent. (Note that the proof of (b) depends on (a).) The case of almost surely transient
random maps was treated in [14, Prop. 10]. There, (a) was proved under the following reversibility
−
condition: if ←
e is the root edge of M, oriented in the opposite direction, then

in distribution. And (b) was replaced by the following variant, which follows directly from the
transience of the map.
(b’) Almost surely, QM (A) is unchanged by any finite modification of the map M.
