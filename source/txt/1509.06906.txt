A BSTRACT. We prove that a real analytic pseudo-rotation f of the
disc or the sphere is never topologically mixing. When the rotation number of f is of Brjuno type, the latter follows from a KAM
theorem of Rüssmann on the stability of real analytic elliptic fixed
points. In the non-Brjuno case, we prove that a pseudo-rotation
of class C k , k ≥ 2, is C k−1 -rigid using the simple observation, derived from Franks’ Lemma on free discs, that a pseudo-rotation
with small rotation number compared to its C1 (or Hölder) norm
must be close to Identity.
From our result and a structure theorem by Franks and Handel
(on zero entropy surface diffeomorphisms) it follows that an analytic conservative diffeomorphism of the disc or the sphere that is
topologically mixing must have positive topological entropy.
In our proof we need an a priori limit on the growth of the
derivatives of the iterates of a pseudo-rotation that we obtain via
an effective finite information version of the Katok closing lemma
for an area preserving surface diffeomorphism f , that provides a
controlled gap in the possible growth of the derivatives of f between exponential and sub-exponential.

1. I NTRODUCTION
It is a known fact that smooth dynamical systems may display
very wild dynamical behavior. The problem of differentiable realization, that consists of finding smooth dynamical systems on compact
manifolds that are isomorphic to a given arbitrary abstract measurable dynamical system (with finite entropy), is wide open. In the
one dimensional setting, that is on the circle, smooth realizations are
clearly limited since a circle diffeomorphism that preserves a smooth
measure is smoothly conjugated to a rotation. Apart from that, the
only case where an obstruction to smooth realization is known to
exist is in surface dynamics, where Pesin theory asserts that an ergodic area preserving diffeomorphism of class C2 that has a positive
metric entropy must be isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift [13]. For zero

entropy systems, no obstruction to smooth realization is known to
exist apart from the one dimensional case.
In the setting of area preserving (or conservative) two dimensional
disc or sphere diffeomorphisms, that will be our interest here, some
analogies with circle diffeomorphisms push in the direction of finding obstructions to smooth realization, even in the zero entropy case.
Among these analogies, is the fact that a rotation set can be defined
for an area preserving disc or sphere diffeomorphism f and if this
set contains rationals then f must have periodic points [6]. Another
one is that if the rotation number of f at some elliptic fixed point
or on the boundary of the disc is Diophantine, then the smooth linearization phenomenon of circle diffeomorphisms with Diophantine
rotation number extends to a neighborhood of the fixed point or the
boundary [16, 10]. We will see in the sequel how these analogies
influence the smooth realization problem.
On the other hand, examples of smooth dynamical systems with
a rich variation of ergodic properties were constructed on the disc
and the sphere. Katok constructed a smooth conservative map of
the disc that is isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift [12]. His example, that
is based on slowing down fixed points of an Anosov automorphism
of the two torus before projecting down the dynamics on the sphere,
can be made real analytic if the slowing down is chosen adequately.
On the zero entropy side, the Anosov-Katok construction method
[1] via successive conjugations of rational rotations provided a multitude of constructions with various ergodic properties, starting with
the first examples of smooth ergodic conservative diffeomorphisms
on the disc or the sphere. The method also yields weak mixing systems, but all the smooth examples on the disc or the sphere obtained
up to now were C ∞ -rigid by construction. A diffeomorphism of class
C k , k ∈ N ∪ {∞}, is said to be C k -rigid if there exists a sequence qn
such that f qn converges to the Identity map in the C k topology. If
we only know that the latter holds in a fixed neighborhood of some
point p, we say that f is C k locally rigid at p. Obviously, rigidity or local rigidity precludes mixing. Hence, the following natural question
was raised in [8] in connection with the smooth realization problem
and the Anosov-Katok construction method.
Question 1. Does there exist a smooth area preserving diffeomorphism of the disc that is mixing with zero metric entropy? with zero
topological entropy?
We will show here that

Theorem A. Area preserving real analytic diffeomorphisms of the
disc or the sphere that are topologically mixing have positive topological entropy.
A homeomorphism f of a metric space X is said to be topologically
mixing if for any non empty open sets A and B there exists N ≥ 0
such that for any n ≥ N, f n ( A) ∩ B 6= ∅.
Observe that the existence of mixing homeomorphisms of the
sphere (or the disc) with zero metric entropy follows from Katok’s
construction of an area preserving ergodic diffeomorphism f of the
sphere with positive entropy [12]. Indeed, f as constructed in [12] is
isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift T, and it is possible to construct using this isomorphism a mixing invariant measure for T with zero entropy that gives a positive mass to every cylinder. The almost product structure of stable and unstable leaves of f then imply that the
constructed measure assigns a positive mass to every open set in the
sphere. Applying Oxtoby and Ulam’s lemma, we get a C0 conjugacy
to a mixing conservative homeomorphism of S2 with zero metric entropy.
We recall that on the other end of the regularity spectrum, the real
analytic category, nothing is known, apart from Theorem A, about
the possible dynamical properties of disc and sphere area preserving
zero entropy diffeomorphisms. The following natural question is
wide open (see [8, 9] and discussion therein).
Question 2. Does there exist real analytic area preserving diffeomorphisms of the disc or the sphere with zero metric entropy that are
transitive? ergodic?
2. P SEUDO - ROTATIONS
2.1. Analytic pseudo-rotations are locally rigid. We denote the unit
disc in R2 by D = {( x, y) ∈ R2 : x2 + y2 ≤ 1}. A homeomorphism
of D that preserves Lebesgue measure, fixes the origin, and has no
other periodic points is called a pseudo-rotation. The fixed point at the
origin is then necessarily elliptic with irrational rotation number and
this rotation number modulo 1 is denoted by ρ( f ) since every point
of the disc must have the same rotation number around the origin
(see for example [5, Corollary 2.6] or [6, Theorem 3.3]).
All constructions of transitive smooth area preserving diffeomorphisms on D by the Anosov-Katok method are pseudo-rotations with
a Liouville rotation number. That the rotation number must be Liouville follows from Herman’s last geometric Theorem asserting that

4

A. AVILA, B. FAYAD, P. LE CALVEZ, D. XU, Z. ZHANG

if this is not the case, then the center and the boundary are accumulated by invariant closed curves which clearly excludes transitivity
[10].
On the other hand, the structure Theorem by Franks and Handel for area preserving diffeomorphisms of genus zero surfaces with
zero topological entropy shows that transitivity in this case implies
that the diffeomorphism must be a pseudo-rotation [7]. Indeed, they
show that if F is an area preserving diffeomorphism of the sphere
with at least three fixed points and if M = S2 − Fix( F ) then an open
and dense set W ⊂ M (of points with a weak type of recurrence
called weakly free disc recurrent points) decomposes into a countable
union of disjoint invariant annuli on which the dynamics of F is similar to an integrable map albeit with possibly complicated sets (such
as pseudo-circles) for the constant rotation number sets instead of
nice simple closed curves. This decomposition clearly excludes transitivity of F, hence transitive area preserving diffeomorphisms on D
must belong to the class of pseudo-rotations, and to prove Theorem
A, we are reduced to the pseudo-rotation case.
In the case of real analytic pseudo-rotations we indeed show more
than the absence of mixing.
Theorem B. Real analytic pseudo-rotations of D are C ∞ locally rigid
around the center.
Bramham already showed in [2] that smooth pseudo-rotations with
super-Liouville rotation number are C0 -rigid. Our proof of Theorem B, gives a very simple proof of the latter result based on Frank’s
free disc Lemma related to Brower’s theory of fixed point free planar homeomorphisms (see Theorem 1 and comments thereafter). To
cover pseudo-rotations with non-Brjuno type rotation numbers, we
need an additional a priori control on the growth of the derivatives of
the iterates of a pseudo-rotation that we obtain via an effective finite
information version of the Katok closing lemma for area preserving
surface diffeomorphisms.

To get C0 -rigidity, we only require Lipschitz regularity of the pseudorotation in the case of super-Liouville rotation number and C2 in the
non-Brjuno case. As we will see in the sequel, our direct approach
to rigidity of pseudo-rotation cannot go much beyond non-Brjuno
type numbers (for example to include all Liouville numbers). To
bridge up with the numbers that are of Brjuno type, we use the KAM
(Kolmogorov Arnol’d Moser) result of Rüssmann that asserts that
an elliptic fixed point, that is precisely of Brjuno type, of an analytic
area preserving surface diffeomorphism is surrounded by invariant
curves [16], which in the case of pseudo-rotations yields local rigidity. This is where the real analytic hypothesis is necessary in Theorem B.
It is worth mentioning here (see also Question 2) that no examples of real analytic pseudo-rotations are yet available. Of course,
if Birkhoff’s conjecture that such examples do not exist turns out to
be true, then the content of Theorem B is void. This however, would
not affect our study of rigidity of pseudo-rotations with well approximated rotation numbers since our results hold in low regularity. We
now proceed to the precise statements in this context.
2.2. Rigidity in the non-Brjuno case. Our main rigidity result for
pseudo-rotations is the following.
Theorem 1. If f is a C k , k ≥ 2, pseudo-rotation of D with rotation number
α = ρ( f ) that is not of Brjuno type, then f is C k−1 -rigid : There exists a
q
subsequence qn j of the sequence qn (α) such that f n j → IdD in the C k−1
topology.
When the rotation number is well approximated by rationals we
do not need too much regularity to show rigidity of a pseudo-rotation.
Indeed, for pseudo-rotations with super-Liouville rotation numbers
we have the following rigidity result in which the case Hölder with
exponent a = 1 corresponds to Lipschitz maps.
Theorem 2. If f is a pseudo-rotation of the disc D that is Hölder with
exponent a ∈ (0, 1] and if α = ρ( f ) satisfies
1 qn
lim sup q−
n a ln qn+1 = + ∞
q

then f n j → IdD in the uniform topology for any sequence n j such that
q
lim qn j −1 a n j ln qn j +1 = +∞.
For any given modulus of continuity, we can by the same method
obtain arithmetic criteria that imply rigidity of a pseudo-rotation
with this modulus of continuity.

Theorems 1 and 2 generalize an earlier result by Bramham [2]. Our
proof is much more elementary than Bramham’s proof that relies on
the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves. The essential idea in our
proof is that if a pseudo-rotation f has a rotation number that is small
compared to k D f k−2 then f must be close to the Identity, because
otherwise f would have a periodic point outside the origin which is
a contradiction. The proof of the latter fact is based on a simple observation that combines Franks’ free disc lemma with Kac’s lemma
to give a lower bound on the measure of free topological discs of a
pseudo-rotation with a small rotation number (see Lemma 3.1 and
Corollary A in Section 3). The rigidity for super-Liouville pseudorotations then follows immediately since k D f q k is at most exponential in q. To obtain the rigidity of non-Brjuno numbers, we need a
better bound than exponential on the growth of k D f qn k. That such
a bound exists a priori for pseudo-rotations, and more generally for
any surface area preserving C2 diffeomorphism of a surface without
hyperbolic periodic points, is provided by an effective finite information version of the Katok closing lemma for area preserving surface diffeomorphisms with some hyperbolic behavior. The following result that
gives a quantitative gap in the growth of k D f m k between exponential and sub-exponential for an area preserving disc diffeomorphism
of class C2 is sufficient, and almost necessary, to prove rigidity for
non-Brjuno rotation numbers.
Theorem C. For any compact subset K ⊂ Diff2vol (S), there exists 0 <
θ < 1, integer H > 0 satisfying the following property: Let {qn } be a
sequence such that q0 ≥ H, qn ≥ H qn−1 , if for some f ∈ K there exists
n ≥ 0 such that
1
(2.1)
log k D f qn k > θ n ,
qn
then f has a hyperbolic periodic point.
Observe that our result implies that in case (2.1) holds for some n,
then actually lim supn q1n log k D f qn k > 0, hence establishing a gap in
the possible rate of growth of k D f n k. In spirit, our approach gives an
effective instance of what Katok described as Anosov and Bowen’s
observation ”that assuming some hyperbolicity conditions, dynamical phenomena which are observed to almost occur for some diffeomorphisms usually do occur for that diffeomorphism” [12, Introduction].
Note that a finite information version of the Katok closing lemma
was given by Climenhaga and Pesin in [3] that relies on the notion of

ON MIXING DIFFEOMORPHISMS OF THE DISK

effective hyperbolicity. A piece of orbit being called essentially hyperbolic if along this piece there are nicely behaving stable and unstable
directions for the differential in the sense that expansion along the
unstable direction dominates the defect from domination over the
contracted direction and dominates also the decay of the angles between the directions under iteration.
Since we want a finitary version of the closing lemma that only
involves the growth of derivatives we prefer to give an independent
statement from [3], with a proof that takes some ideas from [3], but
differs in that the condition of conservation of area is used to control a posteriori the angles as soon as contraction and expansion are
controlled. In the general setting of [3], it is not assumed that the
maps are area preserving surface diffeomorphisms. Also, our proof
does not use graph transforms but rather follows the orbit of a small
box along a selected piece of orbit (a kind of effectively hyperbolic
piece of orbit) and shows that the return of the box to its neighborhood enjoys hyperbolic-like properties that force the existence of a
hyperbolic periodic point (see Section 4).
We will give the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 in Section 3. Theorem
C, that is of independent interest and of independent flavor from the
rest of the paper is discussed and proven in Section 4.
Note that Theorem B has an interesting consequence on the C ∞
centralizer of an analytic pseudo-rotation f (smooth diffeomorphisms
that commute with f ), since it immediately implies that the latter is
always uncountable. Similarly, Theorem 1 shows that the C k−1 centralizer of a C k pseudo-rotation f with rotation number that is not
of Brjuno type is uncountable. This shows that real analytic conservative diffeomorphisms of the disc, or smooth non-Brjuno pseudo
rotations are in this extent less flexible than smooth circle diffeomorphisms for which Yoccoz constructed smooth examples with a C ∞
centralizer that is reduced to the powers of the diffeomorphism [17].
We observe that it is not known if there exists real analytic examples
of the latter construction of Yoccoz.
2.3. Local rigidity around the center in the Brjuno type case. To go
from Theorem 1 to Theorem B we use a KAM result of Rüssmann,
that does not require any twist condition, and allows to deal with the
pseudo-rotations having Brjuno type rotation numbers.
Theorem 3 (Rüssmann). If f is an area preserving real analytic map defined in some open neighborhood of 0 ∈ R2 , and if f (0) = 0 and the
rotation number α of f at 0 is of Brjuno type, then 0 is surrounded by a

8

A. AVILA, B. FAYAD, P. LE CALVEZ, D. XU, Z. ZHANG

positive measure set of real analytic invariant closed simple curves. If f has
no periodic points accumulating 0 then f is analytically conjugated to the
disc rotation Rα in some neighborhood of 0.
Theorem B is then an immediate consequence of Rüssmann’s Theorem (in the Brjuno type case) and our rigidity result of Theorem 1
(in the non-Brjuno type case).
Actually, if in Rüssmann’s Theorem f is in addition supposed to
be a pseudo-rotation close to the rotation Rα , it holds that f is analytically conjugated to Rα and a fortiori C ω -rigid (see Corollary 1 in
[10] and its proof). Thus we get the following local result, in which
the notation | · |δ stands for the sup norm inside the analyticity band
of width δ.
Corollary A. For any α ∈ R − Q and any δ > 0, there exists ε(δ, α) >
0 such that if f is a real analytic pseudo-rotation with rotation number
ρ( f ) = α and if
| f − Rα |δ ≤ ε(δ, α)
then f is C ∞ -rigid.
Remark 2.1. Observe that ε(δ, α) essentially depends on δ and ∑ ln(qn+1 )/qn
where qn = qn (α) and that ε(δ, ∞) = ∞ by Theorem 1.
We conclude this introduction with a series of comments and questions.
2.4. Some questions around the rigidity of pseudo-rotations. The
following question was raised by Bramham in [2].
Question 3. Is every C k pseudo-rotation f C0 -rigid? The question
can be asked for any k ≥ 1, k = ∞ or k = ω.
In the case k = ω or ρ( f ) Diophantine and k = ∞, the latter
question becomes an intermediate question relative to the BirkhoffHerman problem on the conjugability of f to the rigid disc rotation
of angle ρ( f ) [11].
As discussed earlier a better a priori control on the growth of k D f m k
for a pseudo-rotation is sufficient to deduce rigidity for larger classes
of rotation numbers. In the case of a circle diffeomorphism f a gap in
the growth is known to hold between exponential growth in the case
f has a hyperbolic periodic point or a growth bounded by O(m2 )
if not [15]. Does a similar dichotomy hold for area preserving disc
diffeomorphisms?

If for example a polynomial bound holds on the growth of k D f m k
for a smooth pseudo-rotation, then C ∞ -rigidity would follow for any
Liouville rotation number by the same proof as that of Theorem 1.
Question 4. Is there any polynomial bound on the growth of the
derivatives of a pseudo-rotation? Is every C ∞ pseudo-rotation with
Liouville rotation number C0 (or even C ∞ ) rigid?
With Herman’s smooth version of Rüssmann’s Theorem 3 for Diophantine rotation numbers (see [10]), a positive answer to the second
part of Question 4 would imply that smooth pseudo-rotations, and
therefore area preserving smooth diffeomorphisms of the disc with
zero topological entropy are never topologically mixing.
The local result of Corollary A that holds for every analytic pseudorotation raises the following natural question on its semi-global potential validity.
Question 5. Does the local result of Corollary A hold for an ε that is
independent on the rotation number of the pseudo-rotation f ?
Non-rigid C0 pseudo-rotations. In the case of homeomorphisms,
observe that Crovisier constructed on the sphere S2 , C0 pseudo-rotations
of arbitrary rotation number that have positive topological entropy
[4]. It is simple to see that positive topological entropy precludes
C0 -rigidity.
Here is a direct construction of non rigid C0 pseudo-rotations. Let
f t , t ∈ [0, 1] be a continuous family of circle homeomorphisms such
that f 0 = Rα , ρ( f t ) = α for every t ∈ [0, 1], and f t is of class C2 for
every t ∈ [0, 1] − { 21 } while f 1 is a Denjoy counterexample. Hence f t
2

is topologically conjugate to Rα for each t 6= 12 by Denjoy Theorem
while f 1 has a wandering interval. Then, we consider a homeomor2
phism of the disc f that leaves each circle of radius t ∈ [0, 1] invariant
and acts on this circle by the homeomorphism f t . It is clearly not C0 rigid since it is not rigid on the circle of radius 1/2. On the other
hand, f leaves invariant the measure µ given by the integration of
the invariant measures of f t on each circle of radius t, and it is clear
that µ(O) > 0 for any open set O, therefore f can be conjugated
by Oxtoby Ulam lemma to an area preserving homeomorphism that
will be a non C0 -rigid pseudo-rotation of angle α. These examples
fail however to be mixing.
Question 6. Does there exist a mixing C0 pseudo-rotation of the
disc?

10

Pseudo-rotation of the annulus. Pseudo-rotations of the annulus
A = T × [0, 1] are area preserving maps of A that preserve the
boundaries and have a unique irrational rotation number (in projection on the first variable).
Question 7. Are pseudo-rotations of the annulus rigid?
Theorems 1 and 2 hold on the Annulus, with the same proof as
for the Disc. But even in the real analytic category, we do not have a
proof of Theorem A. Indeed, the proof of the KAM Theorem 3 can be
adapted to the annulus only if the map is supposed to be analytically
conjugated to Rα on the boundary. But to guarantee that this always
holds one has to ask that α satisfies the so called condition H [18].
Hence, if α does not satisfy H but satisfies the Brjuno condition (see
[18, Example 2.13]) then neither Theorem 3.1 nor Theorem 3 can be
used, and we do not know if absence of mixing always holds for real
analytic pseudo-rotation of the annulus with rotation number α.
The non-conservative case. Similar results as in Theorems 1 and 2
hold if instead of Lebesgue measure we suppose that f preserves
any measure that assigns a lower bounded mass as a function of r to
discs of radius r. Thus a natural question is the following.
Question 8. Is it true that a diffeomorphism f of the disc with zero
topological entropy that has a unique rotation number is never topologically mixing?
Since Franks and Handel classification result holds for diffeomorphisms that preserve a measure that is strictly positive on every open
set, a positive answer to Question 8 would imply a positive answer
to the first part of the following question.
Question 9. Is it true that a diffeomorphism of the disc with zero
topological entropy that preserves a measure that is strictly positive
on every open set is never topologically mixing? Is it true that a
diffeomorphism of the disc with zero topological entropy is never
topologically mixing?
3. R OTATION NUMBER , R ECURRENCE , AND R IGIDITY
3.1. Rotation number and recurrence. We give here the main ingredient of our approach to rigidity of pseudo-rotations. It is a simple observation that combines Franks’ free disc lemma with Kac’s
lemma to give a lower bound on the measure of free topological discs
of a pseudo-rotation with a small rotation number.

Lemma 3.1. Let f be a continuous pseudo-rotation of D. If ρ( f ) = ε + Z,
then any topological disc D such that λ( D ) > ε satisfies f ( D ) ∩ D 6= ∅.
Proof. Let D be a disc such that f ( D ) ∩ D = ∅ and D̃ a fixed cone = R × [0, 1], the universal
nected component of the lift of D to A
2
covering space od D \ {0}. Since f does not have periodic points on
D2 − {0}, neither does the lift f˜ to Ã, whose (real) rotation number
ρ( fe) is ε. In particular f˜ is fixed point free. Note that f˜( D̃ ) ∩ D̃ = ∅.
Hence, by Franks’ Theorem on positively and negatively returning
discs [6, Theorem 2.1] we have that either f˜n ( D̃ ) ∩ ( D̃ + l ) = ∅ for
every n ≥ 1, l ≥ 0 or f˜n ( D̃ ) ∩ ( D̃ + l ) = ∅ for every n ≥ 1, l ≤ 0.
For definiteness we assume the second condition holds. By Poincaré
recurrence, λ-a.e. x ∈ D returns infinitely many times to D under
iteration by f , call n D ( x ) the first strictly positive return time of such
a point and f D the first return map f D ( x ) = f nD ( x) ( x ). Write l D ( x )
for the integer such that f˜nD ( x) ( x̃ ) ∈ D̃ + l D ( x ), where x̃ is the lift of
x belonging to D̃. By our assumption we know that l D ( x ) ≥ 1. Next,
since f is a pseudo-rotation and ρ( f˜) = ε, we necessarily have for
every x

GROWTH GAP FOR AREA PRESERVING SURFACE
DIFFEOMORPHISMS

4.1. A finite information closing lemma and the gap in the derivatives growth. Let S be a compact smooth surface with a Riemannian
r
(S) the group of Cr diffeomorphisms which
metric. Denote Diffvol
preserve the volume form induced by the Riemannian metric.
Katok’s closing lemma asserts that if a C1+e diffeomorphism f of
a compact manifold has a hyperbolic invariant probability measure
(with non-zero Lyapunov exponents) then f has (many) hyperbolic
r
( S ), r >
periodic points. As a consequence, we get that if f ∈ Diffvol
1, and f has no hyperbolic periodic points then the sequence of sup
norms of the differnetials k D f n k grows sub-exponentially. Indeed,
if the contrary holds, one can easily construct a hyperbolic invariant probability measure. Hence, if one considers a compact set K
r
inside the set of Diffvol
(S) for say r = 2, then there must be an a priori gap between exponential and sub-exponential growth of k D f n k.
Our goal here is to give an explicit estimate on this gap.
We first give a finite information version of Katok’s closing lemma
for a map g ∈ Diff2vol (S) that only requires a growth of k Dgq k comparable to k Dgkθq where θ is close to 1 and q is sufficiently large
compared to powers of the C2 norm of g. We recall that the Cr norm
of a diffeomorphism of a smooth compact manifold M can be defined by taking the supremum over all (finitely many) charts of the
Cr norms of the corresponding maps from Rd to Rd where d is the
dimension of M.
Theorem 4. There exist constants A0 > 0, θ0 ∈ (0, 1), H0 > 0 such
that for all ( g, q, A, D, θ ) with g ∈ Diff2vol (S), q ∈ N, A ≥ A0 , θ ∈
[θ0 , 1), D ≥ A, q ≥ D H0 , if
(4.1)

k Dgk ≤ A

(4.2)

k D2 gk ≤ D

(4.3)

k Dgq k ≥ Aθq

Then g has a hyperbolic periodic point.
Let us first see how the gap on the growth of k D f n k announced in
Theorem C follows from Theorem 4.
Proof of Theorem C. Consider K 0 ⊂ K defined as
K 0 = { f ∈ K : f has no hyperbolic periodic point }

By stability of hyperbolic periodic points, K 0 is open, so K 0 is compact. We claim that
(4.4)

Proof of (4.4). Let αn := supx∈S, f ∈K0 log k D f n ( x )k, we have for all
m, n ∈ N,
αn + αm ≥ αm+n , αn ≥ 0.
Let A0 , θ0 , H0 be given in Theorem 4. From the sub-additive lemma,
we have

n
We have to show that c = 0. Suppose the contrary is true, then there
−1
exists an n ∈ N large enough such that αn ≤ cnθ0−1 , ecnθ0 ≥ A0 .
From the compactness of K, we know that there exists a constant
C ≥ 1 such that for all n ∈ N, f ∈ K,k D2 ( f n )k ≤ eCn . Let
−1

A := ecnθ0 , D := max(eCn , A), θ := θ0 , q := D H0 .
qn

qn
Since qn
≥ c, we can find an f 0 ∈ K 0 such that k D f 0 k ≥ ecqn , let
g := f 0n . Then such ( g, q, A, D, θ ) satisfies the conditions of Theorem
4, therefore by Theorem 4 we have that f 0 has a hyperbolic periodic
point, which contradicts the definition of K 0 . Hence (4.4) is proved.


α

As a consequence of (4.4), there exists H 0 such that for all H > H 0
(4.5)

sup
x ∈S, f ∈K 0

1
log k D f H ( x )k ≤ 1.
H

On the other hand, for A0 , θ0 as in Theorem 4, there exists a positive
integer H 00 sufficiently large such that for any sequence {qn , n ≥ 0}
q
satisfying q0 ≥ H 00 , qn ≥ H 00 n−1 , for each n > 0, we have
(4.6)

n −1

e θ0

q n −1

> A0 .

Indeed for large H 00 , qn increases much faster than θ0−n .
Choose H ≥ max( H 0 , H 00 , e2CH0 ), θ ≥ θ0 , where θ0 , H0 are given in
Theorem 4. We claim that such ( H, θ ) satisfies our conditions.
If there exist f ∈ K, n ≥ 0 satisfying (2.1), where q0 ≥ H, qn ≥
H qn−1 as in Theorem C. We take n to be the smallest integer satisfying
(2.1).

16

A. AVILA, B. FAYAD, P. LE CALVEZ, D. XU, Z. ZHANG

If n = 0, there thus exists an x ∈ S such that q10 log k D f q0 ( x )k > 1.
Since q0 ≥ H, by (4.5) we know f ∈
/ K 0 . Therefore f has a hyperbolic
periodic point.
n −1
q
If n > 0, then let g := f qn−1 , A := eθ qn−1 , q := qn−n 1 , D := eCqn−1 .
By our assumptions on H, θ, H 00 and (4.6), we have A > A0 . It is
clear that ( g, A, θ, q, D ) satisfy the conditions in Theorem 4.
In fact, since n is the smallest integer satisfying (2.1), we get (4.1)
and (4.3) in Theorem 4. We have (2) since

k D2 ( g)k ≤ eCqn−1 = D, log q ≥ qn−1 log H − log qn−1
Finally, log H ≥ 2CH0 , so we have log q ≥ 2CH0 qn−1 − log qn−1 ≥
CH0 qn−1 , therefore q ≥ D H0 .
From Theorem 4, we know that g has a hyperbolic periodic point,
then f also has a hyperbolic periodic point.

Strategy of the proof of Theorem 4. Let us briefly recall how Katok derives his closing lemma from Pesin theory. For almost every
point of the hyperbolic measure, Lyapunov neighborhoods are constructed with stable and unstable manifolds attached to the point,
which have definite size under the Lyapunov metric. Moreover, the
transformation between two neighborhoods looks like a uniform hyperbolic map under these new metrics. Even though the Lyapunov
neighborhoods of some points are very small, Pesin theory provides
sets of positive measure, the so called Pesin basic sets, consisting
of points having Lyapunov neighborhoods (and thus stable and unstable manifolds) of uniformly lower bounded sizes and having as
well a lower bounded angle between the stable and unstable directions. Then, the Poincaré recurrence theorem is used to obtain an
integer L and a point x from a given Pesin basic set that comes back
under L iteration inside the same basic set close to itself. This then
guarantees the existence of a hyperbolic periodic point z of period L
that shadows the piece of orbit of x of length L, in the same way as
Anosov closing lemma gives a hyperbolic periodic point that shadows a recurrent piece of orbit in uniform hyperbolic dynamics. The
proof can for example be done through graph transforms involving
the first return map to the Lyapunov neighborhood of x. Of course,
once the good Pesin point x is detected, the rest of the proof does not
depend on informations on f beyond the ones we have for the first
L iterates of a small neighborhood of x. The problem with this procedure when one is interested in finite information versions of the

ON MIXING DIFFEOMORPHISMS OF THE DISK

17

closing lemma, lies actually in the fact that the Lyapunov charts construction requires an infinite amount of information involving the
full orbit of points.
In the spirit of the finite information versions of the closing lemma
based on the concept of effective hyperbolicity at a point of [3], our
proof of Theorem 4 uses properties (4.1)–(4.3) to select a good point
for which nice hyperbolic properties hold most of the time along a
piece of its orbit until it comes back very close to itself, and then deduce from a hyperbolic-like property of the return map the existence
of a hyperbolic periodic point next to the selected good point.
More precisely, our proof of Theorem 4 goes as follows : In Section
4.2, we use (4.3) to find ”good points” x ∈ S for which there exists
L ∈ {1, . . . q} and vs , vu ∈ Tx S, such that the forward orbit from
x to g L ( x ) contracts and expands consistently at rate almost A the
directions vs and vu respectively (this is possible because θ is close
to 1), and the backward orbit by g−1 from g L ( x ) to x expands and
contracts consistently at rate almost A in the directions Dg L (vs ) and
Dg L (vu ) respectively. To neutralize the nonlinearities coming from
Dg L (v )

the second derivatives, we also ask the distances d T1 S (vs , k Dg L (vs )k )
s

Dg L (v )
and d T1 S (vu , k Dg L (vs )k ) to be small compared to a power of
s

D −1 .

Here
d T1 S is a metric on the unit tangent bundle of S defined by some
embedding into a Euclidean space (in particular, the point g L ( x ) is
very close to x). All the former is possible to achieve due to Pliss
Lemma and the pigeonhole principle (the hypothesis q ≥ D H0 is
crucial here). From area conservation, we also get for free that the
angles ∠(vs , vu ) and ∠( Dg L (vs ), Dg L (vu )) are not too small. We do
not assume any a priori control on the angles of the expanded and
contracted direction within the L-orbit.
Next we study the dynamics along the L-orbit of the good point
x and show that it is possible to find a box B (think of a square) in
the neighborhood of x that contains a vertical strip that is mapped
by the return map g L into a horizontal strip with in addition a strict
cone contraction condition for g L and g− L inside these strips. This
evidently implies the existence of a hyperbolic fixed point for g L .

4.2. Finding a suitable finite orbit. We first precise the notion of
good points mentioned in the introduction.

Remark 4.1. Without loss of generality, we fix an isometric embedding Ψ : S → RW . This allows us to define the angle between two
arbitrary tangent vectors by translating them back to 0. As a result,
we can define the distance between any two unit tangent vectors of
the surface v1 ∈ Tx11 S, v2 ∈ Tx12 S as the following:
d T 1 S ( v1 , v2 ) = ∠( v1 , v2 ) + d ( x1 , x2 )
In particular, for v1 ∈ Tx11 S, v2 ∈ Tx12 S, d T1 S (v1 , v2 ) ≥ d( x1 , x2 ).
Definition 4.3. ((q,a)-good point)
For all q ∈ N, a > 0, we say a point x ∈ S is (q, a)−good if there
exist vs , vu ∈ Tx S, L ∈ N such that the following is true. Let vis , viu , i ∈

Z be defined in Definition 4.1 associated to the triple ( x, vs , vu ). Then
(1) The triple ( x, vs , vu ) is forward ( L, a)−good.
(2) The triple ( g L ( x ), vsL , vuL )) is backward ( L, a)−good.

The goal of this section is to prove the following proposition which
shows the existence of a (q, a)−good point under certain conditions.
We will then show in the Section 4.3 that the existence of a (q, a)−good
point for sufficiently large q ( the largeness only depends on a and S
) implies the existence of a hyperbolic periodic point.
Proposition 4.1. There exists θ0 ∈ (0, 1),A0 > 0, H0 > 0, such that the
following holds. If ( g, A, θ, q) satisfies A > A0 , θ ∈ [θ0 , 1), q ≥ A H0 and
conditions (4.1),(4.3) in Theorem 4, then there exists a (q, a)−good point
x ∈ S, where a = log A.
Proof. We will use the following lemma several times:
Lemma 4.2. (Pliss lemma [14]) Given a sequence of n real numbers a1 , ..., an .
Assume ai ≤ l for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and ∑in=1 ai > nl 0 , l 0 < l.Then for any

there exists x ∈ S such that for a = log A

We claim that if A0 , H0 are large enough, θ0 is sufficiently close to 1,
then there exists a (q, a)−good point in the orbit of any x satifying
(4.17).
Let v0s be a unit vector in the most contracting direction of Dgq ( x )
in Tx S, and let v0u = v0s ⊥ denote a unit vector orthogonal to v0s .

From now on to the end of this subsection, we consider vis , viu , λiu,s , λi
as in Definition 4.1 for the triple ( x, v0s , v0u ), where x satifies (4.17).
e
Then we have the following estimates for λiu,s , λi which will be used
later.
Lemma 4.3. For any 0 < η < 1, there exists θ0 ∈ (0, 1) depending
only on η such that the following is true. Suppose g ∈ Diff1vol (S) satisfies
k Dgk ≤ A. If θ ∈ [θ0 , 1) and (q, a, θ, x ) satisfies (4.17), where a = log A,

A key estimate due to area preservation is the following lower
bound on the anglen ∠(vsn , vun ) at good points.

Lemma 4.5. There exist A0 > 0, θ0 ∈ (0, 1) such that if A > A0 , θ ∈
[θ0 , 1), g ∈ Diff1vol (S) satisfies k Dgk ≤ A, and (q, a, θ, x ) satisfies (4.17),
where a = log A, then for all good points gn ( x ) in the orbit of x,

Sublemma 4.1. | cot ∠(viu+1 , vis+1 )| ≤ e2λi | cot ∠(viu , vis )| + A2 .

Now we can conclude the proof of Proposition 4.1. By Lemma
4.4, there exist A0 , θ0 such that for ( g, A, θ, q, x ) satisfying (4.17) and
q
the conditions of Proposition 4.1, there are more than 2 points in
{ gk ( x ), 0 ≤ k ≤ q − 1} are good in the orbit of x.
We consider the space S × T 1 S × T 1 S. By the pigeonhole principal,
if A0 , H0 are large enough (recall that q ≥ A0H0 ),then q is large, and

we can find two good points, gi ( x ), gi+ L ( x ) such that the distances

dition (4) in Definition 4.3. By (4.18) of Definition 4.4, since gi ( x ) is a
good point in the orbit of x, we have that the triple ( gi ( x ), vis , viu )
is forward ( L, a)−good. Similarly by (4.19) in the Definition 4.4,
since gi+ L ( x ) is a good point in the orbit of x, we have the triple
( gi+ L ( x ), vis+ L , viu+ L ) is backward ( L, a)−good. Moreover, by Lemma
4.5 on the estimates of the angles at points that are good in the orbit
of x, we have
log | cot ∠(vis , viu )| ≤ 3a
log | cot ∠(vis+ L , viu+ L )| ≤ 3a
As a result the triple ( gi ( x ), vis , viu ) satisfies conditions (1)-(4) in
Definition 4.3, so gi ( x ) is a (q, a)−good point. The proof of Proposition 4.1 is thus complete.

4.3. From a good point to a hyperbolic periodic point. We now
claim that the existence of a (q, a)−good point implies the existence
of a hyperbolic periodic point when q is large compared to the C2
norm.
Proposition 4.2. There exist A0 > 0, H0 > 0 such that the following is
true. If ( g, A, D, q) satisfies: A ≥ A0 , D ≥ A, q ≥ D H0 and (4.1),(4.2) of
Theorem 4 and if there exists a (q, a)−good point x, where a = log A, then
g has a hyperbolic periodic point.
Using Proposition 4.2 and Proposition 4.1, we can easily deduce
Theorem 4.
Proof of Theorem 4. We take θ0 as in Proposition 4.1, A1 ,H1 as in Proposition 4.1 and A2 ,H2 as in Proposition 4.2. Let A0 = max( A1 , A2 ),H0 =
max( H1 , H2 ). Then for ( g, q, A, D, θ ) satisfying the hypothesis in Theorem 4, we know from Proposition 4.1 that there exists a (q, a)−good
point x0 ∈ S. From Proposition 4.2, we know that there exists a hyperbolic periodic point.

The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of Proposition 4.2.
Hereafter, we will assume that the conditions of Proposition 4.2 are
satisfied.
4.3.1. Boxes, strips and hyperbolic-like maps. Let x0 be the (q, a)− good
point in Proposition 4.2, let L ∈ N be associated to x0 as in Definition
4.3. To prove Proposition 4.2 we will show that g L has a hyperbolic
fixed point in the neighborhood of x0 . We will do so by applying to
a conjugate of g L ( by a coordinate map), denoted by G, a standard
result on hyperbolic-like maps, namely Proposition 4.3 below which
essentially states that if a homeomorphism G of R2 maps a vertical
”strip” R1 into a horizontal ”strip” R2 that crosses R1 transversally
then G has a fixed point inside the intersection of the strips. Moreover, if G is a diffeomorphism and if G and G −1 have strict cone
conditions in R1 and R2 (see (4.21), (4.22)) then the fixed point is
hyperbolic.
In this section, we first need to introduce some notations and then
define the properties of hyperbolic-like maps that we will be interested in since they guarantee the existence of a hyperbolic fixed
point. We then state Proposition 4.4 that reduces the proof of Proposition 4.2 to checking the hyperbolic-like properties for the map G.
The rest of the paper will then be dedicated to the proof of Proposition 4.4.

• Given r > 0, τ > 0, κ > 0, we define a (r, τ, κ )−Box , that we denote
by U (r, τ, κ ), to be
U (r, τ, κ ) = {(v, w) ∈ R2 ; |v| ≤ r, |w| ≤ τ + κ |v|}
We denote U (∞, τ, κ ) = {(v, w) ∈ R2 ; |w| ≤ τ + κ |v|}

• A curve contained in R2 = Rx ⊕ Ry is called a κ −horizontal graph if
it is the graph of a Lipschitz function from an closed interval I ⊂ Rx
to Ry with Lipschitz constant less than κ. Similarly, we can define
the κ − vertical graphs.
• The boundary of an (r, τ, κ )−Box U is the union of two 0− vertical
graphs and two κ − horizontal graphs. We call these graphs respectively, the left (resp. right) vertical boundary of U and the upper (resp.
lower) horizontal boundary of U. We call the union of the left and right
vertical boundary of U the vertical boundary of U. Similarly we call
the union of the upper and lower horizontal boundary of U the horizontal boundary of U.

• Horizontal and vertical graphs that connect the boundaries of U
will be called full horizontal and full vertical graphs as in the following definition. Given r, τ, κ, η > 0, for each (r, τ, κ )−Box U, an η −
full horizontal graph of U is an η − horizontal graph L such that L ⊂ U
and the endpoints of L are contained in the vertical boundary of U.
Similarly, we define the η −full vertical graphs of U.
• We define an η −horizontal strip of U to be a subset of U bounded
by the vertical boundary of U and two disjoint η − full horizontal
graphs of U that are both disjoint from the horizontal boundary of
U. Similarly we can define η −vertical strips of U.
• A homeomorphism that maps a strip R0 to R is said to be regular
if it maps the horizontal (resp. vertical) boundary of R0 homeomorphically to the horizontal (resp. vertical) boundary of R.
• For κ > 0, we denote
C (κ ) = {(v, w) ∈ R2 : |w| < κ |v|}
C̃ (κ ) = {(v, w) ∈ R2 : |v| < κ |w|}
we will refer to these sets as cones.
Using the above definitions and notations, we now define a class
of maps on the plane that display some sort of local hyperbolicity
that we will call hyperbolic-like maps.
Definition 4.5. Given r, τ > 0, 0 < κ, κ 0 , κ 00 < 1. Denote U =
U (r, τ, κ ), and let R1 be a κ −vertical strip of U, R2 be a κ −horizontal
strip of U. A diffeomorphism G : R1 → G ( R1 ) ⊂ R2 is called a
hyperbolic-like map if it satisfies the following conditions:
G is a regular map from R1 to R2 ,
1
∀ x ∈ R1 , DGx (C (κ 0 )) ⊂ C ( κ 0 ),
(4.21)

(4.22)
∀ x ∈ R2 , DGx−1 (C̃ (κ”)) ⊂ C̃ ( κ”)

Our interest in hyperbolic-like maps comes from the following
classical result.

(4.20)

Proposition
4.3. A hyperbolic-like map F has a hyperbolic fixed point in
T
R1 R2 .
Proof. By (4.20) the Jordan curve C = ∂R1 contains no fixed point of
G. Therefore the Lefschetz index of G relative to C is well defined.
From (4.20), we see that it is equal to 1 therefore there is a fixed point
inside R1 ( then necessarily in R2 , for G (R1 ) = R2 , see Figure 1).
The fixed point is hyperbolic by (4.21) and (4.22).

F IGURE 1. R1 is the topological rectangle abcd, R2 is
the topological rectangle a0 b0 c0 d0 . Under a hyperboliclike map G, ab is mapped to a0 b0 . Similarly, bc, cd, da
are mapped respectively to b0 c0 , c0 d0 , d0 a0 .
By Proposition 4.3, the proof of Proposition 4.2 is thus reduced to
the following proposition.
Proposition 4.4. Under the conditions of Proposition 4.2, there exists an
integer L > 0, a Box U ⊂ R2 , a vertical strip of U denoted by R1 , a C1
diffeomorphism H : U → S, such that g L H (R1 ) ⊂ H (U ) and H −1 g L H :
R1 → R2 is a hyperbolic-like map.
Now the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of Proposition
4.4.
4.3.2. Map from the n-th point to the (n+1)-st point. Let x0 be the (q, a)−
good point in Proposition 4.2, let vs , vu ∈ Tx0 S, L ∈ N be as in Definition 4.3. From now on to the end of this paper, we denote
x n = g n ( x0 ), ∀1 ≤ n ≤ L
To show Proposition 4.4, we will study the iterates of g in the
neighborhoods of the piece of orbit of x0 of length L. We want to

28

A. AVILA, B. FAYAD, P. LE CALVEZ, D. XU, Z. ZHANG

show that the ”return” map from x0 to the neighborhood of x0 (since
x L is very close to x0 ) is a hyperbolic-like map. But for this, we need
to specify the Box on which the ”return” map will be considered as
well as the neighborhoods of the piece of orbit of x0 on which the
dynamics of g will be studied.
For each 0 ≤ n ≤ L, let xn , vun , vsn , λsn , λun be defined in Definition 4.1
and λen be defined in (4.11) associated to the triple ( x0 , vs , vu ). In the
following we fix a splitting Txn S = Enu ⊕ Ens , where Enu = Rvun ,Ens =
Rvsn . We define in : R2 → Txn S as
in ( a, b) = avun + bvsn
By (4.1) and D ≥ A, it is direct to see that there exists a constant

R > 0 depending only on S such that exp−
xn+1 is a diffeomorphism
over g expxn in ( B(0, D −1 R)).

In order to exploit the properties of the good point x0 we chose to
study the dynamics of the iterates of g in the moving frames Enu ⊕ Ens ,
that is gn as defined in (4.23). This comes at the cost of an extra factor
in the C2 norm of gn coming from the angle between vsn and vun . The
parameter β n gives a bound on how small can these angles become
as we shall now see.
Lemma 4.6. If we choose A0 in Proposition 4.2 to be sufficiently large, we
have
(4.31)

β i ≥ max(| cot ∠( Eiu , Eis )|, 1), ∀0 ≤ i ≤ L − 1

Proof. Since δ = a/100, if A0 > e100 , then δ > 1. By Lemma 4.1, we
have

D M = β0.
If for some 0 ≤ i ≤ L − 1, we have β i ≥ | cot ∠( Eiu , Eis )|. Then by

The following lemmata exploit the fact that x0 is good to control
the shape and size of the Boxes at each time n ≤ L. Most importantly,
UL is shown to be long in the horizontal direction and thin in the
vertical direction compared to U0 .
Lemma 4.7. If we choose A0 in Proposition 4.2 to be sufficiently large,
then we have that c L = 100. As a consequence, we have

that c L = 100 when A is large. Indeed, let i be the biggest index
such that 0 ≤ i ≤ L − 1 and ci ≥ 1 ( i ≥ 0 because c0 = 1).

Then c L = min(eλ L−1 −δ c L−1 , 100) = min(e∑k=i (λk −δ) ci , 100). Since

Remark 4.2. Since Un ⊂ B(0, rn + τn + κn rn ), and
rn + τn + κn rn ≤ 2 × 106 r̄ + 100κ̄ r̄ ≤ D − M
when D is sufficiently large. Thus Un ⊂ B(0, D −1 R) when D is sufficiently large depending only on S. This shows that gn is defined
over Un .
The following proposition is purely analytic and relies on the relations between the parameters rn , τn , β n , κn , κ̃n . It will be used repeatedly in the sequel.
Proposition 4.5. Recall that {(rn , τn , β n , κn , κ̃n )}0≤n≤ L are defined by
(4.25) to (4.29). Assume that we also have (4.31) and (4.36). Then for
all D sufficiently large depending only on S, for each 0 ≤ n ≤ L − 1 we
have the following:
(1). For any (v, w) ∈ Un , we have ( Dgn )(v,w) (Cn ) ⊂ Cn+1 ; For any
T
(v, w) ∈ gn (Un ) Un+1 , we have ( Dgn−1 )(v,w) (C̃n+1 ) ⊂ C̃n . As a consequence, the image of any κn − horizontal graph contained in Un under
gn is a κn+1 − horizontal graph; the image of any κ̃n+1 − vertical graph
T
contained in gn (Un ) Un+1 under gn−1 is a κ̃n − vertical graph.
T
(2). If Γ is a κn −full horizontal graph of Un , then gn (Γ) Un+1 is a
κn+1 -full horizontal graph of Un+1 . Moreover, the image of the horizontal boundary of Un under gn is disjoint from the horizontal boundary of
Un+1 ; the image of the vertical boundary of Un under gn is disjoint from
the vertical boundary of Un+1 .
The proof of Proposition 4.5 will be given in the Appendix.
Corollary A. For any 0 ≤ k ≤ L − 1, we can find a κ̃k − vertical strip of
Uk , denoted by R0 , such that R = gk (R0 ) is a κk+1 − horizontal strip of
Uk+1 . Moreover, gk is a regular map from R0 to R.
Proof. For any 0 ≤ k ≤ L − 1, denote the upper and lower horizontal
boundary of Uk by L1 , L2 respectively. Then by Proposition 4.5, for
i = 1, 2, there exists a κk − horizontal graph contained in Li , denoted
by Lk,i , such that gk (Lk,i ) is a κk+1 − full horizontal graph of Uk+1 ,
denoted by Lk+1,i . By Proposition 4.5, Lk+1,1 , Lk+1,2 are disjoint from
the horizontal boundary of Uk+1 . Then there exist a horizontal strip
of Uk+1 , denoted by R, bounded by Lk+1,1 and Lk+1,2 ( see Figure 2
).
Again by Proposition 4.5, denote the κ̃k+1 −vertical graph contained
in the left vertical boundary of Uk+1 , connecting the endpoints of
Lk+1,1 and Lk+1,2 by L0k+1,1 , then gk−1 (L0k+1,1 ) is a κ̃k −vertical graph,

F IGURE 2. gk maps R0 to R. Moreover Lk,1 , Lk,2 are
mapped to Lk+1,1 , Lk+1,2 respectively and L0k,1 , L0k,2 are
mapped to L0k+1,1 , L0k+1,2 respectively.
denoted by L0k,1 . From Proposition 4.5, we see that the images of the
vertical boundary of Uk under gk is disjoint from the vertical boundary of Uk+1 . Then L0k,1 is disjoint from the vertical boundary of Uk .
Since by construction L0k,1 connect the upper and lower horizontal
boundary of Uk , we have L0k,1 ⊂ Uk . Hence L0k,1 is a κ̃k −full vertical
graph of Uk . In a similar fashion, we construct L0k+1,2 and L0k,2 . Then
there exists a vertical strip of Uk , denoted by R0 , bounded by L0k,1
and L0k,2 . It is straightforward to check that the statement is true for
R0 and R.

4.3.3. Concatenation. In this section, we will use Corollary A inductively to construct a vertical strip of U0 that is mapped by g L−1 · · · g0
to a horizontal strip of UL . We will also prove the cone preservation by the derivative map using Proposition 4.5. The result of the
induction is summarized in Corollary B.
First we need the following lemma.

ON MIXING DIFFEOMORPHISMS OF THE DISK

33

Lemma 4.9. If D > 1, for any 0 ≤ n ≤ L, any κ̃n −vertical full graph L0 ,
any κn −horizontal full graph L, L0 intersects L at a unique point.
Proof. A simple topological argument shows that there is at least one
intersection point.
If there are two intersection points, then by the Rolle’s theorem,
there exists p ∈ L0 and q ∈ L, such that the Lipschitz constant of
L at q, denoted by t, equals to the inverse of the Lipschitz constant
of L0 at p, denoted by t0−1 . We have κ̄ = D − M < 1. Thus, we have
κ̃n ≥ t0 = t−1 ≥ κn−1 = cn κ̄ −1 > cn κ̄ = κ̃n . This is a contradiction. 
Corollary B. When A0 > 0 is sufficiently large, there exists a κ̃0 − vertical strip of U0 , denoted by R0 , such that R = g L−1 · · · g0 (R0 ) is a κ L −
horizontal strip of UL and g L−1 · · · g0 is a regular map from R0 to R.
1
Moreover, for any x ∈ R0 , D ( g L−1 · · · g0 ) x maps C (κ̄ ) into C ( 100
κ̄ ); For
−1
−1
any x ∈ R, D ( g0 · · · g L−1 ) x maps C̃ (100κ̄ ) into C̃ (κ̄ ).
Proof. We will inductively prove a stronger statement : for any 1 ≤
n ≤ L, there exists a κ̃0 − vertical strip R00 of U0 and a κn − horizontal
strip Rn of Un such that gn−1 · · · g0 is a regular map from R00 to Rn .
First, we see that the above statement for n = 1 follows from
Corollary A.
Now we assume that the statement is true for n − 1. By the induction hypothesis, we get a κ̃0 − vertical strip of U0 , denoted by Q00 ,
such that gn−2 · · · g0 ( Q00 ) is a κn−1 − horizontal strip of Un−1 , denoted
by Qn−1 . From Corollary A, we get a κ̃n−1 − vertical strip of Un−1 ,
denoted by Q0n−1 , such that gn−1 ( Q0n−1 ) is a κn − horizontal strip of
Un , denoted by Qn . Denote two horizontal boundaries of Qn−1 by
M1 , M2 , two vertical boundaries of Q0n−1 by M10 , M20 ( see Figure 3).
T
By Lemma 4.9, we easily see that Q̃ = Qn−1 Q0n−1 is bounded by:
two κ̃n−1 − vertical graphs contained in M10 and M20 respectively, and
two κn−1 − horizontal graphs contained in M1 and M2 respectively.
Again by Proposition 4.5, we have that g0−1 · · · gn−−1 2 ( Q̃) is a κ̃0 − vertical strip of U0 ,denoted by R00 , and gn−1 ( Q̃) is a κn − horizontal strip
of Un , denoted by Rn . It is clear from the definitions that gn−1 · · · g0
is a regular maps from R00 to Rn . This completes the induction.
The first part of Corollary B is thus proved if we take n = L, and
0
R = R00 and R = R L . The construction also shows that for any
x ∈ R0 , any 0 ≤ n ≤ L − 1, gn · · · g0 ( x ) ∈ Un+1 . This allows us to
apply (1) in Proposition 4.5 and get from (4.34) the second part of the
statement of Corollary B.

have to consider a map from a vertical strip of a box to a horizontal
strip of the same box. We have to compare the exponential coordinate
charts at x0 and x L . Now we define the return map I : UL → Ω0 as

graph. Using (4.40) and (4.41), we see that I (L) contains a 21 κ̄ −full
horizontal graph of U0 . This completes the proof.

We are finally ready to prove Proposition 4.4.
Proof of Proposition 4.4. Consider the map G := IG 0 with G 0 := g L−1 ◦
· · · ◦ g0 . We have
1 L
G = i0−1 exp−
x0 g exp x0 i0

When D > 10, we have 2κ̄ < 1. If we show that there exists a vertical
strip R1 of U0 and a horizontal strip R2 of U0 such that
(1) G is a regular map from R1 to R2 ,
1
(2) for any (v, w) ∈ R1 , DG(v,w) (C (κ̄ )) ⊂ C ( κ̄ )

(3) for any (v, w) ∈ R2 , DG(−v,w

C̃
(

)
Then we define U = U0 and H : R1 → S by H = exp x0 i0 , we have
( H −1 g L H )|R1 = G. This finishes the proof.
Proof of (1). By Corollary B, we know that there is a κ̃0 −vertical strip
R0 of U0 and R := G 0 (R0 ) is a horizontal strip of UL . Denote R2 :=
I (R) ∩ U0 .
By Corollary B, R is a κ L −horizontal strip of UL . By Lemma 4.10
(4.37), the image of the upper horizontal boundary of R under I is
a 2κ L −horizontal graph, and by Lemma 4.10, it intersects the vertical boundary of U0 at two points, one in each component. We
have the same for the lower horizontal boundary of R. Then R2
is a 2κ L −horizontal strip of U0 and the vertical boundary of R2 is
contained in the vertical boundary of U0 .
By Corollary B and Lemma 4.10, ( DG −1 )(v,w) (C̃ (2κ̄ )) ⊂ C̃ (κ̄ ) for
any (v, w) ∈ R2 , this implies that the image of the vertical boundary
of R2 under G −1 is the union of two κ̄ − vertical graphs connecting
two components of the horizontal boundary of R0 . By Lemma 4.10,
these two vertical graphs are contained in R0 , disjoint from each
other and disjoint from the vertical boundary of R0 , hence are κ̄ −
full vertical graphs of R0 . Hence G −1 (R2 ) is contained in R0 , and
is bounded by two κ̄ − full vertical graphs of R0 . Then G −1 (R2 ) is
a vertical strip of U0 , denoted by R1 . From the construction, we see
that the horizontal (resp. vertical) boundary of G −1 (R2 ) is mapped
homeomorphically to the horizontal (resp. vertical) boundary of R.
Hence G is a regular map between these two strips. The proof of (1)
is thus finished.

Combining Lemma 4.10 and Corollary B, we immediately have (2)
and (3) , which ends the proof of Proposition 4.4.

5. A PPENDIX
Proof of Proposition 4.5. We denote the first and second coordinates of
gn as v̄, w̄. We expand gn into linear terms and higher order terms at
the origin. For each (v, w) ∈ Un , we have
(5.1)
(5.2)

v̄(v, w) = An v + f n (v, w)
w̄(v, w) = Bn w + hn (v, w)

where ∂v f n (0, 0) = ∂w f n (0, 0) = ∂v hn (0, 0) = ∂w hn (0, 0) = 0.
( f n , hn are uniquely determined by these conditions). Following the
notations in Section 4.2, we have
u

s

An = eλn , Bn = eλn
Recall that we have assumed k Dgk ≤ A and k D2 gk ≤ D. By
Lemma 4.6, we have the following lemmata which are essentially
proved in [3].
Lemma 5.1. For all 0 ≤ n ≤ L − 1 we have

k D2 f n k, k D2 hn k ≤ C0 Dβ n+1
As a consequence, for all 0 ≤ n ≤ L − 1 we have

|∂v f n (v, w)|, |∂w f n (v, w)|, |∂v hn (v, w)|, |∂w hn (v, w)| ≤ C0 Dβ n+1 (|v| + |w|)
Here C0 is a constant depending only on S and the norm is taken restricted
to Un .
Denote en = 2C0 Dβ n+1 rn (1 + κn ), then we have the following estimate:
Lemma 5.2. For each 0 ≤ n ≤ L − 1, we have

k ∂ v f n k C 0 ≤ en , k ∂ w f n k C 0 ≤ en
k ∂ v h n k C 0 ≤ en , k ∂ w h n k C 0 ≤ en
Here C0 norm is taken restricted to Un .
It is easy to see that

(5.4)

en κn ≤ D − M κ̄

(5.5)

when D is sufficiently large depending only on S.
Then by Lemma 5.1 and (5.1), for any (v, w) ∈ Un we have,

|v̄| ≥ An |v| − | f n (v, w)|
≥ An |v| − en (|v| + |w|)
≥ ( An − en − en κn )|v| − en τn

We will first show that :
(5.8) gn (Un ) is contained in the interior of U (∞, τn+1 , κn+1 )
Combining (5.6) and (5.7), (5.8) follows from :

Now we get to the proof of (1) in Proposition 4.5. Differentiate
(5.1) and (5.2), we get

denote ( a, b) = ( Dgn−1 )(v,w) ( ā, b̄), by (5.15) and (5.16) we have

when D is sufficiently large. This is proved in a similar way as (5.9)
using (5.3), (5.5). This completes the proof of (1).
Now we prove (2) in Proposition 4.5. If Γ is κn −full horizontal
graph of Un , we can denote Γ as the graph of φ : [−rn , rn ] → R, such
that:
(1) The Lipschitz constant of φ is smaller than κn everywhere;
(2) For any v ∈ [−rn , rn ], we have (v, φ(v)) ∈ Un .
By (5.11), we have for any (v, w) ∈ Un

when D is sufficiently large. By (5.6), for any w such that (rn , w) ∈
Un , if D is sufficiently large then
v̄(rn , w) ≥ ( An − en − en κn )rn − en τn
u

> e λ n − 2 δ r n > r n +1
Here the second inequality follows from (5.3), (5.4) and (4.36). Similar calculation shows that v̄(−rn , w) < −rn+1 for all w such that
(−rn , w) ∈ Un . Then v̄−1 is defined over [−rn+1 , rn+1 ], and we have
that the image of the vertical boundary of Un under gn is disjoint
from the vertical boundary of Un+1 .
Then by (5.8), we have
gn ( Γ )

\

Un+1 is contained in Un

and disjoint from the horizontal boundary of Un
Moreover, gn (Γ) Un+1 is the graph of function φv̄−1 restricted
to
T
[−rn+1 , rn+1 ]. Since we already showed (1), we know that gn (Γ) Un+1
is a κn+1 −full horizontal graph, and the image of the horizontal
boundary of Un under gn is disjoint from the horizontal boundary
of Un+1 .
This completes the proof of (2).
