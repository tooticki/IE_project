Abstract
We prove vanishing results for the generalized Miller-Morita-Mumford classes of
some smooth bundles whose fiber is a closed manifold that supports a nonpositively
curved Riemannian metric. We also find, under some extra conditions, that the vertical
tangent bundle is topologically rigid.

Introduction and statement of results

In this paper we study the topology of smooth fiber bundles M → E → B whose fiber M
is a closed manifold that supports a nonpositively curved Riemannian metric. We obtain
two types of results, namely, topological rigidity for the associated vertical tangent bundle
of E → B and vanishing of the tautological classes in positive degrees (also known as
generalized Miller-Morita-Mumford classes).
Rigidity results have appeared in the context of negatively curved bundles already,
i.e. smooth bundles whose (concrete) fibers can be given negatively curved Riemannian
metrics varying continuously from fiber to fiber. In fact, it is proven in [FG15] that the
associated vertical sphere bundle of a negatively curved bundle is topologically trivial,
provided the base space B is a simply connected simplicial complex. Our results, stated
below, concern with the associated vertical tangent bundle of a bundle whose (abstract)
fiber is a nonpositively curved manifold.
With regard to the rational tautological classes, we show that they vanish in many
instances for bundles with nonpositively curved fibers, provided the dimension of the fiber
is greater than 2. This contrasts heavily with the recent results of Galatius and RandalWilliams [GRW14], which show that tautological classes do not vanish for some smooth
bundles with highly connected fibers.
Our results also point in the direction of the following conjecture by Farrell and Ontaneda:
Conjecture 1 (Farrell-Ontaneda). Every negatively curved fiber bundle over a paracompact, Hausdorff space with the homotopy type of a simply connected finite simplicial complex is topologically trivial.
We now proceed to state the results of this paper.
q
A smooth fiber bundle is a fiber bundle M → E →
− B whose (abstract) fiber M is a
smooth finite dimensional manifold and whose structure group is the group Diff(M ) of

1

smooth self-diffeomorphisms of M . We denote the (concrete) fiber q −1 (x) over x ∈ B by
Mx .
Throughout this paper we assume that M is a closed smooth manifold. We say that
q
a smooth fiber bundle M → E →
− B is fiber homotopically trivial (resp. topologically
trivial ) if there exists a continuous map Φ : E → M such that its restriction to each
fiber Φ|Mx : Mx → M is a homotopy equivalence (resp. homeomorphism). Note that in
this case the map E → B × M given by a 7→ (q(a), Φ(a)) is a fiber-preserving homotopy
equivalence (resp. homeomorphism).
A smooth fiber bundle M → E → B over B is said to have nonpositively curved fibers
if the abstract fiber M supports a complete Riemannian metric whose sectional curvatures
are all nonpositive.
q
Given a smooth fiber bundle M → E →
− B we define its associated vertical tangent
π
bundle tE −
→ B to be the smooth fiber bundle of vectors tangent to the fibers Mx of
q : E → B, that is to say
[
tE =
T Mx ,
x∈B

where T Mx is the tangent bundle of Mx . The projection map π : tE → B is nothing but
q
r
the composite tE →
− E→
− B, where the map r : tE → E sends a vector in tE to its “foot”
in E. Thus π : tE → B is a smooth fiber bundle with fiber T M . In fact it is an associated
bundle to q : E → B in the sense of Steenrod [Ste51, p. 43]. Notice that r : tE → E is a
vector bundle of rank equal to the dimension of M . Also, if E and B are smooth manifolds
and π is a smooth map, tE can be identified with the the subbundle of the tangent bundle
T E of E, consisting of all the vectors v ∈ T E in the kernel of the differential of q.
Our first theorem is a rigidity result for the associated vertical tangent bundle of a
smooth bundle with nonpositively curved fibers.
Theorem A. Let M n → E → B be a smooth fiber bundle with nonpositively curved
n-dimensional (n 6= 3) closed fiber over a finite simplicial complex B. Assume that the
bundle is fiber homotopically trivial. Then there exists a continuous map Ψ : tE → T M
such that Ψ|T Mx : T Mx → T M is a homeomorphism for each x ∈ B.
We invite the reader to compare this result with [FG15, Theorem 1.6], where they find
fiber homotopically trivial smooth bundles with real hyperbolic fibers, whose associated
sphere bundles are not topologically trivial.
Using obstruction theory, one can show that a smooth fiber bundle M → E → B
is fiber homotopically trivial if the fiber M is aspherical, π1 (M ) is centerless and B is
a simply connected finite simplicial complex (see for example [FG15, Proposition 1.4]).
Hence Theorem A (cf. Remark 7 below) implies the following:
Corollary A.1. If M n → E → B is a smooth bundle (n 6= 3), with M a closed negatively
curved manifold and B a simply connected finite simplicial complex, then there exists a
continuous map Ψ : tE → T M such that Ψ|T Mx : T Mx → T M is a homeomorphism for
each x ∈ B.
We now recall the definition of the tautological classes (also known as generalized
q
Miller-Morita-Mumford classes) of an oriented smooth fiber bundle. Let M n → E →
−
2

B be an oriented smooth fiber bundle with closed n-dimensional fiber M , i.e. M is
oriented and the structure group of the bundle is the group of orientation preserving selfdiffeomorphisms of M . Let β : E → BSO(n) be the classifying map for the vector bundle
r
Rn → tE →
− E. For every cohomology class c ∈ H i (BSO(n); Z), we define a tautological
q
class τc (E) for the smooth bundle M → E →
− B by the formula
τc (E) := q! β ∗ (c) ∈ H i−n (B; Z),
where q! : H ∗ (E; Z) → H ∗−n (B; Z) is the Gysin map (“integration along the fiber”),
arising from the Serre spectral sequence for the fiber bundle E → B. (See [Mor01, pag.
148-150].) We say that τc (E) ∈ H i−n (B; Z) is a class of positive degree (resp. degree zero)
if i > n (resp. i = n).
Our next result is another instance of rigidity for the associated vertical tangent bundle.
It has the consequence that the rational tautological characteristic classes of a smooth
bundle with nonpositively curved fiber depend only on the characteristic classes of the
abstract fiber.
Recall that a topological Rn -bundle is a fiber bundle whose fiber is homeomorphic to
n
R . Its structure group is denoted by TOP(n) and consists of all self-homeomorphisms
of Rn . Additionally we can assume that every topological Rn -bundle has a zero section.
This is possible because the map p : TOP(n) → Rn , defined by p(f ) = f (0) is a fibration
whose base space is contractible. Then TOP(n) is homotopy equivalent to the fiber of p,
namely the group of self-homeomorphisms that fix the origin. The latter corresponds to
the structure group for topological Rn -bundles with a zero-section.
Let ρ : B × M → M be the projection map onto the second factor.
Theorem B. Let M n → E → B be a smooth fiber bundle over a finite simplicial complex
B, with fiber a closed nonpositively curved n-dimensional manifold (n 6= 3). Assume that
the bundle is fiber homotopically trivial and let Φ : E → B × M be a fiber homotopy
equivalence. Then tE and the pullback of the tangent bundle of M along the composition
ρ
Φ
E−
→B×M −
→ M are isomorphic as topological Rn -bundles.
Remark 1. Although Theorems A and B appear to be essentially the same, they are not.
In fact in Theorem A we obtain a homeomorphism which does not necessarily cover the
given fiber homotopy equivalence between the smooth bundles. Thus Theorem B is not a
consequence of Theorem A, and viceversa.
As a consequence of Theorem B we have:
Corollary B.1. Let M n → E → B be a smooth fiber bundle as in the statement of
Theorem B (without excluding n = 3). Assume that the bundle is oriented. Then for all
i > n and for any rational cohomology class c ∈ H i (BSO(n); Q),
τc (E) = 0.

(1)

Remark 2. If one assumes that the fiber in Corollary B.1 is negatively curved, it is
possible to drop the condition of fiber homotopy triviality and still get the vanishing of the
rational tautological classes in positive degrees (cf. Theorem F and Example a) below).

Remark 3. Tautological classes of degree zero of (not necessarily fiber homotopically
trivial) oriented smooth M n -bundles q : E → B over a path-connected space B satisfy the
following equation:
hτc (E), [1B ]i = hα∗ (c), [M ]i ,

if c ∈ H n (BSO(n); Q),

(2)

where α : M → BSO(n) denotes the classifying map for the tangent bundle of M and
[1B ] ∈ H0 (B; Q) denotes the image of the generator of H0 (B; Z) and [M ] ∈ Hn (M ; Q) the
fundamental class of M .
To prove this equation, identify the abstract fiber M with some concrete fiber M∗ ,
∗ ∈ B. Now, if ι : M ,→ E denotes the inclusion map we obtain a morphism of smooth
M -bundles

Thus equation (2) follows straightforwardly from the naturality of the tautological classes.
One can actually realize many non-vanishing classes (in degree zero) appearing in the
previous remark by bundles with nonpositively curved fibers, indeed with negatively curved
fibers. Here is an example: let c ∈ H 4k (BSO(4k); Q) be a monomial of degree 4k in the
rational Pontrjagin classes p1 , . . . , pk such that the corresponding Pontrjagin number of the
complex projective space CP 2k is non-zero [MS74, p.194]. By Ontaneda’s work on smooth
Riemannian hyperbolization [Ont14], the cobordism class of CP 2k can be represented by
a closed negatively curved smooth 4k-manifold M . Hence the corresponding tautological
class τc (M ) of the smooth bundle M → M → ∗ over a point does not vanish, in fact it
equals its corresponding Pontrjagin number by the equation (2).
A modification of the proofs of Theorem B and Corollary B.1 yields the following
theorem and its corollary. Recall that a smooth bundle M → E → B is a nonpositively
curved bundle if each concrete fiber Mx can be endowed with a nonpositively curved metric
gx in a way that the metrics gx vary continuously from fiber to fiber (c.f. [FO10]).
Caveat. Not every smooth bundle with nonpositively curved fibers is a nonpositively
curved bundle. In fact, for every closed negatively curved manifold M of dimension greater
than 9, it is possible to construct smooth M -bundles over a circle which cannot be given
a fiberwise nonpositively curved metric [FO15].
Theorem C. Let E → B and E 0 → B be fiber homotopy equivalent smooth M n -bundles
over a finite simplicial complex B, where M n is a closed smooth manifold of dimension
n 6= 3. Assume that M → E → B is a nonpositively curved bundle. If Φ : E → E 0 is a
fiber homotopy equivalence then Φ∗ (tE 0 ) and tE are isomorphic as topological Rn -bundles
over E.
Corollary C.1. Under the hypothesis of the Theorem C (including n=3), the bundles
E → B and E 0 → B have the same rational tautological characteristic classes, provided
they are oriented and the fiber homotopy equivalence Φ preserves the orientation.

4

This invariance of the characteristic classes under fiber homotopy equivalence can be
used to obtain vanishing results for characteristic classes in concrete cases where the fiber
is a torus or a closed hyperbolic manifold, without the assumption of fiber homotopy
triviality.
Theorem D. Let Tn → E → B be a smooth fiber bundle over a compact smooth manifold B with fiber an n-dimensional torus Tn . Then the rational Pontrjagin classes of its
associated vector bundle r : tE → E over E, vanish.
Recall that every rational cohomology class c ∈ H ∗ (BSO(n); Q) can be expressed as a
polynomial in the Pontrjagin classes and the Euler class, such that the Euler class in each
monomoial has degree at most 1. Also, equation (2) and the fact that the Euler characteristic of a torus is identically zero, imply that the tautological class τe (E) corresponding
to the Euler class e ∈ H n (BSO(n); Q) of an oriented torus bundle Tn → E → B vanishes.
Hence we obtain the following corollary:
Corollary D.1. Let Tn → E → B be an oriented torus bundle over a compact smooth
manifold B. Then τc (E) = 0 for all c ∈ H ∗ (BSO(n); Q).
Theorem E. Let M → E → B be an oriented smooth fiber bundle over a finite simplicial
complex B, with fiber an n-dimensional (n ≥ 3) (real, complex or quaternionic) hyperbolic
manifold. Then τc (E) = 0 for all c ∈ H i (BSO(n); Q) with i > n.
Theorem E also follows from the next more general result, which is proved by different
methods in the Appendix.
q

Theorem F. Let M → E →
− B be an oriented smooth M -bundle over a finite simplicial
complex B. Assume that M n (n ≥ 3) is a nonpositively curved closed manifold such that
Out(π1 M ) is finite and π1 M is centerless. Then τc (E) = 0 for all c ∈ H i (BSO(n); Q)
with i > n.
Examples.
a) Theorem F holds when M is a closed negatively curved Riemannian manifold of
dimension at least 3 ([Gro87, Theorem 5.4.A], cf. Remark 7).
b) Theorem F also holds if M is a nonpositively curved locally symmetric space of nonc such that M
c is a metric
compact type, such that it has no finite sheeted cover M
product A×B of Riemannian manifolds where A is 2-dimensional. Notice that in this
case Out(π1 M ) is finite by Mostow’s strong rigidity theorem [Mos73, Theorem 24.1],
and the fundamental group is centerless as shown for example in [Ebe83, p.210].
c) The conclusion of Theorem F fails if one allows the outer automorphisms group of
the fundamental group of the fiber to be infinite, yet the fundamental group itself can
be centerless. For an example, consider the product E × E of an oriented surface
q
bundle N → E →
− B over a closed surface B with itself. Denote by τL (E × E) the
tautological class corresponding to the L-genus of t(E × E) → E × E, i.e.


τL (E × E) = (q × q)!
p2 (t(E × E)) + p1 (t(E × E)) ∈ H 4 (B × B; Q).

It is not difficult to conclude that
hτL (E × E), [B × B]i = sign (E × E) = (sign E)2 .
And it is known (see [Ati69] or [Mor01, p.155-160]) that there exist surface bundles
over surfaces for which sign E 6= 0.

Note that the example b) does not apply to the bundle E × E → B × B since N × N
obviously has a 2-dimensional metric factor. On the other hand, there are closed
irreducible nonpositively curved 4-dimensional Riemannian manifolds M (i.e. no
finite sheeted cover of M is a nontrivial metric product) which are locally isometric
to N ×N (i.e. the universal cover of M is isometric to the product of hyperbolic spaces
H × H) and hence satisfy the conditions of example b). Therefore the fundamental
group π1 M is centerless and Out(π1 M ) is finite. Consequently Theorem F applies
to oriented smooth bundles with fiber M . The existence of such manifolds N is a
consequence of [Joh88, Theorem C] and [Shi63, §6].

Under the additional assumption that the fiber M of a smooth bundle satisfies the
Strong Borel Conjecture, we can show the invariance of the tautological classes under
fiber homotopy equivalence of M -bundles. We say that a closed manifold M satisfies the
Strong Borel Conjecture (SBC) if, for all k ≥ 0, every self-homotopy equivalence of pairs
(M × Dk , M × S k−1 ) → (M × Dk , M × S k−1 ) which is a homeomorphism when restricted
to the boundary M × S k−1 is homotopic (relative to the boundary) to a homeomorphism,
where Dk is a k-dimensional closed disc. For example, every closed nonpositively curved
Riemannian manifold of dimension ≥ 5 satisfies SBC, since it is topologically rigid [FJ90].
(See [FJ98] for more results about topological rigidity).
Theorem G. Let Φ : E → E 0 be a fiber homotopy equivalence between M -bundles p : E →
B and q : E 0 → B over a finite simplicial complex B. Assume that M is a closed smooth
manifold which satisfies SBC. Then Φ∗ (pi (tE 0 )) = pi (tE), where pi (tE) ∈ H 4i (E; Q)
denotes the i-th rational Pontrjagin class of tE → E.
Corollary G.1. Let E → B and E 0 → B be oriented smooth M -bundles over a finite
simplicial complex B. Assume that M satisfies SBC. If there is an orientation preserving
fiber homotopy equivalence E → E 0 , then
τc (E) = τc (E 0 )
for all c ∈ H ∗ (BSO(n); Q).
Remark 4. With the exception of Theorem D and Corollary D.1, all the other results
stated above can be proven under the more general assumption that the base space B is a
paracompact, Hausdorff space which is homotopy equivalent to a finite simplicial complex
B (for example, B could be a compact topological manifold [KS69]). In that case the proofs
follow from rather direct arguments involving pull-backs of bundles along some homotopy
equivalence B → B and a homotopy inverse. We do not state them in that generality in
order not to obscure the main ideas.

we prove B and Corollary B.1. Theorem C and Corollary C.1 are proven in Section 4.
In Section 5 we prove Theorem D, Corollary D.1 and Theorem E. Since the proofs of
Theorems F and G and Corollary G.1 follow a different strategy than that used to prove

Topological type of the vertical tangent bundle

In this section we prove Theorem A. We handle the cases n ≥ 4, n = 2 and n = 1
separately. We will make use of the following:
Lemma 2.1. [FW91, Corollary 2.7] Let n ≥ 4 and k be given. Then there is a δ > 0
such that if X k is a k-dimensional complex, p : E → X k is a vector bundle with fiber Rn ,
p0 : E 0 → X 0 is a topological Rn -bundle, and fˆ : E → E 0 is a bundle map that covers
f : X → X 0 and such that the restriction of fˆ to each fiber is a δ-map, then f ∗ (E 0 ) is
isomorphic to E as a topological Rn -bundle.
A map g : Y → Z between two metric spaces Y and Z is a δ-map if diam(g −1 (z)) < δ,
for each z ∈ Z.
Here and in the next sections we will need the following construction: Let Γ be a group.
Recall that if X is a right Γ-space and Y is a left Γ-space, then we can define X ×Γ Y
to be the quotient space X × Y / ∼, where the equivalence relation on X × Y is given by
(x, y) ∼ (x0 , y 0 ) if there exists g ∈ Γ such that x0 = xg −1 and y 0 = gy.
π
Let Γ → EΓ −
→ BΓ be the universal principal Γ-bundle over BΓ and F be a left
Γ-space. The associated fiber bundle over BΓ with fiber F is denoted by
F → EΓ ×Γ F → BΓ,
where the bundle projection sends a class [e, x] ∈ EΓ ×Γ F to π(e).
Proof of Theorem A.
Case n ≥ 4: Our proof in this case is essentially a parametrized version of the proof

Note that the restriction of the bundle map τ E −−−−−−−−−→ B × T M −→ T M to each
fiber over x ∈ B is a homeomorphism. Thus the proof of Theorem A in the case n ≥ 4
will be completed as soon as we prove the following lemma:
Lemma 2.2. tE and τ E are isomorphic topological Rn -bundles over E.

Proof. We prove this lemma by first showing that tE and τ E are isomorphic as microbundles. (We refer the reader to [Mil64] for the basic material about microbundles.) To see
this, first choose a continuously varying family of Riemannian metrics gx , x ∈ B, on each
fx → M

fiber Mx . Let exp gx : T M

rise to a map

ζ : tE → τ E = (1, q)∗ (E
As gx depends continuously on x, the function on Mx that assigns to each point in
Mx its injectivity radius, varies continuously over x ∈ B. Since B and Mx are both
compact, let r > 0 be the minimum among all these injectivity radii. Denote by Nr (Mx )
an r-neighborhood
of Mx in T Mx . Then the restriction of the map ζ to the neighborhood
S
Nr (E) = x∈B Nr (Mx ) of the zero section E in tE, is an embedding into a neighborhood
of the zero section in τ E. This proves that tE and τ E are isomorphic microbundles.
Hence, by Kister-Mazur’s theorem [Kis64, Theorem 2], tE and τ E must be isomorphic
as topological Rn -bundles. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.2 and Theorem A when
n ≥ 4.
We now prove Theorem A in the remaining cases. Let BDiff(M ) be the classifying space
for the group Diff(M ) of self-diffeomorphisms of M and let BG(M ) be the classifying space
for the associative H-space G(M ) of self-homotopy equivalences of M (see [DL59]). Define
σ : BDiff(M ) → BG(M ) to be the map functorially induced by the inclusion (which is an
H-space morphism) ι : Diff(M ) ,→ G(M ). It follows from [DL59] that two smooth bundles
f1 , f2 : B → BDiff(M ) are fiber homotopy equivalent if and only if σ ◦ f1 is homotopic to
σ ◦ f2 . Thus, if σ is a weak homotopy equivalence, then every fiber homotopically trivial
smooth M -bundle over B is also smoothly trivial (see [Hat02, Proposition 4.22]). This
implies that the associated vertical tangent bundle will be topologically (in fact smoothly)
trivial.
Our strategy to prove Theorem A in lower dimensions consists of proving that the map
σ is a weak homotopy equivalence. For this it suffices to show that ι : Diff(M ) → G(M )
is a weak homotopy equivalence.
Recall also that the space G(X) of self-homotopy equivalences of any aspherical complex X has the homotopy type of Out(π1 X) × K(Center(π1 X), 1) (see [Got65]). It will
also be useful to keep in mind that Diff(M ) = π0 Diff(M ) × Diff0 (M ), where Diff0 (M )
denotes the connected component of the identity.
With all this preparation, we can prove the theorem in dimensions 2 and 1.
Case n = 2: The closed surfaces that support a nonpositively curved metric are the
orientable surfaces of genus ≥ 1 and non-orientable surfaces of genus g ≥ 2.
It follows from classical theorems of Dehn, Nielsen, Baer (see [FM12, Theorem 8.1])
and Mangler [Man39], that for all nonpositively curved closed surfaces M , the inclusion
Top(M ) ,→ G(M ) induces a bijection on connected components. It is also known that the
inclusion Diff(M ) ,→ Top(M ) induces an isomorphism π0 (Diff(M )) ' π0 (Top(M )) (see
[FM12, Theorem 1.13] and [EE69]). Therefore we have an isomorphism ι∗ : π0 (Diff(M )) →
π0 (G(M )) induced by the inclusion Diff(M ) ,→ G(M ). Earle and Eells [EE69] showed that
πi (Diff0 (M )) is trivial for all i ≥ 2 and for all nonpositvely curved surfaces M . Likewise
πi (G0 (M )) = 0 if i ≥ 2, where G0 (M ) is the identity component of G(M ).
Hence it remains to show that ι induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. This
has to be divided into several cases:

10

• (M has genus ≥ 2): Earle and Eells also prove in [EE69] that Diff0 (M ) is contractible.
Since the center of π1 (M ) is trivial, the components of G(M ) are also contractible.
Therefore ι : Diff(M ) → G(M ) induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups.
• (M is a 2-torus): We regard M as a Lie group whose identity element we denote
by e ∈ M . Let p : G(M ) → M be evaluation at e, i.e. p(f ) = f (e). Also, for
g ∈ M , denote by Lg : M → M the map Lg (g 0 ) = gg 0 . Note that the identity map
id : M → M factors through

π1 (M, e) −→
π1 (Diff(M ), id) −

π1 (G(M ), id) −→ π1 (M, e).

Earle and Eells [EE69] show that π1 (Diff(M ), id) is a free abelian group of rank 2.
Then observe that each group in the sequence above is free abelian of rank 2, and
the composition is the identity. This forces ι∗ to be an isomorphism.
• (M is the Klein bottle): There is a smooth action L : S 1 → Diff(M ) of the circle S 1
on M . In order to describe the smooth homomorphism L we think of S 1 = [0, 2]/0 ∼
2 as obtained by identifying the end points of the interval [0, 2]. and we identify M
with the quotient space S 1 × [0, 1]/ ∼, where (z, 0) ∼ (z̄, 1) (here S 1 should be
thought of as the unit circle in the complex plane, and z̄ is complex conjugation).
The action L is then given by L(s)(z, t) = (z, t + s), for s ∈ [0, 2]/0 ∼ 2, where “+”
here is understood to be addition mod Z.
Let ∗ = (1, 0) ∈ M be a base point. Then we have a sequence of continuous maps
L

where p is evaluation at ∗ ∈ M . Now recall that Center(π1 (M )) is an infinity cyclic
group generated by the class in π1 (M, ∗) represented by the orbit of ∗ ∈ M under
this circle action. Then it is easy to see that the induced map

∗
∗
π1 (S 1 ) −→

is an isomorphism.
It is shown also in [EE69] that π1 (Diff(M ), id) is infinite cyclic. Likewise π1 (G(M ), id)
is infinite cyclic since Center(π1 (M, ∗)) is infinite cyclic. Therefore ι∗ must be an
isomorphism.
This concludes the proof of the theorem when n = 2.
Case n = 1: This case follows exactly as with the torus. We only need to recall that
Diff(S 1 ) has only two components each of which has the homotopy type of a circle.

11

Remark 5. When M is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, Gabai shows in [Gab01] that the
identity component of Diff(M ) is contractible. It is also shown in [Gab97] and [GMT03]
that the connected components of Diff(M ) are in canonical bijection with the connected
components of the isometry group Isom(M ) of M . This, combined with Mostow rigidity
theorem, shows that ι : Diff(M ) ,→ G(M ) is a homotopy equivalence.
It would be interesting to know whether Theorem A holds for all smooth bundles with
nonpositively curved 3-dimensional fiber.

Vanishing of tautological classes

In this section we prove Theorem B and Corollary B.1. Let ρ : B × M → M be the
projection onto the second factor.
We now prove Theorem B.
Proof of Theorem B.
Case n ≥ 4: We make use of Ferry and Weinberger’s result (Lemma 2.1) again. Put
a nonpositively curved metric on M and consider the following diagram (with the same
notation as in Section 2)

R -bundles and one easily checks (by compactness of B) that the horizontal top map is
a δ-map when restricted to each fiber, for some δ > 0. The linear structure on the fibers
of T M can be used to adjust this δ so that it is the same as in Lemma 2.1. Therefore
ψ ∗ (τ E) ' B × T M . Thus we have the following isomorphisms of topological Rn -bundles:
tE ' τ E

' Φ∗ (B × T M )
' Φ∗ ρ∗ (T M ),

where the first isomorphism comes from Lemma 2.2. This completes the proof of Theorem
B in the case n ≥ 4.
Case n = 1, 2. Since every fiber homotopically trivial smooth M -bundle is smoothly
trivial (by the proof of Theorem A), then there exists an isomorphism Λ : E → B × M
of smooth M -bundles over B. Since the inclusion ι : Diff(M ) ,→ G(M ) is a (weak)
homotopy equivalence, it follows that Φ ◦ Λ−1 : B × M → B × M is fiberwise homotopic
12

to an isomorphism between smooth M -bundles. This yields to an isomorphism between
vector bundles over B × M , namely:
(ρ ◦ Φ ◦ Λ−1 )∗ (T M ) ' B × T M,
and hence an isomorphism between vector bundles over E:
(ρ ◦ Φ)∗ (T M ) ' Λ∗ (B × T M ) ' tE.
This completes the proof of Theorem B in the case n = 1, 2.
Proof of Corollary B.1. Suppose first that n 6= 3. Denote by F : BSO(n) → BTOP(n)
the “forget both orientation and linear structure” map. Then Theorem B can be rephrased
by saying that
F ◦ β ∼ F ◦ α ◦ (ρ ◦ Φ),

where β : E → BSO(n) and α : M → BSO(n) are the classifying maps for the associated
vertical tangent bundle of q : E → B and the tangent bundle of M , respectively. Note
that the rational Pontrjagin classes can be viewed as characteristic classes for topological
Rn -bundles (see [KS77]), i.e. each universal Pontrjagin class pi ∈ H 4i (BSO(n); Q) has a
preimage under the induced homomorphism
F∗ : H ∗ (BTOP(n); Q) → H ∗ (BSO(n); Q).
This implies that
β ∗ pi = (ρ ◦ Φ)∗ α∗ pi ,
for all i. On the other hand, observe that the Euler class is well defined for oriented
topological Rn -bundles and natural with respect to orientation-preserving bundle maps of
topological Rn -bundles, hence
β ∗ e = ±(ρ ◦ Φ)∗ α∗ e,
where e ∈ H n (BSO(n); Q) is the Euler class.
Since H ∗ (BSO(n); Q) is a polynomial ring with rational coefficients generated by the
Pontrjagin classes and the Euler class, then the last two equations imply
β ∗ c = ±(ρ ◦ Φ)∗ α∗ c
for any c ∈ H ∗ (BSO(n); Q). Hence every rational tautological class τc (E) of positive
degree must vanish.
q
Let now n = 3. Fix a point ∗ ∈ S 1 . If M → E →
− B is a smooth bundle with
q0

nonpositively curved fibers, then so is M × S 1 → E × S 1 −
→ B, where q 0 (a, z) = q(a).
Note that we only have to analyze one possible nonzero cohomology class, namely the first
Pontrjagin class p1 ∈ H 4 (BSO(n); Q). It is easy to see that σ ∗ t(E × S 1 ) ' tE ⊕ ε, where
ε is a trivial line bundle over E and σ : E ,→ E × S 1 sends a ∈ E to (a, ∗). Since the
dimension of M × S 1 is 4, we conclude that:
p1 (tE) = p1 (tE ⊕ ε)

= p1 (σ ∗ t(E × S 1 ))

= σ ∗ ◦ (ρ × idS 1 ◦ Φ × idS 1 )∗ p1 (M × S 1 ) = 0,
13

where the last equation follows from the fact that M × S 1 bounds a closed oriented 5dimensional manifold-with-boundary.
Remark 6. The vanishing of the tautological classes for smooth bundles with 3-dimensional
fibers (without curvature assumptions) is proved by J. Ebert in [Ebe13].

Tautological classes of nonpositively curved bundles

In this section we prove Theorem C. The strategy of proof is the same as in Theorem
e ×Γ M
f when E → B is fiber
B. We construct a space btE which plays the same role as E
homotopically trivial (see Section 2). Assume that M is just a closed smooth manifold
(without curvature conditions). For any ∗ ∈ M define P∗ (M ) to be the set of homotopy
classes (relative to the end points) of paths α : [0, 1] → M whose initial point is ∗. For
a path α and a neighborhood U ⊂ M of α(1), let (α, U ) denote the set of all paths
β : [0, 1] → M such that β(0) = ∗, β(1) ∈ U and there exists a path γ : [0, 1] → U with the
property that γ(0) = α(1), γ(1) = β(1) such that the loop α ∗ γ ∗ β −1 is nullhomotopic.
The sets (α, U ) depend on the homotopy class of α and on the open set U . In fact they
form a basis for the topology of P∗ (M ). With this topology P∗ (M ) is a simply connected
space and the map P∗ (M ) → M sending a class [α] to the endpoint α(1), is a covering
map (see for example [GH81, I.6]). G
Let P(M ) be the disjoint union
P∗ (M ) topologized as follows: For a path α :
∗∈M

[0, 1] → M , and neighborhoods U and V of α(0) and α(1) respectively, let (α, U, V ) denote
the set of all paths β : [0, 1] → M such that β(0) ∈ U , β(1) ∈ V and there exist paths
γU : [0, 1] → U and γV : [0, 1] → V with the property that γU (0) = α(0), γU (1) = β(0),
γV (0) = α(1), γV (1) = β(1) and the loop α ∗ γV ∗ β −1 ∗ γU−1 is nullhomotopic. It is
straightforward that the sets (α, U, V ) are well-defined and that they form a basis for the
topology of P(M ). With this topology the onto map r0 : P(M ) → M , sending a class [α]
to its initial point α(0) is continuous. In fact we have the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1. If the universal cover of M is homeomorphic to Rn , then
r

0
P(M ) −→
M

is a topological Rn -bundle over M .
Proof. LetFU ⊂ M be a simply connected neighborhood of a point ∗ ∈ M . Note that
r0−1 (U ) = x∈U Px (M ). Let us define a map
ρU : r0−1 (U ) → U × P∗ (M )
by ρU ([α]) = (α(0), [γ ∗ α]), where γ : [0, 1] → U is any path in U starting at ∗ and ending
at α(0). It is clear that that this is a fiber preserving homeomorphism, so it defines a local
trivialization for r0 : P(M ) → M . This completes the proof of the lemma as the universal
f ≈ P∗ (M ) of M is homeomorphic to Rn .
cover M

14

We shall need a parametrized version
G of this construction. Let M → E → B be a
smooth fiber bundle. Define btE :=
P(Mx ). This set can be topologized as follows:
x∈B

associated to the fiber bundle E → B, one can construct a concrete principal Diff(M )bundle Q → B whose (concrete) fiber over x ∈ B is the space Diff(M, Mx ) of all diffeomorphisms between M and Mx . Then a topology on btE is given via the bijection from
Q ×Diff(M ) P(M ) onto btE that sends (φ, α) ∈ Diff(M, Mx ) × P(M ) to the path φ ◦ α.
Observe that the natural projection btE → B is, in fact, the P(M )-bundle associated to
E → B.
Define the projection
s0 : btE → E
by s0 ([α]) = α(0). Using the fact that P(M ) → M is Diff(M )-equivariant and that the
natural homeomorphism Q×Diff(M ) M → E is covered by the homeomorphism Q×Diff(M )
P(M ) → btE, the next lemma follows obviously from Lemma 4.1.
Lemma 4.2. If the universal cover of M is homeomorphic to Rn , then s0 : btE → E is a
topological Rn -bundle.
Now assume that the bundle M → E → B is given a fiberwise Riemannian metric gx ,
x ∈ B.
Let v ∈ tE. Then v ∈ T∗ (Mx ) for some x ∈ B and ∗ ∈ Mx . Let γv be the unique
gx -geodesic in Mx such that γv (0) = ∗ and γ̇v (0) = v. Then define
exp : tE → btE
by
exp(v) = [γv ].
Since the restriction of exp to each fiber is continuous and the Riemannian metrics
gx vary continuously from fiber to fiber, exp is a fiber preserving continuous map. Let
s1 : btE → E be defined by s1 [α] = α(1). For each x ∈ B and ∗ ∈ Mx , the map
s1 |s−1 (∗) : P∗ (Mx ) → Mx
0

is a covering map. Thus we can pull-back both the smooth structure and the Riemannian
s0
metric gx from Mx along s1 |s−1 (y) . In this way btE −→
E acquires a fiberwise Riemannian
0
metric (and thus a distance function on each fiber).
Lemma 4.3. The map exp : tE → btE is an expanding map when restricted to each fiber.

Compactness of B and a covering space theory argument (e.g. [FW91, p. 409]) show
that, for all x ∈ B, Φx is a δ-map for some δ ≥ 0. Hence, by Lemma 4.3, the map tE → btE 0
is a fiberwise δ-map. By Lemma 2.1, Φ∗ (btE 0 ) and tE are isomorphic as topological Rn bundles. Proceeding as in the proof of Lemma 2.2, one can easily verify that btE 0 and tE 0
are isomorphic as microbundles and by Kister-Mazur theorem they must be isomorphic
as topological Rn -bundles. Therefore Φ∗ (tE 0 ) and tE are isomorphic as topological Rn bundles.
When n = 1, 2, the result follows from the fact that the fiber homotopy equivalence
Φ is homotopic to an M -bundle isomorphism, provided Diff(M ) ,→ G(M ) is a weak
homotopy equivalence and B is a finite simplicial complex. That Φ is homotopic to an
M -bundle isomorphism can be easily obtained by an inductive argument over the skeleta
of B, using the vanishing of the relative homotopy groups of the pair (G(M ), Diff(M ))
and the homotopy extension property.
In order to prove Corollary C.1 we use the following lemma from [GGRW15, Theorem
5.6]. We will provide a different proof of this lemma in the Appendix.
Lemma 4.4. Let Φ : E → E 0 be an orientation-preserving fiber homotopy equivalence
between oriented smooth M n -bundles over a finite simplicial complex B, where M is a
closed smooth n-manifold. Then Φ∗ (e(tE 0 )) = e(tE), where e(tE) ∈ H n (E; Q) denotes the
Euler class of tE → E.
16

Proof of Corollary C.1. By an obvious modification of the argument given in the proof
of Corollary B.1, one can show that pi (tE) = Φ∗ pi (tE 0 ) for all i. This, together with
Lemma 4.4, implies that τc (E) = q! Φ∗ β 0∗ c for any c ∈ H ∗ (BSO(n); Q), where β 0 : E 0 →
BSO(n) is the classifying map for tE 0 . The result follows from the naturality of the Gysin
map.

Tautological classes of torus and hyperbolic bundles

Let G denote the group of affine diffeomorphisms of the n-dimensional torus Tn , i.e. we
identify Tn with the quotient Rn /Zn (so that GLn (Z) acts naturally on Tn ) and define
G = {f ∈ Diff(Tn )|f (x) = Ax + v, where A ∈ GLn (Z) and v ∈ Tn }.
The proof of Theorem D follows from the following three lemmas:
Lemma 5.1. Every smooth torus bundle Tn → E → B over a CW -complex B is fiber
homotopy equivalent to the pull-back of the bundle Tn → EG ×G Tn → BG along some
continuous map B → BG.
Proof. It suffices to show that the inclusion ι : G ,→ G(Tn ) is a weak homotopy equivalence. For in that case the induced map between classifying spaces BG → BG(Tn ) is also
a weak homotopy equivalence and hence we obtain a bijection between the sets [B, BG]
and [B, BG(Tn )] of homotopy classes of continuous maps from B to BG and to BG(M )
respectively.
To prove that ι is a weak homotopy equivalence we note first that the group G is
isomorphic to a semidirect product GLn (Z) n Tn . Thus πi G = 0 = πi G(Tn ) for all i ≥ 2.
It remains to show that ι induces a bijection between path components and an isomorphism
in π1 .
Recall that GLn (Z) acts naturally on Tn yielding a decomposition of the identity map
on GLn (Z) as
ι

Out(π1 (Tn )) = GLn (Z) → G →
− G(Tn ) → GLn (Z) = Out(π1 (Tn )),
where the first map is the action of GLn (Z) on Tn and the last map is the one sending
a self-homotopy equivalence of Tn to its induced (outer) automorphism in π1 (Tn ). These
two maps induce bijections at the π0 -level. Hence ι : G → G(Tn ) must induce a bijection
at the π0 -level as well.
Let now 0 ∈ Tn denote the identity element of (the abelian group) Tn and for each
v ∈ Tn let Lv : Tn → Tn be the map that sends x ∈ Tn to x + v. The identity map
id : Tn → Tn decomposes as
L

p

ι

Tn −

− G(Tn ) →

where L(v) = Lv and p : G(Tn ) → Tn is the evaluation at 0 ∈ Tn . Thus we have an

ι∗
π1 (Tn , 0) −→
π1 (G, id) −
→ π1 (G(Tn ), id) −→ π1 (Tn , 0),
where each group in the sequence is a free abelian group of rank n. Therefore ι∗ must be
an isomorphism. This completes the proof of the lemma.
17

Lemma 5.2. Let Tn → E → B be a smooth torus bundle over a compact space B and
p
let E 0 →
− B be the pull-back bundle of Tn → EG ×G Tn → BG along a continuous map
B → BG. Suppose that there is a fiber homotopy equivalence Ψ : E 0 → E. Then Ψ∗ tE
and tE 0 are isomorphic as topological Rn bundles over E.
p

Proof. First note that the bundle Tn → E 0 →
− B can be given a fiberwise affine flat
connection in the following way: let V ⊂ B be an open subset such that there is a fiber
preserving diffeomorphism φV : V × Tn → p−1 (V ). Identify Tn with Rn /Zn and endow
it with a flat Riemannian metric g F induced by the Euclidean metric on Rn . Denote by
∇F the Levi-Civita connection of g F . Then we put a connection ∇x on p−1 (x) = Tnx by
“pushing forward” ∇F via φV , i.e.


∇x = φV |{x}×Tn ∇F for x ∈ V.
∗

Now cover B with finitely many open sets V1 , . . . , Vm , as above and define affine connections in a similar way by pushing forward ∇F via diffeomorphisms φVi : Vi ×Tn → p−1 (Vi ).
p
Since the structure group of the bundle E 0 →
− B is the group G of affine diffeomorphisms
of the torus, these connections can be glued together to give rise to a desired fiberwise
affine flat connection ∇x , x ∈ B.
Having a fiberwise affine connection allows us to define an exponential map. Let
v ∈ tE 0 . Then v ∈ T∗ (Tnx ) for some x ∈ B and ∗ ∈ Tnx . Let βv be the unique geodesic
(with respect to the connection ∇x ), such that βv (0) = ∗ and β̇v (0) = v. We define a map
exp∇ : tE 0 → btE 0 between Rn -bundles by
exp∇ (v) = [βv ],
where btE 0 was defined in the previous section. This map is continuous because the affine
connections ∇x vary continuously with x.

show that Ψ
Let gx be the push-forward metric of the flat Riemannian metric on Tn along the
restriction of φV to {x} × Tn . By construction, the Levi-Civita connection of gx is ∇x .
Thus, for all x ∈ V and ∗ ∈ Tnx , we have
dgx (exp∇ (v), exp∇ (w)) ≥ dĝx (v, w), for all v, w ∈ T∗ Tnx ,
where dgx and dĝx are the distance functions on Tnx and T∗ Tnx respectively, induced by the
Riemannian metric gx .
Now let {hx }x∈B be a continuously varying family of Riemannian metrics on the bundle

∇ is a δ-map (for a δ ≥ 0 as in the statement
b
it is straightforward that the composite Ψ◦exp
of Lemma 2.1) when restricted to each fiber. This completes the proof of Lemma 5.2.
Lemma 5.3. Suppose that B is a smooth manifold. Then, for any continuous map f :
B → BG, the rational Pontrjagin classes of the associated vertical tangent bundle η :
t(f ∗ (EG ×G Tn )) → f ∗ (EG ×G Tn ) vanish.
Proof. It suffices to prove that the structure group of r : t(EG ×G Tn ) → EG ×G Tn (and
hence of η : t(f ∗ (EG ×G Tn )) → f ∗ (EG ×G Tn )) can be reduced to the discrete group
GLn (Z). For if that is the case then η is a flat vector bundle over a smooth manifold
and so its rational Pontrjagin classes vanish. (However the rational Euler class does not
necessarily vanish for flat bundles. See [MS74, Appendix C, p. 308, 312]).
To prove that the structure group can be reduced to a discrete group we first note that
there is a left action of G on the tangent bundle T Tn of the torus given by the derivative
of the G-action on Tn . Consider the vector bundle
r̂

Rn → EG ×G T Tn →
− EG ×G Tn ,
where r̂ is defined by
r̂[(e, V )] = [(e, τ (V ))],
and τ : T Tn → Tn is the tangent bundle projection. Now, since GLn (Z) sits in an exact
sequence of groups
1 → Tn → G → GLn (Z) → 1,

the action of G on EG × Tn induces a free action of GLn (Z) on EG ×Tn Tn whose orbit
space is EG ×G Tn . On the other hand, we have the usual action of GLn (Z) on Rn . Thus
we can form a vector bundle
Rn → (EG ×Tn Tn ) ×GLn (Z) Rn → EG ×G Tn .
We claim that t(EG ×G Tn ) and (EG ×Tn Tn ) ×GLn (Z) Rn are isomorphic vector bundles
over EG ×G Tn . This claim proves the lemma because GLn (Z) is the structure group of
the latter vector bundle.
19

To prove the claim we observe that t(EG ×G Tn ) is canonically isomorphic to EG ×G
On the other hand, the derivative of left translation on Tn gives rise to an isomorphism Tn ×Rn ' T Tn and hence to continuous map (EG×Tn Tn )×GLn (Z) Rn → EG×G T Tn
which covers the identity map on EG ×G Tn and is a linear isomorphism on each fiber.
Hence (EG ×Tn Tn ) ×GLn (Z) Rn and EG ×G T Tn are isomorphic vector bundles.

Proof of Theorem D. Using Lemma 5.1, we can find a continuous map f : B → BG
and a fiber homotopy equivalence Ψ : f ∗ (EG ×G Tn ) → E between torus bundles over the
smooth manifold B.
By Lemma 5.2, Ψ∗ (tE) and t(f ∗ (EG ×G Tn )) are isomorphic topological Rn -bundles.
Thus these two bundles have the same rational Pontrjagin classes. But they vanish on the
latter by Lemma 5.3.
We conclude this section by proving Theorem E. Let M be a (real, complex or quaternionic) hyperbolic manifold. By Mostow rigidity theorem [Mos73], there is a group isomorphism
Out(π1 M ) → Isom(M )
such that

ι

Out(π1 M ) → Isom(M ) →
− G(M ) → Out(π1 M )
is the identity map.
Lemma 5.4. Every smooth bundle M → E → B as in the statement of Theorem E is fiber
homotopy equivalent to the pull-back of M → EOut(π1 M ) ×Out(π1 M ) M → BOut(π1 M )
along some continuous map B → BOut(π1 M ).
Proof. The inclusion map ι : Isom(M ) → G(M ) must induce a bijection between components. Also, πi G(M ) = 0 for all i > 0 since π1 M is centerless (see Remark 7 below). This
implies that the induced map BOut(π1 M ) → BG(M ) is a weak homotopy equivalence
and the result follows.
Remark 7. That π1 M n (n ≥ 2) is centerless for a closed negatively curved manifold M
is implicitly proven in [EO73, Section 9]. For the reader’s convenience, here is an outline
f denote a universal cover of M and identify π1 M with the group
of the argument. Let M
f → M . Each element f ∈ π1 M − id leaves invariant a
of deck transformations of M
f
unique geodesic line Lf in M (cf. [BGS85, 7.1]). Suppose Center(π1 M ) 6= 1 and pick
an element g ∈ Center(π1 M ) different from the identity. Let f ∈ π1 M . Since f g = gf ,
f must leave Lg invariant. Hence the deck transformation action restricts to a free and
properly discontinuous action of π1 M on Lg . Therefore the orbit map p : Lg → Lg /π1 M
is the universal covering space for the 1-dimensional manifold Lg /π1 M . Hence both M n
and Lg /π1 M are Eilenberg-MacLane spaces K(π1 M, 1). Therefore the closed manifold
M is homotopy equivalent to a closed 1-dimensional manifold. Hence M itself must be
1-dimensional, which is a contradiction.
Proof of Theorem E. Let f : B → BOut(π1 M ) be a continuous map such that there
is a fiber homotopy equivalence E 0 → E where E 0 = f ∗ (EOut(π1 M ) ×Out(π1 M ) M ).
Since Out(π1 M ) acts on M by isometries, it is easy to equip the associated bundle
20

M → EOut(π1 M ) ×Out(π1 M ) M → BOut(π1 M ) over BOut(π1 M ) with a nonpositively
curved fiberwise Riemannian metric. Thus, by Corollary C.1, τc (E 0 ) = τc (E). But since
Out(π1 M ) is a finite group [Bor69], the rational cohomology of BOut(π1 M ) vanishes in
positive degrees and so the rational tautological classes of the bundle E 0 must be zero in
positive degrees.
Remark 8. Theorem E also follows as particular case of Theorem F in the Appendix.

Appendix

We begin with the proof of Theorem F.
Proof of Theorem F. Let Diff0 (M ) ⊂ Diff(M ) be the subgroup of Diff(M ) consisting of
all self-diffeomorphisms of M which are homotopic to the identity (note that Diff0 (M ) is
different from the identity component of Diff(M ). In fact the former contains the latter).
Consider the following pull-back diagram
e

σ



/ BDiff0 (M )


where B → BDiff(M ) is the classifying map for the bundle q : E → B, and BDiff0 (M ) →
BDiff(M ) is the map induced by the inclusion Diff0 (M ) ,→ Diff(M ). We claim that
σ
e −
B
→ B is a finite sheeted cover of B. To see this, it suffices to prove that the fiber
Diff(M )/Diff0 (M ) of BDiff0 (M ) → BDiff(M ) is finite. But this follows because there is a
one-to-one map Diff(M )/Diff0 (M ) → π0 (G(M )) ' Out(π1 M ), and Out(π1 M ) is finite by
hypothesis.
q
e of M → E →
We now consider the pull-back bundle M → σ ∗ E → B
− B along σ.
e → BDiff0 (M ) → BDiff(M ) →
This bundle is fiber homotopically trivial since the map B
BG(M ) ≈ Bπ0 G(M ) is null-homotopic; which follows from the fact that the composition
Diff0 (M ) ,→ Diff(M ) ,→ G(M ) → π0 G(M ) is a constant map, and BG(M ) → Bπ0 G(M )
is a weak homotopy equivalence (because M is aspherical and π1 M is centerless by assumption).
Hence, by Corollary B.1,
τc (σ ∗ E) = 0
for c ∈ H i (BSO(n); Q) and i > n.
Note also that by naturality of the tautological classes
τc (σ ∗ E) = σ ∗ τc (E).
e Q) is monic. But this follows easily
Thus, it suffices to prove that σ ∗ : H ∗ (B; Q) → H ∗ (B;

We now prove Theorem G. Recall that a closed manifold M satisfies the Strong Borel
Conjecture (SBC) if, for all k ≥ 0, every self-homotopy equivalence of pairs (M × Dk , M ×
S k−1 ) → (M ×Dk , M ×S k−1 ) which is a homeomorphism when restricted to the boundary
M × S k−1 is homotopic (relative to the boundary) to a homeomorphism.
Proof of Theorem G. The first step is proving that the fiber homotopy equivalence Φ
is homotopic to a homeomorphism. Let B 0 ⊂ B 1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ B k = B be the skeletal filtration
of B.
First consider a 0-simplex v ∈ B. The restriction Φ|p−1 (v) : p−1 (v) → q −1 (v) is a
homotopy equivalence. Thus, by SBC, it is homotopic to a homeomorphism, that is, there
is a homotopy hvt : p−1 (v) → q −1 (v) such that hv0 = Φ|p−1 (v) and hv1 is a homeomorphism.
By taking the corresponding homeomorphism on each 0-simplex of B, we obtain a homeomorphism h0 : p−1 (B 0 ) → q −1 (B 0 ), which is compatible with the bundle projections and
homotopic to the restriction of Φ to p−1 (B 0 ).
We now want to extend this homotopy over the 1-skeleton. Let ∆1 ⊂ B be a 1-simplex
in B with vertices v, w ∈ B. Define subspaces E 1 ⊂ E × [0, 1] and E 01 ⊂ E 0 × [0, 1] by
E 1 = p−1 (v) × [0, 1] ∪ p−1 (∆1 ) × {0} ∪ p−1 (w) × [0, 1]
and
E 01 = q −1 (v) × [0, 1] ∪ q −1 (∆1 ) × {0} ∪ q −1 (w) × [0, 1],

and a homotopy equivalence ψ : E 1 → E 01

if (y, t) ∈ p−1 (w) × [0, 1]
if y ∈ p−1 (∆1 ).

Figure 1: Construction of a homeomorphism homotopic to Φ.
Note that both E 1 and E 01 are homeomorphic to M × D1 . Thus map ψ can be thought
of as a homotopy equivalence of pairs (M × D1 , M × S 0 ) → (M × D1 , M × S 0 ) which is the
homeomorphism h0 when restricted to the boundary p−1 (v)×{1}∪p−1 (w)×{1} ≈ M ×S 0 .
Thus, by SBC, we can find a homotopy

∆ is a homeomorwhich extends hvt and hw

phism. Repeating this process for each 1-simplex of B we obtain a homeomorphism
h1 : p−1 (B 1 ) → q −1 (B 1 ) homotopic to the restriction of Φ to p−1 (B 1 ).
Continuing this way on each skeleton we obtain the desired homeomorphism E → E 0
homotopic to Φ.
The second and final step to prove the theorem is showing that Φ∗ tE 0 and tE are
stably isomorphic as topological Rn -bundles. For this, embed B into the Euclidean space
RN for some N large enough. Take a compact regular neighborhood B of B in RN whose
tangent bundle T B is trivial and such that there is a retraction r : B → B of B onto B.
Let p : E → B and p0 : E 0 → B denote the pull-back bundle of q : E → B and q 0 : E 0 → B
along r respectively. Observe that there are natural fiber homotopy equivalence ϕ : E → E 0
and bundle maps ι̂ : E → E, ι̂0 : E 0 → E 0 covering the inclusion B ,→ B, such that the
following diagram commutes

Hence, by the first step, ϕ∗ T E 0 and T E are isomorphic as topological Rn -bundles.
Therefore ϕ∗ tE 0 ⊕ q ∗ T B and tE ⊕ q ∗ T B are isomorphic as topological Rn -bundles. But
since T B is a trivial vector bundle of rank, say r, then ϕ∗ tE 0 ⊕ εrE and tE ⊕ εrE , where εrE
is the trivial bundle of rank r over E, are isomorphic as topological Rn -bundles.
Finally, the topological Rn -bundle isomorphism above, together with the isomorphisms
ι̂∗ E ' tE and ι̂∗ ϕ∗ tE 0 ' Φ∗ ι̂0∗ tE 0 ' Φ∗ tE 0 , imply that tE⊕εrE and Φ∗ tE 0 ⊕εrE are isomorphic
as topological Rn -bundles. This completes the proof of the theorem.
Proof of Corollary G.1. Recall that
(
Q[p1 , . . . , pk ]
H ∗ (BSO(n); Q) '
Q[p1 , . . . , pk , e]/(e2 − pk )

if n = 2k + 1,
if n = 2k

Then the corollary follows immediately from Lemma 4.4 and Theorem G.
We conclude this article proving Lemma 4.4 which appears in Section 4.
Lemma 4.4. Let Φ : E → E 0 be an orientation-preserving fiber homotopy equivalence
between oriented smooth M n -bundles over a finite simplicial complex B, where M is a
closed smooth n-manifold. Then Φ∗ (e(tE 0 )) = e(tE), where e(tE) ∈ H n (E; Q) denotes the
Euler class of tE → E.
Proof of Lemma 4.4. Assume first that the base space B is a k-dimensional oriented
manifold (possibly with boundary). In that case both E and E 0 are compact (n + k)manifolds (possibly with boundary).
Let E ×B E → B be the pull-back of the product bundle E × E → B × B along the
diagonal map B → B × B and denote by δ : E → E ×B E the fiberwise diagonal map.

23

Define similarly the bundle E 0 ×B E 0 → B and the diagonal map δ 0 : E 0 → E 0 ×B E 0 .
Observe that the Euler class of tE (resp. tE 0 ) can be computed by the formula
e(tE) = δ ∗ δ! (1) (resp. e(tE 0 ) = δ 0∗ δ!0 (1)).
Here δ! is defined via Lefschetz duality as the map making the following diagram commutative:
δ!

H 0 (E)
ηE ∩



δ∗

Hn+k (E, ∂(E))

/ H n (E ×B E)


ηE×B E ∩

/ Hn+k (E ×B E, ∂(E ×B E))

where ηE ∈ Hn+k (E, ∂E) denotes the orientation class of E. We also have the following
commutative diagram of pairs:
(E, ∂E)
Φ



(E 0 , ∂E 0 )

δ

δ0

/ (E ×B E, ∂(E ×B E))


Φ×B Φ

/ (E 0 ×B E 0 , ∂(E 0 ×B E 0 ))

We now make use of the two diagrams above to compute:
Φ∗ e(tE 0 ) = Φ∗ δ 0∗ δ!0 (1)
= δ ∗ (Φ ×B Φ)∗ δ!0 (1)

= δ ∗ (Φ ×B Φ)∗ δ∗0 ηE 0

= δ ∗ (Φ ×B Φ)∗ δ∗0 Φ∗ ηE

= δ ∗ (Φ ×B Φ)∗ (Φ ×B Φ)∗ δ∗ ηE
= δ ∗ δ ∗ ηE

= δ ∗ δ! (1) = e(tE).
Here, a bar on a homology class denotes its Poincaré - Lefschetz dual and the sixth equation
follows from the naturality of the cap product and the fact that Φ ×B Φ is a homotopy
equivalence. This completes the proof of the theorem when B is manifold with boundary.
Now suppose that B is a finite dimensional simplicial complex. Embed B in RN , for
some N sufficiently large. Let W be an oriented regular neighborhood of B in RN such
that W is a manifold-with-boundary. Denote by r : W → B a retraction of W onto B. We
can pull-back the bundles E → B and E 0 → B along the retraction r : W → B to obtain
M -bundles E → W and E 0 → W respectively. These two bundles are fiber homotopy
equivalent via the restriction of idW × Φ : W × E → W × E 0 to E. Hence, if we denote
this restriction map by Ψ, we have
Ψ∗ (e(tE 0 )) = e(tE).

24
