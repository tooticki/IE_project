LAYERED POSETS AND KUNEN’S UNIVERSAL COLLAPSE
SEAN D. COX
Abstract. We develop the theory of layered posets, and use the notion of
layering to prove a new iteration theorem (Theorem 6): if κ is weakly compact
then any universal Kunen iteration of κ-cc posets (each possibly of size κ) is
κ-cc, as long as direct limits are used sufficiently often. This iteration theorem
simplifies and generalizes the various chain condition arguments for universal
Kunen iterations in the literature on saturated ideals, especially in situations
where finite support iterations are not possible. We also provide two applications: (1) for any n ≥ 1, a wide variety of < ωn−1 -closed, ωn+1 -cc posets
of size ωn+1 can consistently be absorbed (as regular suborders) by quotients
of saturated ideals on ωn (see Theorem 7 and Corollary 8); and (2) for any
n ∈ ω, the Tree Property at ωn+3 is consistent with the Chang’s Conjecture
(ωn+3 , ωn+1 ) ։ (ωn+1 , ωn ) (Theorem 9).

Theorem 1 ([25]). If κ is regular uncountable, then any finite support iteration of
κ-cc posets is κ-cc.
For iterations which are not finite support, the situation is much trickier. A
commonly used theorem in these more general situations is:
Theorem 2. [see Theorem 16.30 of Jech [14]] Let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal and let α be a limit ordinal. Let Pα be an iteration such that for each β < α,
Pβ = Pα ↾ β satisfies the κ-chain condition. If Pα is a direct limit and either
• cf(α) 6= κ or
• cf(α) = κ and there are stationarily many β < α such that Pβ is a direct
limit
then Pα satisfies the κ-chain condition.
The difficult part of applying Theorem 2 is typically the verification that Pβ is
κ-cc when Pβ is an inverse limit. Usually this is taken care of simply by iterating
small posets, as in the following corollary, which is heavily used throughout the set
theory literature:
Corollary 3. [Baumgartner [1]; see also Proposition 7.13 of Cummings [5]] If κ is
inaccessible and hPα , Q̇β | α ≤ κ, β < κi is an iteration such that:
• For all α < κ: Pα |Q̇α | < κ
• A direct limit is taken at κ and on a stationary set of limit stages below κ
Then Pκ has the κ-cc (in fact is κ-Knaster).
What if, in the statement of Corollary 3, we don’t assume that each Q̇α is forced
to have size < κ? This is in general a difficult problem, even if the posets Q̇β
are assumed to be highly closed; in fact there is a countable support iteration of
length ω of countably closed, ω2 -cc posets which fails to be ω2 -cc (Exercise V.5.23
of Kunen [18]). A prominent family of iterations which do not use small posets are
the so-called universal Kunen iterations. Kunen introduced the first version in [17]
to prove that saturated ideals on ω1 are consistent relative to huge cardinals. There
he assumed κ was a huge cardinal and defined a κ-length finite support iteration
hPα , Q̇β | α ≤ κ, β < κi where, importantly, each Q̇α was forced to have size κ and
was in fact from an inner model of V Pα .1 He used the Knaster property of the Silver
collapse, together with Theorem 1 about finite support iterations, to prove that Pκ
had the κ-cc. The poset Pκ is highly universal, even for many posets of size κ;
contrast this with the Levy Collapse Col(ω, < κ) which is only universal for posets
of size < κ. The strong universality property of Pκ is the key to obtaining master
conditions which enable one to construct a saturated ideal in the final model.
Laver generalized Kunen’s universal iteration to contexts where larger supports
were used, in order to obtain saturated ideals on ω2 and beyond (see [7] for a discussion of the history). However in those settings the κ-cc preservation of the resulting
universal iteration had to be checked on a case-by-case basis,2 and seemingly was
believed to be a somewhat delicate issue (see Remark 20.3 of Cummings [5]). We
prove that, at least if κ is weakly compact, then the situation isn’t really delicate
1Namely, Q̇ is the Silver collapse to turn κ into α+ , as defined in the model V Vα ∩Pα in the
α
case that Vα ∩ Pα is a regular suborder of Pα , and trivial otherwise. See Section 5 for a discussion
of such iterations.

at all; any universal Kunen iteration of κ-cc posets—that is, where Q̇β is forced by
Vβ ∩ Pβ to be κ-cc3—will be κ-cc, provided that direct limits are used often.
The proof heavily uses the notion of a layered poset. Layering has previously
appeared in the literature in the form of so-called layered ideals (e.g. [12]), but it
is a general property of posets which is quite useful and interesting. A poset P is
κ stationarily layered iff there are stationarily many Q ∈ Pκ (P) which are regular
suborders of P; κ club layering is defined similarly.
Among the basic facts we prove about layering is the following lemma, proved
in Section 3.3:
Lemma 4. If P is κ stationarily layered then P is κ-Knaster.
The converse is, in general, false; see Cox-Lücke [3]. In [3] it is also proved that
weak compactness of κ is equivalent to “every κ-cc poset is κ stationarily layered”.
In short:
κ-stationarily layered =⇒ κ-Knaster =⇒ κ-cc
and if κ is weakly compact then the 3 notions are equivalent (and highly productive).
In this paper, the notion of layering is used to prove the following general theorems about universal Kunen iterations. See Section 5 for a general discussion of
universal Kunen iterations, and precise statements of the theorems.
Theorem 5. (See Theorem 49 for the precise statement) If κ is Mahlo then any
universal Kunen iteration of sufficiently κ-layered posets is κ-stationarily layered,
provided direct limits were taken at all inaccessible γ ≤ κ.
Theorem 6. (See Corollary 50 for the precise statement) If κ is weakly compact
then any universal Kunen iteration of κ-cc posets is κ-stationarily layered, provided
direct limits were taken at all inaccessible γ ≤ κ.
Note that, in particular, by Lemma 4 the universal Kunen iteration is κ-Knaster
in the conclusion of both theorems.
We give several applications of Theorem 6. The statement of the meta-mathematical
Theorem 7 below is necessarily somewhat technical; the role of the parameter r in
(1) is to allow, for example, that the forcing is defined inside Hκ++ using some bookkeeping device; e.g. a parameter which is a κ+ -to-one surjection from κ+ → Hκ+
used to define some iteration of length κ+ . See Corollary 8 for specific examples of posets which satisfy the requirements of Theorem 7.
Theorem 7. Assume φ(−, −) is a set theoretic formula with two free variables,
and ZFC proves the following: whenever κ is a successor of a regular cardinal then
there exists an r ∈ Hκ++ such that, letting µ be the cardinal predecessor of κ:

	
H
Sr,φκ++ := z ∈ Hκ++ |(Hκ++ , ∈) |= φ(z, r) is a < µ-closed,
(1)
κ+ -cc poset of size at most κ+
Then: whenever V is a model of ZFC and V |= “µ < κ are regular cardinals and
κ is a huge cardinal”, there is a < µ-closed poset in V which forces the following
statements:
• κ = µ+ = 2µ and 2κ = κ+ ;
• There is a normal, saturated ideal J on κ;
3Note this is an apparently weaker assumption than requiring that Q̇ is forced by P to be
β
β
κ-cc, though in the end they are equivalent if κ is weakly compact.

• There exists some r ∈ Hκ++ such that (1) holds, and there exists some
regular embedding
H
e : Sr,φκ++ → ℘(κ)/J
The formula φ(−, −) in the assumptions of Theorem 7 can be designed in ways
to specify a particular ωn , or to specify that certain other requirements are met,
if desired.4 The following corollary lists some specific examples which satisfy the
requirements of Theorem 7. We say that R absorbs Q if there exists a regular
embedding from Q → R.
Corollary 8. Fix n ∈ ω, n ≥ 1. Each of the following posets can consistently be
absorbed by the quotient of a saturated ideal on ωn :
(1) Jensen’s < ωn -closed forcing of size ωn+1 (under GCH) to add an ωn Kurepa tree (see [5]).
(2) The forcing to add a single Hechler subset of ωn ([6]).
(3) A < ωn−1 -closed, ωn+1 -Suslin tree.
(4) The ωn+1 -length, < ωn−1 -support iteration of adding Hechler subsets of
ωn−1 ([6]). More generally, any sufficiently definable5 < ωn−1 -support iteration of length ωn+1 which uses < ωn−1 -closed posets of size ≤ ωn at each
step.
(5) ≤ ωn−1 -support, ωn+1 -length iteration of Sacks(ωn−1 ) (as in Kanamori [15])
(6) (the following poset can consistently be absorbed into the quotient of a saturated ideal on ω2 ): The σ-closed, ω2 -cc poset of size ω3 from Shelah [24],
which he used to force 2ω1 = ω3 together with a generalized version of Martin’s Axiom for a certain subclass of the σ-closed, ω2 -cc posets.
Finally we prove that a certain instance of Chang’s Conjecture is consistent the
Tree Property:
Theorem 9. If µ < κ are both regular and κ is a huge cardinal, then there is a
forcing extension which satisfies the following:
• κ = µ+ ;
• the Chang’s Conjecture (µ+3 , µ+ ) ։ (µ+ , µ) holds; and
• The Tree Property holds at µ+3 .
In particular, for any n ∈ ω, the tree property at ωn+3 is consistent with the Chang’s
Conjecture
(ωn+3 , ωn+1 ) ։ (ωn+1 , ωn )
The paper is organized as follows:
• Section 2 includes some preliminaries;
• Section 3 introduces layered posets; proves that layering implies the Knaster
condition; provides some examples; and proves a useful lemma about layering and elementary embeddings.
4Note that κ is definable in (H
κ++ , ∈), as “the 2nd largest cardinal”. So, for example, if one
has in mind a definable κ+ -cc forcing which only has the desired properties when, say, κ = ω2 ,
then one can simply insert “and the 2nd largest cardinal is ω2 ” into the formula φ(−, −). This
H ++

will have the effect of making Sr,φκ
into the trivial poset when κ 6= ω2 . Similarly, if one has in
mind a definable κ+ -cc forcing which only makes sense when 2κ = κ+ , then simply insert “and
the 2nd largest cardinal satisfies GCH” into the formula φ; this would have the effect of making
H ++

Sr,φκ

into the trivial poset when 2κ > κ+ .

2. Preliminaries
2.1. Regular embeddings and quotient forcing. If p, q are conditions in a
poset P, we write p ≤ q to mean that p is stronger than q, p k q to mean that p
and q are compatible, and p ⊥ q to mean that p and q are incompatible. Given
P-names τ and τ ′ , we will say that τ is equivalent to τ ′ (modulo P) iff P τ = τ ′ .
The Maximality Principle is the fact that if p P ∃x φ(x) where φ is a statement
in the forcing language, then there is some P-name τ such that p  φ(τ ).
A function e : P → Q is a regular embedding iff it is order and incompatibility
preserving, and whenever A is a maximal antichain in P then e[A] is a maximal
antichain in Q. If id : P → Q is a regular embedding then P is called a regular
suborder of Q. If id : P → Q is order and incompatibility preserving—but not
necessarily regular—then we say P is a suborder of Q.
Definition 10. Let P be a suborder of Q and q ∈ Q. We say that p ∈ P is a reduct
of q into P iff
∀p′ ≤P p p′ kQ q.
If p is also ≥Q q then we say p is a nice reduct of q into P.
The following lemma is standard, but we provide the short proof for convenience.
Note that the reduction characterization yields a Σ0 characterization of the regular
suborder relation.
Lemma 11. Let P be a suborder of Q. The following are equivalent:
(1) P is a regular suborder of Q;
(2) For every q ∈ Q there is a reduct of q into P
Proof. Assume P is a regular suborder of Q. So every maximal antichain in P is a
maximal antichain in Q. Assume for a contradiction there is some q ∈ Q which has
no reduct; this implies that
D⊥q := {p ∈ P | p ⊥Q q} is dense in P.
Let G be Q-generic with q ∈ G. Then G ∩ P is P-generic and so G ∩ D⊥q 6= ∅,
contradicting that G is a filter on Q and that q ∈ G.
For the other direction, let A be a maximal antichain in P. Let q be any condition
in Q, and let pq be any reduct of q into P. Let a ∈ A be compatible in P with pq ,
and let p′ ∈ P witness this compatibility. Because p′ ≤ pq , it follows that p′ kQ q.
Then q is compatible with a ∈ A. Because q was arbitrary then A is maximal in
Q.

Definition 12. Suppose e : P → Q is a regular embedding, p ∈ P, and q ∈ Q. We
write q ≤e p to mean:


q Q p̌ ∈ ě−1 [ĠQ ] ↑

6

SEAN D. COX

where



ě−1 [ĠQ ]



↑ denotes the set of all conditions in P which are weaker than

some condition in ě−1 [ĠQ ].
If q ∈ Q and p ∈ P, we say that p is an e-reduct of q iff
∀p′ ≤P p e(p′ ) kQ q.
Note that if e = id and Q is separative, then q ≤e p is equivalent to q ≤Q p.
Lemma 13. Suppose B and C are complete boolean algebras, and e : B → C is a
regular embedding. Let c ∈ C and set
bec := supB {b ∈ B | b is an e-reduct of c}.
Then
(1) bec is an e-reduct of c and moreover is the largest one;
(2) bec ≥e c (as in Definition 12)
Proof. To see that bec is an e-reduct of c, let b′ ≤ bec with b′ 6= 0. By the definition
of bec there is some b which is an e-reduct of c such that b′ ∧ b 6= 0. Then b′ ∧ b ≤ b
and because b is an e-reduct of c we have e(b′ ∧ b) k c. Because e is order preserving
and b′ ∧ b ≤ b′ we have e(b′ ) k c, which completes the proof that bec is an e-reduct
of c. Clearly it is the largest such, by its definition as the sup of all e-reducts of c.
To see that bec ≤e c: suppose toward a contradiction that this were false; then
there is some c′ ≤ c such that
c′ C bec ∈
/ e−1 [ĠC ].
It follows easily that
c′ ⊥ e(bec ).

(2)

Let b′ be any e-reduct of c′ . Then b′ ∨ bec > bec ; otherwise b′ ≤ bec and because
c′ k e(b′ ) this would contradict (2). Because b′ ∨ bec > bec and bec is defined as the
supremum of all e-reducts of c, then b′ ∨ bec is not a reduct of c. We will prove that
b′ ∨ bec is in fact an e-reduct of c which will yield a contradiction and complete the
proof. So let r ≤ b′ ∨ bec , r 6= 0. Then r k b′ or r k bec .
• CASE 1: r k b′ . Because b′ is an e-reduct of c′ then e(r) k c′ , and because
c′ ≤ c this implies e(r) k c.
• CASE 2: r k bec . Then because bec is an e-reduct of c (by the first part of
the proof), we have e(r) k c.

Corollary 14. Suppose B is a complete regular subalgebra of C, and c ∈ C. Let
bc := supB {b ∈ B | b is a reduct of c}.
Then bc is a nice reduct of c.
Proof. This follows immediately from Lemma 13 by taking the e from that lemma
to be the identity map from B → C.

The following fact is well-known:
Lemma 15. If e : P → Q is a regular embedding of separative posets, then e lifts
to a regular embedding of their Boolean completions.

If the map e from Lemma 15 is the identity—i.e. if P is a regular suborder of
Q—then we can essentially take the lifting to the boolean completions to be the
identity map, which simplifies the notation a bit. In other words, if P is a regular
suborder of Q then we can extend both to view ro(P) as a regular suborder of ro(Q).
I’m grateful to Joel David Hamkins for pointing this out to me on MathOverflow:
Lemma 16 ([13]). Suppose P is a regular suborder of the separative poset Q. In
ro(Q) define

	
B(P) := supro(Q) (X) | X ⊆ P .

Then B(P) is a complete regular subalgebra of ro(Q), and P is dense in B(P) (so
B(P) ≃ ro(P)).
Definition 17. Let P be a regular suborder of the separative poset Q, and let q ∈ Q.
Set
WeakestReductro(P) (q) = sup{b ∈ ro(P) | b is a reduct of q}
where we are viewing ro(P) as a regular complete subalgebra of ro(Q) as in Lemma
16.
We will often use the following convention:

Convention 18. Assume P is a regular suborder of Q, σ is a statement in the P
forcing language, and q ∈ Q. We will write q Q σ to mean the following: whenever
G is Q-generic with q ∈ G, then V [G ∩ P] |= σG∩P .
Lemma 19. Let P be a regular suborder of Q, q ∈ Q, and σ a statement in the
forcing language of P. Then the following are equivalent:
(1) q Q σ (as in Convention 18);
(2) WeakestReductro(P) (q) ro(P) σ
Proof. By Corollary 14, WeakestReductro(P) (q) is a nice reduct of q into ro(P); i.e.
it is a reduct and moreover WeakestReductro(P) (q) ≥ q.
To see (1) implies (2): if not then there is some p′ ≤ WeakestReductro(P) (q) in
ro(P) such that p′ forces the negation of σ. But because WeakestReductro(P) (q) is a
reduct then p′ is compatible in ro(Q) with q, yielding a contradiction to assumption
(1).
To see that (2) implies (1): this is simply because WeakestReductro(P) (q) ≥ q;
any ro(Q)-generic which includes q must also include WeakestReductro(P) (q), so
assumption (2) ensures that σ holds in any such generic extension.

If P is a regular suborder of Q and GP is generic for P, then in V [GP ] the
quotient Q/GP is defined as the set of all q ∈ Q which are compatible (in Q) with
every member of GP ; the ordering of Q/GP is the order inherited from Q. The
following fact is standard:
Fact 20. If P is a regular suborder of Q, then
Q is forcing equivalent to P ∗ Q̌/ĠP .
We will also use the following fact in the proof of Theorem 7:
Fact 21. If P is a regular suborder of Q and Q has the κ-cc, then
P

Q̌/ĠP has the κ-cc.

8

SEAN D. COX

Proof. Suppose for a contradiction that there is some p ∈ P forcing that there is a
κ-sized antichain in the quotient; by the Maximaility Principle there is a P-name
hq̇ξ | ξ < κi which is forced by p to be an antichain in the quotient. But then
{(p, q̇ξ ) | ξ < κ} is easily seen to be an antichain in P ∗ Q̌/ĠP . By Fact 20 this
implies Q fails to have the κ-cc, a contradiction.

2.2. Generalized Sacks forcing. The proof of Theorem 9 will make use of the
following generalized Sacks forcing. If T is a subtree of <κ 2, α < κ, and s ∈ α 2, we
say that s splits in T iff both s⌢ 0 and s⌢ 1 are in T .
Definition 22 (Kanamori [15], Definition 1.1). Let κ be a regular uncountable
cardinal. Sacks(κ) is the poset of all subtrees T of <κ 2 such that:
(1) If α < κ is a limit ordinal, s ∈ α 2, and s ↾ β ∈ T for every β < α, then
s ∈ T.
(2) If s ∈ T then there is a t ∈ T such that s ⊂ t and t splits in T .
(3) If α < κ is a limit ordinal, s ∈ α 2, and s ↾ β splits in T for cofinally many
β < α, then s splits in T .
T is stronger than S iff T ⊆ S.
Lemma 23. If T ∈ Sacks(κ) and f : κ → 2 is a cofinal branch through T (i.e.
f ↾ α ∈ T for all α < κ), then
Cf,T := {α < κ | f ↾ α splits in T } is a closed, unbounded subset of κ.
Proof. By requirement 3 of Definition 22 it suffices to show that Cf,T is cofinal in
κ. Fix any α0 < κ. Because f ↾ α0 ∈ T then by requirement 2 of Definition 22
there is some g ⊇ f ↾ α0 which splits in T ; i.e. g ⌢ 0 ∈ T and g ⌢ 1 ∈ T . Let βf,g be
the maximal ordinal such that g ↾ βf,g = f ↾ βf,g . Notice that
βf,g ≥ α0 .
We claim that f ↾ βf,g splits in T . For conceptual clarity, consider two cases:
(1) If βf,g = dom(g) then g ⌢ 0 = (f ↾ βf,g )⌢ 0 and g ⌢ 1 = (f ↾ βf,g )⌢ 1. Because
both of these functions are in T by the assumption that g splits in T , this shows
that f ↾ βf,g splits in T . (2) If βf,g < dom(g), then g ↾ βf,g = f ↾ βf,g and
g(βf,g ) 6= f (βf,g ). Because g ↾ (βf,g + 1) and f ↾ (βf,g + 1) are both in T this again
implies that f ↾ βf,g splits in T .

Kanamori ([15], Lemma 1.2) proves that Sacks(κ) is < κ closed, but we will
actually need a bit more. Recall that if D is a subset of a poset P, we say D is
directed iff whenever d0 , d1 ∈ D then there is a d ∈ D such that d ≤ d0 and d ≤ d1 .
A poset P is < κ-directed closed iff whenever D is a < κ-sized, directed subset of
P, then D has a lower bound in P.
Lemma 24. For all regular uncountable κ, the poset Sacks(κ) is < κ-directed
closed.
T
Proof. Let D be a < κ-sized, directed subset of Sacks(κ). We prove that D
inherits all requirements of conditionhood from Definition 22. The only nontrivial
part is verifying requirement 2; all other requirements of Definition 22 are easily
inherited by arbitrary
T intersections of conditions.
T
So suppose s ∈ D; we need to find some t ⊃ s which splits in D.

Claim 24.1. There is an f : κ → 2 extending s such that f is a cofinal branch
through every member of D.
Proof. We recursively
define f ↾ α for all α ∈ [dom(s), κ] and verify inductively
T
that f ↾ α ∈ D for all such α. First set f ↾ dom(s) := s. If α is a limit ordinal
then f ↾ α is defined as the union of f ↾ β for all β < α;
T the induction hypothesis
and requirement 1 of Definition 22 ensure that f ↾ α ∈ D.
Now suppose f ↾ α is defined; we want to define f ↾T(α + 1). We claim that at
least one of (f ↾ α)⌢ 0 or (f ↾ α)⌢ 1 is an element of D. If not, then there are
T0 , T1 ∈ D such that (f ↾ α)⌢ 0 ∈
/ T0 and (f ↾ α)⌢ 1 ∈
/ T1 . Because D is directed,
there is a T ∈ D such that T ⊆ T0 ∩ T1 . Now the induction hypothesis ensures that
f ↾ α ∈ T ; and requirement 2 of Definition 22 ensures that (f ↾ α)⌢ i ∈ T for at
least one i ∈ {0, 1}. But then (f ↾ α)⌢ i ∈ Ti , a contradiction.

Let f : κ → 2 be as given by the claim, and
T for every T ∈ D let Cf,T be the
club from Lemma 23. Because |D| < κ, C := T ∈D Cf,T is club in κ. Pick some
β ∈ C ∩ (dom(s), κ). Then f ↾ β splits in every member of D; i.e.
\
(f ↾ β)⌢ 0 and (f ↾ β)⌢ 1 are both in
D.
Because f ↾ β ⊃ s this completes the proof.

2.3. Other miscellaneous background. A regular uncountable cardinal κ is:
• weakly compact iff κ is inaccessible and whenever M is a transitive ZF −
model of size κ and M is closed under < κ sequences, then there is a
transitive set N and an elementary embedding j : M → N with critical
point κ. There are many other well-known equivalent formulations.
• almost huge iff there is an elementary embedding j : V → N with critical
point κ such that N is closed under < j(κ) sequences.
• huge iff there is an elementary embedding j : V → N with critical point κ
such that N is closed under j(κ) sequences.
The Tree Property holds at κ iff whenever T is a tree of height κ and each level
of T is of size < κ, then T has a cofinal branch. If
µ3 > µ2 > µ1 > µ0
are cardinals then the “Chang’s Conjecture” (µ3 , µ2 ) ։ (µ1 , µ0 ) means: whenever
A is a first order structure on µ3 in a countable language, then there is an X ≺ A
such that |X| = µ1 and |X ∩ µ2 | = µ0 . Various versions of this are discussed at
length in [7].
The proof of Theorem 7 makes use of Foreman’s Duality Theorem, specifically
regarding the “Magidor variation” of Kunen’s original argument. All of these topics
are covered extensively in [7]; but we only need a special case. To describe the
~ = hUγ | γ < δi is
special case, we recall (see Kanamori [16]) that a sequence U
called a (κ, δ) tower iff each Uγ is a normal measure on Pκ (γ), and if γ < γ ′ then
Uγ ′ = {x ∈ Pκ (Vγ ′ ) | x ∩ Vγ ∈ Uγ }.
Given such a tower, if γ < γ ′ there is an elementary embedding kγ,γ ′ : ult(V, Uγ ) →
ult(V, Uγ ′ ) such that jγ ′ = kγ,γ ′ ◦ jγ , where jγ ′ and jγ are the ultrapower maps for
Uγ ′ and Uγ , respectively. This yields a directed system of ultrapower maps and a

in that case (by (3)) notice that NU~ is closed under < jU~ crit(jU~ ) sequences. We
use the following fact:
Fact 25. Suppose j : V → N is a huge embedding with critical point κ; i.e. j

that (δ + )NU~ < (δ + )N .
An ideal I on a regular uncountable cardinal κ is called normal if it is closed
under diagonal unions, and saturated iff ℘(κ)/I has the κ+ -chain condition. The
following theorem is a special instance of the Duality Theorem of Foreman [7]
(see also Foreman-Komjath [10] or section 5.3 of Cox-Zeman [4] for more detailed
proofs).

the corresponding embedding. Suppose P ⊂ Vκ is a κ-cc poset, ĊSilv (κ, < δ) is the
P-name for the Silver collapse which turns δ into κ+ (described in Section 3.2),
and in NU~ there exists a regular embedding
ι : P ∗ ĊSilv (κ, < δ) → jU~ (P)
such that ι is the identity on P.6 Let G ∗ H be generic for P ∗ ĊSilv (κ, < δ) over
V . Then in V [G ∗ H] there is a normal ideal I(jU~ ) on κ such that ℘(κ)/I(jU~ ) is
forcing equivalent to jU~ (P)/ι[G ∗ H].
We use one more fact about normal ideals:
Fact 27. [[7]] If I is a normal, saturated ideal on κ then ℘(κ)/I is a complete
boolean algebra.
3. Layered posets
3.1. Basic theory of Layered posets. A layered poset is, roughly, a poset which
has many small regular suborders, where “many” is typically taken to mean club
or stationarily many. There are two common definitions of stationarity for subsets
of Pκ (H), where H is any set of cardinality at least κ:
• Strong stationarity, as Definition 8.21 of Jech [14]. A set S ⊆ Pκ (H) is
strongly stationary in Pκ (H) iff S ∩ C 6= ∅ for all C ⊆ Pκ (H) which are
cofinal in (Pκ (H), ⊂) and closed under increasing unions of length < κ.
• Shelah’s Weak stationarity or generalized stationarity, e.g. as in Larson [19]
and Foreman [7]. A set S ⊆ Pκ (H) is weakly stationary in Pκ (H) iff
whenever F : [H]<ω → H then there is some X ∈ S which is closed under
F . The set of all X ⊆ H which are closed under F is denoted by CF .
6I.e. ι(p, 1̇) = p for every p ∈ P.

For κ = ω1 the notions “strongly stationary in Pκ (H)” and “weakly stationary
in Pκ (H)” are equivalent, but for κ ≥ ω2 they may differ, due to the presence or
absence of Changs Conjecture; this is discussed in detail in Foreman [7].
Convention 28. Unless stated otherwise, in this paper “stationary” will refer to
Jech’s Strong stationarity.7
For example, in the proof of Lemma 4, it is essential that the stationary layering
occurs on models M such that M ∩ κ ∈ κ; this happens automatically in any
strongly stationary set, but if κ > ω1 it might fail for a weakly stationary set.
The following is the main definition:
Definition 29. Let P be a poset, κ a regular uncountable cardinal with κ ≤ |P|,
and
Regκ (P) := {X ∈ Pκ (P) | X is a regular suborder of P}.
(1) P is κ stationarily layered iff Regκ (P) is stationary in Pκ (P).
(2) P is κ club layered iff Regκ (P) contains a club (i.e. Pκ (P) − Regκ (P) is not
stationary).

(3) P is κ cofinally layered iff Regκ (P) is cofinal in Pκ (P), ⊆ .
Recall Convention 28; we are referring to Jech’s strong stationarity here.
Remark 30. By standard lifting and projecting of stationary sets (see Theorem
8.27 of [14]), the following are equivalent:
(1) P is κ stationarily layered;
(2) The set
{X ∈ Pκ (H) | X ∩ P is a regular suborder of P}
is stationary in Pκ (H), where H is any set such that P ⊂ H.
The analogous equivalence also holds if we replace “stationary” by “contains a
club” (and if we replace “stationary” by “weakly stationary”).
Definition 31. Assume P ⊂ H and S ⊆ Pκ (H) is stationary. We say that P is
layered a.e. on S iff {M ∩ P | M ∈ S} − Regκ (P) is nonstationary. Equivalently,
M ∩ P is regular in P for all but nonstationarily many M ∈ S.
A special case of the following lemma that appears in the literature is Shelah’s
work on layered ideals.
Lemma 32. [Shelah (see [7])] If P is κ weakly stationarily layered—i.e. if the set
of regular suborders of P is weakly stationary in Pκ (P)—then P is κ-cc.
Proof. Let A be a maximal antichain of P. Let θ be a sufficiently large regular
cardinal so that A, P ∈ Hθ . By Remark 30 (the “weakly stationary” version), there
is an X ≺ (Hθ , ∈, {P, A}) (note that A ∈ X) with |X| < κ such that X ∩ P is
a regular suborder of P. Because X ≺ (Hθ , ∈, {P, A}), then A ∩ X is a maximal
antichain in X ∩P. Because X ∩P is regular in P, then A∩X is a maximal antichain
in P. It follows that A ∩ X = A; i.e. that A is a subset of the < κ-sized set X. So
|A| < κ.

7We could alternatively stick with weak stationarity, but require that our stationary subsets
of Pκ (H) concentrate on those M ∈ Pκ (H) such that M ∩ κ ∈ κ.

For posets of size κ, it is often more natural to work with filtrations of the poset
to determine if the poset is layered. A filtration of a set X is a ⊂-increasing, ⊂continuous
sequence hXξ | ξ < cf(|X|)i such that |Xξ | < |X| for all ξ < |X|, and
S
X = ξ<cf(|X|) Xξ . If cf(|X|) is uncountable then any two filtrations agree on a
club subset of cf(|X|). The proof of the following is standard so we omit it.
Lemma 33. Suppose P is a poset of size κ, where κ is regular and uncountable.
The following are equivalent:
(1) P is κ stationarily layered
(2) For some filtration hQα | α < κi of P, there are stationarily many α < κ
such that Qα is a regular suborder of P.
(3) For every filtration hQα | α < κi of P, there are stationarily many α < κ
such that Qα is a regular suborder of P.
If M ≺ (Hθ , ∈, P) and p ∈ P, then p is called an (M, P)-master condition iff
p  M̌ [Ġ] ∩ ORD = M̌ ∩ ORD. The following correspondence between κ-cc and
master conditions is due to Mekler:
Lemma 34 (Mekler [21]). Given a poset P and a regular uncountable cardinal κ,
the following are equivalent:
(1) P is κ-cc;
(2) There are stationarily many M ∈ Pκ (Hθ ) such that 1P is an (M, P)-master
condition.
If κ = ω1 then these are also equivalent to: there are club many M ∈ Pκ (Hθ )
such that 1P is an (M, P)-master condition.
Just as Lemma 34 characterizes κ-cc in terms of master conditions, κ-stationary
layering can be expressed in terms of strong master conditions, as defined by
Mitchell [22]. If M is a model, P is a poset, and p ∈ P, Mitchell [23] defined p
to be an (M, P) strong master condition iff every p′ ≤ p has a reduction in M ∩ P.
Note that if P ⊂ Hθ and X ≺ (Hθ , ∈, P), then by elementarity X ∩ P is a suborder of P (i.e. we have order and ⊥ preservation in both directions). The following
observation is straightforward, using the “reduct” characterization of regularity in
Lemma 11:
Observation 35. If X ≺ (Hθ , ∈ P), the following are equivalent:
• X ∩ P is a regular suborder of P.
• 1P is an (X, P)-strong master condition (in the sense of Mitchell [23]).
Corollary 36. Given a poset P and a regular uncountable cardinal κ, the following
are equivalent:
(1) P is κ stationarily layered;
(2) There are stationarily many M ∈ Pκ (Hθ ) such that 1P is a (M, P) strong
master condition.
Proof. This follows immediately Observation 35.



3.2. Examples of layered posets. Many commonly used posets are stationarily
layered under mild cardinal arithmetic assumptions; in fact they are often layered
a.e. on some natural stationary set S (i.e. “club-layered relative to S”). Here are
a few common examples of κ-stationarily layered posets, all under the assumption

LAYERED POSETS AND KUNEN’S UNIVERSAL COLLAPSE

that κ is (strongly) inaccessible. Much less than inaccessibility is needed for most
of these, given the right cardinal arithmetic assumptions.
(1) Trivially, any poset of density < κ is κ-club layered;
(2) Any poset as in the hypothesis of Corollary 3 is κ stationarily layered.
(3) If κ is inaccessible then the Levy collapse Col(µ, < κ) is layered a.e. on the
stationary set of < µ-closed models in Pκ (Hκ ) (recall we are using strong
stationarity here, so almost every such model has transitive intersection
with κ). If µ = ω then it is club-layered on Pω1 (Vκ ).
(4) If κ is inaccessible then the Silver Collapse CSilv (µ, < κ) that turns κ into
µ+ is layered a.e. on the stationary set of µ-closed elements of Pκ (Hκ ). The
poset CSilv (µ, < κ) is the µ-support product of {Col(µ, η) | η < κ} with
bounded domain. That is, conditions are partial functions p : µ × κ → κ
such that |p| ≤ µ, p(α, η) < η whenever (α, η) ∈ dom(p), and there is some
ξp < µ such that whenever (α, η) ∈ dom(p) then α < ξ.
(5) If κ is Mahlo then the Easton Collapse E(µ, < κ) is layered a.e. on the
stationary set of W ∈ Pκ (Vκ ) such that |W | = W ∩ κ ∈ κ, µ ∈ W ,
and <|W | W ⊂ W . Conditions are partial functions p : µ × κ → κ such
that p(α, η) < η whenever (α, η) ∈ dom(p), there is some ξ < µ such
that α < ξ whenever (α, η) ∈ dom(p), and the support of p—i.e. the set
{η < κ | ∃α (α, η) ∈ dom(p)}—is Easton above µ. A set X ⊂ κ is Easton
above µ iff |X ∩ γ| < γ whenever γ ∈ (µ, κ) is regular.
(6) The poset B(µ, α, κ) from Foreman-Komjath [10] is layered a.e. on the stationary set of < α-closed elements of Pκ (Vκ ). Here µ < α < κ are regular
cardinals and conditions are elements of the < α-support product of κmany copies of Col(µ, α) which have a bounded domain. More precisely,
let Ci := Col(µ, α) for each i < κ (so these are κ-many
copies of Col(µ, α)).
Q
A condition is a < κ-supported function p ∈ i<κ Ci such that there is
some ξp < µ such that dom(p(i)) ⊆ ξp for all i ∈ supp(p).
(7) Any κ-cc poset—and any µ-support product of κ-cc posets where µ < κ—is
κ stationarily layered, if κ is weakly compact, by [3].
We prove that the Easton collapse E(µ, < κ) is layered on the stationary set
indicated above; the proofs that the other posets are layered is similar (with the
exception of the weakly compact example, which is proved in [3]). Pick any W ≺
(Hκ+ , ∈) such that γW := |W | = W ∩ κ ∈ κ and <|W | W ⊂ W . Let p ∈ E(µ, < κ),
and let S be the support of p, which is Easton above µ (as defined in 5 above).
Because S is Easton, γW is regular (inaccessible), and W is closed under < γW
sequences, then p ↾ W is an element of W . Note that because W ∩ κ ∈ κ then
p ↾ W is the same as p ↾ (µ × γW ). We need to prove that it is a reduct. Suppose
p′ ∈ W is a condition extending p ↾ W . Then clearly p′ ∪ p is a function, because
p′ , being in W , does not make any commitments for those η ∈
/ W . Let ξp′ be
the uniform bound for p′ ’s domains, and ξp be the uniform bound for p’s domains.
Then max(ξp′ , ξp ) is a uniform bound for p ∪ p′ . So p ∪ p′ is a condition.
Remark 37. Naturally-defined layered posets as in the examples listed above typically have κ-stationarily layered products, simply because the stationary sets witnessing layering have stationary overlap. For example, Foreman-Komjath [10] consider
products of the form
S(α, < κ) × B(µ, α, κ)

14

SEAN D. COX

where κ is inaccessible. As remarked above, S(α, < κ) is layered a.e. on the set
of α-closed models, and B(µ, α, κ) is layered a.e. on the set of < α-closed models.
Because the intersection of these stationary sets is the set of α-closed models, which
is stationary, it follows that their product is layered a.e. on the set of α-closed
models; this and other issues surrounding products are addressed in detail in CoxLücke [3]. It also follows from the more general fact that if pi is a strong master
condition for (M, Pi ) for i ∈ {0, 1} then (p0 , p1 ) is a strong master condition for
(M, P0 × P1 ); see Mitchell [23].
3.3. Relation to Knaster property. A poset is called κ-Knaster if every κ-sized
collection of conditions can be refined to a κ-sized collection of pairwise compatible conditions. Clearly κ-Knaster implies κ-cc. The main feature of the Knaster
property used in the literature is:
Fact 38. [see [5]] If P is κ-Knaster and Q is κ-cc, then P × Q is κ-cc.
We now prove Lemma 4, that κ-stationary layering implies κ-Knaster. The proof
is modeled after the proof of Theorem 4.1 of Soukup [26].
Let P be κ stationarily layered, and let X be a κ-sized collection of conditions in
P. By the layering assumption of P, there is an M ≺ (Hθ , ∈, P) such that X ∈ M ,
|M | < κ, M ∩ κ ∈ κ, and M ∩ P is a regular suborder of P. Because |M | < κ = |X|,
there is some p ∈ X − M . Let p|M be any reduct of p into M ∩ P. Let Z be
a maximal subset of X with the property that Z consists of pairwise compatible
conditions, and every member of Z is compatible with p|M . Since X and p|M
are members of M , we can without loss of generality take Z ∈ M . We claim that
|Z| = κ. If not then because Z ∈ M and |Z| < κ, it follows that |Z| ∈ M ∩ κ. And
because M ∩ κ is transitive,8
(4)

Z ⊂ M.

It follows that Z ( Z ∪ {p}. Now p is clearly compatible with p|M , and Z ∪ {p}
is a subset of X; thus we will obtain a contradiction to maximality of Z if we can
prove that Z ∪ {p} is pairwise compatible. Let r ∈ Z; then (4) implies r ∈ M ∩ P
and, by the requirements on Z, we have r kP p|M . Since r and p|M are in M then
this compatibility is witnessed by some r′ ≤ r, p|M such that r′ ∈ M . Because
r′ ≤ p|M it follows that r′ kP p, which implies that r kP p. This proves that Z ∪ {p}
is pairwise compatible, completing the proof.
Remark 39. It is natural to wonder if the implication of Lemma 4 can be reversed.
If κ is weakly compact then the answer is yes; and for non-weakly compact cardinals
the answer is, in general, no; see Cox-Lücke [3].
3.4. Layering and elementary embeddings. The following simple but useful
lemma will be used in the proof of Theorem 6 (and also in [3]):
Lemma 40. Suppose
• j : H → N is a Σ0 elementary embedding of ZF C − models
• κ = crit(j)
• j[H] ∈ N (equivalently j ∈ N )
• Q ∈ H is a poset
• N |= Q is κ-cc
8Note the essential use of transitivity of M ∩ κ in this part of the argument.

• ([Q]<κ )H = ([Q]<κ )N .
Then j[H] ∩ j(Q) is a regular suborder of j(Q).
Proof. Because j[H] ∈ N and “X is a regular suborder of Y ” is a Σ0 property
(using the reduct characterization), it suffices to prove that N believes j[H] ∩ j(Q)
is regular in j(Q). Clearly j ↾ Q : Q → j(Q) is order and incompatibility preserving,
so we only need to check that whenever A ∈ N is a maximal antichain in Q then
j[A] is maximal in j(Q). So let A ∈ N be maximal antichain in Q. Because
([Q]<κ )H = ([Q]<κ )N and N |= Q is κ-cc” then A ∈ H and has size < κ in H.
Since crit(j) = κ this implies that j(A) = j[A]. But by elementarity, N believes
that j(A) is maximal in j(Q), completing the proof.

4. Coherent, conservative systems of reduction operations
The iteration we describe in the main theorem isn’t presented in the usual way,
so we will make the following ad-hoc definition; it is really a definition about how
a poset is presented:
Definition 41. A sequence of posets hLα | α < θi will be called a generalized
iteration iff:
• Each Lα consists of partial functions on α;
• The restriction map παβ is a forcing projection from Lβ → Lα for all β ≥ α.
That is, παβ is order preserving, and whenever q ≤ παβ (p) then there is some
p′ ≤ p such that παβ (p′ ) ≤ q.
• The identity map is a regular embedding from Lα → Lβ for all α ≤ β.
The following definition very important for the main theorem. If L is a suborder
of R, a map π : R → L is called a reduction operation iff π(r) is a reduct of r into
L for all r ∈ R;9 i.e. whenever ℓ ≤ π(r) and ℓ ∈ L then ℓ is compatible with r.10
~ = hLα | α < θi and R
~ = hLα | α < θi are two generalized
Definition 42. Assume L
iterations of the same length θ, and assume that Lα is a regular suborder of Rα for
all α < θ. A system of reduction maps hπα : Rα → Lα | α < θi will be called:
• coherent iff πα (r ↾ α) = πβ (r) ↾ α for all α ≤ β < θ and all r ∈ Rβ ;
• conservative iff whenever:
– α ≤ β;
– ℓβ ≤ πβ (rβ )
– rα′ is some condition in Rα witnessing compatibility of ℓβ ↾ α with
rβ ↾ α;
then there is some rβ′ ∈ Rβ such that rβ′ ↾ α = rα′ , and rβ′ witnesses
compatibility of ℓβ with rβ .
The conservativity requirement is used to pass inverse limit stages of inductively
defined reduction mappings. Roughly, it says that if you’re checking compatibility
(in a proof that some condition is a reduct), you can do it without strengthening
what you did earlier.
9See Section 2 for a discussion of reducts.
10Note that this is not the same as a forcing projection; a forcing projection would require

instead that there is some r ′ ≤ r such that π(r ′ ) ≤ ℓ.

Let Lθ and Rθ be limits of L
limits or both are inverse limits. Then there is a reduction map πθ : Rθ → Lθ such
that ~π ∪ {(θ, πθ )} is a coherent, conservative system of reduction maps.
Proof. We prove the lemma assuming that both Lθ and Rθ are inverse limits, as
this is the hardest case.
Notice that the coherency of ~π ensures that:
[
(5)
∀γ ∈ θ ∩ Lim ∀rγ ∈ Rγ πγ (rγ ) =
πα (rγ ↾ α).
α<γ

Also, the coherency requirement that we desire of πθ compels us to define
[
πθ (r) :=
πα (r ↾ α).
α<θ

That πθ (r) is a condition in Lθ follows from the facts that:
• Coherency of ~π ↾ θ ensures that πβ (r ↾ β) end-extends πα (r ↾ α) whenever
α≤β
• Lθ and Rθ use the same limit type.
We must prove that conservativity is preserved (the proof will also show that πθ
is a reduction mapping). So assume α < θ and
• ℓθ ≤ πθ (rθ )
• rα′ is some condition in Rα witnessing compatibility of ℓθ ↾ α with rθ ↾ α;
We need to find some rθ′ ∈ Rθ such that rθ′ ↾ α = rα′ , and rθ′ witnesses compatibility
of ℓθ with rθ . We construct such an rθ′ using the assumption that ~π is conservative,
together with (5). Namely, recursively define a sequence hrβ′ | α ≤ β ≤ θi as follows:
′
• If rβ′ is defined, let rβ+1
be some condition in Rβ+1 given by the conservativity between β and β + 1. That is:
′
– rβ+1
↾ β = rβ′
′
– rβ+1 witnesses compatibility of ℓθ ↾ (β + 1) with rθ ↾ (β + 1). If index
θ is a trivial coordinate for both ℓθ and rθ —i.e. if ℓθ ↾ (β + 1) = ℓθ ↾ β
and rθ ↾ (β + 1) = rθ ↾ β—then we require that the θ-th coordinate of
′
′
rβ+1
is also trivial; more precisely that rβ+1
= rβ′ .
S
′

• If γ is limit, let rγ = β∈[α,γ) rβ .

The triviality requirement at successor steps of the construction, together with
~ and R
~ use the same limit scheme, ensures that each r′ is
the assumption that L
β
a condition in Rβ . It clear that rβ′ = rβ′ ′ ↾ β whenever β ≤ β ′ , and that rθ′ is as
required.


Though Lemma 43 assumes that the iterations use some mix of inverse and
direct limits, we suspect a similar fact holds for many common iteration schemes
(e.g. RCS iterations).

5. Universal Kunen iterations
The universal Kunen iteration was introduced by Kunen [17] in the first consistency proof of a saturated ideal on ω1 , and is a useful tool when huge embeddings
are involved. Roughly, one has a large cardinal κ and defines some sort of iteration
of length κ, where successor steps are handled as follows: given that 0 < α < κ and
Pα has been defined, if Vα ∩Pα is a regular suborder of Pα , set Pα+1 = Pα ∗ Q̇α where
Q̇α is some poset from the inner model V [Ġα ∩Vα ]; otherwise set Pα+1 = Pα ∗{1}.
In the applications below it will be helpful to describe the Kunen iteration a bit
differently from typical iterations (but these will still be iterations in the general
sense of iteration, that is a commutative system of forcing projections). The scheme
below was roughly described in Foreman [7].
Definition 44. Let κ be an uncountable regular cardinal. A sequence hPα , Q̇β | α ≤
κ, β < κi will be called a universal Kunen iteration iff:
(1) hPα | α ≤ κi is a generalized iteration as in Definition 41;
(2) For each α < κ, the poset Pα+1 has the following form. If Vα ∩ Pα is
not a regular suborder of Pα then we will call α a passive stage and set
Pα+1 = Pα . Otherwise—i.e. if Vα ∩ Pα is a regular suborder of Pα —then
we will call α an active stage and require that Q̇α is a Vα ∩ Pα -name for
a poset,11 and Pα+1 consists of all partial functions f on α + 1 with the
following properties:
• f ↾ α ∈ Pα ;
• If α ∈ dom(f ) then f (α) ∈ V Vα ∩Pα (notice this is a Vα ∩ Pα -name,
not merely a Pα -name) and Vα ∩Pα f (α) ∈ Q̇α .
where the partial ordering is given by:
f1 ≤Pα+1 f0 :≡ f1 ↾ α ≤Pα f0 ↾ α and if α ∈ dom(f0 ) then
f1 (α) ≤Q̇α f0 (α)
α ∈ dom(f1 ) and f1 ↾ α Convention
Pα
where we are using Convention 18, together with the assumption that Vα ∩Pα
is a regular suborder of Pα , to view the statement “f1 (α) ≤Q̇α f0 (α)” as a
statement in the language of Pα .
As usual, we can arrange that P is a set (rather than a proper class) by choosing
a single representative of the various names in the definition (modulo equivalence
of names). We will insist that such a representative is always chosen of minimal
rank. The following is a standard fact:
Fact 45. Suppose γ is regular and R ∈ Hγ is a poset. If τ is a R-name which is
forced to be in Hγ [ĠR ], then there is a R-name τ ′ ∈ Hγ which is R-equivalent to τ
(i.e. R τ = τ ′ ).
Lemma 46. Suppose hPα , Q̇β | α ≤ κ, β < κi is a universal Kunen iteration as in
Definition 44 which uses some mix of inverse and direct limits, and that for every
active α < κ:
(6)

Vα ∩Pα Q̇α ⊆ Vκ [ġα ]

where ġα is the canonical Vα ∩ Pα -name for its generic object. Also assume that Pκ
is a direct limit. Then:
11We emphasize that Q̇ is a V ∩ P -name, not merely a P -name.

(1) Pκ ⊂ Vκ .
(2) If j : V → N is an elementary embedding with critical point κ then:
• j[Pκ ] = Pκ = j(~P)κ ∩ Vκ ;
• If Pκ is κ-cc then κ is an active stage of j(~P) (and thus by reflection
there are many active stages of ~P).
Proof. For item 1: because Pκ is a direct limit then it suffices to prove that each
Pα ⊂ Vκ (for α < κ); note that given the setup of Definition 44, a direct limit is
simply a union.
We prove by induction that Pα ⊆ Vκ for every α < κ.12 For limit stage α this
follows simply from the induction hypothesis and inaccessibility of κ (the latter is
needed if Pα is, say, an inverse limit). Now suppose Pα ⊆ Vκ and let f ∈ Pα+1 . We
need to prove that f ∈ Vκ ; because f ↾ α ∈ Pα ⊂ Vκ by the induction assumption,
it only remains to show that f (α) ∈ Vκ . This follows from assumption (6) and Fact
45 (together with our convention that a representative for a name is always chosen
of minimal rank). The proof that Vκ ∩ j(~P)κ ⊂ Pκ is proved similarly.
For item 2: by item 1 j ↾ Pκ is just the identity map on Pκ . If f ∈ Pκ then because
Pκ is a direct limit, f ∈ Pα for some α < κ. So j(f ) = f . Pick any β < α in the
domain of f . Then f ↾ β ∈ Pβ and Vβ ∩ Pβ forces that f (β) ∈ Q̇β . By elementarity
of j, N believes that j(f ) ↾ j(β) = f ↾ β is an element of the j(β) = β-th member of

j(~P), and that j f (β) = f (β) is forced by j(Vβ ∩ Pβ ) = Vβ ∩ j(~P)j(β) = Vβ ∩ j(~P)β
to be a member of j(Q̇β ). This proves that j(f ) = f is a member of j(~P)α , so in
particular a member of j(~P)κ .
Finally, if we know that Pκ is κ-cc, then because crit(j) = κ it follows that
j ↾ Pκ = idPκ is a regular embedding from Pκ → j(Pκ ) = j(~P)j(κ) ; i.e.
R0 := j[Pκ ] is a regular suborder of R2 := j(~P)j(κ) .
But because we now know that R0 = j[Pκ ] is actually a suborder of R1 := j(~P)κ (by
the previous part of the proof), and because R1 = j(~P)κ is regular in R2 = j(~P)j(κ)
(because j(~P) is a generalized iteration), it abstractly follows that R0 = j[Pκ ] is a
regular suborder of R1 = j(~P)κ .13 Since we showed earlier that j[Pκ ] = Vκ ∩ j(~P)κ ,
it follows that κ is an active stage of j(~P).

The following lemma ensures preservation of closure properties:
Lemma 47. Let µ < κ be regular cardinals. Suppose hPα , Q̇β | α ≤ κ, β < κi is a
universal Kunen iteration with the following properties:
• For all (active) α < κ:
Vα ∩Pα Q̇α is < µ closed.
• The iteration uses < µ supports; i.e. for all limit α ≤ κ, Pα consists of
those partial functions f such that dom(f ) is a < µ-sized subset of α, and
f ↾ ᾱ ∈ Pᾱ for all ᾱ ∈ dom(f ).
Then Pκ is < µ closed.
12Recall that we use the convention that all names for conditions are taken to be of minimal

rank.
13In general, if R is a suborder of R , R is a suborder of R , and R is a regular suborder of
0

R2 , it follows easily that R0 is a regular suborder of R1 .

Proof. This is basically the standard proof that < µ-support iterations of < µclosed posets is < µ-closed (as in section 2 of [1]), with a variation at successor
steps due to the requirement of Definition 44 that we only use Vα ∩ Pα -names,
rather than Pα -names.
Fix λ < µ and suppose hfi | i < λi is a descending sequence in Pκ . Note that
hdom(fi ) | i < λi is a ⊆-increasing sequence of < µ-sized sets, and by regularity of
µ it follows that
[
d :=
dom(fi )
i<λ

has size < µ. We recursively define a function f with domain d and verify that f
is a condition in Pκ and is a lower bound for the fi ’s. Suppose α ≤ κ and f (ᾱ)
is defined for all ᾱ < α, and that the following induction hypothesis IHᾱ holds for
each ᾱ < α:
IHᾱ : f ↾ (ᾱ + 1) is a lower bound in Pᾱ+1 for the sequence hfi ↾ (ᾱ + 1) | i < λi

and dom f ↾ (ᾱ + 1) ⊆ d
First observe that the fact that IHᾱ holds for all ᾱ < α immediately implies:

(7)

f ↾ α is a lower bound in Pα for hfi ↾ α | i < λi.

If α = κ we are done, otherwise we need to define f (α) and verify that IHα
holds. If α ∈
/ d then f (α) isn’t defined, i.e. α ∈
/ dom(f ). Then IHα is immediate.
So from now on assume α ∈ d; then α ∈ dom(fi ) for all sufficiently large i < λ, say
for all i ≥ iα . Note that by the definition of the ordering for Pα+1 , together with
the assumption that the fi ’s are descending, it follows that:
(8)

iα ≤ i < j < λ

fj (α) ≤Q̇α fi (α).
=⇒ fj ↾ α Convention
Vα ∩Pα

Then (7) and (8) together imply
hfi (α) | iα ≤ i < λi is descending in Q̇α .
f ↾ α Convention
Vα ∩Pα
Because Vα ∩ Pα forces (by assumption) that Q̇α is < µ closed, then by the Maximality Principle there is a Vα ∩ Pα -name q̇ such that
q̇ is a lower bound for hfi (α) | iα ≤ i < λi.
f ↾ α Convention
Vα ∩Pα
Then set f (α) := q̇. Then IHα clearly holds.

Here is how such universal iterations are typically used; we concentrate on
Kunen’s original construction for concreteness. Suppose j : V → N is a huge
embedding with critical point κ, and let δ = j(κ). Kunen defined a finite support
iteration hPα , Q̇β | α ≤ κ, β < κi as in Definition 44, where one starts by forcing

m yields a lifting of j to a map from V [G ∗ H] → N [G′ ∗ H ′ ], but one can approximate such a lifting in the model V [G′ ] (without actually forcing with H ′ ). Because
this occurs in the δ-cc extension V [G′ ], the resulting derived ideal in V [G ∗ H] will
be δ = κ+V [G∗H] -cc, i.e. saturated. We refer the reader to Foreman [7] for more
details.
Here are some examples of such iterations in the literature on saturated ideals;
the columns of the table correspond to the scheme described in Definition 44 above.
Kunen’s original paper [17] dealt only with ideals on ω1 and used finite support
iteration; Laver showed how to do < µ-support iterations for arbitrary regular
µ in certain situations. In all cases µ < κ are regular cardinals and P0 is the
Levy collapse Col(µ, < κ) or the Silver collapse S(µ, < κ) (see Section 3.2 for the
definitions of these posets). In the table, ġα denotes the canonical Vα ∩ Pα -name

The following is the key technical theorem of this section:
Theorem 48. Let κ be Mahlo and hPα , Q̇β | α ≤ κ, β < κi be a universal Kunen
iteration as in Definition 44, which uses some mix of inverse and direct limits.
Assume W ≺ (Hκ+ , ∈, ~P) is such that |W | = W ∩ κ =: γW ∈ κ and <|W | W ⊂ W .
Assume that:
(1) Pκ is a direct limit;
(2) PγW is a direct limit;
(3) for every α < γW :
Vα ∩Pα Q̇α ⊆ Vκ [ġα ]
where ġα is the canonical Vα ∩ Pα -name for its generic;
(4) for every α < γW :
Vα ∩Pα W̌ [ġα ] ∩ Q̇α is a regular suborder of Q̇α .
(Note this is trivially true for non-active α).
Then W ∩ Pκ is a regular suborder of Pκ .
Proof. Note that Lemma 46 implies Pκ ⊂ Vκ . Fix any W ≺ (Hκ+ , ∈, Pκ ) as in the
hypotheses of the theorem, and set γW := W ∩ κ. We will recursively construct a
coherent, conservative system of reduction operations
(9)

hπαW : Pα → W ∩ Pα |α < γW i.

LAYERED POSETS AND KUNEN’S UNIVERSAL COLLAPSE

21

At the end of the proof we will use the system from (9) to get a reduction operation
from Pκ → W ∩ Pκ .
Let β < γW and assume that the system (9) has been constructed below β; we
need to define πβW . Assume first that β is a successor ordinal, say β = α + 1. So
παW : Pα → W ∩ Pα is a reduction operation. If α is passive then Pβ = Pα and
πβW := παW works. Otherwise α is active and assumption 4 and the Maximality
Principle imply there is some Vα ∩ Pα -name ρ̇ such that
Vα ∩Pα ρ̇ : Q̇α → W̌ [ġα ] ∩ Q̇α is a reduction operation.
W
Given f ∈ Pα+1 , define πα+1

W
πα (f ↾ α). Now consider the Vα ∩ Pα -name ρ̇ f (α) ; assumption 3 implies ρ̇ f (α)
is an element of Vκ [ġα ]∩ W̌ [ġα ]. Because α ∈ W ∈ Γ then Vα ∩Pα ⊂ VγW = W ∩Vκ ;
so Vκ [ġα ] ∩ W̌ [ġα ] is forced to be the same as (W ∩ Vκ )[ġα ] = VγW [ġα ]. By Fact 45,
there is some Vα ∩ Pα -name ẏfW(α) ∈ VγW ⊂ W such that

Vα ∩Pα ẏfW(α) = ρ̇ f (α) .

We use this ẏfW(α) as the α-th coordinate; i.e.

. Finally we check conservativity of ~π W ↾ (α + 1) ∪ {(α + 1, πα+1

Definition 42). Assume:

• h ≤Pα+1 πα+1

• η ≤ α, fη ≤Pη f ↾ η, and fη′ ≤Pη h ↾ η
We need to find some f ′ ∈ Pα+1 such that f ′ ≤Pα+1 f , f ′ ↾ η = fη′ , and f ′ ≤Pα+1 h.
Our inductive hypothesis that ~π W ↾ (α + 1) is conservative ensures that there is
an fα′ ∈ Pα such that fα′ ≤Pα f ↾ α, fα′ ↾ η = fη′ , and fα′ ≤Pα h ↾ α.
Now consider the Vα ∩ Pα -names f (α) and h(α). Now h ↾ α ≤Pα παW (f ↾ α) and

where again we are using Convention 18. Let WeakestReductro(Vα ∩Pα ) h ↾ α be

Because h ∈ W and α ∈ W , it follows that h(α) ∈ W , which in turn implies
(13)

WeakestReductro(Vα ∩Pα ) ro(Vα ∩Pα ) h(α) ∈ Q̇α ∩ W̌ [ġα ].

Because ρ̇ is forced by Vα ∩ Pα to be a reduction from Q̇α → Q̇α ∩ W [ġα ], then (12)
and (13) imply
(14)

WeakestReductro(Vα ∩Pα ) h ↾ α ro(Vα ∩Pα ) ∃q ≤Q̇α f (α) such that q ≤Q̇α h(α).

WeakestReductro(Vα ∩Pα ) h ↾ α ro(Vα ∩Pα ) q̇h(α),f (α) ≤Q̇α f (α) and q̇h(α),f (α) ≤Q̇α h(α)
and by standard ‘definition of names by cases” we can WLOG assume that ∅ Vα ∩Pα
q̇h(α),f (α) ∈ Q̇α and that ∅ Vα ∩Pα q̇h(α),f (α) ≤Q̇α f (α). So

f ′ := fα′ ∪ { α, q̇h(α),f (α) }

is a condition in Pα+1 , f ′ ≤Pα+1 f , and f ′ ↾ η = fα′ ↾ η = fη′ . We only have left to
check that
(16)

f ′ ≤Pα+1 h.

Now
(17)

f ′ ↾ α = fα′ ≤Pα h ↾ α

and f ′ (α) = q̇h(α),f (α) ; so we only have left to prove that
(18)

q̇h(α),f (α) ≤Q̇α h(α).
fα′ Convention
Pα

Moreover, by (17) it in turn suffices to prove
(19)

q̇h(α),f (α) ≤Q̇α h(α).
h ↾ α Convention
Pα

But this follows from (15) and Lemma 19. This completes the proof that ~π W ↾
W
(α + 1) ∪ {(α + 1, πα+1
)} is a coherent conservative system of reduction operations.
This completes the case where β is a successor ordinal.
Now assume β is a limit ordinal (still assuming β < γW ). Because stage β of Pβ
is either an inverse or a direct limit, and because <γW W ⊂ W and β ∈ W , it follows
that Pβ and Pβ ∩ W use the same limit scheme (with respect to hPα | α < βi and
hPα ∩W | α < βi, respectively). So Lemma 43 applies, and ensures that the natural
limit of hπαW | α < βi (depending on the limit scheme used at β) is a reduction,
and thus we obtain a coherent, conservative system of reductions hπαW | α ≤ βi.
We have constructed a coherent conservative system hπαW | α < γW i. Now by
the assumptions that <γW W ⊂ W and that PγW is a direct limit, then PγW and
W ∩ PγW are direct limits of hPα | α < γW i and hW ∩ Pα | α < γW i, respectively.
So we may again invoke Lemma 43 to extend this to a coherent conservative system
/ W , because PγW is a direct limit then we still
hπαW | α ≤ γW i. Although PγW ∈
have that id : W ∩ PγW → PγW is order and incompatibility preserving. This,
together with the existence of the reduction operation πγWW : PγW → W ∩ PγW ,
implies that
W ∩ PγW is a regular suborder of PγW .
Because PγW is a regular suborder of Pκ it follows that
(20)

W ∩ PγW is a regular suborder of Pκ .

Finally, observe that because both PγW = PW ∩κ and Pκ are direct limits, then
(21)

W ∩ P κ = W ∩ P γW .

LAYERED POSETS AND KUNEN’S UNIVERSAL COLLAPSE

23

Note this is a literal equality, because our conditions are partial functions (i.e. direct
limits are simply unions).14 So (20) and (21) together imply that W ∩Pκ is a regular
suborder of Pκ .

The following theorem is almost an immediate corollary of Theorem 48; however
it is typically less useful than Theorem 50, because typically κ is a very large
cardinal in the context of universal Kunen iterations.
Theorem 49. Assume κ is Mahlo, hPα , Q̇β | α ≤ κ, β < κi is a universal Kunen
iteration as in Definition 44 which uses some mix of inverse and direct limits, and
that Pγ is a direct limit for all inaccessible γ ≤ κ.
Let Φ(W, κ) denote the statement that W ≺ Hκ+ , |W | = W ∩ κ ∈ κ, and
<|W |
W ⊂ W . Assume that for each α < κ:
Vα ∩Pα Q̇α is layered a.e. on {M | ΦV [ġα ] (M, κ)}
and
Vα ∩Pα Q̇α ⊂ Vκ [ġα ]
where ġα is the canonical Vα ∩ Pα -name for its generic.
Then Pκ is layered a.e. on the stationary set
Γ := {W | ΦV (W, κ)}.
i.e. for all but nonstationarily many W ∈ Γ, W ∩ Pκ is a regular suborder of Pκ .
In particular, Pκ is κ-Knaster by Lemma 4.
Proof. Note that Γ is stationary because κ is Mahlo, and the assumptions guarantee
(by Lemma 46) that Pκ ⊂ Vκ . For each active α < κ let Ȧα be a Vα ∩ Pα -name
for a first order structure on Hκ+ [ġα ] witnessing the “a.e.” part of the assumption
about Q̇α ; i.e. so that
(22) Vα ∩Pα ∀M M ≺ Ȧα ∧ Φ(M, κ) =⇒ Q̇α ∩ M is a regular suborder of Q̇α .
~ Let α ∈ W ∩ κ =: γ . Because
Now let W ∈ Γ such that W ≺ (Hκ+ , ∈, ~P, Ȧ).
W
|Vα ∩ Pα | < γW then in particular Vα ∩ Pα has the γW -cc, so together with < γW
closure of W and the fact that Ȧα ∈ W we have:
Vα ∩Pα Φ(W [ġα ], κ) and W [ġα ] ≺ Ȧα .
Thus by (22) we obtain:
(23)

∀α < γW

Vα ∩Pα Q̇α ∩ W [ġα ] is a regular suborder of Q̇α .

Then (23), together with our assumptions that Pγ is a direct limit for all inaccessible
γ ≤ κ, implies by Theorem 48 that W ∩ Pκ is a regular suborder of Pκ .

We finally state and prove the precise version of Theorem 6: It tells us that if κ
is weakly compact and direct limits are used at all inaccessibles, then any universal
Kunen iteration of κ-cc posets will be κ-stationarily layered (and thus κ-Knaster).
We emphasize that assumption 3 in the statement of Theorem 50 is only assuming
that Vα ∩ Pα forces Q̇α to be κ-cc; it is NOT assuming that Q̇α remains κ-cc in
V Pα (though this will be the case automatically in the end).
14If f ∈ W ∩ P then W believes there is some β < κ such that f ∈ P ; so this β must be
κ
β
strictly below W ∩ κ = γW . Thus f ∈ W ∩ PγW .

Theorem 50. Suppose κ is weakly compact and hPα , Q̇β | α ≤ κ, β < κi is a
universal Kunen iteration as in Definition 44 which uses some mix of inverse and
direct limits. Suppose
(1) direct limits are taken at all inaccessible γ ≤ κ;
(2) for every active α < κ: Vα ∩Pα Q̇α ⊂ Vκ [ġα ];
(3) Each Q̇α is forced by Vα ∩ Pα to be κ-cc.15
Then Pκ ⊂ Vκ and is layered on some stationary subset of
Γ := {W ∈ Pκ (Vκ ) | W = Vγ for some inaccessible γ < κ}.
In particular Pκ is κ-Knaster by Lemma 4.
Proof. First note that Γ is stationary, because κ is Mahlo. Also Lemma 46 implies
that Pκ ⊂ Vκ . Suppose toward a contradiction that there were some algebra A =
(Vκ , ∈, . . . ) such that
(24)

∀W ∈ Γ W ≺ A =⇒ W ∩ Pκ is NOT a regular suborder of Pκ .

Fix some transitive κ-sized, < κ-closed models H and H ′ such that:
• κ ⊂ H ∈ H ′;
• H ≺ H ′ ≺ (Hκ+ , ∈, {A, ~P})
Because κ is weakly compact, there is some transitive N ′ and an elementary
j : H ′ → N ′ with critical point κ. Because H ∈ H ′ , crit(j) = κ, and H ′ |= |H| = κ,
then
j[H] ∈ N ′ .

(25)

Note also that Pκ (H) ∈ H ′ , and that Pκ (H) ⊂ H ′ because H ′ is < κ-closed and
H ⊂ H ′ . Define

(26)
U := {X ∈ H ′ ∩ P Pκ (H) | j[H] ∈ j(X)}.

Then U is an ultrafilter on H ′ ∩ P Pκ (H) which is < κ-closed in V , and normal
with respect to κ sequences from H ′ ; i.e. if F ∈ H ′ is a regressive function on some
Z ∈ U , then there is a Z ′ ∈ U on which F is constant.16
Claim 50.1. Let Z be the set of W ∈ H ′ ∩ Pκ (H) which satisfy clause 4 of the
assumptions of Theorem 48. Then Z ∈ U .
Proof. (of Claim 50.1) First note that Z is an element of H ′ , because ~P ∈ H ′ .
Suppose for a contradiction that Z ∈
/ U . Then because Z ∈ H ′ and U is an
′
ultrafilter on H ∩ P Pκ (H) , there are U -many W ∈ Γ such that clause 4 fails for
some α < W ∩ κ; that is, U -many W such that
∃αW < γW ∃pW ∈ VαW ∩ PαW
pW VαW ∩PαW Q̇αW ∩ W [ġαW ] is NOT a regular suborder of Q̇αW .
15Notice again this is a weaker assumption than requiring P to force that Q̇ is κ-cc, though
α
α
in the end that will be true as well.
16It is not really necessary to work with both H and H ′ here. We could really use V in place
κ
of the H, and work with the ultrafilter on H ′ ∩ P (κ) derived from j (rather than the ultrafilter
on H ′ ∩ P (Pκ (H)) derived from j), then make an argument at the end involving Skolem hulls
of γ < κ. We use H merely so that the U -measure one sets concentrate directly on the kinds of
model described in Theorem 48, so we can directly apply that theorem after the following claim.

LAYERED POSETS AND KUNEN’S UNIVERSAL COLLAPSE

25

Notice that the map W 7→ (αW , pW ) is regressive, and also an element of H ′ .
So by normality of U with respect to regressive functions from H ′ , there is some
fixed α∗ and a fixed p∗ ∈ Vα∗ ∩ Pα∗ such that for U -many W ∈ Γ:
p∗ Vα∗ ∩Pα∗ Q̇α∗ ∩ W [ġα∗ ] is NOT a regular suborder of Q̇α∗ .
Let A denote the set of such W (so A ∈ U , i.e. j[H] ∈ j(A)). Notice that A ∈ H ′
(it is definable from the regressive function and (α∗ , p∗ )).
Let g ∗ be generic over V for Vα∗ ∩ Pα∗ with p∗ ∈ g ∗ . Because p∗ ∈ g ∗ it follows
that
(27)

∀W ∈ A Qα∗ ∩ W [g ∗ ] is NOT a regular suborder of Qα∗

where Qα∗ is the evaluation of Q̇α∗ by g ∗ .
Because Vα∗ ∩ Pα∗ ∈ Vκ then j lifts in V [g ∗ ] to an elementary
j̃ : H ′ [g ∗ ] → N ′ [g ∗ ] = N ′ [j̃(g ∗ )].
Because H is < κ-closed in V and g ∗ is generic for a κ-cc poset (in fact a poset
of size < κ), then H[g ∗ ] is < κ closed in V [g ∗ ], and in particular in N ′ [g ∗ ]. Since
also Qα∗ is κ-cc in V [g ∗ ], and thus in N ′ [g ∗ ], then
(28)

N ′ [g ∗ ] and H[g ∗ ] have the same maximal antichains of Qα∗ .

Then H[g ∗ ], j̃ ↾ H[g ∗ ], N ′ [g ∗ ], and Qα∗ satisfy the assumptions of Lemma 40;
note we are using here that j[H] ∈ N ′ to conclude that j[H][g ∗ ] = j̃(H[g ∗ ]) ∈
N ′ [g ∗ ]. So by Lemma 40:
(29)

j̃[H][g ∗ ] ∩ j̃(Qα∗ ) is a regular suborder of j̃(Qα∗ ).

Because j̃[H] = j[H] ∈ j(A) = j̃(A) and j̃(g ∗ ) = g ∗ , then by (29) we get:
N [g ∗ ] |= ∃X ∈ j̃(A) X[j̃(g ∗ )] ∩ j̃(Qα∗ ) is a regular suborder of j̃(Qα∗ ).
By elementarity of j̃ then
H ′ [g ∗ ] |= ∃X ∈ A X[g ∗ ] ∩ Qα∗ is a regular suborder of Qα∗
which contradicts (27) and completes the proof of Claim 50.1.



Let B be the U -set given by Claim 50.1. Because B ∈ U then H ′ |= “B is
stationary in Pκ (H)” and because H ′ ≺ Hκ+ then B really is stationary in Pκ (H).
By Theorem 48, Pκ is layered a.e. on B. Thus P is κ stationarily layered.

Remark 51. If the κ in the assumptions of Theorem 50 is measurable, and U is
any normal ultrafilter on κ, then essentially the same proof shows that Pκ is layered
on a U -measure one set; i.e. there are U -many α < κ such that Vα ∩ Pκ is a regular
suborder of Pκ (i.e. U -many active α).
6. Applications
In this section we use our main iteration result (Theorem 50) to prove Theorems
7 and 9. A few remarks are in order first:
(1) The special case where µ = ω in the conclusion of Theorem 7 follows easily
from Kunen’s original argument ([17]), without having to use our new Theorem 50. The reason that the case µ = ω is significantly easier is because

(2) Similarly, the special case µ = ω of Theorem 9 could have easily been proven
using Kunen’s original construction, together with Kanamori’s Theorem 57
below, without having to use our new Theorem 50. The reason, again,
is that in this particular case (i.e. when κ becomes ω1 ), finite support
iterations are used and so the Solovay-Tennenbaum Theorem 1 is applicable.
(3) Certain specific instances of Theorem 7 were already known for arbitrary
H
µ; e.g. such as when the poset Sr,φκ++ from the statement of Theorem 7
is the poset Col(µ, < κ+ )17 and certain other collapsing-type posets. The
examples listed in Corollary 8 are all new, however, and the template provided by Theorem 7 for absorbing posets into quotients of saturated ideals
is very general.
6.1. Proof of Theorem 7. Fix φ(−, −) as in the statement of the theorem. Assume j : V → N is a huge embedding with critical point κ. Let δ = j(κ). Assume
µ is a regular cardinal and µ < κ. Define a < µ-support universal Kunen iteration
hPα , Q̇β | α ≤ κ, β < κi
(as in Definition 44) as follows: P0 is Col(µ, < κ). For active α < κ—i.e. if Vα ∩ Pα
is a regular suborder of Pα —the Vα ∩ Pα -name that we force with is the following
poset, assuming that α = µ+ in V Vα ∩Pα :

V [ġα ]
H
Q̇α := CSilv (α, < κ) ∗ Ṡrαα,φ++
where ġα is the Vα ∩ Pα -name for its generic object, CSilv (α, < κ) is the Silver
collapse (see Section 3.2) that turns κ into α+ , and rα is some (Vα ∩ Pα ) ∗ ĊSilv (α, <
κ)-name for a parameter which witnesses the analogue of (1) from the statement
of Theorem 7. Note that, from the point of view of the model V [gα ]CSilv (α,<κ) , the
H
poset Ṡrαα,φ++ satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 7.
It is routine to verify that
Vα ∩Pα Q̇α is κ-cc, < µ-closed, and has size κ.
Then by Theorem 50 it follows that
(30)

P := Pκ is κ-cc

and Lemma 47 ensures that P is < µ closed. Because P0 collapses all cardinals
between µ and κ, these facts together imply
(31)

 P κ = µ+ .

For reasons that will be discussed in Section 6.1.3, we will primarily work with
the almost huge embedding jU~ : V → NU~ derived from j, as in Fact 25, rather than
the huge embedding j (though j will play a key role). Let k : NU~ → N be the map
from Fact 25, and recall from Fact 25 that crit(k) = (δ + )NU~ (recall δ = j(κ)).
By (30) and Lemma 46 it follows that κ is an active stage of jU~ (~P). Let G be
(V, P)-generic. Then by the definition of the iteration, combined with (31), stage κ
of the jU~ (~P) iteration forces with the following poset:
NU~ [G]

Because NU~ is < δ closed in V , and G is generic for a δ-cc poset, then NU~ [G]
is < δ closed in V [G]. In particular, V [G] and NU~ [G] have the same κ sequences,
and hence CSilv (κ, < δ) is computed the same in V [G] and NU~ [G]. Let H be
(V [G], CSilv (κ, < δ))-generic, and consider the evaluation of the 2nd step of (32);
i.e. the poset

NU~ [G∗H]
H
Sr,φκ++
where r is the evaluation of jU~ (~r)(κ) by G∗H; so r is a parameter in (Hκ++ )NU~ [G∗H] =
(Hδ+ )NU~ [G∗H] . Now we recall the assumptions about the parameter r, namely

	
H
NU~ [G ∗ H] |= Sr,φκ++ = z ∈ Hκ++ | (Hκ++ , ∈) |= φ(z, r)
(33)
is a < µ-closed, κ+ -cc poset of size at most κ+ .
H

This implies that (Sr,φκ++ )NU~ [G∗H] is actually an element of (Hκ++ )NU~ [G∗H] and
that
H

(34)

(Hκ++ )NU~ [G∗H] |= (Sr,φκ++ )NU~ [G∗H] is a < µ-closed,
κ+ -cc poset of size at most κ+ .
H

Let S := (Sr,φκ++ )NU~ [G∗H] . By the definition of jU~ (~P), there is an ι ∈ NU~ such
that
ι : P ∗ ĊSilv (κ, < δ) ∗ Ṡ → jU~ (P) is a regular embedding and is the identity on P.
By Theorem 26, in V [G ∗ H] there is a normal ideal I(jU~ ) on κ such that
(35)

℘(κ)/I(jU~ ) is forcing equivalent to jU~ (P)/ι[G ∗ H].

By standard arguments involving quotient forcings, the map ι can be used to show
that the poset S = ṠV [G∗H] is absorbed as a regular suborder of jU~ (P)/ι[G ∗ H].
Combining this with (35) yields:

(36)
V [G ∗ H] |= There is a regular embedding e : S → ro ℘(κ)/I(jU~ )
where ro(−) denotes the boolean completion.
Remark 52. Regarding the “ro” appearing in (36): below we will show that in fact
I(jU~ ) is saturated, which implies by Fact 27 that ℘(κ)/I(jU~ ) is a complete boolean
algebra, i.e. that ℘(κ)/I(jU~ ) is isomorphic to (not just densely embeddable into)
the complete boolean algebra ro ℘(κ)/I(jU~ ) . So the “ro” in (36) will ultimately be
redundant.
Remark 53. Using the Duality Theorey from Foreman [7], it can be arranged
that the regular embedding e from (36)has the following additional property: that
whenever K is V [G ∗ H], ℘(κ)/I(jU~ ) -generic and jK : V [G ∗ H] → ult(V [G ∗
H], K) is the generic ultrapower map, then e−1 [K] is an element of ult(V [G∗H], K)
(although K will never be an element of ult(V [G ∗ H], K)). However we choose not
to include this additional feature in the theorem, in order to avoid lengthy detours
into Duality Theory.
Now it remains to prove the following two claims:
Claim 54. The ideal I(jU~ ) is saturated, i.e.
V [G ∗ H] |= ℘(κ)/I(jU~ ) is δ = κ+ -cc.

28

SEAN D. COX
H

Claim 55. The poset S—which, recall, is the poset (Sr,φκ++ )NU~ [G∗H] which was
defined in NU~ [G ∗ H]—has the required definability properties from the point of
view of V [G ∗ H]. In other words, it remains to prove that the following holds from
the point of view of V [G ∗ H]:

S = {z ∈ (Hκ++ )V [G∗H] | (Hκ++ )V [G∗H] , ∈ |= φ(r, z)}
and S is a < µ-closed, κ+ -cc poset of size at most κ+ .

Remark 56. The equality
S = {z ∈ (Hκ++ )V [G∗H] | (Hκ++ )V [G∗H] , ∈



|= φ(r, z)}

from Claim 55 does not follow automatically from (33), because
(κ++ )V [G∗H] = δ +V > δ +NU~ = (κ++ )NU~ [G∗H]
where the inequality is by Fact 25. We seem to need some additional assumption,
such as the huge embedding used in the argument below.
We will use the huge embedding j to help prove Claims 54 and 55. Let k : NU~ →
N be the map from Fact 25. Recall that
(37)

τ := crit(k) = (δ + )NU~ = (κ++ )NU~ [G∗H] .

6.1.1. Proof of Claim 54. By (35), proving Claim 54 is equivalent to showing that
V [G ∗ H] |= “the poset jU~ (P)/ι[G ∗ H] is δ-cc”. By Fact 21, in turn it suffices to
prove that V |= “the poset jU~ (P) is δ-cc”. But because jU~ (P) ⊂ jU~ (Vκ ) = (Vδ )NU~ ,
then by (37) the map k : NU~ → N fixes jU~ (P). Also because P is κ-cc in V then
jU~ (P) is δ-cc in NU~ . Then by elementarity of k, k(jU~ (P)) = jU~ (P) is k(δ) = δ-cc
from the point of view of N . Because N is closed under δ sequences in V , it follows
that jU~ (P) is really δ-cc in V as well, which completes the proof.
6.1.2. Proof of Claim 55. First note that k lifts to an elementary k : NU~ [G ∗ H] →
N

N [G ∗ H] because G ∗ H is generic for a poset which is a subset of Vδ U~ and
δ < crit(k). Because S ∈ (Hτ )NU~ [G∗H] and crit(k) = τ then k(S) = S; similarly
because r ∈ (Hτ )NU~ [G∗H] then k(r) = r. Then by (33) and elementarity of k it
follows that
(38)
N [G∗H] 
N [G∗H] 
, ∈ |= φ(z, r)}
N [G ∗ H] |= k(S) = S = {z ∈ Hκ++
| Hκ++
and this poset is < µ-closed, δ-cc, and of size ≤ δ.
Because the |= relation is absolute, (38) implies
N [G∗H] 
N [G∗H] 
(39)
V [G ∗ H] |= S = {z ∈ Hκ++
| Hκ++
, ∈ |= φ(z, r)}.
Because N is closed under δ sequences and G ∗ H is generic for a δ-cc poset,
N [G∗H] is closed under δ sequences in V [G∗H]; in particular δ +V [G∗H] = δ +N [G∗H]
and
(40)

(Hκ++ )V [G∗H] = (Hδ+ )V [G∗H] = (Hδ+ )N [G∗H] = (Hκ++ )N [G∗H] .

Thus by substituting into (39) we obtain
V [G∗H] 
V [G∗H] 
| Hκ++
(41)
V [G ∗ H] |= S = {z ∈ Hκ++
, ∈ |= φ(z, r)}.

LAYERED POSETS AND KUNEN’S UNIVERSAL COLLAPSE

29

This shows that S indeed has the correct definition from the point of view of V [G ∗
H]. Finally, because N [G ∗ H] is δ-closed in V [G ∗ H], the fact that N [G ∗ H]
believes S is < µ-closed, δ-cc, and of size ≤ δ is upward absolute to V [G ∗ H].
6.1.3. A remark about the use of the huge embedding. A remark is in order regarding
why we insisted on using the almost huge embedding jU~ rather than the huge
embedding j to construct the saturated ideal I(jU~ ) in the proof of Theorem 7.
It certainly is possible to use liftings of the huge embedding j, together with a
“pseudo-generic tower” construction, to define a saturated ideal I(j) on κ; this
was Kunen’s original argument. However, that argument relied on the coarse fact
that there exists an incompatibility-preserving embedding i from ℘(κ)/I(j) into
the δ = κ+ -cc poset
P∗ := j(P)/ι[G ∗ H] = jU~ (P)/ι[G ∗ H]
which guarantees that ℘(κ)/I(j) is κ+ -cc, i.e. that I(j) is saturated. However, it
is not clear if the map i is a dense embedding, or even a regular embedding. So in
particular it is not clear if S—which is a regular suborder of P∗ —can be regularly
embedded into ℘(κ)/I(j). On the other hand, ℘(κ)/I(jU~ ) is forcing equivalent to
P∗ and thus absorbs S as a regular suborder, which is why we worked with I(jU~ )
instead of I(j). Nonetheless, the map j played an important background role in
the proofs of Claims 54 and 55.
6.2. Proof of Theorem 9. Now we proceed to the proof of Theorem 9. For regular
cardinals κ < δ, let Sacks(κ, δ) denote the ≤ κ-support iteration of length δ which
uses Sacks(κ) at each step (see Definition 22 for the definition of Sacks(κ)). We use
the following theorem of Kanamori, which generalizes a theorem from BaumgartnerLaver [2]:
Theorem 57 (Kanamori [15]). Suppose κ < δ are regular uncountable, δ is weakly
compact, and ♦κ holds. Then the ≤ κ support iteration of length δ of Sacks(κ) is
δ-cc, and forces the following:
• δ = κ++ ;
• The Tree property holds at δ = κ++ .
For regular κ < δ let Sacks♦ (κ, δ) denote the ≤ κ-support iteration
hRγ , Q̇β | γ ≤ δ, β < δi
where Q0 = Add(κ) and Q̇γ = SacksRγ (κ) for all γ ∈ (0, δ). It is a standard fact
that Add(κ) forces ♦(κ); so by Theorem 57 it follows that:
Corollary 58. If κ < δ are regular uncountable and δ is weakly compact, then
Sacks♦ (κ, δ) is δ-cc and forces that δ = κ++ and the Tree Property holds at κ++ .
Assume j : V → N is a huge embedding with crit(j) = κ and j(κ) = δ. Fix a
regular µ < κ. Define a < µ-support universal Kunen iteration
hPα , Q̇β | α ≤ κ, β < κi
(as in Definition 44) as follows: P0 is Col(µ, < κ). For active α < κ—i.e. if Vα ∩ Pα
is a regular suborder of Pα —the Vα ∩ Pα -name that we force with is the following
poset:

V [ġα ]
Q̇α := Sacks♦ (α, κ

30

SEAN D. COX

where ġα is the Vα ∩ Pα -name for its generic object. Note that if α < κ and gα is
generic for Vα ∩ Pα , then κ is still weakly compact in V [gα ] (because gα is generic
for a < κ-sized poset), and so by Corollary 58 it follows that:
Vα ∩Pα Q̇α is κ-cc and forces κ = α++ ∧ TP(κ).
By Theorem 50, P := Pκ is κ-cc; then by Lemma 46 it follows that κ is an active
stage of j(~P). Moreover because P0 collapses all cardinals in the interval (µ, κ) and
each Q̇α is forced to be < µ-closed, then κ = µ+ in V P .
Let G be (V, P)-generic. Then stage κ of the j(~P) iteration forces with the
following poset:
N [G]

(42)
Sacks♦ (κ, δ)
.
So there is an e ∈ N [G] such that

N [G]
e : Sacks♦ (κ, δ)
→ j(P)/G is a regular embedding.
Because N is closed under δ sequences in V (really all we need for this part is
that it is closed under < δ sequences) it follows that

V [G] 
N [G]
(43)
Q := Sacks♦ (κ, δ)
= Sacks♦ (κ, δ)
.
Note that, from the point of view of V [G], the poset Q is a δ-length, ≤ κ support
iteration of < κ-directed closed posets, where the poset at each step has size < δ.
That each step is < κ-directed closed follows from Lemma 24.
Let K be generic over V [G] for the poset Q. Then by Corollary 58, in V [G ∗ K]
the Tree Property holds at κ++ . Also κ = (µ+ )V [G∗K] , because P forces κ = µ+
and Q is < κ (directed) closed. Also µ is still a cardinal by Lemma 47. It remains
to prove that
V [G ∗ K] |= (κ++ , κ) ։ (κ, µ).
Let G′ be generic over V [G ∗ K] for
(j(P)/G)/e[K].
′

Then in V [G ], the map j lifts to
j : V [G] → N [G′ ].
We want to further lift j to domain V [G ∗ K] in some forcing extension. Note in
particular that K ∈ N [G′ ], because e ∈ N [G] and K = e−1 [G′ ]. Since N is closed
under δ sequences and j(P) is δ-cc, it follows that N [G′ ] is closed under δ sequences
from V [G′ ]; in particular j ↾ A ∈ N [G′ ] for every A ∈ V [G] of size δ. So the map
j : V [G] → N [G′ ] and the iteration Q satisfy the requirements of the following
lemma, with V [G] playing the role of W and N [G′ ] playing the role of W ′ .
Lemma 59 (implicit in Kunen [17]). Suppose j : W → W ′ is a (possibly external)
elementary embedding with critical point κ; let δ := j(κ) and assume that δ is
~ = hQγ , Ṙβ | γ ≤ δ, β < δi is a ≤ κ-support iteration
inaccessible in W . Suppose Q

and that there exists some K ∈ W ′ which is (W, Qδ )-generic.
Then:
• there is a condition mK ∈ j(Qδ ) such that if K ′ is (W ′ , j(Qδ ))-generic and
mK ∈ K ′ , then j[K] ⊂ K ′ and thus j can be lifted to j̃ : W [K] → W ′ [K ′ ].
• W [K] |= (δ, κ) ։ (κ, < κ)
Proof. The master condition mK will essentially be the condition with support
j[δ] such that for each γ < δ, the j(γ)-th component of mK is a lower bound for
the pointwise image of the γ-th component of K; this is possible because each
component of the iteration is of size < δ and the image of the components of the
iteration are < δ-directed closed.
More precisely, we will recursively define a sequence
m
~ = hmγ | γ ≤ δi
and inductively verify that:
(1) mγ ∈ j(Qγ ) and has support exactly j[γ];
(2) Whenever γ < γ ′ then mγ = mγ ′ ↾ j(γ);

(3) If Kj(γ)

and thus j lifts to an embedding j : W [K|γ] → W ′ [Kj(γ)
].
The recursion goes as follows. If γ is a limit ordinal then mγ is simply the union
of the mβ for β < γ. If γ is a successor ordinal, say γ = γ̄ + 1, then we define mγ̄+1


Hγ̄ := { r(γ̄) K|γ̄ | r ∈ K|(γ̄ + 1)} ⊂ Ṙγ̄ K|γ̄ .

Notice that Hγ̄ ∈ W ′ because K ∈ W ′ . Because Ṙγ̄ K|γ̄ has size < δ
and jγ̄ is elementary, then jγ̄ [Hγ̄ ] is a directed

Finally we prove that W [K] |= (δ, κ) ։ (κ, < κ). In W [K] fix a structure
A = (δ, . . . ) in a countable language. Let K ′ be W ′ , j(Qδ ) -generic with mK ∈ K ′
and let jδ : W [K] → W ′ [K ′ ] be the lifting of j. Elementarity of jδ ensures that
jδ [δ] = j[δ] ≺ jδ (A). Moreover j[δ] ∈ W ′ and W ′ [K ′ ] believes that j[δ] ∩ j(κ) =
κ ∈ j(κ) and that |j[δ]| = δ = j(κ); so
W ′ [K ′ ] |= ∃X ≺ jδ (A)

X ∩ j(κ) ∈ j(κ) and |X| = j(κ).

So by elementarity of jδ :
W [K] |= ∃X ≺ A

X ∩ κ ∈ κ and |X| = κ

which completes the proof.

Remark 60. The model just constructed actually has a κ++ -saturated ideal on
{z ∈ [κ++ ]κ | z ∩ κ ∈ κ}.
This can be proved using the “pseudogeneric tower” argument from Kunen [17]
which is described in detail in Foreman [7].
7. Questions
Question 61. Suppose we alter the assumptions of Theorem 50 as follows:
• Weaken the large cardinal assumption (e.g. only assume that κ is Mahlo)
• Strengthen the assumptions on Q̇α by requiring them to be κ-Knaster instead of merely κ-cc. More precisely, assume that for all active α < κ that
Vα ∩Pα Q̇α is κ-Knaster.
Can we conclude that Pκ has the κ-cc? Note that if ~P is a finite support iteration,
then the answer is yes.
Remark 56 in the proof of Theorem 7 raises the following question:
Question 62. Is Theorem 7 still true if κ is merely assumed to be almost huge in
V?
