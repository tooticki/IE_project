Recall that the existence of a least energy solution u ∈ H 1 (RN ), which is positive, spherically symmetric (radial) and decreasing in r = |x| is established in [5] and the existence of
infinitely many radial solutions but not necessarily positive are provided in [6]. Moreover
Jeanjean and Tanaka [14] showed that J(u) = inf M J, where M stands for the Pohozaev
manifold defined below and J is the energy functional associated with (1.1); see (1.2) and
(1.6).
Firstly, the aim of this paper is to answer to the open problem [6][Section 10.8] concerning
the existence and multiplicity of nonradial solutions of (1.1) for dimensions N ≥ 4 under the
almost optimal assumptions (g0)–(g3). Secondly, we present a new variational approach based
on a critical point theory built on the Pohozaev manifold. Without the radial symmetry one
has to deal with the lack of compactness issues and we present a concentration-compactness
approach in the spirit of Lions [16, 17] together with profile decompositions in the spirit of
Gérard [10] and Nawa [23] adopted to a general nonlinearity satisfying (g0)–(g3); see Theorem
1.4. Using these techniques we provide a new proof of the following result.
Theorem 1.1 ([5, 14]). There is a solution u ∈ M of (1.1) such that J(u) = inf M J > 0,

Moreover we find nonradial solutions of (1.1) provided that N ≥ 4. Indeed, let us fix
τ ∈ O(N) such that τ (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (x2 , x1 , x3 ) for x1 , x2 ∈ Rm and x3 ∈ RN −2m , where
x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) ∈ RN = Rm × Rm × RN −2m and 2 ≤ m ≤ N/2. We define

	
(1.3)
Xτ := u ∈ H 1 (RN ) : u(x) = −u(τ x) for all x ∈ RN .
Clearly, if u ∈ Xτ is radial, i.e. u(x) = u(ρx) for any ρ ∈ O(N), then u = 0. Hence Xτ
does not contain nontrivial radial functions. Then O1 := O(m) × O(m) × id ⊂ O(N) acts
isometrically on H 1 (RN ) and let HO1 1 (RN ) denote the subspace of invariant functions with
respect to O1 .
Our first main result reads as follows.

Theorem 1.2. If N ≥ 4, then there is a solution u ∈ M ∩ Xτ ∩ HO1 1 (RN ) of (1.1) such that

If in addition N 6= 5, then we may assume that N − 2m 6= 1 and let us consider O2 :=
O(m) × O(m) × O(N − 2m) ⊂ O(N) acting isometrically on H 1 (RN ) with the subspace of
invariant function denoted by HO1 2 (RN ).
Theorem 1.3. If N ≥ 4 and N 6= 5, then the following statements hold.
(a) There is a solution u ∈ M ∩ Xτ ∩ HO1 2 (RN ) of (1.1) such that

is of class C 1 and has the mountain pass geometry [14]. Our problem is modelled in RN ,
so that we have deal with the lack of compactness of Palais-Smale sequences. In the classical approach [5, 6] the compactness properties can be obtained by considering only radial
1
N
functions HO(N
) (R ) in the spirit of Strauss [27] due to O(N)-invariance of J. In a nonradial
case, however, for instance in H 1 (RN ), Xτ ∩ HO1 1 (RN ) or in Xτ ∩ HO1 2 (RN ), the crucial Radial
Lemma [5][Lemma A.II] is no longer available and an application of the compactness lemma of
Strauss [5][Lemma A.I] is impossible. As usual, one needs to analyse the lack of compactness
of Palais-Smale sequences by means of a concentration-compactness argument of Lions [17].
The main difficulty concerning the concentration-compactness analysis is that, in general, g(s)
has not subcritical growth of order sp−1 for large s with 2 < p < 2∗ and g does not satisfy an
Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz-type condition [1], or any monotonicity assumption. In the present
paper we show how to deal with the lack of compactness having the general nonlinearity g
and our argument requires a deeper analysis of profiles of bounded sequences in H 1 (RN ); see
Theorem 1.4 below.
Beside the lack of compactness difficulties, it is not clear how to treat (1.1) by means of
the standard variational methods. Although J has the classical mountain pass geometry [14],
we do not know whether Palais-Smale sequences of J are bounded. To overcome this difficulty
in the radial case in R[5, 6], the authors considered the following constrained problems: the
minimization of u 7→ RN |∇u|2 dx on

RN

Both approaches require the compactness properties and the scaling invariance of the equation
(1.1) with application of Lagrange multipliers. Another method in the radial case in [12] is
based on the Mountain Pass Theorem for an extended functional in the spirit of Jeanjean [13].
1
N
Let us mention that a direct minimization method on the Pohozaev manifold in HO(N
) (R ) is
due to Shatah [26], who studied a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with a general nonlinearity.
Again, the radial symmetry and the Strauss lemma played an important role in these works.
In this paper we provide a new constrained approach which allows to deal with noncompact
problems and can be described in an abstract and transparent way for future applications;
see Section 2 for details. Let us briefly sketch our approach. Recall that if u ∈ H 1 (RN ) is a
2,q
critical point of J, then u ∈ Wloc
(RN ) for any q < ∞ and u satisfies the Pohozaev identity,

Observe that M : H 1 (RN ) → R is of class C 1 and but, in general, M ′ is not locally Lipschitz
and
M = {u ∈ H 1 (RN ) \ {0} : M(u) = 0}
need not be of class C 1,1 . Hence it seems to be impossible to use any critical point theory
based on the deformation lemma involving a Cauchy problem directly on M. Our crucial
observation is that M is a topological manifold and there is a homeomorphism m : U → M
such that

is a manifold of class C 1,1 . Moreover J ◦ m : U → R is still of class C 1 and u ∈ U is a critical
point of J ◦ m if and only if m(u) is a critical point of the unconstrained functional J. The
main difficulty is the fact that it is not clear whether a Palais-Smale sequence (un ) ⊂ U of J ◦m
can be mapped into a Palais-Smale sequence m(un ) ⊂ M of the unconstrained functional J.
Moreover, we do not know and if a nontrivial weak limit point of (m(un )) is a critical point
of J and stays in M.
In order to overcome these obstacles we introduce a new variant of the Palais-Smale
condition at level β ∈ R denoted by (M)β (i) (see Section 2), which roughly says that, for
every Palais-Smale sequence (un ) ⊂ U at level β, (m(un )) contains a subsequence converging
weakly towards a point u ∈ H 1 (RN ) up to the RN -translations, which can be projected on a
critical point mP (u) ∈ M. Moreover we may choose a proper RN -translation such that
J(mP (u)) ≤ β = lim J(m(un )).
n→∞

The selection of the proper translation plays a crucial role and requires the following profile
decompositions of bounded sequences in H 1 (RN ) in the spirit of [9–11].

In particular, taking Ψ(s) = |s|p with p = 2 and with 2 < p < 2∗ we obtain [11][Proposition
2.1]. Our argument relies only on new variants of Lions lemma; see Section 3 and variants of
Theorem 1.4 in HO1 1 (RN ) as well as in HO1 2 (RN ).
Having a minimizing sequence of J ◦ m, we find a proper translation such that a weak
limit point can be projected on a critical point of J in M and we prove Theorem 1.1. The
same procedure works in the subspace Xτ ∩ HO1 1 (RN ) ⊂ H 1 (RN ), however we have to ensure
that we choose a proper translation along RN −2m -variable and we get Theorem 1.2.
In order to get multiplicity of critical points, we show that J ◦ m satisfies the Palais-Smale
condition in U ∩ Xτ ∩ HO1 2 (RN ) and in view of the critical point Theorem 2.2 of Section 2, J
has infinitely many critical points and we prove Theorem 1.3.
Note that the existence and the multiplicity results concerning similar problems to (1.1)
in the noncompact case present in the literature require strong growth conditions imposed
on the nonlinear term, e.g. f has to be of subcritical growth and, in addition, must satisfy
an Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz-type condition [1, 8], or a monotonicity-type assumption [29]; see
also references therein. If a nonlinear equation like (1.1) exhibits radial symmetry, then the
problem of existence of nonradial solutions is particularly challenging and there are only few
results in this direction. The first paper [3] due to Bartsch and Willem dealt with semilinear elliptic problems in dimension N = 4 and N ≥ 6 under subcritical growth conditions
and an Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz-type condition. In fact, from [3] we borrowed an idea of the
decomposition of RN and O2 -action on H 1 (RN ) given in Theorem 1.2. Further analysis of
decompositions of RN in this spirit has been recently studied in [19] and in the references
therein. Next, Lorca and Ubilla [18] solved the similar problem in dimension N = 5 by
considering O1 -action on H 1 (RN ), and recently Musso, Pacard and Wei [22] obtained nonradial
solutions in any dimension N ≥ 2; see also [2]. In these works, again, strong assumptions
needed to be imposed on nonlinear terms, for instance a nondegeneracy condition in [2, 22],
which allows to apply a Liapunov-Schmidt-type reduction argument.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we build a critical point theory on a
general topological manifold M in the setting of abstract assumptions (A1)–(A3). Having our
variant of Palais-Smale condition (M)β , in Theorem 2.2 we prove the existence of minimizers
on M and the multiplicity result. The general theorem can be useful in the study of strongly
indefinite problems as well, like [20, 29], where the classical linking approach due to Benci
and Rabinowitz [4] does not apply and the classical Palais-Smale condition is not satisfied;
see Remark 2.3. Moreover, in a subsequent work [21] these techniques will be used to obtain

6

J. Mederski

nonradial solutions in the zero mass case problem (1.1), which has been studied in the radial
case so far in [5,7]. In Section 3 we prove three variants of Lions lemma in H 1 (RN ), HO1 1 (RN )
and in HO1 2 (RN ). These allow us to prove the profile decomposition Theorem 1.4 and its
variant Corollary 3.5 in order to analyse Palais-Smale sequences in Proposition 4.4 and in
Corollary 4.5. We complete proofs of Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 in the last Section 4.
2. Critical point theory on a topological manifold
Let G be an isometric group action on a reflexive Banach space X with norm k · k and
J : X → R is a C 1 -functional. Assume that
(A1) J is G-invariant, i.e. if u ∈ X and g ∈ G then J(gu) = J(u). If gu = −u for some
u ∈ X \ {0}, then g = id. Moreover if gn ∈ G, u ∈ X and gn u ⇀ v, then v = gu for
some g ∈ G or v = 0.
Let M ⊂ X \ {0} be a closed and nonempty subset of X such that
(A2) M is G-invariant and inf M J > 0.
Since, in general, M has not the C 1,1 -structure, we introduce a manifold
S = {u ∈ Y : ψ(u) = 1}
in a closed G-invariant subspace Y ⊂ X, where ψ ∈ C 1,1 (Y, R) is G-invariant and such that
ψ ′ (u) 6= 0 for u ∈ S. Clearly, from the implicit function theorem, S is a G-invariant manifold
of class C 1,1 and of codimension 1 in Y with the following tangent space at u ∈ S
Tu S = {v ∈ Y : ψ ′ (u)(v) = 0}.
(A3) There are a G-invariant open neighbourhood P ⊂ X \{0} of M and G-equivariant map
mP : P → M such that mP (u) = u for u ∈ M and the restriction m := mP |U : U → M
for U := S ∩ P is a homeomorphism. Moreover J ◦ m = J|M ◦ m is of class C 1 and
(J ◦ m)(un ) → ∞ as un → u ∈ ∂U, un ∈ U, where the boundary of U is taken in S.
As usual, we say that (un ) ⊂ U is a (P S)β -sequence of J ◦ m : U → R provided that
(J ◦ m)(un ) → β and (J ◦ m)′ (un ) → 0.
Let K be the set of all critical points of J ◦ m, i.e.

	
K := u ∈ U : (J ◦ m)′ (u)(v) = 0 for any v ∈ Tu S .

For u ∈ X, G ∗ u denotes the orbit of u

G ∗ u := {gu : g ∈ G}.
We introduce the following variant of the Palais-Smale condition at level β ∈ R.

Nonradial solutions of nonlinear scalar field equations

(M)β (i) For every (P S)β -sequence (un ) ⊂ U of J ◦ m, there are a sequence (gn ) ⊂ G and u ∈ P
such that gn m(un ) ⇀ u along a subsequence, J ′ (mP (u)) = 0 and J(mP (u)) ≤ β.
(ii) If K has a finite number of distinct orbits G ∗ u for u ∈ K, then there is mβ > 0 such
that for every (un ) ⊂ U such that (J ◦ m)′ (un ) → 0 as n → ∞, (J ◦ m)(un ) ≤ β and
kun − un+1 k < mβ for n ≥ 1, there holds lim inf n→∞ kun − un+1k = 0.
Note that (M)β (i) implies that if (J ◦ m)′ (u) = 0, then J ′ (m(u)) = 0 for u ∈ U. Indeed,
taking a sequence un = u, observe that gn m(u) ⇀ u
e along a subsequence, u
e ∈ P ⊂ X \{0} and
by (A1), u
e = gm(u) for some g ∈ G. Then u
e ∈ M and by (A3), mP (e
u) = mP (gm(u)) = gm(u)
′
is a critical point of J ◦ m, hence by (A1), we conclude J (m(u)) = 0. Therefore critical points
of J ◦ m are mapped by m into nontrivial critical points of the unconstrained functional J.
Observe that, however, m(un ) need not to be a Palais-Smale sequence of the unconstrained
functional J if (un ) ⊂ U is a (P S)β -sequence of J ◦ m.
In what follows, for A ⊂ X and r > 0, B(A, r) := {u ∈ X : ku − vk < r for some v ∈ A}.
Lemma 2.1. Suppose that (A1)–(A3), (M)β (ii) hold for some β ∈ R and K has finite number
of distinct orbits G ∗ u for u ∈ K. If (un ) ⊂ U is a (P S)α-sequence for some α < β and
un ∈ B(K ∩ (J ◦ m)−1 ((−∞, β]), mβ ),

(2.1)

then passing to a subsequence gn un → u for some u ∈ K and gn ∈ G.
Proof. Let (un ) ⊂ U be a (P S)α -sequence such that (2.1) holds. Passing to a subsequence
(J ◦ m)(un ) ≤ β. Then we put w2n−1 := un and take any w2n ∈ K such that
kw2n − un k < mβ
and (J ◦ m)(w2n ) ≤ β for any n ≥ 1. Take K̃ ⊂ K such that each orbit G ∗ u has a unique
representative in K̃ for u ∈ K, so that K̃ ∩ (G ∗ u) is a singleton. Since K̃ is finite, passing
to a subsequence we may assume that g2n w2n = u ∈ K̃ for some g2n ∈ G and u ∈ K̃.
Take g2n−1 = g2n for n ≥ 1 and observe that by (A1), (J ◦ m)′ is G-equivariant, hence
(J ◦ m)′ (gn wn ) → 0, (J ◦ m)(gn wn ) ≤ β and
kgn wn − gn+1 wn+1 k < mβ
for n ≥ 1. Then, in view of (M)β (ii) we obtain
lim inf kg2n un − uk = lim inf kg2n−1 w2n−1 − g2n w2n k = 0,
n→∞

n→∞

and g2n un → u ∈ K passing to a subsequence.



Hence, roughly speaking, Lemma 2.1 says that if (M)β (ii) holds, then a sufficiently close
Palais-Smale sequence of J ◦ m to the set of critical points with finite number of distinct orbits
contains a convergent subsequence up to the G-action.
Now our main result of this section reads as follows.

Theorem 2.2. Suppose that J : X → R is of class C 1 and satisfies (A1)–(A3).
(a) If (M)β (i) holds for β = inf M J, then J has a critical point u ∈ M such that
J(u) = inf J.
M

(b) Assume that (M)β holds for every β ≥ inf M J, J is even, mP is odd and U, M are
symmetric, i.e. U = −U, M = −M. Then J has infinitely many G-distinct critical points in
M, i.e. there is a sequence of critical points (un ) ⊂ M such that (G ∗ un ) ∩ (G ∗ um ) = ∅ for
n 6= m, provided that
(2.2)

for any k ≥ 1, there exists a continuous and odd map from S k−1 to P,

where S k−1 is the unit sphere in Rk .
(c) Assume that G = id, J is even, mP is odd and U, M are symmetric, and for every (P S)β sequence (un ) ⊂ U of J ◦ m with β ≥ inf M J, there is u ∈ U such that J ′ (m(u)) = 0 and
un → u along a subsequence. Then J has infinitely many critical points in M provided that
(2.2) holds.
Proof. Let Φ := J ◦ m : U → R. Similarly as in [30][Lemma 5.14] we find an odd and locally
Lipschitz pseudo-gradient vector field v : U \ K → Y such that v(u) ∈ Tu S and
(2.3)
(2.4)

kv(u)k < 2kΦ′ (u)k,
Φ′ (u)(v(u)) > kΦ′ (u)k2

for any u ∈ U \ K. The obtained pseudo-gradient vector field allows to prove a variant of
deformation lemma [30][Lemma 5.15] in U and arguing as in [30][Theorem 8.5], we find a
minimizing sequence (un ) ⊂ U such that
(J ◦ m)(un ) → c := inf J ◦ m = inf J
U

M

and (J ◦ m)′ (un ) → 0 as n → ∞. In view of (M)β (i) we find a nontrivial critical point
mP (u) ∈ M of J such that passing to a subsequence gn un ⇀ u for some gn ∈ G. Since
c ≥ J(mP (u)) ≥ inf J,
M

we get J(mP (u)) = c, which completes proof of (a). For any α < β let us denote
Φβα := {u ∈ U : α ≤ Φ(u) ≤ β},
Φβ := {u ∈ U : Φ(u) ≤ β}.
Proof of (b) and (c) is based on the fact that the Lusternik-Schnirelman values
(2.5)

βk := inf{β ∈ R : γ(Φβ ) ≥ k}.

are increasing critical values for k ≥ 1, where γ stands for the Krasnoselskii genus for closed
and symmetric subsets of X. Observe that (2.2) implies that for any k ≥ 1 there is β > 0
such that


γ(Φβ ) ≥ γ m−1 mP (τ (S k−1 )) ≥ k,

hence βk < ∞. To prove (c) one can argue as in [25][Theorem 8.10]. For the reader’s
convenience we provide details, in particular we demonstrate how (M)β (ii) works here, cf. [29].
Observe that we find the unique flow η : G → U \ K such that
(

∂t η(t, u) = −v(η(t, u))
η(0, u) = u

where G := {(t, u) ∈ [0, ∞) × (U \ K) : t < T (u)} and T (u) is the maximal time of the
existence of η(·, u). Suppose that there is a finite number of distinct orbits G ∗ u for u ∈ K.
Take β ≥ c and let
Kβ := {u ∈ K : Φ(u) = β}.
Then there is ε0 > 0 such that
β

β−ε0 = K .

(2.6)

n
Indeed, suppose that there is a sequence (un ) ⊂ K ∩ Φβ+ε
β−εn such that Φ(un ) 6= β and εn → 0.
Passing to a subsequence we may assume that Φ(un ) is strictly increasing or decreasing. In
view of (A1), the orbits G ∗ un consist of critical points on different levels Φ(un ), which
contradicts the finiteness of distinct orbits G ∗ u for u ∈ K. Now we show that for every
δ ∈ (0, mβ+ε0 ) there is ε ∈ (0, ε0] such that

Take u ∈ Φβ−ε

below by c, and by (2.4) it is decreasing in t ∈ [0, T (u)). Hence limt→T (u) Φ(η(t, u)) exists.
Suppose that (2.7) does not hold, i.e. there is δ ∈ (0, mβ+ε0 ) such that for any ε ∈ (0, ε0 ]
β+ε
Aε := {u ∈ Φβ+ε

We show that for any u ∈ Aε0

We show that for u ∈ Aε0 , limt→T (u) η(t, u) exists. Suppose that, on the contrary, there is

as n → ∞, we may assume that Φ′ (η(tn , u)) → 0. Then by (2.9) we get a contradiction
with (M)β+ε0 (ii). Hence u0 = limt→T (u) η(t, u) exists and since J(η(t, u)) ≤ J(u) is bounded
as t → T (u), by (A3) we get u0 ∈

Moreover, by (2.6)

u0 ∈ K ∩ Φβ+ε

which completes the proof of (2.8).
Now observe that in view of (2.8), for u ∈ Aε0 we may define

t0 (u) := inf t ∈ [0, T (u)) : η(s, u) ∈ B(Kβ , mβ+ε0 ) for all s > t

t(u) := inf t ∈ [t0 (u), T (u)) : η(t, u) ∈ B(Kβ , δ/2)

If ρ = 0 then by (2.11) we find un ∈ Aε0 /2 and tn ∈ (t0 (un ), t(un )) such that
Φ′ (η(tn , un )) → 0 as n → ∞.
Since tn > t0 (un ) we have η(tn , un ) ∈ B(Kβ , mβ+ε0 ) and passing to a subsequence
Φ(η(tn , un )) → α ≤ β + ε0 /2 < β + ε0 .
In view of Lemma 2.1, or by the Palais-Smale condition assumed in (c), passing to a subsequence, we obtain
gn η(tn , un ) → u
for some u ∈ K and gn ∈ G. By (2.6) we get u ∈ Kβ . Since tn < t(un ) we obtain

Let us take β = βk defined by (2.5) for some k ≥ 1. Then
γ(Φβ+ε \ B(Kβ , δ)) ≤ γ(Φβ−ε ) ≤ k − 1
and
(2.12)

k ≤ γ(Φβ+ε ) ≤ γ(cl B(Kβ , δ)) + γ(Φβ+ε \ B(Kβ , δ)) ≤ γ(Kβ ) + k − 1.

Thus Kβ 6= ∅, and since it has finite number of orbits and (G) holds, we easy show that there
is a continuous and odd map from Kβ with values in {−1, 1}. Thus γ(Kβ ) = 1. Note that if
βk = βk+1 for some k ≥ 1, then by (2.12) we get γ(Kβk ) ≥ 2, which is a contradiction. Hence
we get an infinite sequence β1 < β2 < ... of critical values, which contradicts that K consists
of a finite number of distinct orbits. This completes the proof of (b) and (c).

Remark 2.3. In this paper we consider the problem (1.1) having the mountain pass geometry,
hence we assume that Y = X, and we show that (M)β (i) holds with translations G = RN
or G = {0} × {0} × RN −2m ; see Lemma 4.7 and Lemma 4.8 below. Moreover, we apply
the multiplicity result Theorem 1.3 (c) and we show that J ◦ m satisfies the Palais-Smale
condition in U ∩ HO1 2 (RN ) ∩ Xτ ; see Lemma 4.9. However, in other applications, for an
indefinite functional J one needs to find a proper subspace Y ⊂ X such that (A3) holds and
the Palais-Smale condition may not be satisfied. For instance, one can consider a generalized
Nehari manifold M, and the approaches considered in [20, 29] fit into the abstract setting of
this section. The discreteness of Palais-Smale sequences obtained in [29][Lemma 2.14] implies
(M)β (ii) with G = ZN and we can reprove the results of [29]. Hence, Theorem 2.2 may be
applied to Pohozev as well as Nehari-type topological constraints.
3. Concentration compactness and profile decompositions
We need the following variant of Lions lemma.

0 < δ < M and cε > 0 such that
Ψ(s) ≤ ε|s|2
Ψ(s) ≤ ε|s|

Let us consider x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) ∈ RN = Rm × Rm × RN −2m with 2 ≤ m ≤ N/2 such that
x1 , x2 ∈ Rm and x3 ∈ RN −2m . Then for O1 := O(m) × O(m) × id ⊂ O(N) invariant functions
with respect to O1 we get the following corollary.

provided that |(yn1 , yn2 )| → ∞. Since (un ) is bounded in L2 (RN ) and invariant with respect to
O1 , by (3.3) |(yn1 , yn2 )| must be bounded. Then for sufficiently large r ≥ r0 one obtains

and we get a contradiction with (3.2). Therefore (3.1) is satisfied with r = 1 and by Lemma
3.1 we conclude.

Remark 3.3. Instead of O1 in Corollary 3.2 one can consider any subgroup G = O′ × id ⊂
O(N) such that O′ ⊂ O(M) and RM is compatible with O′ for some 0 ≤ M ≤ N, cf.
[30][Theorem 1.24].
Now let us assume in addition that N − 2m 6= 1 and
O2 := O(m) × O(m) × O(N − 2m) ⊂ O(N).
In view of [16], HO1 2 (RN ) embeds compactly into Lp (RN ) for 2 < p < 2∗ . In order to deal with
the general nonlinearity we need the following result.

4. Proofs of Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3
Similarly as in [5] we modify g in the following way. If g(s) ≥ 0 for all s ≥ ξ0 , then g̃ = g.
Otherwise we set ξ1 := inf{ξ ≥ ξ0 : g(ξ) = 0},

g(s)
if 0 ≤ s ≤ ξ1 ,
g̃(s) =
0
if s > ξ1 ,
and g̃(s) = −g̃(−s) for s < 0. Hence g̃ satisfies the same assumptions (g0)–(g3) and by the
strong maximum principle if u ∈ H 1(RN ) solves −∆u = g̃(u), then |u(x)| ≤ ξ1 and u is a
solution of (1.1). Hence, from now on we replace g by g̃ and we use the same notation g for
the modified function g̃. Then observe that instead of (g2) we may assume

Now observe that we may consider the group of translations G = RN acting on X =
H (RN ), i.e.
1

(gu)(x) = u(x + g)
for g ∈ RN , u ∈ X, x ∈ RN , and in view of Proposition 4.1 conditions (A1)–(A3) are satisfied.
In the similar way we may consider the following subgroup of translations G = {0} ×
{0} × RN −2m acting on X = Xτ ∩ HO1 1 (RN ) and conditions (A1)–(A3) are satisfied provided
that instead of M, S, Y = X = H 1 (RN ), U, mP and m, we consider M ∩ X, S ∩ X,
Y = X = Xτ ∩ HO1 1 (RN ), U ∩ X, m|P∩X : P ∩ X → M ∩ X and m|U ∩X : U ∩ X → M ∩ X
respectively.
Finally, in case of X = Xτ ∩ HO1 2 (RN ) we consider the trivial group G = {(0, 0, 0)} acting
on X.
Remark 4.2. We show how to easy construct functions in Xτ ∩HO1 2 (RN ). Let u ∈ H01 (B(0, R))∩
L∞ (B(0, R)) be O(N)-invariant (radial) function, R > 1 and take any odd and smooth function ϕ : R → [0, 1] such that ϕ(x) = 1 for x ≥ 1 and ϕ(x) = −1 for x ≤ −1. Note that,

The main difficulty in the analysis of Palais-Smale sequences of J ◦ m is to find proper
translations (yn ) ⊂ RN such that θ > 0 in Lemma 4.3. In order to check (M)β (i) condition
one needs to ensure that even θ ≥ 1. This can be performed with the help of the following
result providing decompositions for Palais-Smale sequences of J ◦ m, which is based on the
profile decomposition Theorem 1.4. Observe that in the usual variational approach e.g. due to
Struwe [28] or Coti Zelati and Rabinowitz [8], such decompositions of Palais-Smale sequences
are finite. In our case, however, a finite procedure cannot be performed in general, since we
do not know whether a weak limit point of a Palais-Smale sequence of J ◦ m is a critical point.
Therefore we need to employ the profile decompositions from Theorem 1.4 and Corollary 3.5.
Proposition 4.4. Let (un ) ⊂ U be a Palais-Smale sequence of J ◦ m at level β = c. Then

ei solves (4.5)
with θi for 1 ≤ i < K + 1. If u
e0 = 0, then θ0 = 0, and if u
e0 6= 0, then θ0 is given by (4.5), so
that (4.10)-(4.11) hold. Since (4.1) holds, then (4.12) follows from (1.8) and (1.10). Moreover

(4.13) and (4.14) follow from (1.8) and (1.7) respectively.
Corollary 4.5. Suppose that X = HO1 1 (RN ) ∩ Xτ and 2 ≤ m < N/2. Let (un ) ⊂ U ∩ X be a
Palais-Smale sequence of J|X ◦ m|U ∩X at level β = inf M∩X J. Then there is K ∈ N ∪ {∞} and

that yn0 = 0, |yni − ynj | → ∞ as n → ∞ for i 6= j, and passing to a subsequence, (4.10)–(4.14)
are satisfied.
Proof. We argue as in proof of Proposition 4.4, but instead of Theorem 1.4 we use Corollary
3.5. Arguing as in Lemma 4.3 we obtain that u
ei solves (4.5) with θi in X for 0 ≤ i < K + 1,

ei solves
and u

(4.5) with θi . As in Lemma 4.3 we show that θi 6= 0 and by the Pohozaev identity (4.7) holds
for u
ei and θi for 1 ≤ i < K + 1. If u
e0 = 0, then θ0 = 0, otherwise θ0 is given by (4.5) and by

the Pohozaev identity satisfies also (4.7).

Remark 4.6. An important consequence of Proposition 4.4 and Corollary 4.5 is the existence
of a sequence of translations (yni ) such that θi ≥ 1 for some i ≥ 0. Indeed, in view of (4.11)

4.3. Proof of Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.
Lemma 4.7. J ◦ m satisfies (Mβ ) (i) for β = c.
Proof. Let (un ) ⊂ U be a (P S)β -sequence of J ◦ m. Since J is coercive on M, (m(un )) is
bounded and in view of Proposition 4.4 and Remark 4.6 we find a sequence (yn ) ⊂ RN such
that m(un )(· + yn ) ⇀ u
e in H 1 (RN ) for some u
e 6= 0 and θ ≥ 1 given by (4.7). Observe that

u
e ∈ P and by Lemma 4.3 we conclude.
Now, let us consider O1 -invariant functions.

Lemma 4.8. Suppose that X = HO1 1 (RN ) ∩ Xτ and 2 ≤ m < N/2. Then J|X ◦ m|U ∩X satisfies
(Mβ ) (i) for β = inf M∩X J.
Proof. Let (un ) ⊂ U ∩ X be a (P S)β -sequence of J|X ◦ m|U ∩X . Similarly as in proof of Lemma
4.7, in view of Corollary 4.5 and and Remark 4.6 we find a sequence (yn ) ⊂ {0} × {0} × RN −2m
such that m(un )(· + yn ) ⇀ u
e in X for some u
e 6= 0 and θ ≥ 1 given by (4.7). Observe that
u)) ≤ β.

More can be said for O2 -invariant functions.
Lemma 4.9. Suppose that X = HO1 2 (RN ) ∩ Xτ . If (un ) ⊂ U ∩ X is a (P S)β -sequence
of (J|X ◦ m|U ∩X ), then passing to a subsequence un → u0 for some u0 ∈ U ∩ X such that
J|′X (m(u0 )) = 0.
Proof. Let (un ) ⊂ U ∩ X be a sequence such that (J|X ◦ m|U ∩X )′ (un ) → 0 and (J|X ◦
m|U ∩X )(un ) → β. Since J is coercive on M, (m(un )) is bounded and in view of Corollary 3.6
we find u
e ∈ X such that

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Since J satisfies (A1)–(A3) and (Mβ ) (i), proof follows from Theorem
2.2 (a).
✷
Proof of Theorem 1.2. If X = HO1 1 (RN ) ∩ Xτ and 2 ≤ m < N/2, then J|X ◦ m|U ∩X satisfies
(A1)–(A3) and (Mβ ) (i). Then, in view of Theorem 2.2 (a) there is a critical point u ∈ M ∩ X
of J|X such that
J(u) = inf J.
M∩X

In view of the Palais principle of symmetric criticality [24], u solves (1.1). Let
Ω1 := {x ∈ RN : |x1 | > |x2 |},
Ω2 := {x ∈ RN : |x1 | < |x2 |}.
Since u ∈ Xτ ∩ HO1 1 (RN ), we get χΩ1 u ∈ H01 (Ω1 ) ⊂ H 1(RN ) and χΩ2 u ∈ H01 (Ω2 ) ⊂ H 1 (RN ).
Moreover χΩ1 u ∈ M and
J(u) = J(χΩ1 u) + J(χΩ2 u) = 2J(χΩ1 u) ≥ 2 inf J,

which completes the proof of (1.4). The remaining case 2 ≤ m = N/2 is contained in Theorem
1.3.
✷
Proof of Theorem 1.3. If X = HO1 2 (RN ) ∩ Xτ , then J|X ◦ m|U ∩X satisfies (A1)–(A3), and note
that Lemma 4.9 holds. In view of [6][Theorem 10], for any k ≥ 1 we find an odd continuous
map τ : S k−1 → H01 (B(0, R)) ∩ L∞ (B(0, R)) such that τ (σ) is a radial function and τ (σ) 6= 0
for all σ ∈ S k−1 . Moreover

G(τ (σ)) dx ≥ c2 RN − c3 RN −1

for any σ ∈ S k−1 and some constants c2 , c3 > 0. As in Remark 4.2 we define a map τ̃ : S k−1 →

τ (σ)(x1 , x2 , x3 )ϕ(|x1 | − |x2 |). Observe
R R)) such that τ̃ (σ)(x1 , x2 , x3 ) =
k−1
that τ̃ (σ) ∈ X and B(0,R) G(τ̃ (σ)) dx > 0 for σ ∈ S
and sufficiently large R. Therefore
(2.2) is satisfied and proof follows from Theorem 2.2 (c) and from the Palais principle of
✷
symmetric criticality [24].
Acknowledgements. I would like to thank Louis Jeanjean and Sheng-Sen Lu, who observed that one has to ensure that the Lusternik-Schnirelmann values are finite in proof of
Theorem 2.2. Very recently they also recovered the results of this paper in preprint [15]. Moreover I am grateful to Rupert Frank for pointing out the reference [23]. The author was partially
