ON PROJECTIVE MODULES OVER FINITE QUANTUM
GROUPS
CRISTIAN VAY
Abstract. Let D be the Drinfeld double of the bosonization B(V )#kG of a
finite-dimensional Nichols algebra B(V ) over a finite group G. It is known that
the simple D-modules are parametrized by the simple modules over D(G), the
Drinfeld double of G. This parametrization can be obtained by considering
the head L(λ) of the Verma module M(λ) for every simple D(G)-module λ.
In the present work, we show that the projective D-modules are filtered by
Verma modules and the BGG Reciprocity [P(µ) : M(λ)] = [M(λ) : L(µ)] holds
for the projective cover P(µ) of L(µ). We use graded characters to proof the
BGG Reciprocity and obtain a graded version of it. As a by-product we show
that a Verma module is simple if and only if it is projective. We also describe
the tensor product between projective modules.

1. Introduction
The representation theory of the universal enveloping algebras of Lie algebras
has plenty of powerful and beautiful methods and results which have served as
inspiration to the study of modules over many other algebras. The first property
that was extended to other contexts is that the simple modules are in bijective
correspondence with the simple modules of the Cartan subalgebra. This was made
by several authors for the Drinfeld double D of the bosonization B(V )#kG of
a finite-dimensional Nichols algebra B(V ) over a finite group G; see for instance
[5, 7, 16, 29] for G abelian, and [21, 22, 26] for general G. In these works D(G), the
Drinfeld double of the underlying group, plays the role of the Cartan subalgebra.
Namely, let Λ be a complete set of non-isomorphic simple D(G)-modules and M(λ)
denote the generalized Verma module of λ ∈ Λ. Then, the head L(λ) of M(λ) is
simple and every simple D-module can be obtained in this way, see loc. cit.
Here we continue this approach and investigate the projective modules over D.
We obtain the following results.
(I) Every projective D-module P has a (graded) standard filtration.
That is, there is a sequence of (graded) subdmodules 0 = N0 ⊂ N1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Nn = P
such that each Ni /Ni−1 is isomorphic to a Verma module. We denote by [P : M(λ)]
the numbers of subquotients isomorphic to the Verma module M(λ), λ ∈ Λ.
(II) The BGG Reciprocity holds in our setting.
More precisely, let P(µ) be the projective cover of L(µ), µ ∈ Λ (it exists because D
is a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic

zero). Then, for all λ ∈ Λ,
[P(µ) : M(λ)] = [M(λ) : L(µ)]
where the last square brackets denote the numbers of occurrences of L(µ) as composition factor of M(λ).
We also give analogous results to (I) and (II) for co-Verma modules. As consequence, we show that
(III) A Verma module is simple if and only if it is projective.
(IV) The tensor product between projective modules is isomorphic to the induced module from a semisimple D(G)-modules.
The BGG Reciprocity has its origin in the work of Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand [9]
for modules in the category O. To achieve our goals we imitate the strategy in [17,
Section 3] developed by Irving [18], who has also defined axiomatically a class of
highest weight categories for which the BGG Reciprocity holds [19]. However, our
algebra D does not completely fit in these frameworks. Indeed, a highest weight
category has finite global dimension but a finite-dimensional non-semisimple Hopf
algebra is Frobenius and then it has infinite global dimension.
A more general definition of highest weight category was given by Kleshchev [20].
Although this can have infinite global dimension, there must exist a partial order ≤
on Λ such that µ ≤ λ if L(µ) is a composition factor of the Verma module M(λ), like
in the definition of Cline-Parshall-Scott [12]. This property may fail in our case.
For instance, if B(V ) is the Fomin-Kirillov algebra F K3 and G is the symmetric
group S3 , we have shown that the composition factors of M(τ, 0) and M(e, ρ) are
the same: L(τ, 0), L(σ, −) and L(e, ρ) [26, Theorems 9 and 10]. Then, such an order
on Λ will imply that (τ, 0) = (e, ρ), a contradiction. The order also ensures that
the simple modules are identified by their characters but the characters of L(τ, 0)
and L(e, ρ) are equal [26, Corollaries 22 and 24].
After this work appeared, Bellamy and Thiel [8] introduced a highest weight
theory for finite-dimensional graded algebras with triangular decomposition. They
show that the category of graded modules over such an algebra is highest weight.
They noted that D fits in their framework and hence some of our results can be
deduced from [8]. As D is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra, there are some peculiarities in this setting which are not present in [8] but are instrumental in our
proofs. For instance, (a) the dual of a Verma module is isomorphic to a Verma module and (b) the tensor product between a Verma module and a co-Verma module
is the induced module from a semisimple D(G)-modules.
Let us summarize the main ideas in the present work. First, we observe that
the Nichols algebra B(V ) is finite-dimensional and graded. Thus, we can consider
graded characters that allow us to distinguish the simple modules (Theorem 3.3)
since they are characterized by their highest-weights. The finiteness assumption
is useful to lead the standard filtrations of projective modules (Theorem 4.3 and
Lemma 2.8) using (b). It also implies that the homogeneous component of maximal degree in B(V ) is one-dimensional. We use this fact to prove that the set
of Verma modules is closed by taking duals, see (11). Then, we find some identities among the graded characters of a Verma module, its dual and co-Verma

module (Theorem 3.4). As a consequence we give a graded version of the BGG
Reciprocity similar to [20, Theorem 7.6]. More explicitly, there exist Laurent polynomials pP(µ),M(λ) , pM(λ),L(µ) ∈ Z≥0 [t, t−1 ] such that the graded characters of P(µ)
and M(λ) satisfy

]. For all λ, µ ∈ Λ, we show in Corollary 3.6 that
pP(µ),M(λ) = pM(λ),L(µ)

in the ring Z[t, t−1 ], where the ring automorphism ( ) : Z[t, t−1 ] → Z[t, t−1 ] interchanges t and t−1 . By evaluating these polynomials at t = t−1 = 1 we obtain the
BGG Reciprocity (Theorem 4.3).
Finally, we point out some by-products of our results. Let us assume that we
know the graded characters of the simple modules. Then, we can deduce the graded
structure of the indecomposable projective modules from the graded version of the
BGG Reciprocity. Moreover, we can infer the tensor product between simple and
projective modules from the multiplication of their graded characters in the ring
ZΛ[t, t−1 ]. We carry out this plan for B(V ) = F K3 and G = S3 jointly with
Barbara Pogorelsky in [27].
The article is organized as follows. We set our conventions and notations in
Section 2, and state immediate properties of the D-modules. We regard the graded
characters in Section 3. The results (I)–(IV) are proved in Section 4. We give some
examples in Section 5.

2. Preliminaries
We assume that the reader is familiarized with Hopf algebras and Nichols algebra.
Through this work we adopt the conventions and notations from [26, Section 3]
about finite quantum groups which we briefly recall below. Although the results
in [26] were stated for non-abelian groups, they also hold for abelian groups. These
were proved for instance in [5, 7, 16, 21, 22, 29] by different methods.
We fix a finite group G and a Yetter-Drinfeld module V ∈ kG
kG YD such that its
Nichols algebra B(V ) is finite-dimensional. Let B(V ) be the Nichols algebra of the
G
Yetter-Drinfeld module V ∈ kkG YD determined by the isomorphism
B(V )#kG ≃ (B(V )#kG)∗op .
We denote by D the Drinfeld double of the bosonization B(V )#kG and by D(G)
the Drinfeld double of kG. Then B(V )#kG and D(G) are Hopf subalgebras of D.

Moreover, D admits a triangular decomposition, i. e. the multiplication gives a
linear isomorphism
B(V )⊗D(G)⊗B(V ) −→ D.
The usual Z-grading on the Nichols algebras induces a Z-grading on D by setting
M
Bi (V )⊗D(G)⊗Bj (V ).
Dn =
n=j−i

Via the adjoint action in D, V identities with the dual object of V in the category
of D(G)-modules. Moreover, it holds that
Bn (V ) ≃ Bn (V )∗

(1)

as D(G)-modules for all n ≥ 0, see the remark below.
The Hopf subalgebra D≥0 generated by B(V ) and D(G) satisfies
D≥0 ≃ B(V )#D(G).
Analogously, we will consider the Hopf subalgebra
D≤0 ≃ B(V )#D(G).
Remark 2.1. In [26, Lemma 11 (iii) and (iv)] we claim that B(V ) and B(V ) are
the Nichols algebras of V and V in D(G) M, and B(V ) is isomorphic to B(V )∗bop in
D(G) M, the category of D(G)-modules. However, we made a mistake in the proof
and these properties do not hold. The correct version of them is the following.
(i) B(V ) is isomorphic to the Nichols algebra B(V , c−1 ) corresponding to the
dual object of V in D(G) M and the inverse braiding of the usual one in
D(G) M.
(ii) There is an isomorphism B(V ) ≃ B(V , c) of algebras in D(G) M. Moreover,
their defining ideals coincide in the tensor algebra T (V ).
(iii) Bn (V ) ≃ Bn (V )∗ as D(G)-modules for all n ≥ 0, that is (1).
In fact, (i) is a straightforward computation, (ii) follows like [4, Lemma 1.11]
and (iii) is a consequence of (ii) and [3, Proposition 3.2.30].

Let ntop be the maximal degree of the Nichols algebra B(V ). The homogeneous
component Bntop (V ) is one-dimensional and coincides with space of integrals. We
fix a non-zero monomial xtop = x1 · · · xntop ∈ Bntop (V ) with xi ∈ V . The antipode

The maximal degree of B(V ) also is ntop . We fix a basis element ytop of Bntop (V ).
Let β1 and β2 be non-zero right integrals of B(V )#kG and B(V )#kG, respectively. According to our convention, D∗ ≃ (B(V )#kG )⊗(B(V )#kG) as algebras.
Then β = β1 ⊗β2 is a non-zero right integral of D∗ .
The Drinfeld double of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra is a symmetric algebra,
see [23, p. 488, (3)] and [25, 28]. That is, D has a non-degenerate bilinear form
(−, −) which is associative and symmetric. It is known that (a, b) = β(ab) for all
a, b ∈ D. Hence (Dn , Dm ) = 0, if n + m 6= 0.
An important property of a symmetric algebra is that the socle and the head of
every indecomposable projective are isomorphic, see for instance [13, (9.12)].
Conventions. In this work we consider finite-dimensional left modules over D.
When there is no place to confusion, we will refer to them just as modules. We
will use N, N′ , N1 , ... to denote them. Projective D-modules are injective (and vice
versa) because D is Frobenius. We will consider the D-modules as D≤0 -modules
or D(G)-modules by restricting the action. We will use N to denote the D(G)modules.
Let N be a module and N a D(G)-submodule. We emphasize that the action
B(V )⊗N −→ N is a morphism of D(G)-modules, cf [26, (31)] and in particular so
is kxtop ⊗N −→ N.
2.1. Weights. We fix a representative set Λ of isomorphism classes of simple D(G)modules. We call weights the elements of this set. The counit ε of D(G) gives the
trivial representation. Then, by abuse of notation, we assume that ε ∈ Λ. The dual
weight of λ will be denoted λ∗ .
It is well-know that the weights are parametrized by conjugacy classes Og and
irreducible representations ̺ of the centralizer of g ∈ G, see e. g. [3]. For instance,
for G abelian, the weights are one-dimensional and are in bijective correspondence
b where G
b is the group of characters of G. For G non-abelian, the weight
with G × G
λ = M (g, ̺) attached to the pair (g, ̺) has dimension #Og · dim ̺.
Let N be a D(G)-module and λ ∈ Λ. We define
[N : λ] = dim HomD(G) (λ, N )

(5)

We say that λ is a weight of N if [N : λ] 6= 0. Since D(G) is a semisimple algebra,
N = ⊕λ∈Λ [N : λ] · λ. In particular, any module over D, D≥0 and D≤0 decomposes
into the direct sum of their weights.
Let K be the Grothendieck ring of the category of D(G)-modules. This was
described in [31], and anticipated in [24]. We think of K as the free abelian group
generated by Λ. Then the character of N is the element in K
X
ch N =
[N : λ] · λ.
λ∈Λ

′

The product in K between λ, λ ∈ Λ is given by the tensor product
λ · λ′ = ch(λ⊗λ′ ).
Then ε is the unit of K. For G non-abelian λ⊗λ′ could not belong to Λ but it
decomposes into the direct sum of weights. Recall that K is a commutative ring
because D(G) M is a braided category.

2.2. Highest and lowest weights. A weight is a simple D≥0 -module if we let
B(V ) act via the counit. In this case, we call it a highest-weight. Up to isomorphisms, all the simple D≥0 -modules are highest-weight. A module generated
by a highest-weight is called highest-weight module. Notice that the tensor product of highest-weights decomposes into the direct sum of highest-weights since
∆(V ) ⊂ V ⊗1 + kG ⊗V .
Similarly, we consider weights as D≤0 -modules and call these lowest-weights. In
particular, the space of lowest-weights of a D≤0 -module N coincides with its socle
socD≤0 N = {n ∈ N | V · n = 0} ≃ ⊕λ∈Λ dim HomD≤0 (λ, N) · λ.

(6)

Since the maximal degree component of a Nichols algebra is one-dimensional,
λV = ch Bntop (V ) and λV = ch Bntop (V )
are one-dimensional weights. These are the unique lowest-weight and highest-weight
of the regular left modules D≤0 D≤0 and D≥0 D≥0 . Tensoring by λV induces a bijection between weights because (1) implies
λV = λ∗V

and hence

λV · λV = ε.

2.3. Verma and simple modules. We fix a weight λ ∈ Λ. The corresponding
Verma module [26, Definition 12] is the induced module
M(λ) = D⊗D≥0 λ.

(7)

It is a highest-weight module and any highest-weight module of weight λ is a quotient of it. By the triangular decomposition, we see that
M(λ) ≃ B(V )⊗λ
as D(G)-modules and it is a free B(V )-module and inherits the Z-grading from D.
2.3.1. Simple modules. The Verma modules have simple head and simple socle.
This is a well-known fact, see for instance [5, 7, 16, 29] for G abelian, and [21, 22, 26]
for general G. Therefore the simple D-modules are in bijective correspondence with
Λ. We adopt the next conventions.
• L(λ) is the head of M(λ). It is the unique simple highest-weight module of
weight λ. It inherits the Z-grading from M(λ) [26].
• S(λ) is the socle of M(λ). It is the unique simple lowest-weight module of
weight λV · λ. The lowest-weight of S(λ) is realized by Bntop (V )⊗λ.
• λ denotes the lowest-weight of L(λ). Then the assignment λ 7→ λ is a
bijection in Λ.
• We think of M, L and S (and also P, Ind and W, see below) as maps from
K to D M which transform sums of weights into direct sums of modules.
We will use this fact to abbreviate the notation.
For instance, we will write
P
M(λ · µ) instead of ⊕i ni · M(λi ) if λ · µ = i ni λi .

Then

 ∗
L(λ) ≃ S(λV · λ) and L(λ)∗ ≃ L λ ,

(8)

the first isomorphism follows by the characterization of the simple modules and the
second one follows by [26, Theorem 5].

2.3.2. Verma modules as D≤0 -modules. Clearly, we have that
M(λ) ≃ D≤0 ⊗D(G) λ.

(9)

and, since the top degree of a Nichols algebra is one-dimensional,
socD≤0 M(λ) = Bntop (V )⊗λ ≃ λV · λ.

(10)

Lemma 2.2. As D≤0 -module, M(λ) is the projective cover of the lowest-weight λ
and the injective hull of the lowest-weight λV · λ.
Proof. By (9), M(λ) is an induced module from a semisimple algebra and hence it
is projective. Also, it is injective because D≤0 is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra.
By (10), M(λ) is indecomposable and the lemma follows.

The next remark is very useful and follows directly from (9).
Remark 2.3. A morphism f : M(λ) → N of D-modules is injective if and only if
xtop · f (λ) 6= 0.
2.3.3. The dual of a Verma module. For all λ ∈ Λ it holds that
M(λ)∗ ≃ M ((λV · λ)∗ ) .

(11)

In fact, we can see that (Bntop (V )⊗λ)∗ ≃ (λV ⊗λ)∗ is a highest-weight of M(λ)∗
by using the Z-degree. This induces a morphism f : M((λV · λ)∗ ) −→ M(λ)∗ . We
apply f to socD≤0 (M(λV · λ)∗ ) and evaluate in the space 1⊗λ ⊂ M(λ):
hxtop · f ((λV · λ)∗ ), 1⊗λi = h(Bntop (V )⊗λ)∗ , S(xtop )⊗λi
· λi 6= 0,
= h(Bntop (V )⊗λ)∗ , xtop ⊗gx−1
top
is bijective on λ. Therefore
here we use (4) and the fact that the action of gx−1
top
(11) follows from Remark 2.3 using the finiteness assumption.
For all 0 ≤ j ≤ ntop , we immediate deduce from (11) that
(Bntop −j (V )⊗λ)∗ ≃ Bj (V )⊗(λV · λ)∗
as D(G)-modules. Using (1), we can rewrite the above isomorphism as
∗
Bntop −j (V )⊗λ∗ ≃ Bj (V )⊗(λV · λ)

(12)

(13)

2.3.4. The co-Verma modules. Let us consider λ as a lowest-weight. We set
W(λ) = D⊗D≤0 λ ≃ B(V )⊗λ,

(14)

where the isomorphism is of D(G)-modules and it inherits the Z-grading from D.
The co-Verma modules have analogous properties to the Verma modules. In
fact, we can see that W(λ) have simple head and simple socle as in the proof
of [26, Theorem 3 and 4]. These are isomorphic to the socle and the head of
M(λV · λ), respectively. Also, they are indecomposable projective as D≥0 -modules.
2.4. Projective modules. The next lemma is inspired by [23, Lemma 2.4].
Lemma 2.4. Let P be projective. Then
socD≤0 P ≃ ⊕λ∈Λ dim HomD≤0 (λ, P) · λ.
if and only if, as D≤0 -modules,


P ≃ ⊕λ∈Λ dim HomD≤0 (λ, P) · M λV · λ .

8

CRISTIAN VAY

Proof. Since D is free over D≤0 , P is D≤0 -projective. Hence P decomposes into
the direct sum of indecomposable projective D≤0 -modules, which are precisely the
Verma modules by Lemma 2.2. Then, the lemma follows using (10).

Definition 2.5. Given a weight λ, P(λ) denotes the projective cover of the simple
highest-weight module L(λ).
Lemma 2.6. Let λ be a weight. Then
(i) P(λ) is the injective hull of L(λ).
(ii) P(λ) is the projective cover of M(λ).

(iii) P(λ) is the injective hull of M λV · λ .
(iv) P(λ) is the projective cover of W(λ).
(v) P(λ) is the injective hull of W (λV · λ).
 ∗
(vi) P(λ)∗ ≃ P λ .

Proof. (i) holds because D is a symmetric algebra.
(ii)(iii) As the Verma modules have simple socle and simple head, we can deduce
that P(λ) is the projective cover of M(λ) and the injective hull of M(λV · λ), see for
instance [13, (6.25)].
We show (iv) and (v) in a similar way, cf. Definition 14.
(vi) is consequence of (i) and (8) because P(λ)∗ is the injective hull of L(λ)∗ . 
By the above lemma we have the next commutative diagrams of injective and
surjective morphisms:
L(λ)

M(λV · λ)

P(λ)

M(λ)
(15)


W λV · λ

P(λ)

W(λ)

L(λ)

We deduce from the morphisms in the first rows that
λ and λV · λ are weights of

socD≤0 P(λ).

(16)

The numbers of occurrences of L(λ) as composition factor of N will be denoted by
[N : L(λ)]. It is known that [N : L(λ)] = dim HomD (P(λ), N) = dim HomD (N, P(λ)),
the last equality is thanks to Lemma 2.6 (i).
2.5. Induced modules.
Definition 2.7. Given a weight λ, Ind(λ) denotes the induced module D⊗D(G) λ.
We can consider Ind(λ) as a submodule of the left regular module D D since D(G)
is a subalgebra. Moreover, it is a direct summand and hence projective. Then
Ind(λ) = ⊕µ∈Λ [L(µ) : λ] · P(µ).

(17)

In fact, if λ is a weight of L(µ), then there is a non trivial epimorphism f :
Ind(λ) → L(µ) just by the definition of induced module. Thus f factors through
P(µ) and we deduce (17) because of the Frobenius reciprocity HomD (Ind(λ), L(µ)) ≃
HomD(G) (λ, L(µ)).
The triangular decomposition of D gives linear isomorphisms
Ind(λ) ≃ B(V )⊗B(V )⊗λ ≃ B(V )⊗B(V )⊗λ

(18)

and Ind(λ) inherits the Z-grading of D. Therefore we see that
(19)

socD≤0 Ind(λ) ≃ λV ⊗B(V )⊗λ.
Hence, by Lemma 2.4, we have the next isomorphism of D≤0 -modules:

Ind(λ) ≃ M ch B(V ) · λ .

(20)

Lemma 2.8. Let λ, µ be weights and


f : Ind λ · µ −→ W(λ)⊗M(µ)
∼

the morphism induced by λ⊗µ −→ (1⊗λ)⊗(1⊗µ). Then f is an isomorphism.
Proof. We will see that f is injective using Remark 2.3 and hence f is an isomorphism because the modules have the same dimension.
P
Let z ∈ socD≤0 Ind(λ · µ). By (19), z = xtop i yi (hi ⊗ki ) where yi ∈ B(V ) and
(hi ⊗ki ) ∈ λ⊗µ. Then

using that µ is a highest-weight, (2) and (3). Then f is injective in socD≤0 Ind(λ · µ)
becuase gxtop ⊗gxtop ⊗xtop : B(V )⊗λ⊗µ −→ B(V )⊗λ⊗Bntop (V )µ is injective. 
2.6. Tensor identity. The next lemma is probably known but we have not found
any reference. The analogous result in Lie Theory is called “tensor identity”.
Let A be a Hopf algebra, B a Hopf subalgebra and R a subalgebra such that
the multiplication R⊗B −→ A gives a linear isomorphism. Under this hypothesis
A⊗B (−) : B M −→ A M is an exact functor since an induced module is B-free.
We assume that R = ⊕n≥0 R(n) is graded with R(0) = k and the comultiplication
of x ∈ R(n) satisfies
n−1
R(j)⊗A,
∆x = x(1) ⊗x(2) ∈ x⊗1 + ⊕j=0

(21)

Lemma 2.9. Let N be an A-module, U a B-module and U ⊗N −→ A⊗B U ⊗N
the inclusion of B-modules given by u⊗n 7→ 1⊗u⊗n. Then the induced morphism


f : A⊗B U ⊗N −→ A⊗B U ⊗N
∀n ≥ 0.

is an isomorphism of A-modules.

Proof. The A-modules in question are isomorphic to R⊗U ⊗N as vector space and
are filtered by Fn = ⊕0≤j≤n R(j)⊗U ⊗N. Then we will prove by induction that
f|Fn is bijective for all n ≥ 0 .
For n = 0 is obvious. We evaluate f in x⊗u⊗n ∈ R(n)⊗U ⊗N and obtain

f x⊗u⊗n = x · (1⊗u⊗n) = x(1) (1⊗u)⊗x(2) n ∈ x⊗u⊗n + f (Fn−1 )

by (21). The lemma follows from the inductive hypothesis.



2.6.1. Applications. The above lemma applies to A = D, B = D≥0 and R = B(V ).
Lemma 2.10. Let M(λ) be a Verma module and µ a highest-weight of a module
N. Then M(λ · µ) is a submodule of M(λ)⊗N.
Proof. By assumption we have an inclusion λ⊗µ −→ λ⊗N of D≥0 -modules. As
D⊗D≥0 (−) is an exact functor
M(λ · µ) = D⊗D≥0 (λ⊗µ) −→ D⊗D≥0 (λ⊗N)
is an inclusion of D-modules and the lemma follows by Lemma 2.9.

Lemma 2.11. Let P the injective hull of M λV · λ · µ for some weights λ and µ.
Then P is a direct summand of P(λ)⊗L(µ).
Proof. By Lemma
2.6 (iii), P(λ) is the injective hull of M(λV · λ). By Lemma 2.10,

M λV · λ · µ is a submodule of P(λ)⊗L(µ). Since P(λ)⊗L(µ) is injective, the lemma
follows.

3. Graded modules
We start by summarizing some notions about graded modules.
Let N = ⊕i∈Z N(i) be a Z-graded D-module, that is Dn · N(i) ⊆ N(n + i) for all
n, i ∈ Z. A morphism f : N −→ N′ between Z-graded D-modules has degree ℓ if
f (N(i)) ⊆ N′ (i + ℓ). The space of such morphisms is denoted by Hom•D (N, N′ )ℓ .
Thus, the morphisms in the category of Z-graded D-modules are the 0-degree ones.
The Hom-spaces satisfy Hom•D (N[ℓ], N′ )0 = Hom•D (N, N′ )ℓ = Hom•D (N, N′ [−ℓ])0 and
HomD (N, N′ ) = ⊕ℓ∈Z Hom•D (N, N′ )ℓ .

(22)

The ℓ-shift Tℓ is an endofunctor in the category of Z-graded D-modules such that
N[ℓ] = Tℓ (N) is N as D-module with homogeneous components N[ℓ](i) = N(i − ℓ) for
all i ∈ Z. TheseP
functors satisfy Tℓ ◦ Tℓ′ = Tℓ+ℓ′ for all ℓ, ℓ′ ∈ Z. Given a Laurent
polynomial p = i∈Z ai ti ∈ Z≥0 [t, t−1 ], we set
p · N = ⊕i∈Z ai · Ti (N)
This induces an action of Z[t, t−1 ] over the Grothendieck ring R• of the category
of Z-graded D-modules.
The modules L(λ)[i], with λ ∈ Λ and i ∈ Z, form a complete set of non-isomorphic
simple Z-graded D-modules.
Since each N(i) is a D(G)-module, we define the graded character of N by setting
X
ch• N =
ch N(i) ti ∈ K[t, t−1 ].
(23)
i∈Z

Clearly, there exist unique pN,λ ∈ Z[t, t−1 ], λ ∈ Λ, such that
X
ch• N =
pN,λ · λ.

(24)

λ∈Λ

The tensor product between Z-graded D-modules is Z-graded with the natural
grading for tensor product and it holds that
ch• (N⊗N′ ) = ch• N · ch• N′ .

(25)

The dual of N also is a Z-graded D-module by setting
N∗ (j) = (N(−j))∗ .
This is compatible with the grading of D because the antipode is an homogeneous
morphism.
Therefore ch• : R• −→ K[t, t−1 ] is a ring homomorphism and ch• N∗ = ch• N;
where p(t, t−1 ) = p(t−1 , t) for any p ∈ K[t, t−1 ].

3.1. Graded projectives. Thank to [15, Corollary 3.4] every projective module
admits a Z-grading. Moreover, up to a shift, every indecomposable projective
module admits only one Z-grading [15, Theorem 4.1].
For each λ ∈ Λ we fix a Z-grading P(λ) = ⊕n∈Z P(λ)(n) such that there is a
homogeneous weight S of degree 0 generating P(λ) with ch S = λ. Thus, we have
a commutative diagram of Z-graded D-module epimorphisms and a section
Ind(λ)
(26)
P(λ)

L(λ).

Also, the diagram on the right hand of (15) is of Z-graded D-modules.
Given λ ∈ Λ, we denote lλ the minimal degree of L(λ). Thus, (8) implies that

L(λ)[i] ≃ L λ [−i − lλ ] and lλ = lλ∗ .
Lemma 3.1. Let λ be a weight and i ∈ Z. In the category of Z-graded D-modules
it holds that
(i) P(λ)[i] is the projective cover and the injective hull of L(λ)[i].
(ii) P(λ)[i] is the projective cover of M(λ)[i].

(iii) P(λ)[i] is the injective hull of M λV · λ [i + lλ + ntop ].

(v) P(λ)[i] is the injective hull of W (λV · λ) [i − ntop ].

(vi) (P(λ)[i]) ≃ P λ [−i − lλ ].

Proof. (i) The first part is clear. Let e ∈ D0 be a primitive idempotent such
that P(λ) ≃ De [15, Proposition 5.8 (iii)], and S be the socle of De which is
homogeneous by [15, Proposition 3.5 (ii)]. Since the symmetric bilinear form of
D satisfies (1, eS(0)) = (1, eS), recall Section 2, we can reason like in the proof
of [13, (9.12)] to show that eS(0) 6= 0. Hence P(λ)[i] is the injective hull of L(λ)[i].
(vi) follows from Lemma 2.6 (i) and (27).
The remaining items are deduced from (i) and Lemma 2.6 (iii).

Let P be a projective module with a fixed Z-grading. Therefore there exist
unique polynomials pP,P(λ) ∈ Z≥0 [t, t−1 ] such that

as ungraded modules.
Let us consider P as a D≤0 -module. Since D≤0 is a graded subalgebra of D, P
also is a projective Z-graded D≤0 -module. Hence, by [15, Proposition 5.8 (iii)] and
Lemma 2.2, there exist unique polynomials pP,M(λ) ∈ Z≥0 [t, t−1 ] such that
P ≃ ⊕λ∈Λ pP,M(λ) · M(λ)

Moreover, for each λ ∈ Λ and i ∈ Z, we assume that the lowest-weight λV · λ is
concentrated in degree 0 and set
aP,M(λ),i = dim Hom•D≤0 (λV · λ, P)i−ntop .
Therefore dim HomD≤0 (λV · λ, P) = pP,M(λ) (1) and

In particular, we have that pInd(µ),P(λ) = pL(λ),µ and pInd(µ),M(λ) = pB(V )⊗µ,λ for
all λ, µ ∈ Λ. Thus, we obtain graded versions of (17) and (20), that is
Ind(µ) ≃ ⊕λ∈Λ pL(λ),µ · P(λ) ≃ M(ch• B(V ) · µ)

(34)

as Z-graded D-modules and Z-graded D≤0 -modules, respectively.

Remarks 3.2. Let Rproj

sets {ch M(λ) | λ ∈ Λ} and {ch W(λ) | λ ∈ Λ} so are by (30) and (39).

3.2. The simple modules are identified by their graded characters. Let
N = ⊕i∈Z N(i) be a Z-graded D-module. For each λ ∈ Λ and i ∈ Z, we define
aN,L(λ),i = dim Hom•D (P(λ)[i], N)0 = dim Hom•D (N, P(λ)[i])0 ;

(35)

these dimensions are equal by Lemma 3.1 (i). It is the number of composition
factors of N isomorphic to L(λ)[i]. We also define the Laurent polynomial

aN,L(λ),i ti ∈ Z[t, t−1 ].

By the next theorem the ring morphism ch• : R• −→ K[t, t−1 ] is injective.
Theorem 3.3. The set {ch• L(λ) | λ ∈ Λ} is a Z[t, t−1 ]-basis of R• . More explicitly,
if N = ⊕i∈Z N(i) is a Z-graded D-module, then the Laurent polynomials pN,L(λ) are
the unique ones such that

Therefore [N : L(λ)] = pN,L(λ) (1).

Proof. Suppose that 0 = λ∈Λ pλ ch• L(λ) with pλ ∈ Z[t, t−1 ]. Multiplying by a
suitable tj with j < 0, we can assume thatPpλ ∈ Z[t−1 ] for all λ. Then, we deduce
that pλ = 0 for all λ since ch• L(λ) = λ + j<0 ch L(λ)(j) tj , and the uniqueness
follows.
Let L be a simple submodule of N. As L is graded and a highest-weight module,
there is i ∈ Z such that L(j) ⊆ N(i + j) and the quotient N/L is a Z-graded Dmodule. Then ch• N = ti ch• L + ch• N/L and the theorem follows by induction
on the length of N; we use that P(λ)[i] is a Z-graded projective module and then
HomD (P(λ)[i], −)0 is an exact functor.
The equality [N : L(λ)] = pN,L(λ) (1) is clear.

3.3. Graded character identities. Irving has defined a class of highest weight
categories for which the BGG Reciprocity holds [19]. These categories have a
duality functor δ which is trivial on simple modules. Using the order on the weights,
he shows that the characters of a Verma module M and δM are equal.
Although we do not have either such a duality or an order on the weights, we
can prove the following identities among the graded characters of Verma modules,
their duals and the modules W(λ) = D⊗D≤0 λ, recall (14). Such identities are key
in the proof of the BGG Reciprocity.
Theorem 3.4. Let λ be a weight. Then
tntop ch• W(λV · λ)∗ = ch• W(λ∗ ) = ch• M(λ)∗ = tntop ch• M ((λV · λ)∗ ) .

Proof. We have that Bj (V )⊗λ ≃ Bj (V )∗ ⊗λ∗ ≃ Bj (V )⊗λ∗ by (1) and hence
ch• W(λ∗ ) = ch• M(λ)∗ , it is (ii).
On the other hand, (12) and (13) imply (i) and (iii), respectively:
ch• M(λ)∗ = tntop ch• M ((λV · λ)∗ )

and tntop ch• W(λV · λ)∗ = ch• W(λ∗ ).


We compare the graded composition factors of a Verma module and its dual
using that {ch• L(λ) | λ ∈ Λ} is a Z[t, t−1 ]-basis. Recall that M(µ)∗ ≃ M ((λV · µ)∗ )
by (11).
Corollary 3.5. Let λ and µ be weights. Then
tlµ +ntop pM(λ),L(µ) = pM((λV ·λ)∗ ),L(µ∗ ) .
In particular, [M(λ) : L(µ)] = [M ((λV · λ)∗ ) : L(µ∗ )] by evaluating the above polynomials at t = t−1 = 1.
Proof. We have the linear isomorphisms
Hom•D (P(µ)[i], M(λ))0 ≃ Hom•D (M(λ)∗ , (P(µ)[i])∗ )0
≃ Hom•D (M(λ)∗ , P (µ∗ ) [−lµ − i])0 .
Then aM(λ),L(µ),i = aM(λ)∗ ,L(µ∗ ),−lµ −i and hence pM(λ),L(µ) = t−lµ pM(λ)∗ ,L(µ∗ ) . Thus,
the corollary follows from Theorem 3.4.

We do not know yet whether the projective modules are filtered by Verma modules. Instead, we know that they decompose into the direct sum of Verma modules
as Z-graded D≤0 -modules (30). Such decomposition is related to the graded composition factors of the Verma modules, as we see below in a graded version of the
BGG Reciprocity.
Corollary 3.6. Let λ and µ be weights. Then
pP(µ),M(λ) = pM(λ),L(µ) .
Proof. We have the linear isomorphisms
Hom•D≤0 (λV · λ, P(µ))i−ntop ≃ Hom•D (W(λV · λ), P(µ))i−ntop
∗

≃ Hom•D (P(µ)∗ , (W(λV · λ)[i − ntop ]) )0
≃ Hom•D (P(µ∗ )[−lµ ], W(λV · λ)∗ [−i + ntop ])0
≃ Hom•D (P(µ∗ )[i − ntop − lµ ], W(λV · λ)∗ )0 ,

the first one is the Frobenius reciprocity and the third one is by Lemma 3.1 (vi).
Thus, by (32), Theorem 3.4 and Corollary 3.5, we have that
t−ntop −lµ pP(µ),M(λ) = pW(λV ·λ)∗ ,L(µ∗ ) = pM((λV ·λ)∗ ),L(µ∗ ) = t−lµ −ntop pM(λ),L(µ)
and the corollary follows.

4. Standard filtrations and the BGG Reciprocity
We say that a (graded) module N has a (graded) standard filtration, so-called
Verma flag, if there exists a sequence of (graded) subdmodules 0 = N0 ⊂ N1 ⊂ · · · ⊂
Nn = N such that each subquotient Ni /Ni−1 is isomorphic to a Verma module. The
multiplicity of a Verma module M(λ) in N is
[N : M(λ)] = # {i | Ni /Ni−1 ≃ M(λ)} .
We also define [N : M(λ)[ℓ]] = # {i | Ni /Ni−1 ≃ M(λ)[ℓ]} for the graded case.
The following lemmas are analogous to [17, Theorem 3.6 and Proposition 3.7
(b)].
Lemma 4.1. Let λ be a weight and N a (graded) module. Then M(λ)⊗N has a
(graded) standard filtration.
Proof. Let 0 = N0 ⊂ N1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Nr = λ⊗N be a filtration of λ⊗N by (graded)
D≥0 -modules such that Ni /Ni−1 is a highest-weight µi , i. e. a Jordan-Hölder series
as (graded) D≥0 -module. Applying the exact functor D⊗D≥0 (−) we obtain the
desired filtration on M(λ)⊗N using Lemma 2.9 with U = λ.

Lemma 4.2. Let N be a (graded) module which has a (graded) standard filtration
and N = N′ ⊕ N′′ as (graded) modules. Then N′ and N′′ have (graded) standard
filtrations.
Proof. By the (graded) standard filtration of N we have an inclusion of ι : M(λ) −→
N. Let p′ : N −→ N′ be the natural projection and ι′ its section. We can assume
that (p′ ◦ ι)(1⊗λ) 6= 0 since the Verma modules have simple socle. Therefore
(ι′ ◦ p′ ◦ ι) : M(λ) −→ N′ is an inclusion and the lemma follows by induction since
N/M(λ) = N′ /M(λ) ⊕ N′′ .

The main result of the section is the following, cf. [17, Theorems 3.10 and 3.11].
Recall the definition of aP,M(λ),i from (32).
Theorem 4.3. Every projective module P has a graded standard filtration and
[P : M(λ)[i]] = aP,M(λ),i
holds for all λ ∈ Λ. Therefore the BGG Reciprocity
[P(µ) : M(λ)] = [M(λ) : L(µ)]
holds for all λ, µ ∈ Λ.
Proof. By Lemma 2.8 and Lemma 4.1, Ind(λ) ≃ M(λ)⊗W(ε) has a graded standard
filtration. The indecomposable projective P(λ) is a graded direct summand of Ind(λ)
by (17) and the above section. Hence it has a graded standard filtration by Lemma
4.2. Therefore all the projective modules have a standard filtration.
The equality [P : M(λ)[i]] = aP,M(λ),i is clear and therefore the BGG Reciprocity
follows from Corollary 3.6 by evaluating the polynomials at t = t−1 = 1.

We point out the information about the structure of the indecomposable projective modules which can be deduced from the above results.
Remarks 4.4. Let 0 = N0 ⊂ N1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Nn = P(λ) be a graded standard filtration
of P(λ) whose subquotients are Ni /Ni−1 ≃ M(λi )[ℓi ] for all i = 1, ...n.
Hence, P(λ) ≃ M(λ1 )[ℓ1 ] ⊕ · · · ⊕ M(λn )[ℓn ] as Z-graded D≤0 -modules.
Via this isomorphism, V ·(1⊗λi )[ℓi ] ⊆ (1⊗λi−1 )[ℓi +1]. Moreover, if we know this
action, we can infer inductively the action of V on M(λi )[ℓi ] using the commutation
rules between V and V , cf. [26, p. 438].
By Lemma 3.1, M(λ1 )[ℓ1 ] = M(λV · λ)[lλ + ntop ] and M(λn )[ℓn ] = M(λ).
4.1. Simple and projective Verma modules. The next corollary is a direct
consequence of the BGG Reciprocity. However, we give another nice proof without
using the former theorem.
Lemma 4.5. Let f : N → M(λ) be a projection. If S ⊂ N is a highest-weight such
that f (S) = 1⊗λ, then f splits.
Proof. We define a morphism φ : M(λ) → N by φ(1⊗λ) = S and hence f ◦ φ =
idM .

Corollary 4.6. Let M(λ) be a Verma module. The following are equivalent:
(i) M(λ) is simple.
(ii) M(λ) is proyective.
(iii) M(λ) is inyective.
Proof. Since D is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra, a D-module is proyective if and
only if it is inyective. Then (ii) and (iii) are equivalent.
Assume that M = M(λ) is simple. We shall prove that every projection f :
N → M splits. By Lemma 4.5, it is enough to find a highest-weight S ⊂ N such
that f (S) = 1⊗λ. Let S ′ be a weight of N such that f (S ′ ) = Bntop (V )⊗λ. Then
S = ytop S ′ is a highest-weight of N and f (ytop S ′ ) = 1⊗λ by [26, Corollary 15].
Hence (i) implies (ii).
Assume now that M = M(λ) is projective. Let f : Ind(λ) → M be the projection
such that f (λ) = 1⊗λ and φ : M → Ind(λ) a section of f . Hence φ(1⊗λ) ⊂
ytop ⊗B(V )⊗λ since V S = 0. That is, for each s ∈ S there exists xs ∈ B(V ) such
that φ(s) = ytop ⊗xs ⊗s and then s = f φ(s) = ytop xs s. As the Verma module is
graded, xs ∈ Bntop (V ) and is non-zero if s 6= 0. Therefore M is simple by [26,
Corollary 15]. Then (ii) implies (i).

We obtain a useful result if we combine the above corollary and the characterization of the simple modules L(λ) and S(λ).
Corollary 4.7. Let N be a module and M(λ) a simple Verma module. Assume that
either λ is a highest-weight of N or λV · λ is a lowest-weight of N. Then M(λ) is a
direct summand of N.
Proof. If λ is a highest-weight of N, then we have a non-trivial morphism f :
M(λ) → N. As M(λ) is simple, f is a monomorphism. But also M(λ) is injective,
then f splits.
Assume that λV · λ is a lowest-weight. Let U be a simple quotient of the submodule generated by λV · λ. As there is a unique simple lowest-weight module of

16

CRISTIAN VAY

weight λV · λ, U = S(λ) = M(λ). Then M(λ) is a direct summand of U and hence
it is of N because M(λ) is injective.

4.2. Co-standard filtration. We say that a (graded) module has a (graded) costandard filtration if it is filtered by (graded) modules whose subquotients are isomorphic to co-Verma modules W(λ), recall (14). The multiplicities [N : W(λ)] and
[N : W(λ)[ℓ]] are defined as for standard filtrations. We next formulate analogous
results to those about standard filtrations. The proofs are similar.
Lemma 4.8. Let λ be a weight and N a (graded) module.
(i) Then M(λ)⊗N has a (graded) standard filtration.
(ii) If N has a (graded) standard filtration and N = N′ ⊕N′′ as (graded) modules,
then N′ and N′′ have (graded) standard filtrations.

Let P be a graded projective module. Then, it is also graded projective as a
D≥0 -module. For each λ ∈ Λ and i ∈ Z, we define
aP,W(λ),i = dim HomD≥0 (λV · λ, P)i+ntop
X
aP,W(λ),i ti ∈ Z[t, t−1 ];
pP,W(λ) =

i

we assume that the highest-weight λV · λ is concentrated in degree 0. Therefore
P ≃ ⊕λ∈Λ pP,W(λ) · W(λ).

(39)

as D≥0 -modules.
The second item below is the BGG Reciprocity for co-Verma modules. Item
(iii) says that the multiplicities of the co-Verma modules can be deduced from the
composition factors of the Verma modules.
Theorem 4.9. Every projective module P has a graded co-standard filtration and
the following indentities hold for all λ, µ ∈ Λ:
(i) [P : W(λ)[i]] = aP,W(λ),i .
(ii) pP(µ),W(λ) = pW(λ),L(µ) and [P(µ) : W(λ)] = [W(λ) : L(µ)].
(iii) pP(µ),W(λ) = t−ntop pM(λV ·λ),L(µ) and [P(µ) : W(λ)] = [M(λV · λ) : L(µ)].

4.3. Tensor product of projective modules.
Theorem 4.10. Let P and Q be projective modules. Then
P⊗Q ≃ ⊕λ,µ∈Λ pP,W(λ) pQ,M(µ) Ind(λ · µ).
Proof. Let 0 = Q0 ⊂ Q1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Qn = Q be a graded standard filtration of Q.
Since P⊗− is exact and P⊗N is projective for any module, we have that
P⊗Q ≃ ⊕ni=1 P⊗(Qi /Qi−1 ) ≃ ⊕µ∈Λ pQ,M(µ) P⊗M(µ).
Let 0 = P0 ⊂ P1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Pn = P be a graded co-standard filtration of P. By
Lemma 2.8, W(λ)⊗M(µ) ≃ Ind(λ · µ) is projective. Then
P⊗M(µ) ≃ ⊕ni=1 (Pi /Pi−1 )⊗M(µ) ≃ ⊕λ∈Λ pP,W(λ) Ind(λ · µ)
and the theorem follows.

5. Examples
5.1. Taft algebras. Let G = Cn = hgi be the cyclic group of order n and q a
n-th primitive root of unity. The quantum line khx | xn = 0i is isomorphic to the
Nichols algebra of V = kx ∈ kG
kG YD with action g · x = qx and coaction ρ(x) = g⊗x.
The Taft algebra Tq is the bosonization B(V )#kG. The Frobenius-Lusztig kernel
uq (sl(2)) is isomorphic to a quotient of the Drinfeld double D(Tq ) by a central
group-like element. The simple modules of D(Tq ) and uq (sl(2)) were studied for
instance in [11] and [1, 10, 14, 30], respectively.
In the case of D(Tq ), Λ ≃ Cn × Cn = hχ1 i × hχ2 i and all the Verma modules
M(r, s) = M(χr1 , χs2 ) have dimension n. The simple module L(r, 1 − (r + l)) has
dimension l for 1 ≤ l, r ≤ n [11, Theorem 2.5]. Therefore the Verma modules
M(r, 1 − (r + n)) are simple and projective by Corollary 4.6.
It is easy to see that the composition factors of M(r, 1 − (r + l)) are L(r, 1 − (r +
l)) and L(r + l, 1 − ((r + l) + (n − l))). Therefore the indecomposable projective
P(r, 1 − (r + l)) has a submodule N ≃ M(r + l − n, 1 − ((r + l − n) + (n − l))) and
P(r, 1 − (r + l))/N ≃ M(r, 1 − (r + l)) by the BGG Reciprocity. Notice that the
module in [11, Remark 2.8] is M(r, 1 − (r + n − 1)).
The previous facts do not appear in [11]. Of course, we can also come to the
same conclusion using the knowledge about modules over uq (sl(2)).
5.2. The Shapovalov determinant. Assume B(V ) is a Nichols algebra of diagonal type. In [16] the authors give a formula analogous to the Shapovalov determinant for complex semisimple Lie algebras. Thus, they characterize the simple
Verma modules of the Drinfeld doubles attached to B(V ). We now know that this
also gives a characterization of the projective Verma modules by Corollary 4.6.
5.3. The Nichols algebra of unidentified diagonal type ufo(7). This is the
smallest Nichols algebra B(V ) of unidentified type, dim B(V ) = 144, see [6]. Let
G be an abelian group such that B(V ) ∈ kG
kG YD and D the Drinfeld double of
B(V )#kG. The simple modules of D are classified in [2]. The authors divide the
set of weights in 47 subsets and study the corresponding Verma modules case by
case. They obtain three families of weights (C0 , C1 , C2 ) which are related with the
Shapovalov determinant.
They use the Shapovalov determinant to show that the Verma modules in C0 are
simple [2, Lemma 1.6]. Hence these are projective by Corollary 4.6.
The class C1 is formed by 9 different types of weights. The composition factors
of the Verma module M(λ), λ ∈ C1 , are given explicitly in [2, Section 2]. These are
L(λ) and L(λ′ ) for certain λ′ ∈ C1 . Then, using the BGG Reciprocity, we deduce
that the projective cover P(λ) of L(λ) has a submodule isomorphic to M(µ) for
certain µ ∈ C1 satisfying µ′ = λ and P(λ)/M(µ) ≃ M(λ).
The Verma module in C2 might have more than two composition factors, see [2,
Remark 3.2]. It is possibly to obtain the composition factors of M(λ), for all λ ∈ C2 ,
by reasoning as in [2, Remark 3.2]; the graded characters can also help.

5.4. The Fomin-Kirillov algebra F K3 . This is a Nichols algebra in kS
kS3 YD, it
is the smallest one over a non-abelian group. In [26] we investigate the Verma
and simple modules over the Drinfeld double of F K3 #kS3 . In this case, the set of
weights is

Λ = {(e, +), (e, −), (e, ρ), (σ, +), (σ, −), (τ, 0), (τ, 1), (τ, 2)} .

We have shown that M(e, −), M(τ, 1), M(τ, 2) and M(σ, +) are simple. Therefore
they are projective by Corollary 4.6. The composition factors of the remaining
Verma modules are given in [26, Theorems 7, 8, 9 and 10]. We have that
• ch M(σ, −) = 2 · ch L(σ, −) + 2 · ch L(e, +) + ch L(τ, 0) + ch L(e, ρ).
• ch M(e, +) = 2 · ch L(e, +) + ch L(σ, −).
• ch M(e, ρ) = ch M(τ, 0) = ch L(τ, 0) + ch L(e, ρ) + ch L(σ, −).
By the BGG Reciprocity, we conclude that
• ch P(σ, −) = 2 · ch M(σ, −) + ch M(e, +) + ch M(τ, 0) + ch M(e, ρ).
• ch P(e, +) = 2 · ch M(e, +) + 2 · ch M(σ, −).
• ch P(e, ρ) = ch M(τ, 0) = ch M(τ, 0) + ch M(e, ρ) + ch M(σ, −).
Together with Barbara Pogorelsky, we study these projective modules more in
detail [27]. We also discuss the tensor product between the simple and projective
modules.
