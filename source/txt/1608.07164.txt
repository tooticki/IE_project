Abstract
We discuss an omission in the statement and proof of Fiorini’s 1983 theorem on hypohamiltonian snarks and present a version of this theorem which is more general in several
ways. Using Fiorini’s erroneous result, Steffen showed that hypohamiltonian snarks exist
for some n ≥ 10 and each even n ≥ 92. We rectify Steffen’s proof by providing a correct
demonstration of a technical lemma on flower snarks, which might be of separate interest.
We then strengthen Steffen’s theorem to the strongest possible form by determining all orders for which hypohamiltonian snarks exists. This also strengthens a result of Máčajová
and Škoviera. Finally, we verify a conjecture of Steffen on hypohamiltonian snarks up to
36 vertices.
Keywords: hypohamiltonian, snark, irreducible snark, dot product

1 Introduction
A graph G is hypohamiltonian if G itself is non-hamiltonian, but for every vertex v in G,
the graph G − v is hamiltonian. A snark shall be a cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graph
with chromatic index 4 (i.e. four colours are required in any proper edge-colouring) and
girth at least 5. We refer for notions not defined here to [21] and [6].
Motivated by similarities between the family of all snarks and the family of all cubic hypohamiltonian graphs regarding the orders for which such graphs exist, Fiorini [7] studied
the hypohamiltonian properties surrounding Isaacs’ so-called “flower snarks” [11] (defined
rigorously below). The a priori surprising interplay between snarks and hypohamiltonian
graphs has been investigated extensively—we now give an overview. Early contributions

include Fiorini’s aforementioned paper [7], in which he showed that there exist infinitely
many hypohamiltonian snarks. (In fact, according to Máčajová and Škoviera [16], it was
later discovered that a family of hypohamiltonian graphs constructed by Gutt [10] includes
Isaacs’ snarks, thus including Fiorini’s result.)
Skupień showed that there exist exponentially many hypohamiltonian snarks [18], and
Steffen [21] proved that there exist hypohamiltonian snarks of order n for every even n ≥
92 (and certain n < 92)—we will come back to this result in Section 3. For more references
and connections to other problems, see e.g. [16, 18, 3, 22]. Hypohamiltonian snarks have
also been studied in connection with the famous Cycle Double Cover Conjecture [3] and
Sabidussi’s Compatibility Conjecture [8].
The smallest snark, as well as the smallest hypohamiltonian graph, is the famous Petersen graph. Steffen [20] showed that every cubic hypohamiltonian graph with chromatic
index 4 is bicritical, i.e. the graph itself is not 3-edge-colourable but deleting any two distinct vertices yields a 3-edge-colourable graph. Nedela and Škoviera [17] proved that every
cubic bicritical graph is cyclically 4-edge-connected and has girth at least 5. Therefore,
every cubic hypohamiltonian graph with chromatic index 4 must be a snark.
This article is organised as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the omission in Fiorini’s
theorem on hypohamiltonian snarks [7] and its consequences and state a more general version of this theorem. In Section 3 we first rectify a proof of Steffen on the orders for which
hypohamiltonian snarks exist which relied on Fiorini’s theorem—this erratum is based on
giving a correct proof of a technical lemma concerning flower snarks, which may be of separate interest. We then prove a strengthening of Steffen’s theorem, which is best possible,
as all orders for which hypohamiltonian snarks exist are determined. Our result is stronger
than a theorem of Máčajová and Škoviera [15] in the sense that our result implies theirs,
while the inverse implication does not hold. Finally, in Section 4 we comment upon and
verify a conjecture of Steffen on hypohamiltonian snarks [22] for small hypohamiltonian
snarks.

2 Fiorini’s Theorem Revisited
We call two edges independent if they have no common vertices. Let G and H be disjoint
connected graphs on at least 6 vertices. Consider G′ = G − {ab, cd}, where ab and cd are
independent edges in G, H ′ = H − {x, y}, where x and y are adjacent cubic vertices in
H, and let a′ , b′ and c′ , d′ be the other neighbours of x and y in H, respectively. Then the
dot product G · H is defined as the graph
(V (G) ∪ V (H ′ ), E(G′ ) ∪ E(H ′ ) ∪ {aa′ , bb′ , cc′ , dd′ }).
Two remarks are in order. (1) Under the above conditions, the dot product may be disconnected. (2) In fact, there are two ways to form the dot product for a specific ab, cd, xy.
One also has the possibility to add the edges {ac′ , bd′ , ca′ , db′ }. However, in this paper we
will always construct the dot product by adding the former set of edges, summarising this
in the following statements as “a, b, c, d are joined by edges to the neighbours of x and y,
respectively”.
According to Skupień [19], the dot product was introduced by Adel’son-Vel’skiı̌ and
Titov [1], and later and independently by Isaacs [11]. Its original purpose was to obtain new
snarks by combining known snarks. Isaacs was the first to explicitly construct infinitely
many snarks [11]. Fiorini then proved that the dot product can also be used to combine

3

two hypohamiltonian snarks into a new one. Unfortunately, Fiorini’s argument is incorrect.
We shall discuss this omission within this section, and correct the proof of a lemma of
Steffen [21] which depended on Fiorini’s result in Section 3.
In a graph G, a pair (v, w) of vertices is good in G if there exists a hamiltonian path in
G with end-vertices v and w. Two pairs of vertices ((v, w), (x, y)) are good in G if there
exist two disjoint paths which together span G, and which have end-vertices v and w, and
x and y, respectively.
Theorem 2.1 (Fiorini, Theorem 3 in [7]). Let G be a hypohamiltonian snark having two
independent edges ab and cd for which
(i) each of (a, c), (a, d), (b, c), (b, d), ((a, b), (c, d)) is good in G;
(ii) for each vertex v, exactly one of (a, b), (c, d) is good in G − v.
If H is a hypohamiltonian snark with adjacent vertices x and y, then the dot product
G · H is also a hypohamiltonian snark, where ab and cd are deleted from G, x and y are
deleted from H, and vertices a, b, c, d are joined by edges to the neighbours of x and y,
respectively.
Cavicchioli et al. [5] point out the omissions in Theorem 2.1: in order for the proof to
work, the given vertex pairs need to be good in the graph minus the edges ab, cd. They
restate the theorem and give a new proof.
Theorem 2.2 (Cavicchioli et al., Theorem 3.2 in [5]). Let G be a hypohamiltonian snark
having two independent edges ab and cd for which
(i) each of (a, c), (a, d), (b, c), (b, d), ((a, b), (c, d)) is good in G − {ab, cd};
(ii) for each vertex v, each of (a, b), (c, d) is good in G − {v, ab, cd}.
If H is a hypohamiltonian snark with adjacent vertices x and y, then the dot product
G · H is also a hypohamiltonian snark, where ab and cd are deleted from G, x and y are
deleted from H, and vertices a, b, c, d are joined by edges to the neighbours of x and y,
respectively.
In above statements, the fact that the dot product of snarks is itself a snark had already
been shown [1, 11], so indeed only the hypohamiltonicity was to be proven.
We point out that the hypotheses in Theorem 2.2 are unattainable for v ∈ {a, b, c, d},
which is tied to the fact that the requirements in (ii) are stronger than what is needed to
prove the statement.
In [9], the following (second) restatement of Theorem 2.1 is given. Note that in [9] the
graphs are required to be cubic and below we do not state this requirement—we do however
need the two vertices which are removed to be cubic. This allows us to use exactly the same
proof as in [9].
Theorem 2.3 (Goedgebeur and Zamfirescu). Let G be a non-hamiltonian graph having
two independent edges ab and cd for which
(i) each of (a, c), (a, d), (b, c), (b, d), ((a, b), (c, d)) is good in G − {ab, cd};
(ii) for each vertex v, at least one of (a, b) and (c, d) is good in G − {v, ab, cd}.
If H is a hypohamiltonian graph with cubic adjacent vertices x and y, then the dot
product G · H is also a hypohamiltonian graph, where ab and cd are deleted from G, x and
y are deleted from H, and vertices a, b, c, d are joined by edges to the neighbours of x and
y, respectively.

4

If G and H are planar, and ab and cd lie on the same facial cycle, then the dot product
can be applied such that G · H is planar, as well. If g (h) is the girth of G (H), then the
girth of G · H is at least min{g, h}. If G and H are cubic, then so is G · H.
Note that the fact that G is non-hamiltonian together with condition (ii) implies that G
must be hypohamiltonian.
In the following, we will call the pair of edges ab, cd from the statement of Theorem 2.3
suitable. The Petersen graph is the smallest snark, and the two Blanuša snarks on 18 vertices are the second-smallest snarks. All three graphs are also hypohamiltonian. Due the
huge automorphism group of the Petersen graph, it can be verified by hand that it does not
contain a pair of suitable edges. Although both Blanuša snarks are dot products of two
Petersen graphs, the Petersen graph does not contain a pair of suitable edges. Thus, in a
certain sense, Theorem 2.3 is not “if and only if”, i.e. there exist dot products whose factors
do not contain suitable edges.
Let us end this section with a remark which may prove to be useful in other applications.
Throughout its statement and proof, we use the notation from Theorem 2.3.
Observation 2.4. We have that G · H + ab, G · H + cd, and G · H + ab + cd are hypohamiltonian, as well.
Proof. Put N (x) = {a′ , b′ , y} and N (y) = {c′ , d′ , x} such that the unique neighbour of
a′ (b′ , c′ , d′ ) in G is a (b, c, d). Assume G · H + ab + cd contains a hamiltonian cycle
h. Thus, at least one of ab and cd lies in h, say ab. We treat H − {x, y} as a subgraph
of G · H. If aa′ , bb′ ∈ E(h), then h ∩ H ∪ a′ xb′ ∪ c′ yd′ gives a hamiltonian cycle in H,
a contradiction. If aa′ , bb′ ∈
/ E(h), then the cycle h ∩ G + cd yields a contradiction. So
w.l.o.g. aa ∈ E(h) and bb′ ∈
/ E(h). This implies the existence of a hamiltonian path in
H − {x, y} with end-vertices a′ and u ∈ {c′ , d′ }. But this path together with uyxa′ is a
hamiltonian cycle in H, a contradiction. It follows that G · H + ab and G · H + cd are
non-hamiltonian, as well.

3 On a Theorem of Steffen on Hypohamiltonian Snarks
3.1 Rectifying Steffen’s proof
A snark is irreducible if the removal of every edge-cut which is not the set of all edges
incident with a vertex yields a 3-edge-colourable graph. Steffen’s article [21] is motivated
by the following problem.
Problem 3.1 (Nedela and Škoviera [17]). For which even number n ≥ 10 does there exist
an irreducible snark of order n? In particular, does there exist an irreducible snark of each
sufficiently large order?
Steffen settled the second question of Problem 3.1 by giving the following main result
from [21].
Theorem 3.2 (Steffen, Theorem 2.5 in [21]). There is a hypohamiltonian snark of order n
(1) for each n ∈ {m : m ≥ 64 and m ≡ 0 mod 8}
(2) for each n ∈ {10, 18} ∪ {m : m ≥ 98 and m ≡ 2 mod 8}
(3) for each n ∈ {m : m ≥ 20 and m ≡ 4 mod 8}
(4) for each n ∈ {30} ∪ {m : m ≥ 54 and m ≡ 6 mod 8}
(5) for each even n ≥ 92.

Isaacs’ flower snark J2k+1 , see [11], is the graph

2k
{ai , bi , ci , di }2k
i=0 , {bi ai , bi ci , bi di , ai ai+1 , ci di+1 , di ci+1 }i=0 ,
where addition in the indices is performed modulo 2k + 1.
However, the proof of [21, Lemma 2.3], which is essential for the proof of the theorem,
is erroneous, since it uses Theorem 2.1 (and it does not, by sheer coincidence, work with
Theorem 2.3). We here give a correct proof of that lemma.

Lemma 3.3 (Steffen, Lemma 2.3 in [21]). The flower snarks J9 , J11 , and J13 satisfy the
conditions of Theorem 2.3.
Proof. In [21], in each of the graphs J9 , J11 , and J13 , the suitable edges were chosen to
be b0 c0 and b4 c4 . However, in [21], for various vertices v, the hamiltonian paths did not
satisfy condition (ii) from Theorem 2.3, as the paths used one of the edges b0 c0 or b4 c4 .
This was for instance the case for v ∈ {a0 , a8 , d0 } in J9 , for v ∈ {a0 , a10 , d0 } in J11 and
for v ∈ {a0 , c1 , c12 , d0 } in J13 , see Claims 6, 7, and 8 in the Appendix of [21].
We will now prove that b0 c0 and b4 c4 are indeed suitable edges for Theorem 2.3 for J9 ,
J11 , and J13 . For J9 the proof is given below (and partially in the Appendix), while the
technical details of the proofs for J11 and J13 can be found in the Appendix. The mapping
between the ai , bi , ci , di (used by Steffen) and the vertex numbers used in the proof is
shown in Figures 1–3. We use numbers as labels in the proof to make it easier to read these
graphs using a computer for verifying the results.
Proof that b0 c0 and b4 c4 are suitable edges for J9 .
Figure 1 shows the flower snark J9 . In J9 , b0 c0 and b4 c4 correspond to the edges (0, 26)
and (11, 12), respectively.

6

(0, 11), (0, 12), (26, 11) and (26, 12) are good in J9 − {(0, 26), (11, 12)} due to the
following hamiltonian paths, respectively:
• 11, 10, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 30, 29, 28, 27, 35, 24, 23, 22, 17, 16, 15, 32, 31, 12, 13, 14, 19, 18, 33,
34, 21, 20, 25, 26, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
• 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 11, 10, 5, 4, 26, 25, 20, 19, 18, 17, 22, 21, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 9, 8, 7, 6, 29,
28, 3, 2, 1, 23, 24, 35, 27, 0
• 11, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 27, 28, 29, 6, 7, 8, 9, 30, 31, 12, 13, 14, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 32, 33, 34,
35, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 25, 26
• 12, 13, 8, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 29, 28, 27, 0, 1, 23, 22, 17, 18, 33, 32, 31, 30, 9, 10, 11, 16, 15, 14,
19, 20, 21, 34, 35, 24, 25, 26

((0, 26), (11, 12)) is good in J9 − {(0, 26), (11, 12)} due to the following two disjoint
paths with end-vertices 0 and 26, and 11 and 12, respectively, which together span J9 .
• 26, 25, 20, 19, 14, 13, 8, 7, 2, 1, 0
• 12, 31, 32, 15, 16, 17, 18, 33, 34, 21, 22, 23, 24, 35, 27, 28, 3, 4, 5, 6, 29, 30, 9, 10, 11

We showed by computer that at least one of (0, 26) or (11, 12) is good in J9 −{v, (0, 26),
(11, 12)} for every v ∈ V (J9 ). In each case we verified that the path found by the computer is indeed a valid hamiltonian path in the graph. Below we explicitly show this for
v = 0. The hamiltonian paths for the other values of v can be found in the Appendix.
v = 0: 12, 13, 14, 15, 32, 31, 30, 29, 6, 5, 10, 9, 8, 7, 2, 1, 23, 24, 25, 26, 4, 3, 28, 27, 35, 34, 33, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 17, 16, 11

Since Steffen’s statement of Lemma 3.3 remains intact, the proof and statement of his
main result, reproduced above as Theorem 3.2, are correct as given in [21]. Even though we
prove a stronger version of Steffen’s theorem in the next section, we think it is important to
fix the proof of Lemma 3.3 as there may be others who rely on this lemma, or might want
to rely on it in the future.
3.2 Orders of hypohamiltonian snarks
We shall now prove a strengthening of Steffen’s theorem, which in a sense is strongest
possible since we will determine all orders for which hypohamiltonian snarks exist. We
emphasise that our proof’s mechanism contains significantly fewer “moving parts” than
Máčajová and Škoviera’s [15], and, as mentioned in the introduction, our theorem also
strengthens their result. We do need the following two easily verifiable lemmas.
Lemma 3.4. The second Blanuša snark B2 shown in Figure 4 has a pair of suitable edges.
Proof. Figure 4 shows the second Blanuša snark B2 . By computer we determined that B2
has exactly three pairs of suitable edges: ((6, 8), (10, 16)), ((3, 9), (12, 17)) and ((4, 7),
(13, 15)). We will now prove by hand that ((6, 8), (10, 16)) is a suitable edge pair.
(6, 10), (6, 16), (8, 10) and (8, 16) are good in B2 − {(6, 8), (10, 16)} due to the following hamiltonian paths, respectively:
• 10, 11, 12, 17, 16, 15, 13, 14, 0, 1, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9, 3, 2, 6
• 16, 15, 9, 8, 7, 17, 12, 13, 14, 10, 11, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

• 10, 11, 1, 0, 14, 13, 12, 17, 16, 15, 9, 3, 2, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8
• 16, 15, 9, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 0, 1, 11, 10, 14, 13, 12, 17, 7, 8

((6, 8), (10, 16)) is good in B2 − {(6, 8), (10, 16)} due to the following two disjoint
paths with end-vertices 6 and 8, and 10 and 16, respectively, which together span B2 .
• 8, 7, 4, 5, 6
• 16, 17, 12, 11, 1, 0, 2, 3, 9, 15, 13, 14, 10

We now prove that at least one of (6, 8) or (10, 16) is good in B2 − {v, (6, 8), (10, 16)}
for every v ∈ V (B2 ). By symmetry we only need to prove this for v = 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8.
• v = 0: 8, 7, 4, 5, 1, 11, 10, 14, 13, 12, 17, 16, 15, 9, 3, 2, 6

• v = 4: 16, 15, 13, 14, 0, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 9, 8, 7, 17, 12, 11, 10

• v = 8: 16, 15, 9, 3, 2, 6, 5, 4, 7, 17, 12, 13, 14, 0, 1, 11, 10

has exactly six pairs of suitable edges: ((0, 1), (17, 20)), ((0, 2), (8, 17)), ((1, 5), (14, 20)),
((2, 3), (8, 10)), ((3, 4), (10, 12)) and ((4, 5), (12, 14)). We will now prove by hand that
((3, 4), (10, 12)) is a suitable edge pair.

9

(3, 10), (3, 12), (4, 10) and (4, 12) are good in L1 − {(3, 4), (10, 12)} due to the following hamiltonian paths, respectively:
• 10, 7, 9, 6, 8, 17, 19, 21, 16, 13, 11, 0, 1, 5, 4, 18, 20, 14, 12, 15, 2, 3
• 12, 14, 20, 18, 4, 5, 7, 10, 8, 17, 19, 21, 16, 9, 6, 1, 0, 11, 13, 15, 2, 3
• 10, 7, 5, 1, 0, 11, 13, 16, 9, 6, 8, 17, 20, 14, 12, 15, 2, 3, 19, 21, 18, 4
• 12, 14, 11, 0, 1, 6, 9, 16, 13, 15, 2, 3, 19, 21, 18, 20, 17, 8, 10, 7, 5, 4

((3, 4), (10, 12)) is good in L1 − {(3, 4), (10, 12)} due to the following two disjoint
paths with end-vertices 3 and 4, and 10 and 12, respectively, which together span L1 .
• 4, 5, 1, 6, 8, 17, 20, 18, 21, 19, 3
• 12, 14, 11, 0, 2, 15, 13, 16, 9, 7, 10

We now prove that at least one of (3, 4) or (10, 12) is good in L1 − {v, (3, 4), (10, 12)}
for every v ∈ V (L1 ). By symmetry we only need to prove this for v = 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
16, 17, 18, 21.
• v = 1: 12, 15, 13, 16, 9, 6, 8, 17, 20, 14, 11, 0, 2, 3, 19, 21, 18, 4, 5, 7, 10

Figure 5: The first Loupekine snark L1 . It has 22 vertices. The suitable edges (3, 4) and (10, 12)
are marked in bold red.

The following is the strongest form of Steffen’s Theorem 3.2.
Theorem 3.6. There exists a hypohamiltonian snark of order n iff n ∈ {10, 18, 20, 22} or
n is even and n ≥ 26.
Proof. For n = 10, it is well-known that the Petersen graph is hypohamiltonian and it is
also well-known that no snarks exist of order 12, 14 or 16.
In Lemma 3.4 we showed that the second Blanuša snark B2 (which has order 18) contains a pair of suitable edges. In [3] it was proven that hypohamiltonian snarks exists for
all even orders from 18 to 36 with the exception of 24 (see Table 1). Let Sn denote a
hypohamiltonian snark of order n. Using Theorem 2.3, we form the dot product B2 · Sn
for n ∈ {18, 20, 22, 26, 28, 30, 32} and obtain hypohamiltonian snarks of all even orders
between 34 and 48 with the exception of 40 (recall that the dot product of two snarks is a
snark).
By Lemma 3.5 we know that the first Loupekine snark L1 (which has order 22) contains
a pair of suitable edges. Applying Theorem 2.3 to this snark and a 22-vertex hypohamiltonian snark, we obtain a hypohamiltonian snark of order 40.
We form the dot product B2 · Sn for all even n ∈ {34, ..., 48} and obtain hypohamiltonian snarks of all even orders from 50 to 64. This may now be iterated ad infinitum, and
the proof is complete.
In [15] Máčajová and Škoviera proved the following theorem (which fully settles Problem 3.1).
Theorem 3.7 (Máčajová and Škoviera, Theorems A and B in [15]). There exists an irreducible snark of order n iff n ∈ {10, 18, 20, 22} or n is even and n ≥ 26.

11

Nedela and Škoviera [17] proved that a snark is irreducible if and only if it is bicritical,
and Steffen [20] showed that every hypohamiltonian snark is bicritical—while the converse
is not true, as will be shown in Table 1.
In [4] Carneiro, da Silva, and McKay determined all 4-vertex-critical snarks up to 36
vertices and Škoviera [23] showed that a snark is 4-vertex-critical if and only if it is irreducible. (A graph G without k-flow is k-vertex-critical if, for every pair of vertices (u, v)
of G, identifying u and v yields a graph that has a k-flow (see [4] for more details)).
The number of hypohamiltonian snarks on n ≤ 36 vertices was determined in [3] and
can be found in Table 1 together with the number of irreducible snarks from [4]. These
graphs can also be downloaded from the House of Graphs [2] at
http://hog.grinvin.org/Snarks.
As can be seen from Table 1, there are a significant number of irreducible snarks which
are not hypohamiltonian. The smallest such snarks have order 26. So Theorem 3.6 implies
Theorem 3.7, while the inverse implication is not true.

Table 1: Number of irreducible and hypohamiltonian snarks (see [4, Table 1] and [3, Table 2]).
λc stands for cyclic edge-connectivity. The counts of cases indicated with a ’≥’ are possibly
incomplete; all other cases are complete.

The hypohamiltonian snarks on n ≥ 34 vertices constructed by the dot product in the
proof of Theorem 3.6 clearly all have cyclic edge-connectivity 4. By combining this with
Table 1 we obtain:
Corollary 3.8. There exists a hypohamiltonian snark of order n and cyclic edge-connectivity 4
iff n ∈ {18, 26, 28, 30} or n is even and n ≥ 34.
As already mentioned, every hypohamiltonian snark is irreducible, thus Corollary 3.8
implies [15, Theorem A]. For higher cyclic edge-connectivity, the following is known.
Theorem 3.9 (Máčajová and Škoviera [16]). There exists a hypohamiltonian snark of order n and cyclic connectivity 5 for each even n ≥ 140, and there exists a hypohamiltonian
snark of order n and cyclic connectivity 6 for each even n ≥ 166.

12

If we relax the requirements from hypohamiltonicity to irreducibility, more is known:
Theorem 3.10 (Máčajová and Škoviera [15]). There exists an irreducible snark of order n
and cyclic connectivity 5 iff n ∈ {10, 20, 22, 26} or n is even and n ≥ 30, and there exists
an irreducible snark of order n and cyclic connectivity 6 for each n ≡ 4 (mod 8) with
n ≥ 28, and for each even n ≥ 210.
Note that as every hypohamiltonian graph is irreducible, Theorem 3.9 also implies that
n ≥ 210 can be improved to n ≥ 166 in Theorem 3.10.
The smallest hypohamiltonian snark of cyclic edge-connectivity 5 has order 10 and is
the Petersen graph, and the second-smallest such graph has order 20. The flower snark J7 of
order 28 is the smallest cyclically 6-edge-connected hypohamiltonian snark. We conclude
this section with the following two problems motivated by Theorem 3.10 and results of
Kochol [12, 14].
Problem 3.11 (Máčajová and Škoviera [15]). Construct a cyclically 6-edge-connected
snark (irreducible or not) of order smaller than 118 and different from any of Isaacs’ snarks.
Problem 3.12. Determine all orders for which cyclically 6-edge-connected snarks exist.

4 On a Conjecture of Steffen on Hypohamiltonian Snarks
Consider a cubic graph G. We denote with µk (G) the minimum number of edges not
contained in the union of k 1-factors of G, for every possible combination of k 1-factors.
If µ3 (G) = 0, then G is 3-edge-colourable. In [22], Steffen made the following conjecture
on hypohamiltonian snarks.
Conjecture 4.1 (Steffen, Conjecture 4.1 in [22]). If G is a hypohamiltonian snark, then
µ3 (G) = 3.
If true, this conjecture would have significant consequences, e.g. by Theorem 2.14
from [22], it would imply that every hypohamiltonian snark has a Berge-cover (a bridgeless
cubic graph G has a Berge-cover if µ5 (G) = 0).
We wrote a computer program for computing µ3 (G) and tested Conjecture 4.1 on the
complete lists of hypohamiltonian snarks up to 36 vertices. This leads to the following
observation.
Observation 4.2. There are no counterexamples to Conjecture 4.1 among the hypohamiltonian snarks with at most 36 vertices.
The authors of [3] noted a huge increase (from 13 to 31 198) in the number of hypohamiltonian snarks from order 32 to 34, see Table 1. Using a computer, we were able
to determine that 29 365 out of the 29 701 hypohamiltonian snarks with cyclic edgeconnectivity 4 on 34 vertices can be obtained by performing a dot product on a hypohamiltonian snark on 26 vertices and the Petersen graph. We also determined that the
remaining hypohamiltonian snarks with cyclic edge-connectivity 4 on 34 vertices are obtained by performing a dot product on the Blanuša snarks. Intriguingly, our computations
show that some hypohamiltonian snarks can be obtained by performing a dot product on a
hypohamiltonian snark on 26 vertices and the Petersen graph, as well as by performing a
dot product on the Blanuša snarks.

13

There is also a (slightly less dramatic) increase in the cyclically 5-edge-connected
case—these are obviously not dot products—and we believe it to be due to more general
graph products, for instance “superposition” introduced by Kochol [13]. It would be interesting to further explore these transformations in order to fully understand these sudden
increases and decreases in numbers.
Using a computer, we determined that all hypohamiltonian snarks with cyclic edgeconnectivity 4 up to 36 vertices can be obtained by performing a dot product on two hypohamiltonian snarks. This leads us to pose the following question.
Problem 4.3. Is every hypohamiltonian snark with cyclic edge-connectivity 4 a dot product
of two hypohamiltonian snarks?
Recall that in Theorem 2.3 the graphs G and H are hypohamiltonian, but the theorem
is not “if and only if”, since although the Petersen graph does not contain a pair of suitable
edges, the Blanuša snarks (which are dot products of two Petersen graphs) are hypohamiltonian. We believe the answer to this problem to be “no” due to the following observation.
In order to cover all cases, we would need to add to condition (ii) of Theorem 2.3 the possibility of ((a, b), (c, d)) being good in G − {v, ab, cd}. However, we would then need to
require from H that it contains a 2-factor containing exactly two (necessarily odd) cycles.
Although we were unable to find a counter-example, we believe that there exist hypohamiltonian snarks which do not possess such a 2-factor.
We also determined all hypohamiltonian snarks up to 44 vertices which can be obtained
by performing a dot product on two hypohamiltonian snarks. The counts of these snarks
can be found in the fourth column of Table 1. We also verified Conjecture 4.1 on these
snarks.
Observation 4.4. There are no counterexamples to Conjecture 4.1 among the hypohamiltonian snarks with at most 44 vertices which are a dot product of two hypohamiltonian
snarks.
