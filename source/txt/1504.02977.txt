Abstract. A flexible polyhedron in an n-dimensional space Xn of constant curvature is a
polyhedron with rigid (n− 1)-dimensional faces and hinges at (n− 2)-dimensional faces. The
Bellows conjecture claims that, for n ≥ 3, the volume of any flexible polyhedron is constant
during the flexion. The Bellows conjecture in Euclidean spaces En was proved by Sabitov
for n = 3 (1996) and by the author for n ≥ 4 (2012). Counterexamples to the Bellows
conjecture in open hemispheres Sn+ were constructed by Alexandrov for n = 3 (1997) and
by the author for n ≥ 4 (2015). In this paper we prove the Bellows conjecture for bounded
flexible polyhedra in odd-dimensional Lobachevsky spaces. The proof is based on the study
of the analytic continuation of the volume of a simplex in the Lobachevsky space considered
as a function of the hyperbolic cosines of its edge lengths.

1. Introduction
Let Xn be one of the three n-dimensional spaces of constant curvature, namely, the Euclidean space En , or the Lobachevsky space Λn , or the sphere Sn . We shall always normalize
the metrics on the sphere Sn and on the Lobachevsky space Λn so that their (sectional)
curvatures are equal to 1 and −1, respectively. We consider an oriented connected closed
(n − 1)-dimensional polyhedral surface P in Xn with rigid (n − 1)-faces and with hinges
at (n − 2)-faces. We consider continuous deformations Pt of P such that all Pt have the
same combinatorial type, and every (n − 1)-face of Pt remains congruent to itself during the
deformation, while the dihedral angles at (n − 2)-faces of Pt are allowed to vary continuously.
Such deformations Pt are called flexions of P . A flexion Pt is called non-trivial if it is not
induced by an ambient rotation of Xn . A polyhedral surface P is called a flexible polyhedron
if it admits a non-trivial flexion. Notice that the surface P is not required to be embedded,
though embedded flexible polyhedra are of a special interest. The two-dimensional case is
trivial, since all generic polygons in E2 , Λ2 , and S2 with at least four sides are flexible, and
all triangles are rigid. So further we assume that n ≥ 3.
The study of flexible polyhedra started with Bricard’s classification of flexible octahedra
in E3 , see [6]. According to this classification, there are three families of flexible octahedra
in E3 , and none of them contains an embedded octahedron. The first example of an embedded
flexible polyhedron in E3 was constructed by Connelly [11], see also [21]. The simplest of the
presently known embedded flexible polyhedra was constructed by Steffen in 1978. It has 9
vertices. This polyhedron and its unfolding are shown in Fig. 1. A more detailed description
of it can be found in [12]. Kuiper [21, Sect. 2.7] noticed that the analogues of Bricard’s
flexible octahedra and of Connelly’s flexible polyhedron exist both in Λ3 and in S3 , see

also [36]. For a long time the problem on existence of flexible polyhedra in dimensions 4 and
higher remained open. Examples of flexible self-intersecting polyhedra in dimension 4 were
constructed by Walz (unpublished) and Stachel [35]. In dimensions 5 and higher, the first
examples of flexible polyhedra were constructed by the author [19] in all the three spaces En ,
Λn , and Sn . In addition, in [20] the author showed that in spheres Sn of all dimensions there
exist embedded flexible polyhedra with the combinatorial type of the cross-polytope that
are contained in the open hemispheres Sn+ . (Recall that the cross-polytope is the regular
polytope dual to the cube.) However, the problem on the existence of embedded flexible
polyhedra in Euclidean and Lobachevsky spaces of dimensions 4 and higher is still open.
In 1978 Connelly [13] conjectured that the volume of any flexible polyhedron in E3 is
constant during the flexion. This assertion is now called the Bellows conjecture. Notice that
this conjecture makes sense for all polyhedra without the requirement of embeddedness, since
for self-intersecting polyhedra there is a natural concept of a generalized oriented volume,
see Section 7 for details. The proof of the Bellows conjecture by Sabitov [27]–[29] is one of
the most amazing results in the theory of flexible polyhedra. Another proof was obtained
in [14]. Notice that flexible polygons change their areas during the flexion, so no analogue
of the Bellows conjecture holds in dimension 2.
It is natural to consider the analogues of the Bellows conjecture for flexible polyhedra in all
spaces of constant curvature of dimensions 3 and higher. If Xn = En or Λn , then the Bellows
conjecture in Xn says that the volume of any flexible polyhedron in Xn is constant during
the flexion. The author [17], [18] proved the Bellows conjecture in all Euclidean spaces En ,
n ≥ 4.
The aim of the present paper is to prove that the Bellows conjecture holds for all bounded
flexible polyhedra in odd-dimensional Lobachevsky spaces Λn , n ≥ 3.
Theorem 1.1. The generalized oriented volume of any bounded flexible polyhedron in Λn ,
where n is odd and n ≥ 3, is constant during the flexion.
To make this assertion rigorous, we need to give rigorous definitions of a flexible polyhedron
and of a generalized oriented volume. This will be done in Section 7. Theorem 7.3 in that
section is a more precise formulation of Theorem 1.1.
In Lobachevsky spaces, alongside with bounded flexible polyhedra, one can consider flexible polyhedra of finite volume with some vertices on the absolute. It remains unknown
2

whether the Bellows conjecture is true for such polyhedra. Also, it still remains unknown
whether the Bellows conjecture is true in even-dimensional Lobachevsky spaces.
In the spherical case there exist the following trivial examples of flexible polyhedra with
non-constant volumes. Consider any flexible polygon with non-constant area in the equatorial
sphere S2 ⊂ S3 , and take the suspension over it with the vertices at the poles of S3 . It is easy
to see that the volume of the obtained flexible polyhedron is non-constant. Iterating this
construction, we can obtain examples of flexible polyhedra with non-constant volumes in
spheres of all dimensions. Such trivial examples become possible because they are too large
and contain pairs of antipodal points of the sphere. Therefore, the Bellows conjecture for Sn ,
n ≥ 3, was usually formulated as follows: The volume of any flexible polyhedron contained
in the open hemisphere Sn+ ⊂ Sn is constant during the flexion. However, this assertion is
also false. The first example of a flexible polyhedron in S3+ with non-constant volume was
constructed by Alexandrov [3]. Recently, the author [20] has constructed embedded flexible
cross-polytopes with non-constant volumes in Sn+ for all n ≥ 3. Thus the Bellows conjecture
in spheres is false. In [20] the author has suggested the Modified bellows conjecture, which
claims that, for any flexible polyhedron Pt in Sn , n ≥ 3, one can replace some vertices
of Pt with their antipodes so that the generalized oriented volume of the obtained flexible
polyhedron will become constant during the flexion. Up to now, no counterexample to the
Modified bellows conjecture is known.
A survey of some other results and problems on flexible polyhedra and their volumes can
be found in [30].
The main ingredient of our proof of Theorem 1.1 is the study of the analytic continuation
of the volume of a bounded simplex in Λn considered as a function of the hyperbolic cosines
of its edge lengths. Much more studied is the problem of expressing the volumes of convex
polytopes in Λn or Sn from their dihedral angles. The fundamental results in this area were
obtained by Lobachevsky, Schläfli, Coxeter, and Milnor; a good survey can be found in [1,
Ch. 7]. In particular, it is known that the functions expressing the volumes of simplices in Sn
and Λn from their dihedral angles can be obtained from each other by analytic continuation,
see [15], [5]. Besides, in the Lobachevsky case, the volume of a simplex can be expressed from
its dihedral angles not only for bounded simplices but also for simplices with some vertices
on the absolute. The functions expressing the volumes of simplices in Sn and Λn from their
edge lengths have fewer good properties. Nevertheless, they are much more convenient in
the study of flexible polyhedra, since edge lengths are constant during flexions while dihedral
angles vary.
Let ∆n ⊂ Λn be a bounded n-dimensional simplex with vertices v0 , . . . , vn , and let ℓjk
be the length of an edge [vj vk ]. We put cjk = cosh ℓjk , cjj = 1, and consider the matrix
C(∆n ) = (cjk ) of size (n + 1) × (n + 1). If we identify the Lobachevsky space Λn with its
standard vector model, namely, with the half of the hyperboloid hx, xi = 1, x0 > 0 in the
pseudo-Euclidean vector space R1,n with the inner product
n

hx, yi = x0 y0 − x1 y1 − · · · − xn yn ,

then the matrix C(∆ ) will become the Gram matrix of the vertices of ∆n .
We denote by G(n) (C) (respectively, by G(n) (R)) the affine space of all complex (respectively,
real) symmetric matrices C of size (n + 1) × (n + 1) with units on the diagonal. Let CΛn ⊂
G(n) (R) be the subset consisting of all matrices C(∆n ) corresponding to non-degenerate
bounded simplices ∆n ⊂ Λn . Obviously, CΛn is a domain in G(n) (R).
3

The simplex ∆n can be recovered from a matrix C ∈ CΛn uniquely up to isometry, and the
volume of ∆n is a real analytic function of C, which will be denoted by VΛn (C). Aomoto [5]
studied the analytic continuation of the function VΛn (C) using Schläfli’s formula for the
differential of the volume, see Section 4 for details. He proved that the analytic continuation
of VΛn (C) yields a multi-valued function on G(n) (C) that branches along X and has no other
singularities, where X is the hypersurface in G(n) (C) consisting of all matrices C such that at
least one of the principal minors of C vanishes. In other words, the function VΛn (C) admits
the analytic continuation along every path in G(n) (C) \ X. The multi-valued function on
G(n) (C) \ X obtained by the analytic continuation of VΛn (C) will be denoted by VeΛn (C).
Our main result concerning the analytic continuation of the volume of a simplex in an
odd-dimensional Lobachevsky space is as follows.
Theorem 1.2. Suppose that n is odd. Let γ : [0, 1] → G(n) (C) \ X be an arbitrary closed
path such that γ(0) = γ(1) ∈ CΛn . Let V1 (C) and V2 (C) be two branches of the multi-valued
function VeΛn (C) in a neighborhood of γ(0) such that V2 (C) is obtained from V1 (C) by the
analytic continuation along γ. Then
V2 (γ(0)) − (−1)lk(γ,H) V1 (γ(0)) ∈ iR,

where H ⊂ G(n) (C) is the hypersurface consisting of all degenerate matrices C, and lk(γ, H)
is the linking number of γ and H.
First, this result is the main technical step in our proof of Theorem 1.1. Second, it
seems to be interesting in itself. There exists an analogue of this theorem for simplices in
even-dimensional Lobachevsky spaces and in spheres. It is even easier to formulate, but,
unfortunately, it does not yield any analogue of Theorem 1.1. If Xn = Sn , then we put
cjk = cos ℓjk instead of cjk = cosh ℓjk so that C(∆n ) is the Gram matrix of the vertices
of ∆n , where Sn is realized as the unit sphere in the Euclidean vector space Rn+1 . As in
the Lobachevsky case, we denote by CSn the domain in G(n) (R) consisting of all matrices
C(∆n ) corresponding to non-degenerate simplices ∆n ⊂ Sn , and we denote by VeSn (C) the
multi-valued analytic function obtained by the analytic continuation of the function VSn (C)
computing the volume of a spherical simplex from the cosines of its edge lengths. Again, by a
result of Aomoto [5], the ramification locus of VeSn (C) is the same hypersurface X ⊂ G(n) (C).
Theorem 1.3. Suppose that either Xn = Λn and n is even or Xn = Sn and n is arbitrary.
Then all branches of the multi-valued function VeXn (C) are real in all points of CXn .

The main tool in our proofs of Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.1 is Schläfli’s formula for the differential of the volume of a convex polytope in Xn that is deformed preserving its combinatorial
type. Recall that this formula is as follows:
X
1
KdVn (P ) =
Vn−2 (F ) dαF ,
(1.1)
n − 1 F ⊂P, dim F =n−2

where the sum is taken over all codimension 2 faces F of an n-dimensional polytope P ,
Vk denotes the k-dimensional volume, αF is the dihedral angle of P at F , and K is the
(sectional) curvature of Xn . This formula was proved by Schläfli [31] for Sn and by Sforza [32]
for Λn , see also [1, Ch. 7, Sect. 2.2]. Actually, the convexity of P is unimportant, and
formula (1.1) holds true for all polyhedra, see Lemma 9.1. Schläfli’s formula is a very useful
4

tool for studying the analytic properties of the volumes of simplices in Λn and Sn . As it
has already been mentioned, it was the main ingredient of Aomoto’s construction of the
analytic continuations of the functions VXn (C). Let us also mention that Schläfli’s formula
was used by Rivin [26] to give a simpler proof of Milnor’s conjecture on the continuity of the
extension of the function computing the volume of a simplex from its dihedral angles, which
was originally proved by Luo [22].
We shall use Schläfli’s formula twice. First, we shall use it to prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.3
by induction on n. Second, we shall use it to deduce Theorem 1.1 from Theorem 1.2. The
scheme of our exposition will be roughly as follows. We shall show that the configuration
space Σ of any flexible polyhedron Pt in Λ2m+1 is a connected component of a real affine
variety, and consider the analytic continuation of the generalized oriented volume of Pt to the
complexification ΣC of this variety. On the one hand, Schläfli’s formula for Pt will imply that
e
the difference between any two branches of the obtained multi-valued analytic function V
is real. On the other hand, Theorem 1.2 will imply that this difference is purely imaginary
e is single-valued. Finally, we shall show
on Σ. Thus, we shall conclude that the function V

entire functions to show that the function V

Remark 1.4. In the even-dimensional case both Schläfli’s formula and Theorem 1.3 will yield
the same result, namely, they will yield that the difference between any two branches of the
e is real on Σ. This is not sufficient to conclude that the function V
e
multi-valued function V
is single-valued. Hence we cannot apply Liouville’s theorem on entire functions. Therefore
our method for proving Theorem 1.1 does not work in even dimensions. Nevertheless, the
question of whether the Bellows conjecture holds true in even-dimensional Lobachevsky
spaces remains open, since no counterexample is known, too.

In the Euclidean space En Schläfli’s formula yields that the right-hand side of (1.1) vanishes. Hence the differential of the volume does not enter this formula. This immediately
implies that the total mean curvature

Vn−2 (F )(π − αF )

F ⊂P, dim F =n−2

of a polyhedron P in En is constant during flexions of P , see [2], [4]. Similarly, for a flexible
polyhedron Pt in Λn , the linear combination (n − 1)Vn (Pt ) − TMC(Pt ) is constant during
the flexion. (See Remark 9.10 for a rigorous definition of the total mean curvature of a
non-embedded polyhedron.)

Corollary 1.5. The total mean curvature of any bounded flexible polyhedron in Λn , where n
is odd and n ≥ 3, is constant during the flexion.
In the three-dimensional case, there exist explicit formulae for the volumes of simplices
in S3 and Λ3 . The first formula of such kind was obtained
R x by Sforza [32]. More convenient

terms of the dilogarithm Li2 (x) = − 0 log(1 − t) t were obtained in [10], [24], [23], [16]. It
is possible that Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 in the three-dimensional case can be deduced from
these explicit formulae. However, this seems to be rather hard, since all these formulae are
very cumbersome. In this paper, we do not use them.

This paper is organized as follows. Sections 2–6 contain the proofs of Theorems 1.2
and 1.3. The main technical lemma is Lemma 3.2, which provides a sufficient condition
that ensures that all branches of a multi-valued analytic function on a principal Zariski open
subset X ⊂ Cm are real on a connected component U of X ∩ Rm . The key role in this lemma
is played by a special unipotent filtration on the ring of multi-valued analytic functions
on a complex analytic manifold. The construction of this filtration is given in Section 2.
Lemma 3.2 is formulated and proved in Section 3. In Section 4 we recall Aomoto’s results on
the analytic continuations of the functions VXn (C). In Sections 5 and 6 we apply Lemma 3.2
to prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.3. Section 7 contains all necessary definitions and notation
concerning flexible polyhedra. Also in this section we give a more precise formulation of
Theorem 1.1 (Theorem 7.3). In Sections 8–11, we study the analytic continuation of the
generalized oriented volume of a flexible polyhedron, and prove Theorem 7.3.
Throughout the paper, we shall deal with various classes of functions on complex analytic
manifolds. Let us fix the terminology that we shall use in the sequel. We shall use the
term ‘analytic function’ for a multi-valued analytic function, though in most cases we shall
specify explicitly that the function under consideration is multi-valued. However, the term
‘holomorphic function’ will always stand for a single-valued analytic function, either in the
point or on the whole manifold under consideration. The ring of holomorphic functions on
a complex analytic manifold Y will be denoted by O(Y ). Recall that a function that is
holomorphic on the whole affine space Cm is called an entire function. Almost all complex
analytic manifolds that are considered in this paper are smooth affine algebraic varieties
over the field of complex numbers. Following the standard terminology, the restriction of
a polynomial in coordinates in Cm to a (closed) affine submanifold Y ⊂ Cm will be called
a regular function. The ring of regular functions on Y will be denoted by C[Y ]. Besides,
by C(Y ) we shall denote the field of rational functions on Y , i. e., the quotient field of the
ring C[Y ].

θ2 = 0, hence, the assertion is true. Assume that the assertion is proved for k + l = m − 1,

For each connected covering X̆ of X, the universal covering of X̆ coincides with X.

In particular, assertion (1) of this lemma says that the spaces Fk are invariant under all

Lemma 2.2. The spaces Fbkq are invariant under all monodromy operators Mγ , γ ∈ π.

Example 2.3. Put X = C \ {0}, and consider the function Log z as an element of O(X).
The variation of this function along any loop is a constant of the form 2πin, n ∈ Z. Hence
Log z belongs to F10 and, a fortiori, to Fb10 . A more interesting example is as follows. Put

π̂ ⊂ π has index 4 and consists the homotopy classes of all loops γ that have even winding
numbers around the points 1 and −1. It is easy to see that the monodromy of Arcsin z along
any loop γ whose homotopy class belongs to π̂ yields a function of the form Arcsin z + 2πn,
n ∈ Z. Hence the function Arcsin z belongs to Fb10 . However, it is easy to see that Arcsin z
belongs to none of the spaces Fk0 .

Assume that the group H1 (X; Z2 ) is finite; let 2s be the order of this group. We introduce
the notation
H = H1 (X; Z2 ),
H ∗ = H 1 (X; Z2 ).
There is a canonical identification H ∗ = Hom(π, Z2 ). We denote by h·, ·i the non-degenerate
pairing H ∗ ⊗ H → Z2 . The homology class in H represented by a loop γ or by a homotopy
class γ ∈ π will be denoted by [γ].
It is useful to give the following characterization of the spaces Fbkq in terms of all monodromy
operators Mγ , γ ∈ π. For each ρ ∈ H ∗ , we define the corresponding twisted variation operator
by
Varργ θ = Mγ θ − (−1)ρ(γ) θ.

Recall the notion of an iterated integral introduced by Parshin [25] and Chen [7], see
also [8]. Let ω1 , . . . , ωk be 1-forms on X, and let α : [0, 1] → X be a path. Let fj (t) dt be
the pullback of ωj by the mapping α, j = 1, . . . , k. By definition, the iterated integral of
ω1 , . . . , ωk along α is given by

not hold automatically.) The maximum of the numbers kn will be called the length of the

3. Totally real functions

Throughout this paper, the words ‘a real (respectively, complex) affine algebraic variety’
always mean ‘a subset of Rm (respectively, Cm ) that can be given by polynomial equations’.
In other words, we do not distinguish between affine varieties that coincide as subsets of Rm
(respectively, Cm ) but correspond to different ideals in the polynomial ring. Besides, we
do not require that affine varieties are irreducible unless this is specified explicitly. We say
that an affine variety X ⊂ Cm is a hypersurface if all irreducible components of X are
(m − 1)-dimensional. So we allow a hypersurface to be reducible.
For an affine algebraic variety X ⊂ Cm , we denote by X reg the set of regular points of X,
and we denote by X(R) the set of real points of X, i. e., the intersection X ∩ Rm . We also
put X reg (R) = X reg ∩ X(R).
An irreducible affine algebraic variety X ⊂ Cm will be called essentially real if X is
given by a system of polynomial equations with real coefficients, and X reg (R) 6= ∅. The
latter condition is equivalent to the condition dimR X(R) = dimC X. For instance, the circle
z12 + z22 = 1 in C2 is essentially real, but the imaginary circle z12 + z22 = −1 is not essentially
real though is defined over reals. A reducible affine variety X ⊂ Cm will be called essentially
real if all its irreducible components are essentially real.
10

Now, let X ⊂ Cm be an essentially real hypersurface, let X1 , . . . , Xs be its irreducible
components, and let U be a connected component of the set Rm \ X(R). We consider the
complex analytic manifold X = Cm \ X, choose a base point z ∗ for X such that z ∗ ∈ U, and
apply to X all constructions in the previous section.
e will be called totally real on U if the values Φ(z̃) are
Definition 3.1. A function Φ ∈ O(X)
real for all z̃ ∈ p−1 (U).

Regarding Φ as a multi-valued function on X, we may equivalently say that Φ is totally
real on U if all branches of Φ on U are real-valued. For instance, the function Arcsin z is
totally real on (−1, 1). On the other hand, the function Log z is not totally real on (0, +∞),
though its principal branch is real-valued on this set.
e is said to be totally real on U if θ(z̃, v) ∈ R for all z̃ ∈ X
e and
Similarly, a 1-form θ ∈ A1 (X)
P

e such that p(z̃) ∈ U and p∗ (v) ∈ Tp(z̃) R . Obviously, a 1-form θ =
all v ∈ Tz̃ X
j=1 θj dzj
is totally real on U if and only if all functions θj are totally real on U, where z1 , . . . , zm are
the standard coordinates in Cm .
The following properties of totally real functions are straightforward:
e
(1) The set of functions totally real on U is a subring of O(X).
(2) If Φ is a function totally real on U, then the functions Mγ Φ are also totally real on U
for all γ ∈ π.
(3) If Φ is a function totally real on U, then the 1-form dΦ is also totally real on U.
The converse of (3) is generally not true. For instance, the 1-form dz
is totally real on
z
(0, +∞), but its integral
 
dz
= Log z + c
I
z
is not totally real on (0, +∞). Nevertheless, there is a very important for us special case when
the converse of (3) is true. To formulate this result, we need to introduce some notation.
Suppose that we are given a decomposition X = Y ∪ Z ∪ W such that Y is an irreducible
component of X, Z = Z1 ∪ · · · ∪ Zq and W = W1 ∪ · · · ∪ Wr are unions of irreducible components of X, and all irreducible components Y , Z1 , . . . , Zq , W1 , . . . , Wr are pairwise distinct.
Let f (z) = 0, g1 (z) = 0, . . . , gq (z) = 0, h1 (z) = 0, . . . , hr (z) = 0 be irreducible polynomial
equations with real coefficients giving the hypersurfaces Y, Z1 , . . . , Zq , W1 , . . . , Wr , respectively. We agree to choose the signs of the polynomials hj (z) so that hj (z) > 0 on U. (The
signs of the polynomials f (z) and gj (z) are unimportant.) To each point z ∈ Rm \ W (R),
we assign the vector κ(z) = (κ1 (z), . . . , κr (z)) ∈ Zr2 such that κj (z) = 0 if hj (z) > 0 and
κj (z) = 1 if hj (z) < 0. Then κj (z) is the modulo 2 linking number of the pair of points
{z ∗ , z} and the hypersurface Wj (R) in Rm .
Lemma 3.2. Assume that the 4-tuple (Y, Z, W, U) satisfies the conditions:
(A) The boundary ∂U of the domain U contains a point that belongs to Y reg (R) and does
not belong to Z ∪ W .
(B) The vectors κ(z), where z runs over all points of Y reg (R) that do not belong to Z ∪W,
generate the whole group Zr2 .
e be a 1-form such that
Let θ ∈ A1 (X)
(i) θ is totally real on U.

(ii) θ is closed.
(iii) θ belongs to Fbk1 for some k.
(iv) In a neighborhood of each point z0 ∈ Y \ (Z ∪ W ) any branch of θ has the form

θ=

ic dgj (z)
+ ω,
gj (z)

(3.2)

where c is a real constant, and ω is a 1-form holomorphic at z0 .
Then the function I(θ) is totally real on U.
Remark 3.3. In conditions (iv) and (v) in this lemma, the 1-form θ is regarded as a multivalued analytic 1-form on X.
Proof of Lemma 3.2. The proof is by induction on k. The basis of induction for k = −1 is
1
obvious. Assume that the assertion of the lemma is true for 1-forms in Fbk−1
, and prove it
1
b
for a 1-form θ ∈ Fk .
The group H = H1 (X; Z2 ) is generated by the homology classes of circuits around the
irreducible components of X. Hence H is finite. Therefore, by Lemma 2.4, the 1-form θ is
1
the sum of the 1-forms θρ given by (2.2), and Varργ θρ ∈ Fbk−1
for all γ ∈ π. Since θ satisfies
conditions (i), (ii), (iv), and (v), we easily see that the 1-forms θρ also satisfy the same
conditions (i), (ii), (iv), and (v). To prove that I(θ) is totally real on U it is sufficient to
1
prove that I(θρ ) are totally real on U for all ρ. Let us fix a ρ. If θρ ∈ Fbk−1
, then I(θρ ) is
1
b
totally real on U by the inductive assumption. So we assume that θρ ∈
/ Fk−1 .
−1
Our goal is to show that the function Ψ = I(θρ ) is real on p (U). Since the 1-form
dΨ = θρ is totally real on U, it is sufficient to prove that every connected component
of p−1 (U) contains a point at which the value of Ψ is real. Hence it is sufficient to prove that
the values Ψ(Tγ z̃ ∗ ) are real for all γ ∈ π. Consider the mapping µ : π → R given by
Z Tγ z̃ ∗
∗
µ(γ) = Im Ψ(Tγ z̃ ) = Im
θρ .
z̃ ∗

e is simply connected and θρ is closed.) Then
(The integral is independent of the path, since X
we need to show that µ(γ) = 0 for all γ ∈ π.
Let z0 be a point in condition (A). Since z0 is a regular point of ∂U, we can choose a
non-self-intersecting path α from z ∗ to z0 that is contained in U, except for its endpoint z0 .
Let δ be a loop in X that starts at z ∗ , goes along α to a point z close to z0 , goes once
around Y in the positive direction near z0 , and then returns to z ∗ along α−1 . Obviously, the
homotopy class of δ is independent of z and of the chosen circuit around Y provided that
they are close enough to z0 . So the homotopy class δ ∈ π is well defined. (Nevertheless, the
homotopy class δ may depend on the path α, which is supposed to be fixed.)
12

Since any branch of θρ near z0 has form (3.1), we obtain that Mδ θρ = −θρ . If ρ(δ) = 0,
1
then we would have Varρδ θρ = −2θρ , which would yield a contradiction, since Varρδ θρ ∈ Fbk−1
1
and θρ ∈
/ Fbk−1

Lemma 3.6. The image of the mapping µ is a finitely generated subgroup of R.
Proof. Let A be the image of µ. We need to show that, for any a1 , a2 ∈ A, both a1 + a2 and
a1 −a2 belong to A. If a1 , a2 ∈ A, then a1 = µ(γ1), a2 = µ(γ2 ) for some γ1 , γ2 ∈ π. Hence the
number µ(γ1 γ2 ) = a1 + (−1)ρ(γ1 ) a2 belongs to A. On the other hand, we have constructed an
element δ ∈ π such that µ(δ) = 0 and ρ(δ) = 1. Hence the number µ(γ1 δγ2 ) = a1 −(−1)ρ(γ1 ) a2
also belongs to A. Therefore A is a subgroup of R. But the group π is finitely generated,
since it is the fundamental group of the complement of a complex affine variety. Hence the
group A is also finitely generated.

Assume that A 6= 0. Any non-trivial finitely generated subgroup of R is a free Abelian
group, hence, has an epimorphism onto Z2 . Choose an arbitrary epimorphism ̟ : A → Z2 ,
and consider the mapping
µ
̟
ν: π −
→A−
→ Z2 .
This mapping is surjective, since both µ and ̟ are surjective. Lemma 3.5 implies that ν is
a homomorphism, i. e., ν ∈ H ∗ = Hom(π, Z2 ).
Let η, ζ1, . . . , ζq , ξ1 , . . . , ξr ∈ H = H1 (X; Z2 ) be the the homology classes of small circuits
around the irreducible components Y, Z1 , . . . , Zq , W1 , . . . , Wr of X, respectively. It is well
known that these elements form a basis of H. For a point z ∈ Rm \ W (R), we put ξ(z) =

Also, for any point z ∈ Rm \ X(R), we denote by σ(z), τ1 (z), . . . , τq (z) the
modulo 2 linking numbers of {z ∗ , z} with Y (R), Z1 (R), . . . , Zq (R), respectively, and we put

Lemma 3.7. We have hν, ζj i = 0 for j = 1, . . . , q.

Proof. Let z0 be a regular point of Zj that does not belong to the union of all other irreducible
components of X. Consider a loop γ in X that goes from z ∗ to a point z ∈ X close to z0
along some path α, travels along a small circuit β around Zj in the positive direction, and
then returns to z ∗ along α−1 . Then [γ] = ζj . By condition (v) for θρ , any branch of θρ is
meromorphic at z0 . Hence Mγ θρ = θρ . Therefore,

where β̃ is the lift of β starting at the end of α̃, and c is the real constant in (3.2) for the
branch of θρ realized on β̃. Consequently µ(γ) = 0, hence, hν, ζj i = 0.

Lemma 3.8. Suppose that z ∈ Rm \ X(R) and hρ, χ(z)i = 1. Then hν, χ(z)i = 0.

Proof. Choose an arbitrary path β in Rm with endpoints z ∗ and z that intersects X(R) transversely in finitely many regular points of it. Near every intersection point of β and X(R), we
replace a small segment of β with a small positive half-circuit around X in Cm , see Fig. 2.
The obtained path from z ∗ to z in X will be denoted by β1 . Let γ be the loop in X with
endpoints at z ∗ obtained by the concatenation of β1 and β̄1−1 , where β̄1−1 is the path obtained
from β1 by the coordinatewise conjugation traversed in the opposite direction. It is easy to
see that [γ] = χ(z), since the incomes to [γ] of intersection points of β with the components
Y (R), Z1 (R), . . . , Zq (R), W1 (R), . . . , Wr (R) of X(R) are equal to η, ζ1, . . . , ζq , ξ1 , . . . , ξr , respectively. Obviously, the path γ̄ coordinatewise conjugate to γ coincides with γ −1 . Since
the 1-form θρ is real on p−1 (U), we see that the integrals of θρ along the lifts γ̃ and γ̄˜ of γ
and γ̄, respectively, starting at z̃ ∗ are conjugate to each other, i. e.,
Z T −1 z̃ ∗

Hence µ(γ ) = −µ(γ). On the other hand, by Lemma 3.5, we obtain that
µ(γ −1 ) = −(−1)ρ(γ) µ(γ) = −(−1)hρ,χ(z)i µ(γ) = µ(γ).

Therefore µ(γ) = 0. Thus hν, χ(z)i = 0.

Lemma 3.9. Suppose that z ∈ Y reg (R) and z ∈
/ Z ∪ W . Then hν, ξ(z)i = 0.



Proof. In a neighborhood of z, the subvariety Y (R) ⊂ Rm is a smooth hypersurface. Choose
two points z± ∈ Rm \ X(R) close to z and lying on the different sides of Y (R). Then
ζ(z± ) = ζ(z), ξ(z± ) = ξ(z), and η(z+ ) = η(z− ) + η. Hence χ(z+ ) = χ(z− ) + η. Since
hρ, ηi = ρ(δ) = 1, we obtain that hρ, χ(z+ )i = hρ, χ(z− )i + 1. Therefore, exactly one of the
two values hρ, χ(z± )i is equal to 1. We may assume that hρ, χ(z+ )i = 1. Then, by Lemma 3.8,
hν, χ(z+ )i = 0. By Lemmas 3.4 and 3.7, we have hν, ηi = ν(δ) = 0 and hν, ζj i = 0 for all j.
Hence hν, ξ(z)i = hν, ξ(z+ )i = 0.

Figure 2. The loop γ in Lemma 3.8
By condition (B), the vectors ξ(z), where z runs over all points in Y reg (R) that do not
belong to Z ∪ W, generate the subgroup of H spanned by ξ1 , . . . , ξr . Hence, by Lemma 3.9,
we obtain that hν, ξj i = 0 for j = 1, . . . , r. But, by Lemmas 3.4 and 3.7, hν, ηi = 0 and
hν, ζj i = 0 for j = 1, . . . , q. Therefore, ν = 0, which is impossible since the homomorphism
ν : π → Z2 must be surjective. This contradiction proves that A = 0, i. e., µ(γ) = 0 for all
γ ∈ π. Therefore I(θρ ) is totally real on U, which completes the proof of Lemma 3.2.

In the sequel, Lemma 3.2 will be used in the inductive proof of Theorem 1.3. To prove
Theorem 1.2, we shall need a slightly more complicated lemma. To formulate it, we need to
e the connected component
introduce several concepts and some notation. We denote by U
−1
∗
e
of p (U) that contains the base point z̃ . Recall that each function Ψ holomorphic on X
can be considered as a multi-valued analytic function on X. Suppose that Ψ has trivial
variations along all loops γ contained in U. Then, by definition, the principal branch of Ψ
e of p−1 (U), i. e., the function ψ
on U is the branch realized on the connected component U
e . The definition of the principal branch of a 1on U such that ψ(p(z̃)) = Ψ(z̃) for all z̃ ∈ U
e with trivial variations along all loops γ contained in U is completely
form holomorphic on X
e satisfies zero boundary conditions on U
e if
similar. We shall say that a function Ψ ∈ O(X)
its principal branch ψ(z) has zero limit as a point z approaches to any point z0 ∈ ∂U from
values in U.
Lemma 3.10. Assume that the 4-tuple (Y, Z, W, U) satisfies conditions (A) and (B) in
e be a 1-form satisfying conditions (ii), (iii), and (iv) in Lemma 3.2.

Proof. Condition (v′ ) for θ immediately implies that all 1-forms ϕγ satisfy condition (v) in
Lemma 3.2. All other conditions of Lemma 3.2 for ϕγ also follow from the corresponding
conditions for θ. Hence, applying Lemma 3.2 to the 1-forms ϕγ , we may conclude that all
functions I(ϕγ ) are totally real on U. Nevertheless, the functions Φγ , which we are interested
in, do not coincide with the functions I(ϕγ ) but differ from them by constants. Namely,
Φγ (z̃) = I(ϕγ )(z̃) + Φγ (z̃ ∗ ).

Therefore, we still need to prove that the values Φγ (z̃ ∗ ) are real for all γ ∈ π. This proof
follows the same line as the proof of Lemma 3.2, though differs in many details. To stress
the similarity with the proof of Lemma 3.2, we shall use the same notation for the objects
that play similar roles in these two proofs.
Consider the homomorphism ρ ∈ Hom(π, Z2 ) = H ∗ given by
ρ(γ) = lk(γ, Y )

mod 2.

Then ϕγ = i Varργ θ and Φγ = i Varργ Ψ. Let δ be the same loop as in the proof of Lemma 3.2.
Then lk(δ, Y ) = 1, hence, ρ(δ) = 1. As in the proof of Lemma 3.2, condition (iv) implies
that Mδ θ = −θ.
Consider the mapping µ : π → R given by
µ(γ) = Im Φγ (z̃ ∗ ) = Re Ψ(Tγ z̃ ∗ ) − (−1)ρ(γ) Re Ψ(z̃ ∗ ).

Our aim is to prove that µ(γ) = 0 for all γ.
Lemma 3.11. µ(δ) = 0.
Proof. Let α : [0, 1] → Cm be the path from z ∗ to a point z0 ∈ ∂U that was used in the
construction of the loop δ, see the proof of Lemma 3.2. Since α is contained in U except
e imply that limt→1 Ψ(α̃(t)) = 0.

Lemma 3.12. For all γ1 , γ2 ∈ π, we have

µ(γ1γ2 ) = µ(γ1) + (−1)ρ(γ1 ) µ(γ2).
16

(3.6)

Proof. As it was shown above, the functions I(ϕγ ) are totally real on U for all γ ∈ π. In
particular, the value I(ϕγ1 )(Tγ2 z̃ ∗ ) is real. We have
I(ϕγ1 )(Tγ2 z̃ ∗ ) = Φγ1 (Tγ2 z̃ ∗ ) − Φγ1 (z̃ ∗ ) =


= i Ψ(Tγ1 γ2 z̃ ∗ ) − (−1)ρ(γ1 ) Ψ(Tγ2 z̃ ∗ ) − Ψ(Tγ1 z̃ ∗ ) + (−1)ρ(γ1 ) Ψ(z̃ ∗ ) .

Equating the imaginary part of this number with zero, we obtain exactly equality (3.6). 
In the same way as Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5 implied Lemma 3.6, Lemmas 3.11 and 3.12 imply
that the image of µ is a finitely generated subgroup A ⊂ R. Assume that A 6= 0, choose an
arbitrary epimorphism ̟ : A → Z2 , and consider the surjective mapping

Lemma 3.13. We have hν, ζj i = 0 for j = 1, . . . , q.
Proof. In the proof of Lemma 3.7 we deduced equality (3.3) from condition (v). In the same
way condition (v′ ) implies the equality
Ψ(Tγ z̃ ∗ ) − Ψ(z̃ ∗ ) = 2πic,

where the loop γ passing around Zj is the same as in the proof of Lemma 3.7. Since ρ(γ) = 0,
it follows that µ(γ) = 0, hence, hν, ζj i = 0.

Lemma 3.14. Suppose that z ∈ Rm \ X(R) and hρ, χ(z)i = 0. Then hν, χ(z)i = 0.

Proof. Construct a loop γ in the same way as in the proof of Lemma 3.8. Recall that
[γ] = χ(z) and γ −1 = γ̄. Since ρ(γ) = 0, we have

Since the 1-form θ is real on U
and γ̄, respectively, starting at z̃ ∗ are conjugate to each other. Hence, µ(γ −1 ) = µ(γ). On
the other hand, it follows from Lemma 3.12 that µ(γ −1 ) = −µ(γ). Therefore, µ(γ) = 0.
Thus, hν, χ(z)i = 0.

Lemma 3.15. Suppose that z ∈ Y reg (R) and z ∈
/ Z ∪ W . Then hν, ξ(z)i = 0.

Proof. As in the proof of Lemma 3.9, take two points z± ∈ Rm \ X(R) close to z and lying
on the different sides of Y (R). Then hρ, χ(z+ )i = hρ, χ(z− )i + 1. Therefore, exactly one
of the two values hρ, χ(z± )i is equal to 0. We may assume that hρ, χ(z− )i = 0. Then, by
Lemma 3.14, hν, χ(z− )i = 0. By Lemmas 3.11 and 3.13, we have hν, ηi = 0 and hν, ζj i = 0
for all j. Hence hν, ξ(z)i = hν, ξ(z− )i = 0.

As in the proof of Lemma 3.2, Lemmas 3.11, 3.13, and 3.15, and condition (B) imply that
ν = 0, which is impossible, since the homomorphism ν : π → Z2 must be surjective. This
contradiction yields that A = 0, i. e., µ(γ) = 0 for all γ ∈ π, which completes the proof of
Lemma 3.10.

4. The analytic continuation of volume
As in the Introduction, consider the affine space G(n) (C) ∼
= Cn(n+1)/2 of symmetric complex
matrices of size (n + 1) × (n + 1) with units on the diagonal, the affine hypersurface X ⊂
G(n) (C) consisting of all matrices C such that at least one of the principal minors of C
vanishes, and the domains CSn and CΛn in G(n) (R) ⊂ G(n) (C) consisting of the Gram matrices
of vertices of all non-degenerate simplices in Sn ⊂ Rn+1 and of all non-degenerate bounded
simplices in Λn ⊂ R1,n , respectively.
Let Xn be either Sn or Λn . We consider the complex analytic manifold X = G(n) (C) \ X,
and take for the base point C ∗ ∈ X the point corresponding to the regular simplex in Xn
with edge 1; then C ∗ ∈ CXn . We shall use all notation introduced in Section 2. However, the

As in the Introduction, we consider the function VXn (C) computing the volume of a simplex
in Xn from the cosines (if Xn = Sn ) or the hyperbolic cosines (if Xn = Λn ) of its edge lengths.
This function is defined and real analytic on the domain CXn . Aomoto [5] proved that the
function VXn admits the analytic continuation to the multi-valued analytic function on X,
b is unipotent. In our terminology, his result is as
and the monodromy of this function on X
follows.

Aomoto proved this result in the following way. He used Schläfli’s formula to write the
function VeXn as a homotopy invariant linear combination of iterated integrals of 1-forms
b and then concluded that the monodromy of this function on X
b is unipotent
holomorphic on X,
(see Proposition 2.5). Though the formula for the volume via iterated integrals is interesting
in itself, the usage of iterated integrals for the proof of Proposition 4.2 is superfluous. Indeed,
Proposition 4.2 can be deduced directly from Schläfli’s formula and the basic properties of
unipotent filtrations listed in Lemma 2.1. We shall give this simplified version of Aomoto’s
proof of Proposition 4.2 below, since the details of this proof will be useful in our further
study of the function VeXn .
Now, let us introduce some notation. For any subsets I, J ⊂ {0, . . . , n} such that |I| = |J|,
we denote by DI,J (C) the minor of a matrix C ∈ G(n) (C) formed by rows with numbers in I
and columns with numbers in J. The principal minor DI,I (C) will be denoted by DI (C).
18

The submatrix of C formed by rows and columns with numbers in I will be denoted by CI ;
then DI (C) = det CI . The determinant of the matrix C will be denoted by D(C), i. e.,
D(C) = D{0,...,n} (C). It is well known that the polynomials DI (C) are irreducible whenever
±
|I| ≥ 3, and D{j,k}(C) = (1 + cjk )(1 − cjk ). We put D{j,k}
(C) = 1 ± cjk .
For each subset I ⊂ {0, . . . , n}, |I| ≥ 2, we denote by HI the affine hypersurface in G(n) (C)
given by the equation DI (C) = 0, and we put H = H{0,...,n} . If |I| = 2, we denote by
HI± the hypersurfaces (hyperplanes) given by DI± (C) = 0. Then X is the union of all
hypersurfaces HI , I ⊂ {0, . . . , n}, |I| ≥ 2. The irreducible components of X are all HI
such that |I| ≥ 3 and all HI+ and HI− such that |I| = 2. (Obviously, no two of these
components coincide to each other.) Thus the number of irreducible components of X is
s = 2n+1 + n(n−1)
− 2.
2
It is a standard fact that the set CSn consists of all positive definite matrices in G(n) (R),
and the set CΛn consists of all matrices C ∈ G(n) (R) such that (−1)|I| DI (C) < 0 for all I
and cjk > 1 for all j and k. The latter condition can be rewritten in the form DI+ (C) > 0
and DI− (C) < 0 for all I such that |I| = 2. It follows that both CSn and CΛn are connected
components of G(n) (R) \ X(R). (The sets CSn and CΛn are connected, since the spaces of
non-degenerate simplices in Sn and in Λn , respectively, are connected.)
Below we shall often use induction on the dimension n. Hence we shall introduce an
additional index (n) indicating the dimension of the space Xn to which an object is related,
q
for instance, we shall write X(n) , X(n) , Fbk,(n)
, etc. Nevertheless, to simplify the notation, we
shall omit this index whenever it is clear.
Let I ⊂ {0, . . . , n} be a subset of cardinality m + 1. We denote by prI the projection
G(n) (C) → G(m) (C) given by C 7→ CI . Obviously, prI (X(n) ) = X(m) , prI (CXn ) = CXm , and

Now, suppose that C ∈ CXn , and let ∆ be a simplex in X corresponding to C. For each
subset I ⊂ {0, . . . , n}, we denote by ∆I the face of ∆n spanned by vertices with numbers
in I. If |I| = n − 1, we denote by αI = αI (C) the dihedral angle of the simplex ∆n at the
(n−2)-dimensional face ∆I . Consider the standard vector model of Xn in V, where V = Rn+1
if Xn = Sn and V = R1,n if Xn = Λn . Let v0 , . . . , vn ∈ V be the vectors representing the
vertices of ∆n , and let v0 , . . . , vn be the basis of V dual to the basis v0 , . . . , vn . Then
v0 , . . . , vn are interior normal vectors to the (n − 1)-dimensional faces of ∆n if Xn = Sn and
exterior normal vectors to the the (n − 1)-dimensional faces of ∆n if Xn = Λn . Hence

Now, let us prove the induction step. Assume that the proposition is proved for n − 2
and prove it for n. The proof will be based on Schläfli’s formula (4.4). Notice that our
convention VX0 = 1 makes this formula true for n = 2, too. Indeed, in this case it takes the
form dVX2 = ε(dα{0} + dα{1} + dα{2} ), which is true, since

To prove Theorems 1.3 and 1.2, we would like to apply Lemmas 3.2 and 3.10, respectively,

Below in this section and in the next section we always assume that n ≥ 2; then Y is
irreducible. In the next section we shall check that X is essentially real and that the 4-tuples
(Y, Z, W, CSn ) and (Y, Z, W, CΛn ) satisfy conditions (A) and (B) in Lemma 3.2. Obviously,
the 1-form dVeXn is closed, i. e., satisfies condition (ii) in Lemma 3.2. By Proposition 4.2, the
1-form dVeXn satisfies condition (iii).
Lemma 4.3. The 1-form dVeXn satisfies condition (iv) in Lemma 3.2.

Proof. Since Y = H, we obtain that the irreducible equation giving Y is D(C) = 0. Let C 0 be
a point in Y that does not belong to Z ∪W . Then formula (4.8)p
immediately yields that, in a
0
neighborhood of C , any branch of every de
αI has the form ωI / D(C), where ωI is a 1-from
0
holomorphic at C . But all branches of all multi-valued functions pr
e ∗I VeXn−2 (C) = VeXn−2 (CI )
have no singularities off W . Hence condition (iv) for the 1-form dVeXn follows from (4.9). 

To apply Lemma 3.2 (respectively, Lemma 3.10) we still need to check conditions (i)
and (v) (respectively, conditions (i′ ), (i′′ ), and (v′ )). Further, we shall check that dVeXn
satisfies conditions (i) and (v) if Xn is either Sn or Λ2m , and satisfies conditions (i′ ), (i′′ ),
and (v′ ) if Xn = Λ2m+1 using Theorems 1.3 and 1.2 for Xn−2 , respectively. Then Theorems 1.3
21

and 1.2 for Xn will follow from Lemmas 3.2 and 3.10, respectively. Such inductive proofs of
Theorems 1.3 and 1.2 will be given in Section 6 after we check conditions (A) and (B).

5. Conditions (A) and (B)
In this section we always assume that n ≥ 2.
Lemma 5.1. The hypersurface X ⊂ G(n) (C) is essentially real.
Proof. Irreducible components of X are given by the polynomial equations DI (C) = 0 and
DI± (C) = 0 with real coefficients. Moreover, each of the polynomials DI (C) and DI± (C) takes
on G(n) (R) both positive and negative values. Therefore each of the irreducible components
of X(R) separates G(n) (R), hence, contains regular points.

Lemma 5.2. The 4-tuples (Y, Z, W, CSn ) and (Y, Z, W, CΛn ) satisfy condition (A) in
Lemma 3.2.
Proof. Take n + 1 points v0 , . . . , vn in Xn such that they lie in an (n − 1)-dimensional plane,
but any n of them do not lie in an (n − 2)-dimensional plane. Then the simplex with vertices
v0 , . . . , vn is degenerate but all its proper faces are non-degenerate. Let C 0 = (c0jk ) be the
matrix of the cosines (if Xn = Sn ) or hyperbolic cosines (if Xn = Λn ) of the pairwise distances
between the points v0 , . . . , vn . Then D(C 0 ) = 0 and DI (C 0 ) 6= 0 for all I such that |I| ≤ n.
Hence C 0 ∈ Y (R) and C 0 ∈
/ Z ∪ W . Besides, using Jacobi’s identity (4.2), we see that

Therefore C 0 is a regular point of Y . Finally, since the points v0 , . . . , vn can be shifted
arbitrarily small so that the simplex with vertices at them will become non-degenerate, we

see that C 0 ∈ ∂CXn .
If n = 2, then condition (B) is satisfied, since W = ∅. So we assume that n ≥ 3. To
prove that the 4-tuples (Y, Z, W, CSn ) and (Y, Z, W, CΛn ) satisfy condition (B), we need the
following auxiliary lemma. Let W1 , . . . , Wr be the irreducible components of W listed in an
arbitrary order. It is easy to compute that
r = 2n+1 +

n2 − 3n
− 4.

Lemma 5.3. For every λ = 1, . . . , r, there exists a matrix C λ ∈ G(n) (R) such that the smooth
hypersurfaces Y reg (R) and Wλreg (R) intersect transversely at C λ , and C λ does not lie in the
union of Z and all components Wµ such that µ 6= λ.
Proof. The irreducible component Wλ is either HI , where 3 ≤ |I| < n, or HIσ , where |I| = 2
and σ ∈ {+, −}. Without loss of generality, we may assume that I = {0, . . . , k − 1}, where
2 ≤ k < n. If |I| ≥ 3, we choose a sign σ arbitrarily. Consider the matrix C λ = (cλjl ) ∈

Since DI (C) is independent of c0k , we see that the gradients of the polynomials DI and D
at C λ are linearly independent. Therefore C λ is a regular point of both hypersurfaces Y
and Wλ , and these hypersurfaces intersect transversely at C λ .


Lemma 5.4. The 4-tuples (Y, Z, W, CSn ) and (Y, Z, W, CΛn ) satisfy condition (B) in
Lemma 3.2.
Proof. Let a1 , . . . , ar be the standard basis of the group Zr2 . Note that the functions
κ : G(n) (R) \ W → Zr2 corresponding to the 4-tuples (Y, Z, W, CSn ) and (Y, Z, W, CΛn ) are
different from each other, since the signs of the equations hλ (C) = 0 giving the hypersurfaces Wλ are chosen in the different ways. Nevertheless, both cases are treated in the
same way. So let Xn be either Λn or Sn , and let κ be the function corresponding to the
4-tuple (Y, Z, W, CXn ). Denote by K the subgroup of Zr2 generated by all κ(C) such that
C ∈ Y reg (R) \ (Z ∪ W ). Our goal is to prove that K = Zr2 .
For every λ = 1, . . . , r, let C λ be the matrix in Lemma 5.3. Then Y reg (R) and Wλreg (R)
intersect transversely at C λ , and no other irreducible component of X contains C λ . Let C+λ
and C−λ be two points
in Y reg (R) close
to C λ and


 lying on the different sidesof Wλ (R). Then
κλ C+λ = κλ C−λ + 1 and κµ C+λ = κµ C−λ for all µ 6= λ. Hence κ C+λ = κ C−λ + aλ .
Therefore aλ ∈ K. Since this holds true for all λ, we see that K = Zr2 .

6. Proofs of Theorems 1.2 and 1.3
We shall prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 by induction on the dimension n. In both cases
the induction will be with step 2, that is, we shall deduce the assertion of Theorem 1.2
(respectively, Theorem 1.3) for n from the assertion of this theorem for n − 2. So we need
to start by proving the basis of induction for n = 1 and n = 2.
Basis of induction: n = 1. In this case we have only one variable c = c01 . The volume
of a one-dimensional simplex is just the length of the segment, hence, VeΛ1 = Arcosh(c) and
VeS1 = Arccos(c). We have, CΛ1 = (1, +∞) and CS1 = (−1, 1). The assertion of Theorem 1.3
holds true, since all branches of the multi-valued function Arccos(c) are real on (−1, 1).
The assertion of Theorem 1.2 holds true, since every branch of the multi-valued function
Arcosh(c) on (1, +∞) has the form ± arcosh c + 2πik, k ∈ Z, and the sign ± is given by the

with the pair of points H = {−1, 1}.

The arguments of the arccosines in the right-hand side of this formula belong to (−1, 1)
whenever C ∈ CX2 , since they are the cosines of the angles of a triangle. After the analytic
continuation along a loop, the square roots in the denominators may change their signs.
Nevertheless, the arguments of the arccosines will still belong to (−1, 1). Since any branch
of the arccosine takes real values on (−1, 1), we obtain that the multi-valued functions VeS2 (C)
and VeΛ2 (C) are totally real on the sets CS2 and CΛ2 , respectively.
Induction step for Theorem 1.3. Assume that Xn is either a sphere or an even-dimensional
Lobachevsky space, and n ≥ 3. Assume that the assertion of Theorem 1.3 holds true for
Xn−2 . Let us prove the assertion of Theorem 1.3 for Xn .
We would like to apply Lemma 3.2 to the 1-form dVeXn . This 1-form is closed, that is,
satisfy condition (ii). Proposition 4.2 and Lemma 4.3 imply that dVeXn satisfies conditions (iii)
and (iv). In Section 5 we have proved that X is essentially real and the 4-tuple (Y, Z, W, CXn )
satisfies conditions (A) and (B). By the inductive assumption, any branch of the function
e ∗I (VeXn−2 ), where
VeXn−2 is real on CXn−2 . Hence any branch of any of the functions VeI = pr
|I| = n − 1, is real on CXn . On the other hand, formula (4.8) implies that both branches
of de
αI on CXn are real. Therefore, by (4.9), the 1-form dVeXn is totally real on CXn , that is,
satisfies condition (i).
If ϕ is a function holomorphic at C ∗ and β is a path starting at C ∗ such that ϕ admits
the analytic continuation along β, then we denote by ϕ(β) the holomorphic function in a
neighborhood of the end of β obtained by this analytic continuation.
Now, let us prove that the 1-form dVeXn satisfies condition (v). We need to study the
behavior of the multi-valued 1-form dVeXn in a neighborhood of a point C 0 such that C 0 is
a regular point of HJ for some subset J ⊂ {0, . . . , n}, |J| = n, and C 0 does not lie in the
24

union of all other hypersurfaces HK , K 6= J. Without loss of generality, we may assume that
J = {0, . . . , n − 1}. Let β be a path from C ∗ to C 0 lying in X except for its endpoint C 0 .
(β)
Since C 0 ∈
/ W , the functions VI are holomorphic at C 0 for all I such that |I| = n − 1.
(β)
Further, formula (4.8) implies that, if I 6⊂ J, then the 1-form dαI is holomorphic at C 0 ,
(β)
and if I ⊂ J, then the 1-form dαI is meromorphic at C 0 , and

(β)
Since the 1-form dVXn is closed, we obtain that the function Qβ (C) is constant on HJ in
a neighborhood of C 0 . Hence
Qβ (C) = Qβ (C 0 ) + DJ (C)Fβ (C),

where the function Fβ is holomorphic at C 0 . Hence formula (6.2) can be rewritten in the
form

dVXn = Qβ (C 0 ) ·

(6.5)

where ωβ is a 1-form holomorphic at C 0 .
Our aim is to prove that the number Qβ (C 0 ) is purely imaginary for any C 0 and any β. The
(β)
integral of the 1-form dVXn along a small circuit around HJ is equal to 2πiQβ (C 0 ). Hence
the number Qβ (C 0 ) does not change under continuous deformations of the pair (C 0 , β) such
that C 0 remains a regular point of HJ lying on none of HK , K 6= J, and β remains a
path that leads to C 0 and is contained in X, except S
for its endpoint. Since n ≥ 3, the
hypersurface HJ is irreducible. Hence the set HJreg \ K6=J HK is connected. Besides, if
the point C 0 moves continuously in this set, we can always change continuously the path β
leading to C 0 . Therefore it is sufficient to prove that Qβ (C 0 ) is purely imaginary for some
particular point C 0 and for all paths β leading to it. We choose the point C 0 in the following
way. Consider a regular (n − 2)-dimensional simplex [u1 . . . un−1 ] with edge 1 in Xn−2 . Let u0
25

be the centre of this simplex. Let C be the Gram matrix of the points u0 , . . . , un−1 (in the
reg
standard vector model of Xn−2 ). Then C ∈ ∂CXn−1 ∩H(n−1)
, and all principal minors of C are
non-zero, see the proof of Lemma 5.2. Let L be the space of all matrices C ∈ G(n) (R) whose
upper-left submatrix CJ of size n × n coincides with C. Then L ⊂ HJreg (R). The matrix
entries c0n , c1n , . . . , cn−1,n can be taken for coordinates on L. For each K such that n ∈ K,
the principal minor DK (C) restricted to L is a polynomial PK (c0n , . . . , cn−1,n ). Since all
proper principal minors of C are non-zero, we easily see that none of these polynomials PK is
identically zero. Hence there exist real numbers c00n , . . . , c0n−1,n such that PI (c00n , . . . , c0n−1,n ) 6=
0 for all K such that n ∈ K. Then all proper
principal minors of the obtained matrix C 0
S
are non-zero. Therefore, C 0 ∈ HJreg (R) \ K6=J HK .
Now, let us show that Qβ (C 0 ) ∈ iR for any path β from C ∗ to C 0 that is contained in X
except for its endpoint C 0 . For each subset I ⊂ J such that |I| = n − 1, the matrix CI0
is the Gram matrix of vertices of a non-degenerate simplex, hence, CI0 ∈ CXn−2 . Then the
(β)
assertion of Theorem 1.3 for Xn−2 yields that VI (C 0 ) ∈ R. Now, it follows from (6.4) that
Qβ (C 0 ) ∈ iR.
Thus, we have proved that the 1-form dVeXn satisfies all conditions of Lemma 3.2. Therefore,
the function I(dVeXn ) = VeXn − VX∗n is totally real on CXn . (Recall that VX∗n = VXn (C ∗ ).) Since
VX∗n ∈ R, we conclude that the function VeXn is totally real on CXn , which completes the proof
of Theorem 1.3.
Induction step for Theorem 1.2. Assume that n odd and n ≥ 3. Assume that the assertion
of Theorem 1.2 holds true for Λn−2, and prove the assertion of Theorem 1.2 for Λn . The
assertion of Theorem 1.2 can be reformulated as follows:
For any element γ ∈ π = π1 (X, C ∗ ), the function


fγ = i Mγ VeΛn − (−1)lk(γ,H) VeΛn

(6.6)

We would like to apply Lemma 3.10 to the 1-form dVeΛn . Conditions (A) and (B) have been
checked in Section 5, condition (ii) is obvious, and conditions (iii) and (iv) are satisfied by
Proposition 4.2 and Lemma 4.3, respectively. The principal branch dVΛn of the 1-form dVeΛn
is well defined and real on U, hence, condition (i′ ) is also satisfied.
fγ are totally real on CΛn . Let us prove this
Condition (i′′ ) for dVeΛn says that all 1-forms dW

The linking number of the loop γ and the hypersurface HI = HI,(n) in G(n) (C) is equal to
the linking number of the loop prI (γ) and the hypersurface H(n−2) in G(n−2) (C). Hence,

Let us prove that the 1-form dVeΛn satisfies condition (v′ ). As in the proof of Theorem 1.3,
let C 0 be a regular point of HJ , where |J| = n, such that C 0 does not belong to the union
of all other hypersurfaces HK , and let β be a path from C ∗ to C 0 that is contained in X,
except for its endpoint C 0 . Again, we may assume that J = {0, . . . , n − 1}. Formulae (6.4)
and (6.5) are obtained literally in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 1.3. We need to
prove that the numbers Qβ (C 0 ) are real for all C 0 and β. As in the proof of Theorem 1.3,
we see that it is sufficient to prove this assertion for some particular point C 0 and for all
paths β leading to it. We take the same matrix C 0 as in the proof of Theorem 1.3. Recall
that CJ0 is the Gram matrix of the points u0 , . . . , un−1 in Λn−2 such that u1 , . . . , un−1 are
vertices of a regular (n − 2)-dimensional simplex, and u0 is the centre of this simplex. The
matrices CI0 lie in CΛn−2 for all I ⊂ J such that |I| = n − 1, that is, for all I = J \ {j},
j = 0, . . . , n − 1. The assertion of Theorem 1.2 for Λn−2 implies that

Let us vary continuously the pair (C 0 , β) so that C 0 remains in HJreg (R) \ K6=J HK . Then
the submatrix CJ0 remains in ∂CΛn−1 . Obviously, the coefficients sj do not change under such
continuous deformations. On the other hand, as it was mentioned above, the value Qβ (C 0 )
also does not change under such deformations. Hence, the linear combination

can be extended

and the deformation of β can be easily built using the smoothness of the hypersurface HJ
in a neighborhood of C 0 . Therefore, the linear combination

the points u0 , . . . , un−1 , respectively. Here by V (w1 , . . . , wn−1) we denote the (n − 2)dimensional volume of the simplex in Λn−2 with vertices w1 , . . . , wn−1. We put Vj =
V (v0 , . . . , vj−1, vj+1 , . . . , vn−1 ), j = 0, . . . , n − 1.

Lemma 6.1. A unique (up to multiplication by a number ) linear combination of the volumes V0 , . . . , Vn−1 remaining constant as the points v0 , . . . , vn−1 vary in sufficiently small

Proof. The equality (6.12) holds true, since the simplex [v1 . . . vn−1 ] with volume V0 is decomposed into n simplices [v0 . . . vj−1 vj+1 . . . vn−1 ], j = 1, . . . , n − 1, with volumes V1 , . . . , Vn−1 ,
respectively.P
n−1
λj Vj be a constant linear combination. Take vj = uj for j = 1, . . . , n−1, and
Now, let j=0
allow to vary the point v0 only. Then the volume V0 is constant, and the volumes V1 , . . . , Vn−1
become functions in v0 . It is clear from the symmetry reasons that the gradients of these functions at the point v0 = u0 are tangent vectors ξ1 , . . . , ξn−1 to the segments [u0 u1], . . . , [u0 un−1 ],
respectively, and the lengths of all these vectors are equal to each other. Then ξ1 + · · · + ξn−1
is the only zero linear combination of these vectors. Hence,
Pn−1 all coefficients λ1 , . . . , λn−1 must
be equal to each other. Then equality (6.12) yields j=0
λj Vj = (λ0 + λ1 )V0 . However, the
volume V0 is obviously non-constant if we allow to vary all points vj . Therefore, we obtain
that λ0 + λ1 = 0.

Lemma 6.1 implies that the linear combination (6.11) is proportional to the linear combination (6.12), hence, is equal to zero. Therefore, the right-hand side of (6.9) is equal to
zero. Hence, the 1-form dVeΛn satisfies condition (v′ ).
The principal branch VΛn (C) of the multi-valued function VeΛn on CΛn is well defined and
satisfies zero boundary conditions, since the volume of any degenerate simplex vanishes.
Thus, Lemma 3.10 can be applied to the 1-form dVeΛn and the function VeΛn . This lemma
fγ are totally real on CΛn for all γ ∈ π, which completes the proof
implies that the functions W

7. Flexible polyhedra and their volumes
In this section we give a rigorous definition of a flexible polyhedron, and reformulate
Theorem 1.1 more precisely. First of all, it is standard for the theory of flexible polyhedra to
restrict ourselves to considering only simplicial polyhedra. Indeed, an arbitrary polyhedral
surface has a simplicial subdivision. Passing to this subdivision, we introduce new hinges.
Hence all flexions of the initial polyhedral surface induce flexions of the obtained simplicial
polyhedral surface, and, possibly, some new flexions appear. Therefore Theorem 1.1 for all
flexible polyhedra follows immediately from Theorem 1.1 for simplicial flexible polyhedra.
Below, we shall always work with simplicial polyhedra only.
Recall that a k-dimensional pseudo-manifold is a finite simplicial complex K such that
(1) every simplex of K is contained in a k-dimensional simplex,
(2) every (k − 1)-dimensional simplex of K is contained in exactly two k-dimensional
simplices,
(3) K is strongly connected, i. e., the complement K \ Skk−2 (K) is connected, where
Skk−2 (K) is the (k − 2)-skeleton of K.
28

A pseudo-manifold K is said to be oriented if its k-dimensional simplices are endowed with
orientations such that, for any two k-dimensional simplices σ1 and σ2 with a common (k −1)dimensional face, the orientations of this face induced by the orientations of σ1 and σ2 are
opposite to each other.
As before, we shall identify the Lobachevsky space Λn with its standard vector model
in R1,n . Let ∆k be an affine simplex with vertices v0 , . . . , vk . A mapping P : ∆k → Λn will
be called pseudo-linear if
β0 P (v0 ) + · · · + βk P (vk )
P (β0 v0 + · · · + βk vk ) =
|β0 P (v0 ) + · · · + βk P (vk )|
p
for any non-negative numbers β0 , . . . , βk such that β0 + · · · + βk = 1, where |x| = hx, xi.
It is easy to see that the restriction of a pseudo-linear mapping to a face of ∆k is also
pseudo-linear.
In the sequel, we shall assume that the dimension n is greater than or equal to 2.
Definition 7.1. Let K be an oriented (n − 1)-dimensional pseudo-manifold. A bounded
(simplicial ) polyhedron of combinatorial type K in the Lobachevsky space Λn is a mapping
P : K → Λn such that the restriction of P to every simplex of K is pseudo-linear. A
flexion of a bounded polyhedron of combinatorial type K is a continuous family of polyhedra
Pt : K → Λn , where t runs over some interval (a, b), such that the lengths of all edges of Pt
are constant as t varies. A flexion Pt is called non-trivial if the mappings Pt1 and Pt2 cannot
be obtained from each other by an isometry of Λn for any sufficiently close to each other
t1 6= t2 .
Notice that, for bounded simplicial polyhedra, the requirement that the lengths of edges
are constant during the flexion immediately implies that all faces of the polyhedron remain
congruent to themselves during the flexion.

Remark 7.2. Definition 7.1 is a natural analogue of the standard definition of a flexible
polyhedron in the Euclidean space used in [27]–[29], [14], [17], [18]. The only difference is
that in the Euclidean case we use affine mappings instead of pseudo-linear. Actually, the
usage of pseudo-linear mappings in Definition 7.1 is convenient but not obligatory. Let us
refuse from the requirement that the restriction of P to every simplex of K is pseudo-linear,
and require only that the restriction of P to every simplex ∆ of K is a continuous mapping
onto the convex hull of the points P (v), where v runs over all vertices of ∆. Besides, let
us not distinguish between polyhedra of the same combinatorial type such that all pairs of
their corresponding vertices coincide. This definition is equivalent to Definition 7.1, and was
used in [20].

Let v1 . . . vn , s = 1, . . . , q, be all positively oriented (n − 1)-dimensional simplices of
the pseudo-manifold K. By definition, the generalized oriented volume of the polyhedron
P : K → Λn is given by

where o is an arbitrary point in Λ and Vor (v0 , . . . , vn ) denotes the oriented volume of the
simplex in Λn with vertices v0 , . . . , vn with the orientation given by the indicated order of
vertices. It is easy to see that VK (P ) is independent of the choice of the point o.
29

An equivalent definition of the generalized oriented volume can be given in the following
way. For each point x in the complement of the surface P (K), let λP (x) be the algebraic
intersection number of a path from x to infinity and the (n − 1)-dimensional cycle P (K). It
is easy to show that this intersection number is independent of the choice of the path. The
function λP (x) is called the indicator function of the polyhedron P . Then
Z
VK (P ) =
λP (x) dV (x),
(7.2)
Λn

where dV (x) is the standard volume measure in Λn .
If P : K → Λn is an embedding, then VK (P ) is the usual oriented volume of the region
bounded by the polyhedral hypersurface P (K).
The following theorem is a more precise formulation of Theorem 1.1, which is the main
result of this paper.

Theorem 7.3. Suppose that n is odd. Let K be an oriented (n − 1)-dimensional pseudomanifold, and let Pt : K → Λn , t ∈ (a, b), be a flexion of a bounded polyhedron of combinatorial type K. Then the generalized oriented volume VK (Pt ) is constant.
Definition 7.1 allows flexible polyhedra to be self-intersecting and degenerate. For instance,
one can easily construct an example of a flexible polyhedron in sense of this definition
that geometrically is the union of the boundaries of two tetrahedra with a common edge,
see [20, Sect. 2] for details. Certainly, these two tetrahedra can rotate around their common
edge independently of each other. When we consider the question on existence of flexible
polyhedra, we would like to avoid such pathological examples. So some additional conditions
should be added to the definition of a flexible polyhedron. For instance, in [20] the following
two conditions are added:
(1) The image of any simplex of K under the mapping P is a non-degenerate simplex of
the same dimension in Λn .
(2) The simplicial complex K cannot be decomposed into the union of two its subcomplexes K1 and K2 such that dim K1 = dim K2 = n − 1 and the set P (K1 ∩ K2 ) is
contained in an (n − 2)-dimensional plane in Λn .
Polyhedra satisfying (1) are called polyhedra with non-degenerate faces, and polyhedra satisfying both (1) and (2) are called non-degenerate polyhedra. In [19] the author constructed
examples of non-degenerate flexible polyhedra in the spaces En , Sn , and Λn of all dimensions.
This result makes substantial the assertion of Theorem 7.3.
First, we shall prove Theorem 7.3 for polyhedra with non-degenerate faces. From the
geometric viewpoint only this case is sensible. However, for the completeness of our result,
we then shall show that Theorem 7.3 for all flexible polyhedra in sense of Definition 7.1
follows from Theorem 7.3 for polyhedra with non-degenerate faces.
Remark 7.4. Definition 7.1 can be easily modified so as to obtain a rigorous definition of a
not necessarily simplicial flexible polyhedron. Namely, in the definition of a pseudo-manifold
one should replace a simplicial complex by a cell complex glued out of affine convex polytopes
along affine isomorphisms of their faces. In this case no appropriate analogue of a pseudolinear mapping exists, so one should replace the requirement that the restriction of P to
every cell of K is pseudo-linear with the requirement that the restriction of P to every cell σ
of K is a continuous mapping onto the convex hull of the points P (v), where v runs over all
30

vertices of σ, as in Remark 7.2. The generalized oriented volume of a polyhedron P : K → Λn
is given by the same formula (7.2). However, as it was mentioned in the beginning of this
section, Theorem 1.1 for arbitrary flexible polyhedra follows immediately from Theorem 1.1
for simplicial flexible polyhedra. Hence further we consider only simplicial flexible polyhedra
in sense of Definition 7.1.
8. The configuration space of polyhedra with given edge lengths
Let K be an oriented (n − 1)-dimensional pseudo-manifold with m vertices and r edges,
and let V(K) and E(K) be the sets of vertices and edges of K, respectively. A polyhedron
P : K → Λn is determined solely by the positions of its vertices. For each vertex v of K,
we denote by xv the vector representing the point P (v) in the standard vector model of Λn ,
and we denote by xv,0 , . . . , xv,n the coordinates of xv . Consider the space Rm(n+1) = (R1,n )m
with the coordinates xv,j , v ∈ V(K), j = 0, . . . , n. The point of this space corresponding
to a polyhedron P : K → Λn will again be denoted by P . Then the space of all bounded
polyhedra P : K → Λn of combinatorial type K is the subset of Rm(n+1) given by
hxv , xv i = x2v,0 − x2v,1 − · · · − x2v,n = 1,
xv,0 > 0,

(8.1)
(8.2)

where v runs over V(K).
We fix a set ℓ = (ℓe ) of positive real numbers indexed by edges e ∈ E(K). Then the
configuration space Σ+ (ℓ) of all polyhedra P : K → Λn with the prescribed set of edge
lengths ℓ is the subset of Rm(n+1) given by m equations (8.1), m inequalities (8.2), and
r equations
hxu , xv i = xu,0 xv,0 − xu,1 xv,1 − · · · − xu,n xv,n = cosh ℓ[uv] ,

(8.3)

where [uv] runs over all edges of K. (Certainly, the configuration space Σ+ (ℓ) may be
empty.) We also denote by Σ(ℓ) the real affine variety in Rm(n+1) given by the m + r
quadratic equations (8.1) and (8.3). Since K is connected, it follows easily from (8.3) that,
for each point P = (xv,j ) ∈ Σ(ℓ), either all xv,0 are positive or all xv,0 are negative. Hence
Σ(ℓ) = Σ+ (ℓ) ∪ (−Σ+ (ℓ)).
The following proposition is a reformulation of Theorem 7.3.
Proposition 8.1. Suppose that n is odd. Then the function VK (P ) is constant on every
connected component of Σ+ (ℓ).
Any real affine variety Σ ⊂ RN possesses a natural stratification that can be constructed
in the following way, see [37, Sect. 11(b)]. Let d = dim Σ. Then Σ = Σ1 ∪ Σ2 , where Σ1 is
the the union of all d-dimensional irreducible components of Σ, and Σ2 is the the union of
all irreducible components of Σ of dimensions strictly less than d. Put M = Σreg
1 \ Σ2 and
sing
′
′
′
Σ = Σ1 ∪ Σ2 ; then Σ = M ⊔ Σ . The set Σ is a real affine variety of dimension strictly
less than d. All connected components of M are taken for d-dimensional stata. Then the
same procedure is recursively applied to Σ′ . The obtained stratification will be referred to as
the standard stratification of Σ. By construction, every stratum S of this stratification is a
connected open (in the analytic topology) subset of the set of regular points of an irreducible
real affine variety. This easily implies the following proposition.
31

Proposition 8.2. Let S be a stratum of the standard stratification of a real affine variety Σ ⊂
RN , and let Ξ be the Zariski closure of S in CN . Then Ξ is an irreducible complex affine
variety, dimC Ξ = dimR S, and S ⊂ Ξreg .

The set Σ+ (ℓ), which we are interested in, generally is not a real affine variety, but it is the
union of several connected components of the real affine variety Σ(ℓ). The restriction of the
standard stratification of Σ(ℓ) to Σ+ (ℓ) will be called the standard stratification of Σ+ (ℓ).
Since the standard stratification of Σ+ (ℓ) consists of finitely many strata, Proposition 8.1
will follow if we show that the function VK (P ) is constant on every stratum S of the standard
stratification of Σ+ (ℓ). This will be done in three steps. First, using Schläfli’s formula, we
shall show that the function VK (P ) restricted to S can be continued to a multi-valued analytic
eK (P ) on a dense Zariski open subset Υ ⊂ Ξreg , where Ξ is the Zariski closure of S
function V
eK (P )
in Cm(n+1) . Second, we shall deduce from Theorem 1.2 that the analytic function V
is in fact single-valued. Third, we shall use Liouville’s theorem on entire functions to show
eK (P ) is constant. This scheme will be realized in Sections 9 and 10 for
that the function V
flexible polyhedra with non-degenerate faces. Thus we shall prove Theorem 7.3 for such
flexible polyhedra. In Section 11, we shall show that Theorem 7.3 for arbitrary polyhedra
follows from Theorem 7.3 for polyhedra with non-degenerate faces.
9. Proof of Theorem 7.3 for polyhedra with non-degenerate faces

In this section all polyhedra under consideration are supposed to have non-degenerate
faces. Notice that the property of a polyhedron P : K → Λn to have non-degenerate faces is
determined solely by the combinatorial type and the set of edge lengths of the polyhedron.
So in this section we consider only those pairs (K, ℓ) that polyhedra of combinatorial type K
with the set of edge lengths ℓ have non-degenerate faces.
We define the oriented dihedral angle αF of a polyhedron P : K → Λn at an (n − 2)dimensional face F of K in the following way. Let σ1 and σ2 be the two (n − 1)-dimensional
simplices of K containing F . Take any point x in P (F ). Let n1 and n2 be the unit vectors in
the tangent spaces Tx P (σ1 ) and Tx P (σ2 ), respectively, orthogonal to Tx P (F ) and pointing
inside the simplices P (σ1 ) and P (σ2 ), respectively. Let m1 and m2 be the outer normal
vectors to P (σ1 ) and P (σ2 ), respectively, at x, i. e., the unit vectors in Tx Λn orthogonal to
Tx P (σ1 ) and to Tx P (σ2 ), respectively, such that the product of the direction of mi and the
positive orientation of P (σi ) yields the positive orientation of Λn . We say that the positive
direction of rotation around P (F ) is from m1 to n1 , and denote by αF = αF (P ) the angle
from n1 to n2 in this positive direction. This angle is well defined up to 2πk, k ∈ Z. We
shall always consider αF as an element of R/(2πZ). It is easy to see that αF is independent
of the choice of the point x and does not change if we interchange the simplices σ1 and σ2 .
Schläfli’s formula for the differential of the volume is usually written for convex polytopes
in Λn , see the Introduction. However, the convexity is unimportant. The following version
of Schläfli’s formula follows immediately from Schläfli’s formula for a simplex, formula (7.1),
and the above definition of oriented dihedral angles.
Lemma 9.1 (Schläfli’s formula). The differential of the generalized oriented volume of a
polyhedron P : K → Λn with non-degenerate faces is given by
X

32

where the sum is taken over all (n − 2)-dimensional faces F of K, and VF (P ) is the (unoriented ) (n − 2)-volume of the simplex P (F ).

Let us restrict equation (9.1) to Σ+ (ℓ). For each F , the volume VF (P ) depends only on
the set ℓ of edge lengths, hence, is constant on Σ+ (ℓ); we denote it by VF,ℓ .
Lemma 9.2. For each (n − 2)-dimensional face F of K, the restriction of the function
exp(iαF (P )) to the set Σ+ (ℓ) coincides with the restriction of some polynomial QF (P ) in
the coordinates xv,j .

Proof. Let σ1 and σ2 be the two (n − 1)-dimensional simplices of K containing F . We denote
the vertices of σ1 and σ2 opposite to F by v0 and v1 , respectively, and the vertices of F
by v2 , . . . , vn , where the order of vertices is chosen so that the order v1 , v2 , . . . , vn yields the
positive orientation of σ2 . Let C be the Gram matrix of the vectors xv0 , . . . , xvn . It follows
easily from the definition of the oriented dihedral angles that the sign of sin αF (P ) coincides
with the sign of the determinant det(xv0 , . . . , xvn ). The square of this determinant is equal
to (−1)n D(C). By (4.1), we obtain that
(−1)n−1 DI ′ ,I ′′ (C)
cos αF (P ) = p

where I = {2, . . . , n}, I ′ = {0, 2, . . . , n}, and I ′′ = {1, 2, . . . , n}. The minors DI (C), DI ′ (C),
and DI ′′ (C) are constant on Σ+ (ℓ), while DI ′ ,I ′′ (C) and det(xv0 , . . . , xvn ) are polynomials
in the coordinates xv,j . Therefore the restrictions of cos αF (P ) and sin αF (P ) to Σ+ (ℓ) are
polynomials, hence, the restriction of exp(iαF (P )) to Σ+ (ℓ) is also a polynomial.

The polynomials QF (P ) such that exp(iαF (P )) = QF (P ) on Σ+ (ℓ) may be not unique.
We choose and fix some polynomials satisfying these condition.
Now, let S be a stratum of the standard stratification of Σ+ (ℓ). Since S is connected
and VF (P ) = VF,ℓ are constants on S, we can integrate equation (9.1). We obtain that the
following equality holds on S:
X
i
VK (P ) =
VF,ℓ Log QF (P ) + cS ,
(9.2)
n − 1 F ⊂K, dim F =n−2

where cS is a real constant that depends on S only. This formula should be understood in
the following way. Each summand VF,ℓ Log QF (P ) may have non-trivial variation along a
loop in S. However, the whole sum in the right-hand side of (9.2) has trivial variations along
all loops in S, since we know that the volume VK (P ) is well defined on S. Formula (9.2)
means that we can choose a branch of the sum in the right-hand side so that the equality
will hold. (Choosing another branch, we change the constant cS only.)
Let Ξ be the Zariski closure of S in Cm(n+1) . By Proposition 8.2, Ξ is irreducible, dimC Ξ =
dimR S, and S ⊂ Ξreg . Hence the analytic continuation of a function defined on S along a
path in Ξ is unique whenever exists.
The angles αF (P ) are well defined for all P ∈ S. Hence the polynomials QF (P ) do not
take zero values in S. Nevertheless, the polynomials QF (P ) may take zero values in Ξ. Let
Υ ⊂ Ξ be the Zariski open subset consisting of all regular points P of Ξ such that all values
33

QF (P ) are non-zero. The subset Υ is non-empty, since it contains S, hence, Υ is dense in Ξ.
We immediately obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 9.3. The function VK (P ) admits the analytic continuation along every path

eK (P ), one can choose branches of the logarithms in the right-hand side so that equalof V
ity (9.3) will hold true. However, it is possible that not any choice of branches of the

lowing simplest example: Certainly, the equality 2 z = z + z is true for an appropriate
choice of branches of the square roots in the right-hand side. However, branches of the square
√
roots in the right-hand side can be chosen so that their sum will equal zero rather than 2 z.
Since all volumes VF,ℓ are real constants, Proposition 9.3 immediately implies the following
assertion.
Corollary 9.5. For each point P0 ∈ Υ, any two branches of the multi-valued analytic funceK (P ) in a neighborhood of P0 in Υ differ by a real constant.

Lemma 9.6. The subset Ω ∩ S is dense in S (in the analytic topology).
Proof. The isometry group Isom(Λn ) acts naturally on Σ+ (ℓ). This action is compatible
with the standard stratification, that is, the image of any stratum under the transformation
given by each element of Isom(Λn ) is again a stratum. Since the subgroup Isom+ (Λn ) of
orientation-preserving isometries is connected and the number of strata is finite, we obtain
that every stratum is invariant under the action of Isom+ (Λn ). Let P0 be a point in S. Then

Since the standard stratification of Σ+ (ℓ) consists of finitely many strata, Proposition 9.9
implies that the function VK (P ) is constant on every connected component of Σ+ (ℓ). Thus
Proposition 8.1 and, hence, Theorem 7.3 hold true for polyhedra with non-degenerate faces.

Remark 9.10. Substituting the oriented dihedral angles αF to formula (1.2), we obtain the
definition of the total mean curvature of any polyhedron P : K → Λn with non-degenerate
faces. Since the angles αF are defined modulo 2πZ, the total mean curvature is defined
modulo the subgroup of R generated by the numbers 2πVF (P ) for all (n−2)-dimensional faces
of K. However, for any flexible polyhedron Pt : K → Λn , we can choose a real-valued branch
of the total mean curvature of Pt . Theorem 7.3 and Schläfli’s formula (9.1) immediately
imply the following assertion, which is a more precise formulation of Corollary 1.5.
Corollary 9.11. Suppose that n is odd. Let K be an oriented (n − 1)-dimensional pseudomanifold, and let Pt : K → Λn be a flexion of a bounded polyhedron of combinatorial type K
with non-degenerate faces. Then the total mean curvature of Pt is constant.
10. Proof of Lemma 9.8
Lemma 10.1. Let A be an irreducible complex affine variety, and let f be a non-constant
regular function on A that does not take zero value. Then the multi-valued function Log f
does not have a single-valued holomorphic branch on A.
36

Proof. First, suppose that A is a curve. Then we can delete from C a finite set of points B =
{b0 = 0, b1 , . . . , bq } so that the restriction of f will yield a finite-sheeted (non-ramified)
covering f −1 (C \ B) → C \ B. Choose a positive number R different from |b1 |, . . . , |bq |, and
put
SR1 = {z ∈ C | |z| = R}.

Then the restriction of f to f −1 (SR1 ) is a finite-sheeted covering f −1 (SR1 ) → SR1 . Any connected component γ of f −1 (SR1 ) is a closed path in A. As a point x passes along γ, its image
f (x) passes several times along SR1 in the same direction. Hence any branch of Log f changes
by a non-zero constant.
Second, suppose that A ⊂ CN is an irreducible affine variety of dimension d > 1. Since
f is non-constant on A, there exists a regular point x ∈ A such that df is non-zero at x.
Take any tangent vector ξ ∈ Tx A such that hdf, ξi =
6 0. It is not hard to see that there
exists an irreducible affine curve Γ ⊂ A such that x is a regular point of Γ and ξ is a tangent
vector to Γ at x. Indeed, one can take for Γ the irreducible component containing x of an
arbitrary plane section A ∩ Π, where Π ⊂ CN is an (N − d + 1)-dimensional plane such that
Tx A ∩ Tx Π = hξi. Then the restriction of f to Γ is non-constant. Hence Log f does not have
a single-valued branch on Γ. Therefore it does not have a single-valued branch on A.

Proof of Lemma 9.8. Let d be the dimension of A. Then there exists a finite regular mapping
F : A → Cd . Let k be the degree of F . Then there is a non-empty Zariski open subset U ⊂ Cd
such that every point z ∈ U has exactly k pre-images under F . Moreover, the pre-images of
every point z ∈ Cd \ U can be assigned multiplicities such that the sum of the multiplicities
of all pre-images is equal to k, and the resulting mapping F −1 : Cd → Symk (A) is continuous,
where Symk (A) is the kth symmetric power of A. We put
ψ(x) = exp(−iϕ(x)).
For each z ∈ Cd , we put

Ψj (z) = σj (ψ(x1 ), . . . , ψ(xk )),

(10.1)

where σj is the jth elementary symmetric polynomial, and x1 , . . . , xk are the pre-images of z
under F . The functions Ψj (z) are holomorphic on U and continuous on Cd . Hence they
have removable singularities on Cd \ U, i. e., they are entire functions on Cd , see [33, Sect. 32,
Theorem 3].
Now, let us estimate the functions Ψj (z). Inequality (9.6) yields

The ring C[A] is an integral extension of the ring C[Cd ] = C[z1 , . . . , zd ]. Hence every function
fn satisfies a polynomial relation of the form
fnsn + gn,1fnsn −1 + · · · + gn,sn = 0,
where gn,l are polynomials in z = F (x). Therefore estimates (10.2) yield estimates
|Ψj (z)| ≤ Cj (1 + |z|Kj )
for some Cj , Kj > 0. By Liouville’s theorem on entire functions, the functions Ψj (z) are
polynomials, see [9, Sect. A1.1].
37

By (10.1), the function ψ satisfies the polynomial relation
ψ k (x) − Ψ1 (F (x))ψ k−1 (x) + Ψ2 (F (x))ψ k−2(x) − · · · + (−1)k Ψk (F (x)) = 0.

The coefficients Ψj (F (x)) are regular functions on A. Hence, the function ψ is integral over
the ring C[A]. On the other hand, the function ψ is holomorphic on A. It follows that ψ
is rational function on A, see [34, Ch. 8, Sect. 3.1]. Since A is smooth and ψ takes finite
values at all points of A, we obtain that ψ is a regular function on A. The function −iϕ is
a single-valued holomorphic branch of the function Log ψ on A. By Lemma 10.1, this would
be impossible if the function ψ were non-constant. Thus ψ and ϕ are constants.

11. Proof of Theorem 7.3 for arbitrary polyhedra
Theorem 7.3 for arbitrary flexible polyhedra follows immediately from Theorem 7.3 for
flexible polyhedra with non-degenerate faces and the following lemma.
Lemma 11.1. Let Pt : K → Λn be a bounded flexible polyhedron. Then there exist oriented
(n−1)-dimensional pseudo-manifolds K (1) , . . . , K (k) and bounded flexible polyhedra with non(l)
degenerate faces Pt : K (l) → Λn , l = 1, . . . , k, such that the indicator function λPt (x) is equal

Proof. Let ℓ be the set of edge lengths of the flexible polyhedron Pt : K → Λn . For each
simplex σ of K, the image Pt (σ) is determined up to isometry of Λn by the set of edge
lengths of σ. We shall conveniently choose a polytope ∆σ ⊂ Λn isometric to Pt (σ) for all t,
the projection ̟σ : σ → ∆σ , and the isometries ϕσ,t : ∆σ → Pt (σ) such that ϕσ,t ◦ ̟σ = Pt |σ
for all t. We shall say that a simplex σ of K is ℓ-non-degenetrate if dim ∆σ = dim σ, and
ℓ-degenetrate if dim ∆σ < dim σ. If σ is ℓ-non-degenetrate, then ∆σ is a simplex.
A sequence θ = (σ0 , . . . , σm ) of (n − 1)-dimensional simplices of K is called a thick path
if dim(σj−1 ∩ σj ) = n − 2 for j = 1, . . . , m, and σj−1 6= σj+1 for j = 1, . . . , m − 1. The
number m will be called the length of θ. A thick path θ will be called admissible if m ≥ 1
and the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) σ0 is ℓ-non-degenerate and σ1 , . . . , σm−1 are ℓ-degenerate.
(2) The simplices τj = σj−1 ∩ σj are ℓ-non-degenerate, j = 1, . . . , m.
(3) dim (Pt (τ1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ Pt (τm )) = n − 2.
Let us prove that the latter condition is independent of t. Indeed, let ιt2 ,t1 be an isometry
of Λn taking Pt1 (σ0 ) to Pt2 (σ0 ), and let Πt1 and Πt2 be the (n − 2)-dimensional planes in Λn
containing Pt1 (τ1 ) and Pt2 (τ1 ), respectively. It is easy to see that conditions (1) and (2) imply
that Pt1 and Pt2 map all simplices σ1 , . . . , σm−1 to the planes Πt1 and Πt2 , respectively, and
Pt2 |σ1 ∪···∪σm−1 = ιt2 ,t1 ◦ Pt1 |σ1 ∪···∪σm−1 .

Therefore, the polytopes Pt1 (τ1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ Pt1 (τm ) and Pt2 (τ1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ Pt2 (τm ) are isometric.
Moreover, we see that the (n − 2)-dimensional convex polytope
is independent of t.

An admissible thick path θ = (σ0 , . . . , σm ) will be called maximal if σm is ℓ-non-degenerate. Obviously, if θ is a maximal admissible thick path, then the inverse sequence θ−1 =

Lemma 11.2. The number of admissible thick paths is finite. Let σ be an ℓ-non-degenerate
(n − 1)-dimensional simplex of K. Then the polytopes Fθ , where θ runs over all maximal
admissible thick paths starting with σ, form a decomposition of ∂∆σ into finitely many convex
polytopes with disjoint interiors.
Proof. To prove that the number of admissible thick paths is finite it is sufficient to show
that any admissible thick path θ = (σ0 , . . . , σm ) is non-self-intersecting, i. e., the simplices
σ0 , . . . , σm are pairwise disjoint. Assume the converse. Take the smallest j such that σj = σi
for some i < j. If i 6= 0, then the simplices τi , τi+1 , and τj are three pairwise different (n−2)dimensional faces of σi . It follows easily that dim(Pt (τi ) ∩ Pt (τi+1 ) ∩ Pt (τj )) < n − 2, which
contradicts property (3) in the definition of an admissible thick path. If i = 0, then j = m.
Because of the minimality of j, we see that σ1 6= σm−1 . Hence τ1 and τm are different (n − 2)dimensional faces of the ℓ-non-degenerate simplex σ0 . Therefore dim(Pt (τ1 )∩Pt (τm )) < n−2
and we again obtain a contradiction with property (3).
Let us prove that the interiors of polytopes Fθ and Fθ′ corresponding to different maximal
′
′
admissible thick paths θ = (σ, σ1 , . . . , σm ) and θ′ = (σ, σ1′ , . . . , σm
′ ) are disjoint. If σ1 6= σ1 ,
then Fθ and Fθ′ lie in different (n − 2)-dimensional faces of ∆σ , hence their interiors are
disjoint. Assume that σ1 = σ1′ . Take the smallest j such that σj 6= σj′ . Then τj−1 , τj , and τj′
are three pairwise different (n − 2)-dimensional faces of σj−1 . Hence dim(Pt (τj−1 ) ∩ Pt (τj ) ∩
Pt (τj′ )) < n − 2. Therefore dim(Fθ ∩ Fθ′ ) < n − 2. Thus the interiors of Fθ and Fθ′ are
disjoint.
Finally, let us prove that the union of the polytopes Fθ for all maximal admissible thick
paths θ starting with σ coincides with ∂∆σ . We denote by Am (σ) the set of all admissible
thick paths of length m starting with σ, and we denote by MA(σ) the set of all maximal
admissible thick paths starting with σ. For m > 1, let us prove that

Let θ = (σ, σ1 , . . . , σm−1 ) be an admissible thick path that is not maximal. Let τm , . . . , τm
be all ℓ-non-degenerate (n − 2)-dimensional faces of σm−1 different from τm−1 . For j =
(j)

(j)
1, . . . , p, let σm be the (n − 1)-dimensional simplex of K such that σm−1 ∩ σm = τm , and let

(j) 
θ(j) = (σ, σ1 , . . . , σm−1 , σm ). Since σm−1 is ℓ-degenerate, we have Pt (τm−1 ) ⊂ pj=1 Pt τm .
Hence,

Pt (τ1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ Pt (τm−1 ) ⊂

j=1

Moreover, since Pt (τ1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ Pt (τm−1 ) is an (n − 2)-dimensional convex polytope, it is
(j) 
contained in the union of only those polytopes Pt (τ1 ) ∩ · · · ∩ Pt (τm−1 ) ∩ Pt τm which
are (n − 2)-dimensional, that is, correspond to admissible thick paths θ(j) . Therefore the
39

polytope Fθ is contained in the union of the polytopes Fθ(j) corresponding to admissible thick
paths θ(j) , which immediately
yields (11.1).
S
S Since the sets Am (σ) are empty for sufficiently
large m, we obtain that θ∈M A(σ) Fθ ⊃ θ∈A1 (σ) Fθ = ∂∆σ . The latter equality holds, since
all thick paths (σ, σ1 ) of length 1 are admissible.

Let us proceed with the proof of Lemma 11.1. Take the disjoint union of the hyperbolic
simplices ∆σ , where σ runs over all ℓ-non-degenerate (n−1)-dimensional simplices of K. For
each maximal admissible thick path θ = (σ0 , . . . , σm ), glue the (n − 2)-dimensional polytopes
Fθ ⊂ ∂∆σ0 and Fθ−1 ⊂ ∂∆σm along the isometry γθ . Let K be the obtained cell complex.
For each t, the mappings ϕσ,t : ∆σ → Λn constitute a well-defined mapping Pt : K → Λn .
In particular, it follows that the tautological mappings ∆σ → K are embeddings, i. e., that
we never glue any two different points of the same cell ∆σ . By the construction, every cell
of K is contained in an (n − 1)-dimensional cell and every (n − 2)-dimensional cell of K
is contained in exactly two (n − 1)-dimensional cells. We subdivide the cell complex K
into convex hyperbolic simplices. Let K (1) , . . . , K (k) be the connected components of the
obtained simplicial complex. Then K (1) , . . . , K (k) are (n − 1)-dimensional pseudo-manifolds.
The orientation of every ℓ-non-degenerate (n − 1)-dimensional simplex σ of K induces the
orientation of ∆σ . Hence the pseudo-manifolds K (1) , . . . , K (k) obtain canonical orientations.
(j)
Let Pt be the restriction of Pt to K (j) . Since the restriction of Pt to every cell ∆σ is an
(j)
isometry, we see that Pt : K (j) → Λn is a flexible polyhedron with non-degenerate faces.
(j)
It follows immediately from the construction that Pt (K (j) ) ⊂ Pt (K) for all j and t, and

λPt (x) = l=1 λP (l) (x) for all t and all x ∈ Λn \ Pt (K).
