Abstract

For a graph G, the tree graph TG,t has all tree subgraphs of G with t vertices as
vertex set and two tree subgraphs are neighbors if they are edge-disjoint. Also,
the rth cut number of G is the minimum number of edges between parts of a
partition of vertex set of G into two parts such that each part has size at least
r. We show that if t = (1 − o(1))n and n is large enough, then for any dense
graph G with n vertices, the chromatic number of the tree graph TG,t is equal
to the (n − t + 1)th cut number of G. In particular, as a consequence, we prove
that if n is large enough and G is a dense graph, then the chromatic number
of the spanning tree graph TG,n is equal to the size of the minimum cut of G.
The proof method is based on alternating Turán number inspired by Tucker’s
lemma, an equivalent combinatorial version of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem.

Introduction

The usual Kneser graph KG(n, k) is a graph whose vertex set consists of all k-subsets
of [n] = {1, . . . , n} and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding k-subsets are
disjoint. The usual Kneser graphs are generalized in several ways. For a given graph
G and a positive integer t, where 1 ≤ t ≤ |V (G)|, define the tree graph TG,t to be a
graph whose vertex set consists of all tree subgraphs of G with t vertices and two
vertices are adjacent if the corresponding tree subgraphs are edge-disjoint. Note
that TG,t can be considered as a generalization of the usual Kneser graphs. For this
purpose, note that if G is a star with n edges, then the graph TG,t is isomorphic to
KG(n, t).
A partition (X, Y ) of the vertex set of a graph G is called a cut of G. The size of
this cut is the number of edges in G which meet both X and Y , that is, |E(G[X, Y ])|.
A cut (X, Y ) is called an r-cut, if min{|X|, |Y |} ≥ r. The minimum possible size of
an r-cut in G is called the r th cut number of G and is denoted by cutr (G),
In this paper, we are interested in finding the chromatic number of the tree graph
TG,t . Let t ∈ {1, 2, . . . , ⌊ n2 ⌋ − 1}, where |V (G)| = n. Since the vertex set of any tree
1

subgraph of G with n − t vertices meets both sides of any (t + 1)-cut of G, we have
χ(TG,n−t) ≤ cutt+1 (G).
As a main result of this paper, we prove the next theorem.
Theorem 1. Let n and r be nonnegative integers and δ be a real number, where
5
6 < δ < 1 and r = o(n). If n is sufficiently large, then for any graph G with n
vertices and δ(G) ≥ δn we have
χ(TG,n−r ) = cutr+1 (G).
It should be mentioned that we actually prove a more general statement (Theorem 2)
which implies the previous theorem immediately. However, we need some technical
definitions to state this statement.

Motivation and Background

A graph G is called a labeled graph, if there exists a bijective map from the vertex set
of G to a set of labels of size |V (G)|. Two labeled graphs G and H are isomorphic,
if there is a bijective map between their vertex sets which preserves adjacency, nonadjacency, and labels. Also, for any subgraph H of G, the labels of the vertices of
H are inherited from G. For an unlabeled (resp. labeled) graph G and a nonempty
family F of unlabeled (resp. labeled) graphs, the general Kneser graph KG(G, F)
has all subgraphs of G isomorphic to some members of F as vertex set and two
vertices of KG(G, F) are adjacent if the corresponding subgraphs are edge-disjoint.
It is known that for any graph G there are many general Kneser graphs isomorphic
to G, see [1, 2]. In [6], it was shown that if the complement of G is a connected
graph, then there is a labeled tree T and a family T of subtrees T such that G
and KG(T, T ) are isomorphic. Also, it is known that if T3 is a labeled tree with
maximum degree at most 3 and T is a family of subtrees of T3 , then the graph
KG(T, T ) is isomorphic to the complement of a chordal graph, and moreover, the
complement of any choral graph has such a representation, see [6]. For more about
general Kneser graphs, see [1, 2, 3].
Hereafter, unless otherwise stated, we only consider unlabeled graphs. Several
well-known families of graphs can be represented by some general Kneser graphs
of unlabeled graphs. For instance, the general Kneser graphs KG(nK2 , kK2 ) ∼
=
KG(K1,n , K1,k ), KG(Cn , kK2 ), and KG(Cn , Pd ), are isomorphic to the Kneser graph
KG(n, k), the Schrijver graph SG(n, k) and the circular complete graph K nd , respectively, where Pd is a path of length d.
In this paper, we investigate the chromatic number KG(G, Tt ) ∼
= TG,t , where
the family Tt consists of all tree subgraphs of G with t vertices. This problem is
motivated by the problem of finding the clique number of spanning tree graphs, i.e.,
the maximum number of edge-disjoint spanning tree subgraphs of a graph. The later
problem has been studied in the literature, see [8, 11]. It was shown [8] that the
maximum number of edge-disjoint spanning tree graphs of a graph G is bounded
⌋. It is simple to see that the maximum number of edge-disjoint
below by ⌊ cut1 (G)−1

spanning tree graphs of G is bounded above by the size of the minimum cut of G.
In this paper, we show that the chromatic of the spanning tree graph of a dense
graph G with a large number of vertices is equal to the size of the minimum cut (the
minimum degree) of the graph G.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 3 is concerned with some notation
that will be used later. In particular, we introduce the concept of alternating Turán
number. Section 4 is devoted to the chromatic number of tree graphs.

Alternating Turán Number

Let G be a graph, H be a subgraph of G, and G = {G1 , . . . , Gk } be a family
of nonempty subgraphs of G. The subgraph H is called a G-subgraph, if for any
1 ≤ i ≤ k, E(H) ∩ E(Gi ) 6= ∅. In this regard, by a G-forest (G-tree), we mean
a forest (resp. tree) which is also a G-subgraph. Also, throughout the paper, we
write G \ H and G − H for the subgraphs of G obtained by removing the edges and
the vertices of H, respectively. For any family of graphs F, the generalized Turán
number ex(G, G, F) is the maximum number of edges of a spanning subgraph of G
such that it has no G-subgraph isomorphic to some member of F. For a graph G
and a linear ordering σ : e1 < e2 < · · · < e|E(G)| of E(G), an alternating 2-coloring of
E(G) with respect to the ordering σ is a mapping which assigns alternatively (with
respect to σ) two colors red and blue to a subset of E(G). For an edge e ∈ E(G), if
the red (resp. blue) color is assigned to e, then this edge is called a red edge (resp.
blue edge) and if no color is assigned to e, then it is called a neutral edge. Note that
in an alternating 2-coloring of E(G), any two consecutive colored edges (with respect
to the ordering σ) have different colors. Moreover, the red subgraph GR (resp. blue
subgraph GB ) is a spanning subgraph of G whose edge set is the set of all red (resp.
blue) edges of G. The length of an alternating 2-coloring of E(G) is the number of
colored edges, i.e., |E(GR )| + |E(GB )|. For a subgraph H of G, the set of neutral
edges of E(H) is denoted by NEU(H). Moreover, the set of neutral edges of E(H)
incident with a vertex v of H is denoted by NEU(v, H). Define exalt (G, G, F, σ) to
be the maximum length of an alternating 2-coloring h of E(G) with respect to the
ordering σ such that it has no monochromatic (red or blue) G-subgraph isomorphic
to a member of F, or equivalently, each of GR and GB has no G-subgraph isomorphic
to a member of F. Define the generalized alternating Turán number exalt (G, G, F)
as follows
exalt (G, G, F) = min {exalt (G, G, F, σ) : σ is an ordering of E(G)} .
σ

In view of definition of generalized Turán number and generalized alternating Turán
number, one can check that
ex(G, G, F) ≤ exalt (G, G, F) ≤ 2ex(G, G, F).

(1)

The general Kneser graph KG(G, G, F) has all G-subgraphs of G isomorphic to some
members of F as vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding Gsubgraphs are edge-disjoint. Note that KG(G, G, F) is a subgraph of KG(G, F) and
if G = {G}, then two graphs KG(G, G, F) and KG(G, F) are isomorphic. In [2],
3

several examples presented to show that equality holds in both of inequalities in (1).
One can see that the chromatic number of KG(G, G, F) is bounded above by |E(G)|−
ex(G, G, F). To see this, consider a subgraph H of G with ex(G, G, F) edges such that
it has no G-subgraph isomorphic to any member of F. Assume that E(G) \ E(H) =
{e1 , . . . , et }. For any vertex of KG(G, G, F), which is a G-subgraph of G, consider
the minimum number i such that ei is an edge of this G-subgraph. Assign i as a
color to this vertex. One can see that it is a proper coloring for KG(G, G, F). On
the other hand, it is proved that the chromatic number of KG(G, G, F) is bounded
below by |E(G)| − exalt (G, G, F) [1, 2].
Lemma A. [1, 2] Assume that G is a graph and G = {G1 , . . . , Gk } is a family of
subgraphs of G. For any family F of graphs, we have
|E(G)| − exalt (G, G, F) ≤ χ(KG(G, G, F)) ≤ |E(G)| − ex(G, G, F).
It should be mentioned that the lower bound presented in Lemma A was originally proved in [1], where it was stated in different terms. However, it was restated
in terms of alternating Turán numbers in [2].

Tree Graphs

Let G be a graph and Tt be the family of all tree subgraphs of G with t vertices.
In this section, we investigate the chromatic number of the tree graph KG(G, Tt )
provided that G is dense graph with sufficiently large number of vertices. In [8],
it was shown the clique number of the spanning tree graph KG(G, Tn ) is bounded
⌋, where cut1 (G) is the size of the minimum cut of the graph
below by ⌊ cut1 (G)−1

G. We show that if n is sufficiently large, then for any dense graph G with n
vertices, the chromatic number of the tree graph KG(G, Tn ) is equal to the size of
the minimum cut of G. Note that, in general, equality does not hold. For instance,
χ(KG(K3 , T3 )) = 1 and χ(KG(K4 , T4 )) = 2.
For two graphs G and H, an H-packing of G is a set {H1 , . . . , Ht } of pairwise
edge-disjoint subgraphs of G such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ t, the graph Hi is isomorphic to H. Moreover, if the edge sets of the Hi ’s partition the edge set of G,
then it is termed an H-decomposition. The H-packing number of G is the maximum cardinality of an H-packing of G. An H-packing (resp. H-decomposition)
of G is called a monogamous H-packing (resp. monogamous H-decomposition), if
every pair of vertices of G appears in at most one copy of H in the packing (resp.
decomposition). In [9], it was shown that for positive even integers m and n, the
complete bipartite graph Km,n has a monogamous C4 -decomposition if and only if
(m, n) = (2, 2) or 6 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2n − 2. Note that if a graph G has a Kt -packing,
then it is a monogamous Kt -packing. The problem of finding as many as possible
vertex-disjoint complete subgraphs of specified order has been studied in several
articles. Hajnal and Szemerédi [4] proved the next theorem.
Theorem A. [4] Assume that G is a graph with n vertices. If δ(G) ≥ (1 − 1r )n,
then G contains ⌊ nr ⌋ vertex-disjoint copies of Kr .

Let G be a graph with n vertices and G = {G1 , . . . , Gk } be a family of pairwise
edge-disjoint subgraphs of G. For any integer 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, define the ith cut
number of G with respect to G, cuti (G, G), as follows
cuti (G, G) = |E(G)| − ex(G, G, Tn−i+1 ).
If G = {G}, then set cuti (G) = cuti (G, G). One can readily check that if 1 ≤ i ≤ ⌊ n2 ⌋,
then
cuti (G) = min {|E(S, V (G) \ S)| : S ⊆ V (G), |S| ≥ i, |V (G) \ S| ≥ i} .
Note that cut1 (G) is the size of the minimum cut of G.
Consider a connected graph G with n vertices. Also, let G = {G1 , G2 , . . . , Gk } be
a decomposition of G. Lemma A gives a lower and an upper bound for the chromatic
number of KG(G, G, Tt ) in terms of |E(G)|, ex(G, G, Tt ), and exalt (G, G, Tt ). One
can see that the upper bound is equal to cutn−t+1 (G, G) provided that t ≥ ⌈ n2 ⌉ + 1.
It would be of interest to find some sufficient conditions which make this upper
bound sharp. Next theorem, which is the main result of this paper, provides some
sufficient conditions for the equality of cutn−t+1 (G, G) and the chromatic number of
KG(G, G, Tt ).
Theorem 2. Let k, n, and r be positive integers and δ be a real number, where 56 <
√
δ < 1, k = o( n), and r = o(n). There is a constant integer N = N (k, δ, r) such that
for any graph G with n ≥ N vertices and any decomposition G = {G1 , G2 , . . . , Gk }
of G satisfying the following conditions

• Gk is a spanning subgraph of G with δ(Gk ) ≥ δn,

we have
χ(KG(G, G, Tn−r )) = cutr+1 (G, G).
The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of the previous theorem.
Definition 1. Let G be a graph and G = {G1 , G2 , . . . , Gk } be a decomposition
of G, where 1 ≤ |E(G1 )| ≤ |E(G2 )| ≤ · · · ≤ |E(Gk )|. For an ordering σ ∈ SE(G) ,
we say that G has (G, σ)-forest property if for any alternating 2-coloring of E(G) of
length at least |E(G)| − |E(G1 )| + 1 with respect to the ordering σ, the following
property holds. If GR (resp. GB ) is a connected spanning G-subgraph, then it has a
G-forest. Moreover, G has G-forest property if for any ordering σ ∈ SE(G) in which
the edges of each Gi are consecutive, i.e., σ = σ1 ||σ2 || · · · ||σk and σi ∈ SE(Gji ) is an
ordering of the edge set of Gji for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, G has (G, σ)-forest property.
♠
In what follows, we determine the chromatic number of some tree graph KG(G, G, Tt )
provided that the graph G has G-forest property. Hence, it would be of interest to
know when a graph satisfies this property.
Assume that G = {G1 , G2 , . . . , Gk } is a decomposition of a graph G. A cycle C
of G is termed a rainbow cycle, if for any 1 ≤ i ≤ k, |E(C) ∩ E(Gi )| ≤ 1.

then G has G-forest property.
Proof. Let σ ∈ SE(G) be a permutation such that the edges of each Gi are consecutive in σ. Also, consider an alternating 2-coloring of E(G) of the length at least
|E(G)| − |E(G1 )| + 1 with respect to the ordering σ. Without of loss of generality,
suppose that GR is a connected spanning G-subgraph. It is readily seen that the
assertion holds for k ≤ 2. Therefore, assume k ≥ 3.
Consider a spanning G-subgraph F of GR with k edges and the minimum number
of cycles. Note that some vertices of F might be isolated. We show that F is a
spanning forest with k edges. Since F has exactly k edges, for any 1 ≤ j ≤ k, we have
|E(F ) ∩ E(Gj )| = 1. Assume that for j = 1, 2, . . . , k, E(F ) ∩ E(Gj ) = {ej }. For a
contradiction, suppose that Ct is a rainbow cycle of length t of F . Also, suppose that
for any 1 ≤ j ≤ t, E(Ct ) ∩ E(Gij ) 6= ∅ where |E(Gi1 )| ≤ |E(Gi2 )| ≤ · · · ≤ |E(Git )|.
The number of neutral edges of G is at most |E(G1 )| − 1 ≤ |E(Gi1 )| − 1. Now we
show that if condition

condition (a) for the rainbow cycle Ct holds. Suppose that there are nj neutral
edges in E(Gij ), for j = 1, 2, . . . , t. In view of the ordering of σ, one can see that

is at most one. Consequently, there are at least

The graph FShas at most 2k − 3 non-isolated vertices, and therefore, there exists

e ∈ E(Gil ) and consider F ′ = (F − {eil }) ∪ {e}. One can see that F ′ is a G-subgraph
of GR with k edges and it has fewer cycles than F , which is impossible.

In the next lemma, we introduce a sufficient condition to extend a G-forest of a
connected graph G to a G-tree such that the number of vertices of G-tree is sufficiently
less than the number of vertices of G.
Lemma 3. Let k, n, and r be positive integers, where n ≥ k + r + 1. Assume
that G is a connected graph with m vertices, where n − r ≤ m ≤ n. Also, let
G = {G1 , G2 , . . . , Gk } be a family of pairwise edge-disjoint nonempty subgraphs of
+ (r + k − 1)(n − 1), then G has
G. If G has a G-forest and |E(G)| > k(3k−2)(n−2)
2
a G-tree with n − r vertices.
Proof. Consider a spanning G-forest F . Note that some vertices might be isolated.
Since G is connected, we can add some edges to F to obtain a spanning G-tree. Now
it is enough to show that G contains a G-tree T with at most n − r vertices. Note
that if we prove this, then we can extend T (if it is necessary) to a tree with exactly
n − r vertices, which implies the assertion. Consider all G-trees with the minimum
number of vertices. Among these G-trees, let T be a G-tree with the maximum
number of pendant vertices, i.e., the vertices of degree one. If |V (T )| ≤ n − r, then
there is nothing to prove. Therefore, we can assume that |V (T )| > n − r. Also, if T
has at least k + 1 pendant vertices, then there is a pendant vertex v such that T − v
is still a G-tree with fewer vertices, which contradicts the minimality of T . Hence,
T has at most k pendant vertices. It is known that for any tree T , the number of
pendant vertices is
X
2+
(degT (v) − 2).
{v∈V (T ): degT (v)≥3}

This implies that T has at most k − 2 vertices of degree more than 2 and the
maximum degree of T is at most k. Assume that {v1 , v2 , . . . , vt } are the pendant
vertices of T where 2 ≤ t ≤ k. Set W = V (T ) \ {v1 , v2 , . . . , vt }. Since T has at
most k pendent vertices, for any vertex u ∈ W and any positive integer i, we have
|{v : dT (u, v) = i}| ≤ k, where dT (u, v) denotes the distance between u and v in T .
Therefore, there are at most k(3k−2) vertices v ∈ W such that 1 ≤ dT (u, v) ≤ 3k−2.
In view of the assumption and since |W | ≥ n − r − t + 1 ≥ n − r − k + 1, one
edges. Therefore, since
can check that the graph G[W ] has at least k(3k−2)(n−2)+1
2
|W | ≤ n − t ≤ n − 2, there is an edge e ∈ G[W ] such that the unique cycle C
7

in T ∪ {e} has the length at least 3k. Since T has at most k − 2 vertices whose
degrees are at least 3, there are at least k + 1 edges in C \ {e} such that the degree
of any vertex of these edges in the graph T ∪ {e} is 2, and also, these
S edges are not
incident with the edge e. Now, if there is an edge f ∈ E(G) \ ki=1 E(Gi ), then
we set T ′ = (T ∪ {e}) − {f }. Otherwise, there are two edges f and f ′ among the
aforementioned edges such that f, f ′ ∈ E(Gl ) for some l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}. Now set
T ′ = (T ∪ {e}) − {f }. One can see that T ′ is a G-tree with the same vertex set as T .
Also, the number of pendant vertices of T ′ is more than that of T , which contradicts
our assumption.

Assume that G is a graph and σ is an ordering of E(G), i.e. σ ∈ SE(G) . For a
vertex v ∈ V (G), a path uvw is celled a (σ, v)-consecutive path if the edges uv and
vw are consecutive in the ordering σ. In any alternating 2-coloring of the edges of
G with respect to the ordering σ, we do not assign the same color to the edges of
any (σ, v)-consecutive path. This implies the next lemma.
Lemma 4. Let G be a graph, v be a vertex of G, and σ be an ordering of the edges of
G. Consider an alternating 2-coloring of the edges of G with respect to the ordering
σ and let EvR be a subset of E(G) such that any red edge incident with v is a member
of EvR . If there are t1 edge-disjoint (σ, v)-consecutive paths such that the number of
these (σ, v)-consecutive paths which have nonempty intersection with EvR is at most
t2 , then there are at least t1 − t2 neutral edges incident with v in E(G) \ EvR .
Suppose that G is a subgraph of an Eulerian graph H. An ordering σ of E(G) is
induced by an Eulerian tour of H, if the edges of G are ordered corresponding to
their ordering in the Eulerian tour of H, i.e., if we traverse the edge e before the
edge e′ in the Eulerian tour of H, then in the ordering σ we have e < e′ .
Lemma 5. Let H be an Eulerian graph and G be a subgraph of H. If σ is an ordering
of the edge set of G induced by an Eulerian tour of H, then in any alternation 2coloring of E(G) with respect to the ordering σ, the number of red (resp. blue) edges
incident with a vertex v of G is at most degH2(v)+2 .
Proof. We show that for each vertex v ∈ V (G), we have degGR (v) ≤ degH2(v)+2 ,
and similarly, the assertion holds for the blue spanning subgraph GB . In view
of the definition of alternating coloring, we do not assign the same color to the
edges of any (σ, v)-consecutive path. One can check that in the ordering σ, the
H (v)−2
. Note that if
number of (σ, v)-consecutive paths in G is at least 2degG (v)−deg
2
the vertex v is not the beginning vertex of the Eulerian tour, then this number is at
H (v)−2
H (v)
. This implies that there are at least 2degG (v)−deg
edges
least 2degG (v)−deg
2
2
incident with v which are not red. Hence, the number of red edges incident with the
vertex v is at most degH2(v)+2 .

Now we are in a position to prove the main lemma.
Lemma 6. Let k, n, and r be positive integers and δ be a real number, where 65 < δ <
√
1, k = o( n), and r = o(n). There is a constant integer N = N (k, δ, r) such that
for any n ≥ N we have the following. Assume that G is a graph with n ≥ N vertices
8

and G = {G1 , G2 , . . . , Gk } is a decomposition of G, where |E(Gk )| ≥ |E(Gk−1 )| ≥
· · · ≥ |E(G1 )| ≥ 1. If the following conditions hold
• G has G-forest property,
• Gk is a spanning subgraph of G with δ(Gk ) ≥ δn,
then
χ(KG(G, G, Tn−r )) = cutr+1 (G, G).
Proof. Assume that n ≥ N , where N = N (k, δ, r) is a constant and will be determined during the proof. Note that if there is some i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k − 1} such that
|E(Gi )| = 1, then we have χ(KG(G, G, Tn−r )) ≤ 1 and ex(G, G, Tn−r ) ≥ |E(G)| − 1.
Now it is easy to see that χ(KG(G, G, Tn−r )) = cutr+1 (G, G). Therefore, we can assume that for any i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k−1}, we have |E(Gi )| ≥ 2. In view of Lemma A, it is
enough to show that for large enough N , exalt (G, G, Tn−r ) ≤ |E(G)|−cut r+1 (G, G) =
ex(G, G, Tn−r ), which is equivalent to the following claim.
Main Claim: There is an ordering σ ∈ SE(G) such that for any alternating
2-coloring of E(G) of length ex(G, G, Tn−r ) + 1 with respect to the ordering σ, GR
or GB contains a G-tree with n − r vertices.
The proof will be divided into 5 steps as follows. In the first step, we introduce the ordering σ. In the second step, we consider an alternating 2-coloring for
the edge set of G of length ex(G, G, Tn−r , σ) + 1 with respect to the ordering σ.
Furthermore, we present some upper bounds for the r th cut number of G and the
maximum degrees of GR and GB . In the third step, we show that if GR or GB is not
a G-subgraph, then the main claim follows. In the fourth step, we claim that GR or
GB has a large connected component and we prove this claim by two cases. Finally,
in the last step, we show the largest connected component of GR or GB contains a
G-tree with n − r vertices, and consequently, the main claim holds.
Step I: An ordering for the edge set of G
For any i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k − 1}, if Gi has some odd degree vertices, then add a new
vertex zi to Gi and join it to all odd degree vertices in Gi . Otherwise, consider Gi
itself. Suppose that G1i , . . . , Gtii are the connected component of the resulting graph.
For any 1 ≤ j ≤ ti , consider an Eulerian tour for Gji and define σij to be an ordering
of E(Gji ) ∩ E(Gi ) such that these edges are ordered corresponding to their ordering
in the aforementioned Eulerian tour of Gji , i.e., if the edge ei is traversed before the
edge ej , then ei < ej . Define the ordering σi for the edge set of Gi as follows
σi = σi1 ||σi2 || · · · ||σiti .
Let V (Gk ) = V (G) = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn }. Here, we want to present an ordering for
+ 3k
the edges of Gk . Set l = ⌈ 26r+26
δ
2 ⌉ = o(n) and assume that n = 4a + b, where
a and b are positive integers and 1 ≤ b ≤ 4. Join 4 − b new vertices to the graph
Gk to obtain the graph G′k = Gk ∨ K4−b . Let F be a graph with exactly a + 1
connected components such that each connected component of F is isomorphic to
1
n,
the complete graph K4 . By Theorem A, the F -packing number of G′k is at least 36
9

and consequently, if N is large enough, then it is more than 4l + 2. Assume that the
set {F1 , F2 , . . . , F4l+3 } forms an F -packing of G′k . For any i = 1, 2, . . . , 4l + 3 and for
any connected component of Fi , which is a subgraph of G, choose a four cycle C4 of
this component. One can see that every vertex of Gk appears in at least 4l and at
most 4l + 3 of these C4 ’s. Clearly, these C4 ’s form a monogamous C4 -packing of Gk .
Call every C4 of this packing a 4-block. Construct a bipartite graph with the
vertex set W ∪ W ′ such that W consists of l copies of each vertex in V (G) and
W ′ consists of all 4-blocks. Join a vertex of v ∈ W to a vertex u ∈ W ′ , if the
corresponding vertex of v in V (G) is contained in the corresponding 4-block of u.
One can check that the degree of every vertex in the part W is at least 4l and also
the degree of every vertex in the part W ′ is exactly 4l. In view of Hall’s Theorem,
one can see that this bipartite graph has a matching, which saturates all vertices
of W . For any vertex vi ∈ V (G), set Ai to be the set of all 4-blocks assigned to
all copies of vi through the aforementioned matching. Note that |Ai | = l and since
4-blocks form a monogamous C4 -packing, the intersection of any two 4-blocks in Ai
is vi . For each i ∈ [n], set Hi to be a subgraph of Gk consisting of all 4-blocks in Ai .
One can see that H1 , H2 , . . . , Hn are pairwise edge-disjoint subgraphs of Gk and
for each i ∈ [n], vi ∈ V (Hi ). Also, every vertex of V (Hi ) \ {vi } has degree 2 in Hi .
In view of the aforementioned F -packing, one can check that the degree of every
vertex of Gk \∪ni=1 Hi is at least δn−8l −6. Now by a well-known result of Dirac, one
can check that for large enough N , the graph Gk \∪ni=1 Hi contains four edge-disjoint
Hamiltonian cycles Cn , Cn′ , Cn′′ and Cn′′′ . Without loss of generality, we can assume
that E(Cn ) = {vi vi+1 : 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} ∪ {v1 vn }. If Gk has no odd degree vertices,
then set M = ∅. Otherwise, consider a family M of vertex-disjoint paths in Cn′ such
that every odd degree vertex of Gk is an end point of these paths and also the end
points of these paths have odd degree in Gk .
By a result of Huu Hoi (see page 8 in [5]), there are at least

edge-disjoint triangles in Gk \ L.
Call each of these triangles a 3-block. Let G′′k be the graph obtained from Gk by
removing all edges in L and the aforementioned 3-blocks. Every vertex of G′′k has an
even degree, and therefore, every connected component of G′′k is an Eulerian graph.
Assume that Q1 , Q2 , . . . , Qs are connected components of G′′k .
We construct an Eulerian tour for Gk \ (M ∪ Cn′′ ∪ Cn′′′ ) by the following algorithm
and using it we present an ordering σk for the edge set of Gk . At the ith stage, where
1 ≤ i ≤ n, do the following steps
10

• Traverse an Eulerian tour of Hi started at vi .
• Traverse every 3-block containing vi which is still untraversed.
• If there is a j ∈ [s] such that vi ∈ Qj and the edge set of Qj is still untraversed,
then consider an Eulerian tour for Qj starting at vi and traverse it.
• Traverse the the edge vi vi+1 (the indices are taken modulo n).
• If i < n, then start the (i + 1)th stage.
Assume that E(Cn′′ ) = {f1 , f2 , . . . , fn } and E(Cn′′′ ) = {f1′ , f2′ , . . . , fn′ } such that
′ ) are incident
for each i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, two edges fi and fi+1 (resp. fi′ and fi+1
(the indices are taken modulo n). Construct an ordering π for the edge set of
the graph Gk \ (M ∪ Cn′′ ∪ Cn′′′ ) such that the edges of Gk \ (M ∪ Cn′′ ∪ Cn′′′ ) are
ordered corresponding to their ordering in the aforementioned Eulerian tour, i.e., if
we traverse the edge e before the edge e′ in the Eulerian tour, then in the ordering
π, we have e < e′ . Construct the ordering σk from π by putting the edges of M at
the end of the ordering π such that any two incident edges in M are consecutive.
Set
σ = σ1 ||σ2 || · · · ||σk ||f1 < f1′ < f2 < f2′ < . . . < fn < fn′ .
Step II: The r th cut number of G and the maximum degrees of GR and GB
Consider an alternating 2-coloring of edges of G with respect to the ordering σ of
length ex(G, G, Tn−r ) + 1. In view of the definition of ex(G, G, F), we have
ex(G, G, Tn−r ) ≥

k
X
j=1

|E(Gj )| − |E(G1 )| = |E(G)| − |E(G1 )|.

Also, in the aforementioned alternating 2-coloring of E(G), the number of neutral
edges is equal to
cutr+1 (G) − 1 = |E(G)| − ex(G, G, Tn−r ) − 1 ≤ |E(G1 )| − 1.
Also, one can check that
cutr+1 (G, G) ≤ min{|EG (S, V (G)\S)| : S ⊆ V (G), |S| ≥ r +1, |V (G)\S| ≥ r +1}.
Therefore,
cutr+1 (G, G) ≤ min({|E(G1 )|, (r + 1)(n − r − 1)}) = o(n2 ).
In view of the ordering σ and Lemma 5, one can check that for any vertex
v ∈ V (G), since Gk \ (M ∪ Cn′′ ∪ Cn′′′ ) is an Eulerian graph, the number of red (resp.
(deg

(v)−deg

(v)−4)+2

M

.
2
According to the ordering of the edges of M ∪ Cn′′ ∪ Cn′′′ in σ, all edges of Cn′′ ∪ Cn′′′
incident with v and at most one edge of M incident with v (if there is such an edge)
might be red (resp. blue). Consequently, since degM (v) ∈ {0, 1, 2},

max{degGR (v), degGB (v)} ≤

max{degGR (v), deg GB (v)} ≤

degG (v) + 3k + 4
.
2

(5)

Step III: Both of GR and GB are G-subgraphs.
In this step, we show that if GR or GB is not a G-subgraph, then the main claim
follows. First, assume that there exists an i0 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k} such that Gi0 has no blue
edge, i.e., GB is not a G-subgraph. Since there are at most |E(G1 )|−1 neutral edges,
hence, in view of the ordering of the edge set of Gi0 , there are exactly |E(Gi0 )| − 1
neutral edges in Gi0 and that |E(Gi0 )| = |E(G1 )|. In particular, Gi0 contains exactly
one red edge. This also implies that there is no neutral edges in E(G) \ E(Gi0 ).
Therefore, either Cn′′ or Cn′′′ has no blue edge. Without loss of generality, assume
that all edges of Cn′′ are red. Also, note that for any i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k} \ {i0 }, Gi has at
least two edges and in view of the ordering of its edges, Gi has at least a red edge.
For any i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}, let gi be a red edge in Gi . Now consider the red subgraph
Cn′′ ∪ {g1 , g2 , . . . , gk }. Clearly, this subgraph is a connected spanning subgraph of
GR , and consequently, GR is a connected spanning graph, which intersects all Gi ’s
for i = 1, 2, . . . , k. Since G has G-forest property, one can conclude that GR contains
a G-forest. Also, since the number of neutral edges is at most cutr+1 (G, G) − 1, one
can see that
B
min{|E(GR
k )|, |E(Gk )|} ≥

5

|E(Gk )| − cutr+1 (G, G)

Also, for large enough N ,

5 2 1
n − (r + 1)(n − r − 1) >
+ (r + k − 1)(n − 1).
24
2
2
Hence, in view of Lemma 3, GR contains a G-tree, which is a member of Tn−r . This
implies the main claim. Similarly, if there exists an i0 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k} such that
Gi0 has no red edge, then the main claim holds. Thus we can suppose that for
any i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}, both of colors appear in E(Gi ), i.e., both of GR and GB are
G-subgraphs.
Step IV (Claim): GR or GB has a connected component with at least n − r
vertices.
One the contrary, suppose that every connected component of GR and also GB has
at most n−r−1 vertices. Assume that ΩR (resp. ΩB ) is the largest connected component of GR (resp. GB ). In view of the assumption, we have max{|V (ΩR )|, |V (ΩB )|} ≤
n − r − 1. Therefore, in view of (6), the number of red and blue edges in Gk is O(n2 ),
12

√
i.e., |E(GR )| = O(n2 ) and |E(GB )| = O(n2 ). Since r = o( n), for large enough
N , we have min{|V (ΩR )|, |V (ΩB )|} ≥ r + 1. Let HR be the bipartite subgraph of
G with the vertex set (UR , VR ), where {UR , VR } = {V (ΩR ), V (G) \ V (ΩR )} and
|UR | ≤ |VR |. A vertex of UR is a neighbor of a vertex of VR , if they are neighbors
in G. Similarly, the bipartite subgraph HB of G has (UB , VB ) as vertex set, where
{UB , VB } = {V (ΩB ), V (G) \ V (ΩB )} and |UB | ≤ |VB |. Set α = |UR | and β = |UB |
and note that r + 1 ≤ α, β ≤ n2 . Consider the bipartite graph HR . Note that there
is no red edge in E(HR ) = EG (UR , VR ). Therefore, in view of (5),

Since there are cutr+1 (G) − 1 neutral edges in G and that cutr+1 (G) − 1 ≤

This implies that either r + 1 ≤ α ≤ δ or 2 n − o(n) ≤ α ≤ 2 provided that N

provided that N is large enough.
Case I: 2δ n − o(n) ≤ min{|V (Ωt )|, |V (G) \ V (Ωt )|} ≤ n2 ; t ∈ {R, B}

that
2δ − 1 2
|E(HR ) ∩ E(Gk )| ≥ α(δn − α + 1) ≥ α(δn − α) ≥ (

provided that N is large enough. Since, there is no red edges between two parts UR
and VR , and moreover, there are at most (n − r − 1)(r + 1) − 1 = o(n2 ) neutral edges

between them, one can conclude that there are at least ( 2δ−1

in E(HR ) ∩ E(GB

Call an edge of Gk an unusual edge, if it is either a neutral edge in Gk or a blue
edge of E(Gk ) \ E(HR ). Also, we call two 3-blocks consecutive, if the edge set of
these blocks appear consecutively in the ordering σ. In other words, there are no
other edges among them in the ordering σ. One can check that there exists at least
an unusual edge in any two consecutive 3-blocks of Gk . In view of (3), the ordering
σ, and the aforementioned discussion, one can check that the number of unusual
edges is at least

In view of the aforementioned discussion, we can assume r + 1 ≤ α, β ≤ 3(r+1)
δ
that for any vertex x ∈ UR ∩ UB , all edges in G and between x and the vertices of
V (G) \ (UR ∪ UB ) are neutral, i.e., each edge in EG (UR ∩ UB , V (G) \ (UR ∪ UB )) is
and N is sufficiently large,
neutral. One can readily check that if |UR ∩ UB | ≥ 2(r+1)

provided that N is large enough, which is impossible. Therefore, we can suppose
|UR ∩ UB | ≤ 2(r+1)

δ
chosen from a monogamous packing, one can check that the number of 4-blocks in
− 1.
Hi having some vertices of UR ∪ UB \ {vi } is at most |UR ∪ UB | − 1 ≤ 6(r+1)
δ
One can check that any 4-block in Hi which has no red edge incident with vi
contains at most one red edge. Suppose that there are γ consecutive 4-blocks of Hi
14

(with respect to the ordering σ) such that each of them has no vertex in UR ∪UB \{vi }.
Clearly, these blocks have no red edges incident with vi . Consequently, they have at
most γ red edges. Since the edges of these blocks are consecutive in σ, they contain
at most γ + 1 blue edges. This implies that there are at least 4γ − (2γ + 1) = 2γ − 1
neutral edges among the edges of these 4-blocks. Since the number of 4-blocks in
Hi containing some vertex of (UR ∪ UB ) \ {vi } is at most |UR ∪ UB | − 1, we have
|NEU(Hi − (UR ∪ UB \ {vi })| ≥ 2l − 3|UR ∪ UB | + 3.

EvRi = G[UR ∪ UB ] ∪ Hi ), one can see that the number of neutral edges incident with

which is a contradiction.
Therefore, the claim follows, i.e., GR or GB has a connected component P with
n − q vertices where 0 ≤ q ≤ r. Without loss of generality, suppose that P is such a
component in GR with n − q vertices.
Step V (Claim): P contains a G-tree with n − r vertices.
If q = 0, then P = GR is a G-subgraph. Also, the length of the alternating
2-coloring is at least |E(G)| − |E(G1 )| + 1. Now since G has G-forest property, GR
has a G-forest. Also, note that
|E(GR )| ≥

provided that N is large enough. Therefore, in view of Lemma 3, the graph GR has
a G-tree with n − r vertices, which implies the main claim.
Thus suppose q 6= 0. Now we show
 that for large enough N and for any i ∈
{1, 2, . . . , k}, |E(P ) ∩ E(Gi )| ≥ 2k−3

Since 1 ≤ q ≤ r = o(n) and k = o( n), for large enough N , the number of neutral
edges is more than |E(G
 i0 )| − 1, which is impossible. Hence, for any 1 ≤ i ≤ k,
|E(P ) ∩ E(Gi )| ≥ 2k−3

Suppose that F is a spanning G-subgraph of P with k edges and the minimum
number of cycles. In what follows, we show that F is a forest with k edges and
in view of Lemma 3, we extend it to a G-tree of P with n − r vertices. On the
contrary, suppose that F is not a forest. Let e bean edge of a cycle of F and that
e ∈ E(F ) ∩ E(Gj ). Since |E(P ) ∩ E(Gi )| ≥ 2k−3
+ 1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k, and also,
2
since F has at most 2k − 3 non-isolated vertices, there exists a red edge e′ ∈ E(Gj )
incident with some isolated vertex of F . Define F ′ = (F − e) ∪ {e′ }. Clearly, F ′ is
a G-subgraph of P with k edges. Also, the number of cycles of F ′ is less than that
of F , which is a contradiction.
In view of cutr+1 (G, G) ≤ (r + 1)(n − r − 1), one can see that for large enough
N , the number of edges of P is at least

Therefore, in view of Lemma 3, one can see that P has a G-tree subgraph with
n − r vertices. This implies the main claim, and consequently, exalt (G, G, Tn−r ) ≤
ex(G, G, Tn−r ). In view of Lemma A, the lemma follows.

We are now in a position to prove Theorem 2.
Completing the proof of Theorem 2. In view of Lemma 2, one can see that the
graph G has G-forest property. Now by Lemma 6, the assertion holds.

For an ordering σ of the edge set of G, a σ-tree of G is a tree subgraph of G such
σ,∆
that it has no two consecutive edges in the ordering σ. Define Tn−r
to be the set of
all σ-tree subgraphs of G with n − r vertices and maximum degree at most ∆. It is
worth noting that, in view of the proof of Lemma 6, we can determind the chromatic
σ, n + 3k+4

number of the graph KG(G, G, Tn−r2 2 ), where G and G meet the conditions of
the lemma and σ is the ordering introduced in the first step. Precisely,
σ, n + 3k+4
2

χ(KG(G, G, Tn−r2

)) = cutr+1 (G, G).

Note that any tree subgraph of GR or GB is a σ-tree subgraph, and moreover, in
view of (5), it has maximum degree at most n2 + 3k+4
2 .
By the aforementioned results, one can introduce some graph whose chromatic
number is about twice of its clique number. To see this, note that if n is sufficiently
large, then χ(KG(Kn , Tn )) = n − 1. Also, if n is an even integer, then the complete
graph Kn is decomposable into edge-disjoint Hamiltonian paths. Hence, the clique
number of KG(Kn , Tn ) is ⌊ n2 ⌋. It would be of interest to note that we cannot drop
some conditions in Lemma 6. For instance, one can see that Lemma 6 does not hold
for sparse graphs. To see this, consider the general Kneser graph KG(G, Tn ), where
G is a connected graph with n vertices and |E(G)| ≤ 2n − 3. One can check that the
chromatic number of this graph is equal to 1, while the size of the minimum cut of
G can be equal to 3. Finally, in [2], it was shown that for a large family of graphs,
we have
χ(KG(G, T3 )) < cutn−2 (G) = |E(G)| − ex(G, T3 ).
Hence, it seems that Lemma 6 does not hold for the family of small trees.
Hedetniemi’s conjecture asserts that the chromatic number of the Categorical
product of two graphs is the minimum of that of graphs. This conjecture has been
studied in the literature, see [3, 12, 13, 14]. A family of graphs is tight if Hedetniemi’s conjecture holds for any two graphs of this family. By Theorem 2 and in
view of the results of [3], we can enrich a family of tight graphs.
