We propose existence and multiplicity results for the system of Schrödinger equations
with sign-changing nonlinearities in bounded domains or in the whole space RN . In
the bounded domain we utilize the classical approach via the Nehari manifold, which is
(under our assumptions) a differentiable manifold of class C 1 and the Fountain theorem
by Bartsch. In the space RN we additionally need to assume the ZN -periodicity of
potentials and our proofs are based on the concentration-compactness lemma by Lions
and the Lusternik-Schnirelmann values.
Keywords: ground state, variational methods, system of Schrödinger equations, Nehari

(t, x) ∈ R × Ω.

The studying of the existence of standing waves for nonlinear Schrödinger equations arises in various
branches of mathematical physics and nonlinear topics (see eg. [13, 14, 17, 23, 26, 30] and references
therein). Recently many papers have been devoted to the study of standing waves of the Schrödinger
equation and of the system of Schrödinger equations (see eg. [2, 3, 6–11, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25,
29, 34] and references therein).
Recently, J. Peng, S. Chen and X. Tang ([28]) studied semiclassical states of a similar system


in RN ,


u, v ∈ H 1 (RN ),

where a, b, µ ∈ C(RN ) and ε > 0 is sufficiently small. J. M. do Ó and J. C. de Albuquerque
considered a similar system to (1.1) in R:
(
(−∆)1/2 u + V1 (x)u = f1 (u) + λ(x)v
in R,
1/2
(−∆) v + V2 (x)v = f2 (v) + λ(x)u
in R,
but with the square root of the Laplacian (−∆)1/2 and fi with exponential critical growth (see [12]).
Similar systems were also considered in [1, 20, 35], see also references therein.
Our aim is to provide existence and multiplicity results using classical techniques in the presence
of external, positive potentials and sign-changing nonlinearities. We show that under classical
assumption (V2) on λ and in the presence of nonlinearities like g(x, u) = |u|p−2 u − |u|q−2 u, where
2 < q < p < 2∗ classical techniques can be applied. We assume that
(F1) for i ∈ {1, 2}, fi ∈ C 1 (R) is such that
|fi′ (u)| ≤ c(1 + |u|p−2 ) for all u ∈ R,
where 2 < q < p < 2∗ :=

2N
N −2 ;

in particular the inequality

|fi (u)| ≤ c(1 + |u|p−1 ) for all u ∈ R,
also holds for some c > 0;
(F2) fi (u) = o(u) as u → 0;

is increasing on (−∞, 0) and on (0, ∞);

(F5) fi (−u) = −fi (u) for all u ∈ R.
Observe that in view of (F4) we can easily show that
0 ≤ qFi (u) ≤ fi (u)u
for any u ∈ R.
We impose the following conditions on potentials

for some 0 < δ < 1.

For Ω = RN we assume additionaly that
(V3) V1 , V2 , λ are ZN -periodic.
Observe that functions u 7→ f1 (u)−|u|q−2 u, u 7→ f2 (u)−|u|q−2 u don’t need to satisfy the AmbrosettiRabinowitz-type condition on the whole real line R, e.g. take f1 (u) = f2 (u) = |u|p−2 u. However
such a condition is satisfied for sufficiently large u, see Lemma 4.2.
We provide the following results in the case of bounded Ω.
Theorem 1.1. Assume that (F1)-(F5) and (V1)-(V2) hold, and Ω ⊂ RN is a bounded domain.
Then there exists a ground state solution (u0 , v0 ) of (1.1), i.e. a critical point (u0 , v0 ) of the energy
functional J being minimizer on the Nehari manifold
N = {(u, v) ∈ H01 (Ω) × H01 (Ω) \ {(0, 0)} : J ′ (u, v)(u, v) = 0},
where J is given by (2.1). Moreover u0 , v0 ≥ 0.
Theorem 1.2. Assume that (F1)-(F5) and (V1)-(V2) hold, and Ω ⊂ RN is a bounded domain.
Then there is a sequence of solutions (un , vn ) such that
J (un , vn ) → ∞

as n → ∞,

where J is given by (2.1).
We also obtain the following existence and multiplicity results in the case Ω = RN .
Theorem 1.3. Assume that (F1)-(F4) and (V1)-(V3) hold, and Ω = RN . Then there exists a
ground state solution (u0 , v0 ) of (1.1), i.e. a critical point (u0 , v0 ) of the energy functional J being
minimizer on the Nehari manifold
N = {(u, v) ∈ H 1 (RN ) × H 1 (RN ) \ {(0, 0)} : J ′ (u, v)(u, v) = 0},
where J is given by (2.1). Moreover u, v ∈ C(RN ) and there are constants C, α > 0 such that
|u(x)| + |v(x)| ≤ Ce−α|x| .
Theorem 1.4. Assume that (F1)-(F5) and (V1)-(V3) hold, and Ω = RN . Then there are infinitely
many pairs (±u, ±v) of solutions which are geometrically distinct.
We recall that solutions (u1 , v1 ), (u2 , v2 ) ∈ H 1 (RN )×H 1 (RN ) are geometrically distinct if O(u1 , v1 )∩
O(u2 , v2 ) = ∅, where
O(u, v) := {(u(· − z), v(· − z)) : z ∈ ZN }
is the orbit of (u, v) ∈ H 1 (RN ) × H 1 (RN ) under the action of (ZN , +). Obviously, in view of (V3),
if (u, v) is a solution then the whole orbit O(u, v) consists of solutions.

Our paper is organized as follows. The second section contains used notations and some preliminary
facts about nonlinearities, potentials and properties of the Nehari manifold. Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6
contain proofs of main results - Theorems 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 respectively.

It is classical to check that J ∈ C 1 (E) and critical points of J are weak solutions of (1.1). Let
N := {(u, v) ∈ E \ {(0, 0)} : J ′ (u, v)(u, v) = 0}.
Lemma 2.1. For s 6= 0 there holds
fi′ (s)s2 − fi (s)s > (q − 2)fi (s)s,
Proof. Let ϕi (s) :=

fi (s)

i ∈ {1, 2}.

for s > 0 and in view of (F4) we have

Hence
fi′ (s)sq−1 − (q − 1)fi (s)sq−2 > 0
for s > 0. So
fi′ (s)s2 − fi (s)s − (q − 2)fi (s)s > 0
and the conclusion follows for s > 0. Suppose now that s < 0. Then −s > 0 and
fi′ (−s)(−s)2 − fi (−s)(−s) − (q − 2)fi (−s)(−s) > 0
which implies that
fi′ (s)s2 − fi (s)s − (q − 2)fi (s)s > 0,
since (F5) holds.

Lemma 2.6. Suppose that (u0 , v0 ) ∈ N is a critical point of J 

N



: N → R. Then J ′ (u0 , v0 ) = 0.

Proof. Let

ξ(u, v) := J ′ (u, v)(u, v).


Since (u0 , v0 ) ∈ N is a critical point of J  there exists a Lagrange multiplier µ ∈ R such that
N

J ′ (u0 , v0 ) − µξ ′ (u0 , v0 ) = 0.

Thus
0 = J ′ (u0 , v0 )(u0 , v0 ) = µξ ′ (u0 , v0 )(u0 , v0 ).
Taking into account that ξ ′ (u0 , v0 )(u0 , v0 ) < 0 (see the proof of Lemma 2.3) we get µ = 0 and
J ′ (u0 , v0 ) = µξ ′ (u0 , v0 ) = 0.

Lemma 2.7. For every (u, v) ∈ E \ {(0, 0)} there is a unique t > 0 such that
(tu, tv) ∈ N
and J (tu, tv) = maxs≥0 J (su, sv).
Proof. Take any (u, v) ∈ E \ {(0, 0)} and consider the function
ϕ(t) := J (tu, tv)

In view of (F3) we have ϕ(t) → −∞ as t → ∞. Using Lemma 2.4 and (2.3) we gets
ϕ(t) ≥ Ct2
for sufficiently small t > 0. Hence there is a maximum point tmax of t 7→ J (tu, tv) in the interval
(0, ∞). While ϕ is of C 1 -class for such tmax we have
0 = ϕ′ (tmax ) = J ′ (tmax u, tmax v)(u, v).
Hence (tmax u, tmax v) ∈ N . In order to show the uniquencess it is enough to show that for any
(u, v) ∈ N the point t = 1 is the unique maximum of ϕ. For (u, v) ∈ N and t > 0 we compute

it follows that J is coercive, i.e. {(un , vn )}n≥1 ⊂ N and k(un , vn )k → ∞ imply that
J (un , vn ) → ∞.
Remark 2.10. In view of the coercivity of J on N , any sequence {(un , vn )}n≥1 ⊂ N such that
J (un , vn ) → c is bounded in E.

3 Existence of a ground state in a bounded domain
By Ekeland’s variational principle there
is a Palais-Smale sequence on N , i.e. a sequence {(un , vn )}n≥1 ⊂
  ′

(un , vn ) → 0. Taking (|un |, |vn |) instead of (un , vn ) we may
N such that J (un , vn ) → c and J 
N
assume that un ≥ 0 and vn ≥ 0. In view of Remark 2.10 the sequence {(un , vn )}n≥1 ⊂ N is bounded
in E.
  ′

Arguing as in Lemma 2.6 we see that J 
(un , vn ) → 0 implies also J ′ (un , vn ) → 0. Hence
N
{(un , vn )}n≥1 is a bounded Palais-Smale sequence for the free functional J . Moreover J satisfies the
Palais-Smale condition (see eg. [33, Lemma 2.17]) and {(un , vn )}n≥1 has a convergent subsequence,
i.e. (up to a subsequence)
(un , vn ) → (u0 , v0 ) in E.
Hence J (un , vn ) → J (u0 , v0 ) and therefore J (u0 , v0 ) = c. Thus (u0 , v0 ) is a ground state solution
and obviously u0 , v0 ≥ 0.

4 Multiplicity result in a bounded domain
We will use the following Fountain Theorem provided by T. Bartsch.
Theorem 4.1 ([4], [33, Theorem 3.6]). Suppose that X is a Banach space, J ∈ C 1 (X) and G is a
compact group. Moreover, assume that for any k ∈ N there are ρk > rk > 0 such that
(B1) G acts isometrically on
X=

Then there exists an unbounded sequence of critical points of J .

for |u| ≥ R.
Proof. In view of (F3) we have Fi (u) > 1q |u|q for sufficiently large |u| ≥ R. Hence the inequality
follows by (1.2).
Let (ej ) be an orthonormal basis of E = H01 (Ω) × H01 (Ω), G = Z2 := Z/2Z and Xj := Rej . On E
we consider the antipodal action of G. In view of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem the condition (B1) is
satisfied. From Lemma 4.2, (F3) and (1.2) there is C > 0 such that

Since on finite dimensional space Yk all norms are equivalent, we get

Hence the condition (B2) is satisfied for ρk > 0 large enough. From (F1) there is C̃ > 0 such that

there is (uk , vk ) ∈ Zk such that k(uk , vk )k = 1 and |uk |p + |vk |p > β2k . In view of the definition

9

of Zk we have (uk , vk ) ⇀ (0, 0) in H01 (Ω) × H01 (Ω). In view of Sobolev embeddings we obtain
|uk |p + |vk |p → 0 and therefore βk → 0 and (B3) is proved. It is classical to check that (B4) is
satisfied, see e.g. [33, Lemma 2.17].
Hence, in view of Theorem 4.1 and coercivity of J on N there exists a sequence of solutions (un , vn )

By Ekeland’s variational principle thereis a Palais-Smale sequence on N , i.e. a sequence {(un , vn )}n≥1 ⊂


 ′
(un , vn ) → 0. In view of Remark 2.10 the sequence
N such that J (un , vn ) → c and J 
N
{(un , vn )}n≥1 ⊂ N is bounded in E. Passing to a subsequence we may assume that
(un , vn ) ⇀ (u0 , v0 ) in E,
(un , vn ) → (u0 , v0 ) in Ltloc (RN ) × Ltloc (RN ) for every 2 ≤ t < 2∗ ,
(un (x), vn (x)) → (u0 (x), v0 (x))

for a.e. x ∈ Ω.

Take any (ϕ, ψ) ∈ C0∞ (RN ) × C0∞ (RN ) and see that

Let K ⊂ RN be a compact set containing supports of ϕ and ψ. Then

and therefore J 
N
is a critical point of J . If (u0 , v0 ) 6= (0, 0) we are done. Hence assume that (u0 , v0 ) = (0, 0). We
will use the following concentration-compactness result due to P.-L. Lions.
Lemma 5.1 ([33, Lemma 1.21]). Let r > 0 and 2 ≤ s < 2∗ . If {wn } is bounded in H 1 (RN ) and if
Z
|wn |s dx → 0 as n → ∞,

then wn → 0 in Lt (RN ) for 2 < t < 2∗ .

In view of Lemma 5.1 we get un → 0 and vn → 0 in Lt (RN ) for all t ∈ (2, 2∗ ). Then

Similarly

RN

f2 (vn )vn dx → 0

and therefore k(un , vn )k → 0 - a contradiction with Lemma 2.5. Hence (5.2) cannot hold. Hence
there is a sequence (zn ) ⊂ ZN such that
Z
lim inf
|un |2 + |vn |2 dx > 0.
(5.3)
√
n→∞

B(zn ,1+ N )

It is classical to check that that |zn | → ∞. Moreover (un (· − zn ), vn (· − zn )) ⇀ (ũ, ṽ) in H and in
view of (5.3) we have (ũ, ṽ) 6= (0, 0). Define ũn := un (· − zn ) and ṽn := vn (· − zn ). Then similarly
as before
J ′ (ũn , ṽn )(ϕ, ψ) → J ′ (ũ, ṽ)(ϕ, ψ)

for all (ϕ, ψ) ∈ C0∞ (RN ) × C0∞ (RN ).

11

In view of ZN -periodicity of V1 , V2 and λ we also have
J ′ (ũn , ṽn )(ϕ, ψ) → 0 for all (ϕ, ψ) ∈ C0∞ (RN ) × C0∞ (RN ).
and therefore, in view of Lemma 2.6, we obtain that (ũ, ṽ) is a nontrivial critical point of J , in
particular J (ũ, ṽ) ≥ c. In view of ZN -periodicity of V1 , V2 and λ we have J (un , vn ) = J (ũn , ṽn ) → c.
If
Z
|ũn − ũ|2 + |ṽn − ṽ|2 dx → 0
sup
y∈RN

B(y,1)

then in view of Lemma 5.1 we obtain ũn → ũ and ṽn → ṽ in Lt (RN ) for all t ∈ (2, 2∗ ) and, as
before, (ũn , ṽn ) → (ũ, ṽ) and (ũ, ṽ) is a ground state. Otherwise there are (z̃n ) ⊂ ZN such that
Z
|ũn − ũ|2 + |ṽn − ṽ|2 dx > 0
lim inf
√
n→∞

B(z̃n ,1+ N )

and similarly
(ūn , v̄n ) := (ũn (· − z̃n ), ṽn (· − z̃n )) ⇀ (ū, v̄) 6= (0, 0);

J ′ (ū, v̄) = 0.

Repeating this argument we obtain the following decomposition lemma (for more details see eg.
[6, Theorem 4.1]).
Lemma 5.2. There are ℓ ≥ 0, (znk ) ⊂ ZN and (w1k , w2k ) ∈ E, where k = 1, . . . , ℓ, such that
(i) (w1k , w2k ) 6= (0, 0) and J ′ (w1k , w2k ) = 0;

While we assumed that (u0 , v0 ) = (0, 0), from Lemma 5.2(iii) we get

J (w1k , w2k ) ≥ ℓc.

k=1

Hence c ≥ ℓc and therefore ℓ ∈ {0, 1}. While (u0 , v0 ) = 0 we cannot have ℓ = 0 and therefore ℓ = 1,
and (w11 , w21 ) is a ground state solution.
[27, Theorem 2] gives the continuity and exponential decay of the solution.

6 Multiplicity of solutions in RN
To show Theorem 1.4 we will adapt the argument from [32] to our context. Let τk denote the action
of (ZN , +) on E, i.e. τk (u, v) := (u(· − k), v(· − k)), where k ∈ ZN . It is easy to show that
τk N ⊂ N ,
i.e. N is invariant under τk . Similarly kτk (u, v)k = k(u, v)k and J (τk (u, v)) = J (u, v). Since J is
invariant, we know that ∇J is equivariant.

12

Fix any (u, v) ∈ E \ {(0, 0)}. Let
S := {(u, v) ∈ E : k(u, v)k = 1}.
Then there exists unique t(u,v) > 0 such that (t(u,v) u, t(u,v) v) ∈ N . Define
m:S→N
by the formula m(u, v) := (t(u,v) u, t(u,v) v). Obviously m is bijection and the inverse is given by
m

(u, v) =

.

Lemma 6.1. The function m : S → N is a local diffeomorphism of class C 1 .
Proof. Let ξ : E \ {(0, 0)} → R be given by
ξ(u, v) := J ′ (u, v)(u, v).
Fix (u, v) ∈ E \ {(0, 0)}. From the proof of Lemma 2.7 there is a unique t(u,v) such that

From the Implicit Function Theorem


ξ t(u,v) u, t(u,v) v = 0.

E ∋ (u, v) 7→ t(u,v) ∈ R \ {0}
is of C 1 -class and therefore
m̂ : E \ {(0, 0)} → N , m̂(u, v) = t(u,v) u, t(u,v) v

is of C -class. Clearly, the restriction m = m̂ is a local diffeomorphism.

S

Similarly as in [5, Lemma 5.6] we show that m : S → N , m−1 : N → S and ∇(J ◦ m) : S → E are
τk -equivariant.
Lemma 6.2. The function m−1 : N → S is Lipschitz continuous.
Proof. Fix (u, v), (ũ, ṽ) ∈ N . See that

Let
C := {(u, v) ∈ S : (J ◦ m)′ (u) = 0}.
Let F ⊂ C be a symmetric set such that for every orbit O(u, v) there is unique representative
v ∈ F. We want to show that F is infinite. Assume by contradiction that F is finite. Then we have
that (see [32])
κ := inf{k(u − ũ, v − ṽ)k : (u, v), (ũ, ṽ) ∈ C , (u, v) 6= (ũ, ṽ)} > 0.
Hence C is a discrete set.
Lemma 6.3. Let d ≥ c = inf N J . If (wn1 , zn1 ), (wn2 , zn2 ) ⊂ S are Palais-Smale sequences for J ◦ m
such that
(J ◦ m)(wni , zni ) ≤ d, i ∈ {1, 2},
then
k(wn1 − wn2 , zn1 − zn2 )k → 0
or
lim inf k(wn1 − wn2 , zn1 − zn2 )k ≥ ρ(d) > 0,
n→∞

where the constant ρ(d) > 0 depends only on d, but not on the particular choice of sequences.
Proof. Define (uin , vni ) := m(wni , zni ) for i ∈ {1, 2}. Then a similar reasoning to [32, Corollary 2.10]
shows that (uin , vni ) are Palais-Smale sequences for J and
J (uin , vni ) ≤ d,

i ∈ {1, 2}.

While J is coercive on N , the sequences are bounded and in view of the Sobolev embedding, they
are bounded also in L2 (RN ) × L2 (RN ), say
|u1n |2 + |vn1 |2 + |u2n |2 + |vn2 |2 ≤ M.
We will consider two cases.
Case 1. |u1n − u2n |p + |vn1 − vn2 |p → 0.

Since (u1n −u2n ) and (vn1 −vn2 ) are bounded in L2 (RN ) and 2 < q < p, it follows from the interpolation
inequality that there holds
|u1n − u2n |q + |vn1 − vn2 |q → 0.

for some ε > 0. In view of τk -invariance of N , J , J ◦m and τk -equivariance of ∇J , ∇(J ◦m), m and
m−1 we can assume that the sequence (yn ) ⊂ RN is bounded. We have that, up to a subsequence
(uin , vni ) ⇀ (ui , v i ) in E, i ∈ {1, 2}
and (u1n , vn1 ) 6= (u2n , vn2 ). Moreover J ′ (u1 , v 1 ) = J ′ (u2 , v 2 ) = 0 and

In view of [31, Lemma II.3.9] J ◦ m → R admits a pseudo-gradient vector field, i.e. there is a
Lipschitz continuous function H : S \ C → T S such that
H(w) ∈ Tw S,
kH(w)k < 2k∇(J ◦ m)(w)k,

hH(w), ∇(J ◦ m)(w)i > k∇(J ◦ m)(w)k2

(

dt (t, w) = −H(η(t, w)),
η(0, w) = w,
where T := {(t, w) : w ∈ S \ C , T − (w) < t < T + (w)}. T − (w) and T + (w) are the maximal
existence time in negative and positive direction of t 7→ η(t, w). Then we can repeat the arguments

16

from the proof of [32, Theorem 1.2] and [5, Theorem 1.2]. In fact we show that for any k ≥ 1 there
exists (wk , zk ) ∈ S such that
(J ◦ m)′ (wk , zk ) = 0 and

J (m(wk , zk )) = ck ,

where
ck := inf {d ∈ R : γ ({(w, z) ∈ S : J (m (w, z)) ≤ d}) ≥ k}
and γ denotes the Krasnoselskii genus for closed and symmetric sets. We refer to [31] for basic facts
about the Krasnoselskii genus and Lusternik-Schnirelmann values. Moreover ck < ck+1 and we have
a contradiction with the assumption that F is finite.
