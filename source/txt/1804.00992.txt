DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BINARY NECKLACES AND A
COMBINATORIAL METHOD FOR THEIR ENUMERATIONS
ROMEO MEŠTROVIĆ

Abstract. In this paper we investigate enumeration of some classes of ncharacter strings and binary necklaces. Recall that binary necklaces are necklaces in two colors with length n. We prove three results (Theorems 1, 1’ and 2)
concerning the numbers of three classes of j-character strings (closely related
to some classes of binary necklaces or Lyndon words). Using these results,
we deduce Moreau’s necklace-counting function for binary aperiodic necklaces
of length k [12] (Theorem 3), and we prove the binary case of MacMahon’s
formula from 1892 [9] (also called Witt’s formula) for the number of necklaces
(Theorem 4). Notice that we give proofs of Theorems 3 and 4 without use of
Burnside’s lemma and Pólya enumeration theorem. Namely, the methods used
in our proofs of auxiliary and main results presented in Sections 3 and 4 are
combinatorial in spirit and they are based on counting method and some facts
from elementary number theory.

1. Introduction
George Pólya (1887–1985) discovered a powerful general method for enumerating the number of orbits of a group on particular configurations. This method
became known as the Pólya Enumeration Theorem, or PET, whose proof follows directly from Burnside’s lemma. Pólya’s theorem can be used to enumerate
several objectst under permutation groups. In particular, it can be used for enumeration of different classes of necklaces and bracelets.
In combinatorics, a k-ary necklace of length n is an equivalence class of ncharacter string over an alphabet of size k, taking all rotations are equivalent.
It represents a structure with n circularty connected beads of up to k different
colors. A necklace of length n is primitive if its period is not a proper divisor of
n.
Technically, one may classify as an orbit of the action of the cyclic group of
n-character strings, and a bracelet as an orbit of the dihedral grooup’s action.

Namely, an (n, k) - bracelet is an equivalence classs of words of length n under
rotation and reflection. This enables appplication of Pólya enumeration theorem
of necklaces and bracelets. An (n, k) - necklace is an equivalence class of words of
length n over an alphabet of size k under rotation. For example, if k = 2 and the
alphabet is {0, 1}, then the following sets are examples of three binary necklaces
(i.e., those with k = 2):
{0101, 1010},
{011011, 110110, 1011101},
and
{0110101, 1101010, 1010101, 0101011, 1010110, 0101101, 1011010},
The basic enumeration problem is then (Necklace Enumeration): For a given n
and k, how many (n, k)-necklaces are there? Equivalently, we are asking how
many orbits the cyclic group Cn has on the set of all words of length n over an
alphabet of size k. We will denote this value by a(n, k). Notice that in a group G
of symmetry transformations such that only translations (ai → ai+s ) are allowed,
G is a cyclic group Cn . This case appears in [14] in connection with counting
necklaces made from n beads of k different kinds (translations merely rotate the
necklace). It also arises in problems of coding and genetics [6]. The special case
n = 12, k = 2 occurs in finding the number of distinct musical chords (of 0, 1,
· · · , or 12 notes) when inversions and transpositions to other keys are equivalences
(for related calculations see [4, Section 6]).
An aperiodic necklace of length n is an equivalence class of size n, i.e., no
distinct rotations of a necklace from such class are equal. According to Moreau’s
necklace-counting function (see [3, p. 503]; also see [14]), there are
1X

different k-ary aperiodic necklaces of length n, where µ is the Möbius function,
where µ(1) = 1, µ(n) = (−1)r if n is a product of r distinct primes, and µ(n) = 0
otherwise (see the sequence A001037 in [16] concerning the sequence {M2 (n)}∞
n=1
which presents the number of binary Lyndon words). The formula (1) is called
MacMahon’s formula in the book by Graham et al. [5, the formula (4.63), p.
141]. Notice that this formula may be derived by a simple direct argument given
in [6].
Each aperiodic necklace contains a single Lyndon word so that Lyndon words
form representatives of aperiodic necklaces. Recall that in mathematics, in the
areas of combinatorics and computer science, a Lyndon word is a nonempty string
that is strictly smaller than lexicographic order than all of its rotations. More
precisely, a k-ary Lyndon word of length n > 0 is an n-character string over an
alphabet of size k, and which is the unique minimum element in the lexicographical ordering of all its rotations. Being the singularly smallest rotation implies

that a Lyndon word differs from any of its non-trivial rotations, and is therefore
aperiodic (see [1]). For example (see [1]), the list of Lyndon words of length 6 on
the alphabet {0, 1} reads
000001, 000011, 000101, 000111, 001011, 001111, 001111, 010111, 011111.
Of course, the number of Lyndon words of length n on k symbols is equal to
Mk (n), where Mk (n) is given by (1).
Notice that the authors of the paper [1] investigate the historical roots of the
field of combinatorics of words. They comprise applications and interpretations
in algebra, geometry, and combinatorial enumeration. Combinatorics of words is
a comparatively new area of discrete mathematics. It is pointed out in [1] that the
collective volumes written under the pseudonym of Lothaire give an account of it
(Lothaire’s first volume [7] appeared in 1983 and was reprinted with corrections
in 1997 [8]).
It is also well known (see, e.g., [14, p. 162]) that the number of (n, k) - necklaces
is given by

Nk (n) =
ϕ(d)k n/d .

The formula (2) is called MacMahon’s formula in the book by Graham et al. [5,
the formula (4.63), p. 141], while in Lucas’ book [3, p. 503], it is credited to
M. le colonel Moreau (see the sequence A001031 in [16] concerning the sequence
{N2 (n)}∞
n=1 ) which presents the number of binary necklaces). A proof of (2) given
in [5, pp. 14-141] is based on a lemma presented by Pólya [13] (see also Lemma
in [14, p. 659]).
Let G be a finite group that acts on a set X. For each g ∈ G let X g denote the
set of elements in X that are fixed by g. Burnside’s lemma asserts the following
formula for the number of orbits, denoted |X/G|:
1 X g
|X/G| =
|X |.
(3)
|G| g∈G
Two elements of X belong to the same “orbit” when one can be reached from the
other by through the action of an element of G. For example, if X is the set of
colorings of a cube, and G is the set of rotations of the cube, then two elements
of X belong to the same orbit precisely when one is a rotation of the other.
In this paper we focus our attention to the investigation of enumerations of
some classes of n-character strings and binary necklaces, i.e., for new deductions
of expressions for numbers of some binary type necklaces. As noticed above,
binary necklaces are necklaces in two colors with length n. Observe that the
authors of the paper [2] exhibit a correspondence between the binary cycles on
length n and the lexicographic composition of the integer n. Furthermore, in [2]
the authors give an algorithm for generating all necklaces of a specific density.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the main results
and related notions necessary for their formulations and proofs. Section 3 is
devoted to the auxiliary results and related notions and notations. In Section
4 we prove Theorems 1, 1’ and 2 concerning the numbers of three classes of jcharacter strings (closely related to some classes of binary necklaces of Lyndon
words). Furthermore, by using these results, we give proofs (of Theorems 3 and
4) of the well known formulae for two classes of binary necklaces without use
of Burnside’s lemma and Pólya enumeration theorem (Burnside’s lemma is also
called Burnside’s counting theorem, the Cauchy-Frobenius lemma or the orbitcounting theorem).
Notice that the formula (15) of Theorem 3 is a special (binary) case of formula
(1) with k = 2. Similarly, the formula (16) of Theorem 4 is a special (binary)
case of formula (2) with k = 2. As applications, we obtain some interesting
congruences involving the sums of certain binomial coefficients and the function
µ(n) or ϕ(n) (Corollaries 1 and 2). In particular, we obtain two Lucas’ type
congruences (Corollaries 3 and 4; see, e.g., [10] and [11]). The all our main
results and their consequences are given in Section 2.
Methods used in all our proofs of auxiliary results presented in Section 3 are
very combinatorial in spirit and they involve the applications of elementary number theory. By using these auxiliary results, in Section 4 we give proofs of our
results (Theorems 1-4 and Corollaries 3 and 4).
2. The main results
Throughout this paper we suppose that k ≥ 2 and r ≥ 1 are fixed k ≥ 2 is
an arbitrary fixed integer and r ≥ 1 is an integer such that r ≤ k. Here, as
always in the sequel, we will denote by (n, m) the greatest common divisor of
positive integers n and m, and by |S| the cardinality of a finite set S. Usualy,
denote by µ(n) and ϕ(n) the Möbius function and the Euler totient function,
respectively. For any positive integers j ≥ 1 and i ≥ 1 with j ≤ i, denote by
A(j, i) the collection of all subsets of Ri := {0, 1, . . . , i − 1} that contain exactly j
elements. For given set Aj = {a1 , a2 , . . . , aj } ∈ A(j, i), denote by l = fi (Aj ) > 0
the smallest positive integer for which the set Aj is equal to the set Aj + l modulo
i, where Aj + l = {a1 + l, a2 + l, . . . , aj + l}. Since Aj is equal to Aj + i modulo
i, fi (Aj ) exists and fi (Aj ) ≤ i.
For an arbitrary positive integer s with 1 ≤ s ≤ i, denote by As (j, i) the
subset of A(j, i) consisting of those sets Aj ∈ A(j, i) for which fi (Aj ) = s.
Notice that the set As (j, i) may be considered as a class of binary necklaces with
length j whose properties are described above, i.e., for which fi (Aj ) = s. Then
R2 = {0, 1}, A(2, 3) = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 2}}}. Then assuming A2 = {0, 2}, we
have A2 +1 = {1, 0} modulo 3, A2 +2 = {2, 1} modulo 3 and A2 +3 = {0, 2} = A2
modulo 3, whence it follows that f3 (A2 ) = 3. If for example, i = j = 3 and

DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BINARY NECKLACES. . .

A3 = {0, 2, 4}, then since A3 + 1 = {1, 0, 2} and A3 + 2 = {2, 4, 0} = A3 modulo
3, we find that f3 (A3 ) = 2.
Our investigations are motivated by the following question:
Under what conditions on integers k, n, r, a1 , a2 , . . . , ar , the set Ar = {a1 , a2 , . . . , ar }
equals the set Ar + n = {a1 + n, a2 + n, . . . , ar + n} modulo k?
The answer to this question is given by Proposition 2 in Section 2. Namely, if
n = fk (Ar ), then by Proposition 1, n necessarily divides k, that is, k = nd, and
by Proposition 2, d divides r, i.e., r = md for a positive integer m. When this is
the case, by Proposition 2, the set Ar contains exactly m distinct representatives
modulo n. Further, assuming that a′1 , a′2 , . . . , a′m are these representatives modulo
n, then Ar has the form
Ar = {a′j + sn : 1 ≤ j ≤ m, 0 ≤ s ≤ d − 1}.

(4)

For given common divisor d of k and r, with k = nd and r = md, by Proposition
3, we have |An (m, n)| = |An (r, k)|. This result is the basic tool for determining
the cardinality |An (r, k)| (proof of Theorem 1 in Section 3).
Now we present our basic result whose proof will be given in Section 4.
THEOREM 1. Let Ar = {a1 , a2 , . . . , ar } ⊆ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1} be a set for which
n = fk (Ar ). Then n divides k and d = k/n is a positive integer that divides r,
that is, k = nd and r = md for a positive integer m. Furthermore, the class of
r-character strings An (r, k) consists of

elements, and the sum is taken over all positive divisors s of the greatest common
divisor (n, m) of n and m.

REMARK 1. Notice that the numbers |An (r, k)| are closely related to the sequence (triangular array read by rows) A185158 in [16], Namely, T (n, m) =
|An (r, k)| for all n, k = 1, 2, . . . (with k = nd and r = md), where by Comments
in [16], T (n, m) is the number of binary Lyndon words of length n containing m
ones (cf. the sequence/triangular array A051168 in [16]).
REMARK 2. It follows from Theorem 1 and Example 1 at the end of Section 3
that the collection An (r, k) is a nonempty set if and only if d = k/n is an integer
that divides r.
For a fixed positive integer n that divides k such that the integer d = k/n
divides r, the r-character strings that belong to An (r, k) can be separated into

6

disjoint classes as follows. We say that the r-character strings A and A′ in An (r, k)
are k-equivalent, writting A ∼k A′ , if there exists j ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1} such that
A + j is equal to A′ modulo k. It is easy to see that ∼k is an equivalence relation,
and that every coset (with respect to this relation) has exactly n elements. More
precisely, the coset A represented by a set A ∈ An (r, k) is equal to {A + j : j =
0, 1, . . . , n − 1} modulo k. Denote by Pn (r, k) the set of all these cosets. We say
that each element of Pn (r, k) is a (r, k)-period with length n. Thus by (5) and (6)
of Theorem 1, with k = nd and r = md, we obtain the following result.
THEOREM 1’. Suppose that k = nd and r = md for some positive integers n,
m and d. Then we have

S(r, k) given by (11) in Theorem 2 is the number of binary Lyndon words of length
k containing r ones.
Notice that the numbers |An (r, k)| are closely related to the sequence (triangular array read by rows) A185158 in [16], Namely, T (n, m) = |An (r, k)| for all

3. The Collections As (j, i) and Auxiliary Results
Let i be a fixed integer greater than 1, and consider an alphabet consisting of
the numbers 0, 1, . . . , i − 1. With this alphabet form all possible k-letter words
(a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ), where k is also fixed. There are evidently ik such words in all.
For our purposes, notice that the set Ri := {0, 1, . . . , i − 1} is a complete residue
system modulo i. For a finite subset A of N0 := {0, 1, 2, . . .}, denote by A(i) the
(unique) subset of Ri consisting of all l ∈ Ri for which there is a al ∈ A such that
al ≡ l (mod i). In other words, A(i) is a set of representatives modulo i (chosen
from the set Ri ) of all elements which belong to A. For given two finite subsets
A and B of N0 we say that A equals B modulo i if A(i) = B(i). In this case, we
shall often write A = B modulo i.
For any positive integers i ≥ 1 and j ≥ 1 with j ≤ i, denote by A(j, i) the
collection of all subsets of {0, 1, . . . , i − 1} that contain exactly j elements. Given
set Aj = {a1 , a2 , . . . , aj } ∈ A(j, i), and any positive integer t, put Aj + t =
{a1 + t, . . . , aj + t}. Denote by l = fi (Aj ) > 0 the smallest positive integer for
which Aj = Aj + l modulo i. Clearly, Aj = Aj + i modulo i, whence we see that
fi (Aj ) exists and fi (Aj ) ≤ i.
For an arbitrary positive integer s with 1 ≤ s ≤ i, denote by As (j, i) a subset of
A(j, i) consisting of those sets Aj in A(j, i) for which fi (Aj ) = s. It is of interest
here to consider the collections An (r, k) and An (m, n).
Recall that k ≥ 2 is any fixed integer and r ≥ 1 is an integer such that r ≤ k.
In this section we give necessary conditions on integers k, r, n, a1 , a2 , . . . , ar , to be
satisfied fk (Ar ) = n for given set Ar = {a1 , a2 , . . . , ar } ∈ A(r, k). To solve this
problem, we start with the following proposition.
PROPOSITION 1. For any set Ar = {a1 , a2 , . . . , ar } ⊆ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1}, the
integer n = fk (Ar ) divides k.

DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BINARY NECKLACES. . .

Proof. As noticed above, n = fk (Ar ) ≤ k. If we suppose that the integer
fk (Ar ) = n does not divide k, then k = q1 n + r1 with positive integers q1 and
r1 such that 0 < r1 ≤ n − 1, and hence
Ar = Ar + k = Ar + (q1 n + r1 ) = (Ar + q1 n) + r1 = Ar + r1

modulo k.

It follows that n = fk (Ar ) ≤ r1 < n. This contradiction shows that fk (Ar ) divides
n.

Let d be any divisor of k, and k = nd for an integer n ≥ 1. For a fixed integer
i such that 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, consider the set Ci defined as
Ci = {i, i + n, i + 2n, . . . , i + (d − 1)n}.

(19)

Then we have the following lemma.
LEMMA 1. Every set C i (k) (0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1) has exactly d elements. Moreover,
C i (k) = C j (k) if and only if i ≡ j (mod n). In the case when i 6≡ j (mod n),
C i (k) and C j (k) are disjoint sets.
Proof. First observe that the set C i (k) has d elements. Namely, if i + d1 n ≡
i + d2 n (mod k) for some d1 and d2 with 0 ≤ d1 < d2 ≤ d − 1, then (d2 − d1 )n ≡ 0
(mod dn). Thus (d2 − d1 ) ≡ 0 (mod d), and hence it must be d1 = d2 .
Suppose that C i (k) and C j (k) have at least one common element. In other
words, assume that i + d1 n ≡ j + d2 n (mod k) for some d1 and d2 with 0 ≤
d1 , d2 ≤ d − 1, or equivalently, i − j + (d1 − d2 )n ≡ 0 (mod dn). Therefore, we

obtain i ≡ j (mod n), whence it follows easily that C i (k) = C j (k).
Given set Ar = {a1 , a2 , . . . , ar } ⊆ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1}, put n = fk (Ar ). Then
by Proposition 1, the number d = k/n is an integer. Assume that the set Ar
contains m distinct representatives modulo n. Choose a maximal subset Bm =
{a′1 , a′2 , . . . , a′m } of Ar such that a′s 6≡ a′q (mod n) for any integers s and q with
1 ≤ s < q ≤ m. Then by Lemma 1,

or equivalently,
A′r := {a′i + jn : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1} ⊆ Ar .

(23)

On the other hand, for any ai ∈ Ar , there exists a′j with 1 ≤ j ≤ m, such that
n divides ai − a′j . Hence, in view of the fact that 0 ≤ ai − a′j ≤ k − 1, there is an
s with 0 ≤ s ≤ d − 1 such that ai − a′j = sn, i.e., ai = a′j + sn ∈ A′r . Therefore,
Ar ⊆ A′r , and hence, it must be Ar = A′r . It follows that r = |Ar | = |A′r | = md,
and we have
Ar = {a′i + jn : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}.
(24)
The above arguments together with Proposition 1 imply the following result.
PROPOSITION 2. For given set Ar = {a1 , a2 , . . . , ar } ⊆ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1} put
n = fk (Ar ). Then d = k/n is an integer that divides r, that is, r = md for a positive integer m. Moreover, the set Ar contains exactly m distinct representatives
modulo n. If we assume that a′1 , a′2 , . . . , a′m are these representatives modulo n,
then Ar has the form
Ar = {a′i + jn : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}.

(25)

REMARK 4. Clearly, Ar = Ar + n modulo k for every set Ar given by (25).
However, the converse of Proposition 2 is not true in the sense that generally,
given positive integers k, r, n, m and d such that k = nd and r = md, there are
sets Ar of the form (25) for which fk (Ar ) < n. To show this fact, put n = k = 4,
d = 1, m = r = 2, and consider the set A2 = {0, 2} ⊂ {0, 1, 2, 3}. Then
A2 + 2 = A2 modulo 4, and hence f4 (A2 ) = 2 < 4.
REMARK 5. If the integers k and r are relatively prime, using the same notations
as in Proposition 2, this proposition implies that d divides (k, r) = 1. Hence, it
must be d = 1 and k = n = fk (Ar ) for any
 set Ar = {a1 , a2 , . . . , ar } ∈ A(r, k).
k
It follows that |Ak (r, k)| = |A(r, k)| = r (cf. (5) and (6) of Theorem 1). This
means that each set Ar ∈ A(r, k) belongs to certain (r, k)-period with maximal
length k.
The following result has an important role in the proof of Theorem 1.
PROPOSITION 3. For an arbitrary common divisor d ≥ 1 of k and r, take k = nd
and r = md. Then the collections An (m, n) and An (r, k) have same cardinality,
and one bijection h between these collections is given as
Bm = {a1 , a2 , . . . , am } 7→ Ar = {ai + jn : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1},

(26)

where Bm is in An (m, n) and Ar is in An (r, k).
Proof. For a given set Bm = {a1 , a2 , . . . , am } ∈ An (m, n), it is easy to check
that all elements of its associated set Ar = {ai + jn : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}
are distinct modulo k. Therefore, |Ar | = md = r modulo k, and hence the above

DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BINARY NECKLACES. . .

11

map Bm 7→ Ar , denoted here as h, is a map into A(r, k). Furthermore, it is
routine to verify that the map h is injective.
It remains to show that the map h is onto An (r, k). Let Ar ∈ An (r, k) be
arbitrary. This means that n = fk (Ar ) > 0 is the smallest positive integer for
which Ar + n equals Ar modulo k. It follows from Proposition 2 that the set Ar
contains m distinct representatives modulo n; assume ai1 , ai2 , . . . , aim . Hence, by
(25) we get
Ar = {ail + jn : 1 ≤ l ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}.
(27)
Obviously, it is sufficient to show that there exists a set Bm ∈ An (m, n) such that
h(Bm ) = Ar . Define Bm = {ai1 , ai2 , . . . , aim }. Clearly, Bm is in A(m, n), and
hence it suffices to show that fn (Bm ) = n. Suppose that fn (Bm ) = n1 < n. Then
as in the proof of Proposition 1, we infer that n1 divides n, i.e., n = n1 d1 with
an integer d1 > 1. Since the set Bm + n1 equals Bm modulo n, by Proposition 2,
with n1 , m, n, d1 and Bm instead of n, r k, d and Ar , respectively, we conclude
that d1 divides m, i.e., m = m1 d1 with m1 ∈ N. Furthermore, by Proposition
2, the set Bm contains exactly m1 distinct representatives modulo n1 , assume for
example, ai1 , ai2 , . . . , aim1 . Then by (25) of Proposition 2, Bm has the form
Bm = {ais + tn1 : 1 ≤ s ≤ m1 , 0 ≤ t ≤ d1 − 1},

(28)

which by (27) implies that
Ar = {(ais + tn1 ) + jn : 1 ≤ s ≤ m1 , 0 ≤ t ≤ d1 − 1, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1},

(29)

whence by putting n = n1 d1 , we obtain
Ar = {ais + (t + jd1 )n1 : 1 ≤ s ≤ m1 , 0 ≤ t ≤ d1 − 1, 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1}.

(30)

Because of k = nd = n1 d1 d, it is easy by (30) to verify that the set Ar +n1 is equal
to the set Ar modulo k. This implies that fk (Ar ) ≤ n1 < n. This contradiction
with our assumption that fk (Ar ) = n shows that fn (Bm ) = n. This means that
Bm is in An (m, n), and since by (26), (27) and the definition of Bm , h(Bm ) = Ar ,
we conclude that h is a surjective map. This completes the proof.

EXAMPLE 1. We will show that An (r, k) is a nonempty set for each positive
integer n satisfying conditions of Proposition 2. More precisely, for any integers
n ≥ 1 and d ≥ 1, such that k = nd and r = md, we will construct some elements
of An (r, k). Since by (26) of Proposition 3 it is given an one-to-one correspondence
h between the families An (m, n) and An (r, k) = An (md, nd), it is sufficient to
consider the corresponding problem for the families An (m, n) with m ≤ n.
If (n, m) = 1, then according to Remark 5 (by replacing k and r with n
and m, respectively), we have An (m, n) = A(m, n). In other words, each set
n
Am = {a1 , a2 , . . . , am } ∈ A(m, n) is in An (m, n), and hence |An (m, n)| = m
.
Now we suppose that (n, m) > 1. First we observe that if the set Am is in
An (m, n), then it is easily seen that the set An−m = {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} \ Am is in

12

ROMEO MEŠTROVIĆ

An (n − m, n). Indeed, since Am + n is equal to Am modulo n, then
An−m + n = ({0, 1, . . . , n − 1} \ Am ) + n = {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} \ (Am + n)
= {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} \ Am = An−m modulo n.
(31)
Hence, fn (An−m ) ≤ n. If we suppose that fn (An−m ) = s < n, then as above
we obtain that Am + s is equal to Am modulo n. This contradiction with the fact
that Am is in An (m, n) implies that An−m is in An (n − m, n).
In view of the above natural correspondence between the families An (m, n) and
An (n − m, n), and the fact that (n, m) > 1, we may suppose that 2 ≤ m ≤ ⌊ n2 ⌋.
For such a m define
V = {v ∈ N : v ≤ 2m − 2, (v, n) > 1}.

(32)

Since v = m ≤ 2m − 2 and by the assumption, (n, m) > 1, it follows that V is a
nonempty set. Let u = max{v| v ∈ V } and
n
S = {s1 s2 : s1 ∈ N, s2 ∈ N, s1 < , s2 ≤ n, (s2 , n) = 1}.
(33)
u
We will prove that Bs = {s, 2s, . . . , ms} ∈ An (m, n) for each s ∈ S. In particular,
we have {1, 2, . . . , m} ∈ An (m, n). First show that Bs has exactly m different
elements modulo n. Assume that for a fixed s ∈ S, the integers l1 s and l2 s are
in Bs with 1 ≤ l1 − l2 ≤ m − 1 such that n | (l1 − l2 )s. We write s = s1 s2
with integers s1 and s2 as described by (33). Then since (s2 , n) = 1, it must be
n | (l1 − l2 )s1 . Now, since 1 ≤ s1 < nu < n, it follows that l1 − l2 = l3 s3 such that
(s3 , n) = 1 and (l3 , n) > 1. So n | l3 s1 , and because of l3 ≤ m − 1 and (l3 , n) > 1,
we have l3 ≤ u with u defined above. Thus 1 ≤ l3 s1 < u · nu = n, and therefore,
l3 s1 6≡ 0(mod n). This contradiction shows that |S| = m modulo n.
It remains to show that Bs is not equal to Bs + t modulo n for any integer t
with 1 ≤ t ≤ n−1. Indeed, if Bs = Bs +t modulo n for some t with 1 ≤ t ≤ n−1,
then there is an integer p with 1 ≤ p ≤ m−1 such that s+t = (p+1)s. Therefore,
Bs + t = {(p + 1)s, (p + 2)s, . . . , (p + m)s} modulo n, and hence we have
{s, 2s, . . . , ms} = {(p + 1)s, (p + 2)s, . . . , (p + m)s} modulo n.

(34)

Thus there is an integer q with p + 1 ≤ q ≤ p + m ≤ 2m − 1 such that n | qs − s.
It follows that n | (q − 1)s1 s2 , whence since (s2 , n) = 1, we have n | (q − 1)s1 .
Since s1 ≤ n − 1, it follows that (q − 1, n) > 1, i.e., q − 1 = q1 q2 for integers q1
and q2 with 1 ≤ q1 ≤ q − 1 ≤ 2m − 2 such that (q1 , n) > 1 and (q2 , n) = 1. This
yields that q1 ≤ u, and n | q1 s1 , which is impossible since 1 ≤ q1 s1 < u · nu = n.
This contradiction implies that Bs is in An (m, n) for each s ∈ S.
4. Proofs of Theorems 1–4 and Corollaries 3 and 4
We give here a combinatorial proof of Theorem 1 which is based on auxiliary
results obtained in Section 3 and on property of function τ (a, t) defined as follows.

DIFFERENT CLASSES OF BINARY NECKLACES. . .

DEFINITION 1. For any integers a > 1 and t ≥ 1, denote by τ (a, t) the number
of t-tuples (a1 , a2 , . . . , at ) of integers such that aj ≥ 2 for all j = 1, 2, . . . , t, and
a = a1 a2 · · · at . Obviously, τ (a, t) = 0 for all t ≥ a.
In the proof of Theorem 1, we use the following property of the function τ (a, t).
LEMMA 2. For each integer a > 1, we have

a−1
X

(−1)t τ (a, t) = µ(a),

(35)

t=1

where µ(a) is the Möbius function.
Proof. We derive the proof by induction on a ≥ 2. Since −τ (2, 1) = −1 = µ(2),
we see that (35) is true for a = 2. Suppose that a > 2 and that (35) is satisfied
for all integers less than a.
Obviously, there holds τ (a, 1) = 1 for all a > 1. Letting that the first coordinate
q = a1 of t-tuples (a1 , a2 , . . . , at ) of integers satisfying aj ≥ 2 for all j = 1, 2, . . . , t,
and a = a1 a2 · · · at , is taken over all divisors of a, by Definition 1 of τ (a, t), we

We are now ready to prove the main result.
Proof of Theorem 1. Note that the first assertion of Theorem 1 is contained in
Proposition 2. It remains to prove the equality (5).
Using the notations introduced in Section 3, if k = nd and r = md for an
integer d ≥ 1, then by Proposition 2 we have
|An (md, nd)| = |An (m, n)|.

(39)

If integers k and r are relatively prime, then it must be d = 1, r = m, and thus
n = k = fk (Ar ) for any set Ar = {a1 , a2 , . . . , ar } ⊂ {0, 1, 2, . . . , k − 1}. Therefore,

Now suppose that (k, r) > 1. To determine |An (r, k)|, where k = nd and
r = md with d ≥ 1, denote

An (m, n) = A(m, n) \ An (m, n).

Then since |A(m, n)| = m

Moreover, An (m, n) = 1≤s<n As (m, n), and by Proposition 2, As (m, n) is a
nonempty set if and only if s divides n and d1 = ns divides m. When this is the

Proof of Corollary 3. We proceed by induction on α ≥ 1. If α = 1, then since

Proof of Corollary 4. We deduce the proof by induction on σ = n + m ≥ 2.
If σ = 2, that is n = m = 1, (18) is obvious. Suppose that σ > 2 and that the
congruence (18) is satisfied for any n and m such that n + m < σ.
Assume that n′ and m′ be positive integers such that n′ + m′ = σ. If n′ and
m′ are relatively prime, then (18) is in fact (17) of Corollary 1 with n = n′ p,
m = m′ p and α = 1. Now suppose that (n′ , m′ ) = d > 1. If d = pα with α ≥ 1,
i.e., n′ = n′′ pα and m′ = m′′ pα with (n′′ , m′′ ) = 1, then (12) implies that
