Abstract
Let Tr(n, m, k) denote the largest number of distinct projections onto k coordinates guaranteed in any family of m binary vectors of length n. The classical Sauer-Perles-Shelah Lemma
implies that Tr(n, nr , k) = 2k for k ‚â§ r. While determining Tr(n, m, k) precisely for general k
and m seems hopeless, estimating it remains a widely open problem with connections to important questions in computer science and combinatorics. For example, an influential result of
Kahn-Kalai-Linial gives non-trivial bounds on Tr(n, m, k) for k = Œò(n) and m = Œò(2n ). Here
we prove that, for r, Œ±‚àí1 ‚â§ no(1) , it holds that Tr(n, nr , Œ±n) = n¬µ(1+o(1)) with
¬µ=

r + 1 ‚àí log(1 + Œ±)
.
2 ‚àí log(1 + Œ±)
o(1)

Thus, we (essentially) determine Tr(n, m, k) for k = Œò(n) and all m up to 2n .
For the proof we establish a ‚Äúsparse‚Äù version of another classical result, the Kruskal-Katona
Theorem, which gives a stronger guarantee when the hypergraph does not induce dense subhypergraphs. Furthermore, we prove that the parameters in our sparse Kruskal-Katona theorem
are essentially best possible. Finally, we mention two simple applications which may be of
independent interest.

Introduction

For a hypergraph (or a set system) F, the trace of F on a vertex subset I is defined as the set
of projections of the edges of F onto I, namely,
  FI = {e ‚à© I : e ‚àà F}. The shatter function,
or trace function, of F is Tr(F, k) = maxI FI  with I a set k vertices. The focus of this paper
is the following important extremal function; for integers n ‚â• k and 0 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 2n , let Tr(n, m, k)
denote the largest number of distinct projections onto k vertices guaranteed in any n-vertex m-edge
hypergraph:
 
Tr(n, m, k) = min Tr(F, k) = min max FI .
F ‚äÜ2[n]
|F |=m

F ‚äÜ2[n] I‚äÜ[n]
|F |=m |I|=k

There is a considerable number of results, in various areas of discrete mathematics, determining
or estimating this function for certain values of the parameters. The most famous result is arguably
the Sauer-Perles-Shelah Lemma ([16], [17], see also Vapnik and Chervonenkis [18] for a slightly
weaker estimate).

The VC-dimension of a hypergraph F is the largest k so that Tr(F, k) = 2k , i.e., it is the largest
number k so that F has a full projection on some k vertices. The VC-dimension is a basic combinatorial measure of the complexity of a hypergraph; understanding the shatter function beyond
the case of full projections is a very natural direction. Shatter functions and the VC-dimension are
extensively studied in combinatorial and computational geometry, as well as in machine learning
(see the survey of MatousÃåek [15] for several geometric and algorithmic applications of shatter functions, and the survey of Angulin [3] for the role VC-dimension is playing in computational learning
theory).
In [6], Bondy proved that Tr(n, n, n ‚àí 1) = n, and a remark in [1] and in [9] is that
Tr(n, m, 3) = 7 for m = 1 + n + [n2 /4] + 1,
and the same argument implies that determining the smallest m for which Tr(n, m, 4) = 15 is
equivalent to determining the maximum possible number of edges of a 3-uniform hypergraph on n
vertices with no complete hypergraph on 4 vertices‚Äîa well-known open problem of TuraÃÅn. Additional results that can all be formulated in terms of the function Tr(n, m, k) appear in [5], [12], [4],
[8] and more.
Recently, Bukh and Goaoc were able to estimate Tr(n, nO(1) , k) for constant values of k that
are not too small (and also improved an earlier lower bound of [8]). In the other extreme regime,
a classical paper of Kahn et al. [12] proves that for every 0 < Œ±, Œ≤ < 1,
Tr(n, Œ≤2n , Œ±n) ‚â• (1 ‚àí n‚àíc )2Œ±n ,
where c = c(Œ±, Œ≤) > 0 depends only on Œ±, Œ≤. Benny Chor conjectured in the 80s that one can in
fact make the error term exponentially rather than polynomially small in n. This conjecture was
recently disproved by Bourgain et al. [4]. In fact, Bourgain et al. prove several additional results,
in particular strengthening those of [12].
In [5], BollobaÃÅs and Radcliffe considered the case where m is polynomial and k is linear. For
the lower bound they were able to prove the following.
Theorem 1.2 (BollobaÃÅs and Radcliffe [5, Theorem 7]). For constants r ‚â• 2 and 0 < Œ± ‚â§ 1 it holds
that Tr(n, nr , Œ±n) ‚â• ‚Ñ¶(nŒªr ) with1

‚àö
Œª=
log(1 + Œ±)/H(log(1 + Œ±)) Œ± ‚àà (0, 2 ‚àí 1)
As for the upper bound, it would seem that among hypergraphs on n vertices with a given
number of edges m, a hypergraph F with Tr(F, k) = Tr(n, m, k) should be very symmetric, when
k is not too small or too large. A natural candidate for such an extremal hypergraph is thus the
hypergraph containing all edges up to the appropriate size. BollobaÃÅs and Radcliffe were able to
show that this is in fact not the case.

Our results

Our main result in this paper determines the value of Tr(n, nr , Œ±n), for constant r and Œ±, up to
logarithmic factors, thus closing the gap between the lower and upper bounds in Theorems 1.2
and 1.3. We henceforth use the following standard notation: for two functions f (n) and g(n), by
f = OÃÉ(g) we mean f = O(g logc (g)) for some absolute constant c > 0; f = ‚Ñ¶ÃÉ(g) and f = ŒòÃÉ(g) are
defined analogously. The main result of this paper is as follows.
Theorem 1.4 (Main result). Let r ‚â• 1, Œ± ‚àà (0, 1]. If r, Œ±‚àí1 ‚â§ no(1) then Tr(n, nr , Œ±n) = n¬µ(1‚àío(1))
where
r + 1 ‚àí log(1 + Œ±)
¬µ = ¬µ(r, Œ±) =
.
(1)
2 ‚àí log(1 + Œ±)
Moreover, if r = O(1), Œ±‚àí1 ‚â§ (log n)O(1) then Tr(n, nr , Œ±n) = ŒòÃÉ(n¬µ ).

It is perhaps instructive to consider one representative special case: r = 2, Œ± = 1/2. In this
case, the proofs in [5] bound Tr(n, n2 , n/2) as follows;
‚Ñ¶(n1.169925.. ) = ‚Ñ¶(n2 log2 3/2 ) ‚â§ Tr(n, n2 , n/2) ‚â§

n2 (log log n)O(1)
= o(n2 ),
log n

whereas Theorem 1.4 in particular implies that
Tr(n, n2 , n/2) = ŒòÃÉ(n1+1/(3‚àílog 2 3) ) = ŒòÃÉ(n1.706695.. ).
A new Kruskal-Katona-type theorem. As it turns out, our main result can be readily deduced
from a new version of the well-known Kruskal-Katona Theorem. Recall that the Kruskal-Katona
Theorem gives a lower bound on the number of i-sets contained within the edges of a uniform
hypergraph. Formally, for a hypergraph F and i ‚àà N we denote
 
 
	
F
= S  |S| = i and ‚àÉe ‚àà F : S ‚äÜ e .
i
The following classical version of the Kruskal-Katona Theorem was given by LovaÃÅsz [14]. Henceforth, for real y > 0 we use the standard notation
 
y
y(y ‚àí 1) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ (y ‚àí i + 1)

i

We use the abbreviation that F is a k-graph to mean that F is a k-uniform hypergraph.

Theorem 1.5 (Kruskal-Katona Theorem, LovaÃÅsz [14]). Let F be a k-graph. If |F| = ky with real
 

y > 0 then for every 0 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k we have  Fi  ‚â• yi .

Our new version of the Kruskal-Katona Theorem gives a stronger lower bound depending on
the sparsity of the hypergraph F. As is standard, we denote the sub-hypergraph of a hypergraph F
induced on a vertex subset I by F[I] = ( I, {e | e ‚àà F and e ‚äÜ I} ). We denote the largest number
of edges in an induced sub-hypergraph on i vertices by


span(F, i) := max F[I].

We next state our new version of the Kruskal-Katona Theorem. (See Theorem 2.7 for a slightly
stronger form.) For the parameters relevant to our applications here, it provides a significantly
stronger estimate than the classical theorem, using an appropriate sparseness assumption.
Theorem 1.6 (‚ÄúSparse Kruskal-Katona Theorem‚Äù). Let F be a k-graph with n vertices and |F| =
nr edges, r ‚â• 1. If

It is of course natural to ask whether the bound in Theorem 1.6 is essentially best possible. Our
third result in this paper proves that this is indeed the case.

Applications. We end the paper with two simple applications of our main result, in geometry
and in graph theory. We first describe the geometric application. Let H be a family of halfspaces2
in Rd , and let P be a set of points in Rd . We say that P separates H if for every pair of distinct
halfspaces H1 6= H2 ‚àà H there is a point in P that lies in one and outside the other.
Proposition 1.8. Let P ‚äÇ Rd be a set of n points and let H be a family of nr halfspaces in Rd ,
with 1 ‚â§ r ‚â§ nŒ¥ , such that P separates H. Then there exists a subset P ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ P of at most n1‚àíŒ¥
r+1
points and a subset H‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ H of at least n 2 (1‚àíO(Œ¥)) halfspaces such that P ‚Ä≤ separates H‚Ä≤ .
The graph-theoretic application shows that in any graph with not too many independent sets,
one can always find an induced subgraph on a vanishingly small number of vertices that nevertheless
retains significantly more than square root of the total number of independent sets.

Proposition 1.9. Let G = (V, E) be an n-vertex graph, and assume that the number of independent
sets in G is nr with 1 ‚â§ r ‚â§ nŒ¥ . Then there exists a subset V ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ V of at most n1‚àíŒ¥ vertices such
r+1
that the number of independent sets in the induced subgraph G[V ‚Ä≤ ] is at least n 2 (1‚àíO(Œ¥)) .
Organization. In Section 2 we prove Theorem 1.6 using an appropriate hypergraph decomposition method. We use it in Subsection 2.2 to deduce the lower bound in Theorem 1.4. In
Subsection 3.1 we prove that the parameters of Theorem 1.6 are essentially best possible, and in
Subsection 3.2 we prove a matching upper bound for Theorem 1.4, using a probabilistic construction. Our applications, Proposition 4.1 and Proposition 4.3, are given in Section 4.

Proofs overview. For the proof of the sparse Kruskal-Katona Theorem (Theorem 1.6, see also
Theorem 2.7 below) we proceed as follows. In the first part of the proof we apply a new approximate
hypergraph decomposition method, relying on the sparseness of the input hypergraph, into links.
The decomposition is performed iteratively, in each step finding many vertices of high degree within
the current link and restricting the next links to them. The final step of these iterations consists
of ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù each link by iteratively removing vertices of low degree. We then prove, using the
sparseness of the hypergraph, that in fact most of the parts in our decomposition have few edges. In
the second part of the proof we find, by applying the classical Kruskal-Katona Theorem, i-subsets
within the edges of each (sub)link separately. We then argue that, since the links approximately
decompose the hypergraph, we may essentially collect the i-subsets from all links without much
overcounting. The proof of our lower bound for traces (in Theorem 1.4) follows quite easily from
the sparse Kruskal-Katona Theorem by applying it on the most ‚Äúpopular layer‚Äù of the hypergraph
(i.e., the uniform hypergraph with the most edges contained in our hypergraph, which we may
assume is down-closed) and projecting onto a random subset of Œ±n vertices.
For the proof that the parameters in the sparse Kruskal-Katona Theorem are essentially best
possible (Theorem 3.1 below) we give a randomized construction of a uniform hypergraph whose
edges contain few i-subsets. The construction is fairly simple: the union of a carefully chosen
number of cliques on random subsets, such that it simultaneously holds that there are many cliques
and yet they are nearly edge disjoint. We show in particular that the expected number of edges
induced on subsets of Œ±n vertices is sufficiently small so as to allow taking a union bound over all
cliques. The proof of the upper bound for traces (in Theorem 1.4) follows by taking the down-closed
hypergraph generated by the uniform hypergraph above, and then upper bounding the expected
trace on a random subset of Œ±n vertices.
Throughout the paper we assume, whenever needed, that n is sufficiently large. All logarithms are
in base 2 unless otherwise specified. To simplify the presentation we omit all floor and ceiling signs
whenever these are not crucial.

Sparse Kruskal-Katona and Traces Lower Bound

In this section we prove Theorem 1.6. Henceforth, for a hypergraph F on V and for a vertex subset
I ‚äÜ V we denote by F(I) the link of I in F, that is,
F(I) = ( V \ I, {e \ I | I ‚äÜ e ‚àà F} ).
Note that if F is a k-graph then F(I) is a (k ‚àí |I|)-graph. For a tuple U of vertices in V we
denote by |U | the number of distinct vertices in U , and by F(U ) the link F(I) where I is the set
of (distinct) vertices in U (and so F(U ) is a (k ‚àí |U |)-graph).
For the proof we will need several lemmas which we state and prove below. We begin with the
following simple ‚Äúhypergraph regularization‚Äù lemma.
Lemma 2.1. Every hypergraph F = (V, E) has an induced sub-hypergraph F ‚Ä≤ = (V ‚Ä≤ , E ‚Ä≤ ) satisfying:
1. |E ‚Ä≤ |/|V ‚Ä≤ | ‚â• |E|/|V |.
2. The degree of each vertex v ‚àà V ‚Ä≤ in F ‚Ä≤ is at least
3. |E ‚Ä≤ | > |E|/2.

|E ‚Ä≤ |
2|V ‚Ä≤ | log |V | .

Proof. Put n = |V |, V0 = V and E0 = E. Starting with i = 0, as long as the hypergraph
Fi = (Vi , Ei ) in which |Vi | = n ‚àí i does not satisfy (2), let Vi+1 be the set obtained from Vi by
removing a vertex of minimum degree in Fi , and let Fi+1 be the induced subhypergraph on this
set. It is easy to see that |Ei+1 |/|Vi+1 | > |Ei |/|Vi | and hence this process must terminate with a
nonempty hypergraph Fj = (Vj , Ej ). Define V ‚Ä≤ = Vj , E ‚Ä≤ = Ej . Then (1) holds as the quantity
|Ei |/|Vi | keeps increasing during the process, (2) holds by the definition of j, and (3) holds since

V with edge set {e ‚àà F : U ‚äÜ e}. Note that |F U | = |F(U )|. We proceed by induction on s, noting
that the induction basis s = 1 is Lemma 2.2. For the induction step, let F be as in the statement,
and note that by the induction hypothesis there are at least is‚àí1 (s ‚àí 1)-tuples U ‚àà V s‚àí1 with
|F |
|F U | = |F(U )| ‚â• (2n)

similar fashion, we deduce that the total number of s-tuples U ‚Ä≤ as above is at least is‚àí1 ¬∑ i. This
completes the induction step and the proof.

Sparse Kruskal-Katona Theorem

In this subsection we prove Theorem 2.7, which is a more precise version of Theorem 1.6. First, we
will need a lemma which extends the classical Kruskal-Katona Theorem 1.5 by collecting i-subsets
from the hypergraph‚Äôs links.
Lemma 2.6. Let F be a k-graph on V , and let t ‚àà N. For every t ‚â§ i ‚â§ k we have

Note that Lemma 2.6 recovers Theorem 1.5 by taking t = 0.
We prove the following stronger form of Theorem 1.6, our sparse Kruskal-Katona Theorem.

Remark 2.8. The parameters in Theorem 2.7 satisfy the following relations:

For the first inequality, note that otherwise s = ‚åàr‚åâ and so, by the definition of s, c ¬∑ span(F, Œ±n) ‚â§
|F|/(2n)s‚àí1 ‚â§ n, implying that span(F, Œ±n) < Œ±n and thus, by averaging, |F| < n, contradicting
the statement‚Äôs assumption r ‚â• 1. For the second inequality, notice nr = |F| ‚â§ nk ‚â§ nk .

Note that the error term C increases with the quotient k/Œ± and with r. This precludes us from
taking hypergraphs of large uniformity, with many edges, or from inducing on too few vertices.
More formally, we have the following corollary.
Remark 2.9. Under the assumptions of Theorem 2.7:
1. If (k/Œ±)r ‚â§ (log n)O(1) then |F|/C ‚â• ‚Ñ¶ÃÉ(|F|).
2. If k/Œ± ‚â§ no(1) then |F|/C ‚â• |F|1‚àío(1) .

We now show how to deduce the sparse Kruskal-Katona Theorem from Theorem 2.7.

and the last inequality uses Lemma 2.4. Using (2) to bound t, the proof follows.

Note that the statement in Corollary 2.10 does not depend on k, the uniformity of the hypergraph, except in the error term C ‚Ä≤ . In fact, in order for this statement to be meaningful, C ‚Ä≤ should
be negligible, so k should be relatively small, e.g., poly-logarithmic in n.
11

Remark 2.11. If the bound in Corollary 2.10 is tight, then, in the proof of Theorem 2.7, all the
inequalities become (essentially) equalities. In the proof of Theorem 2.7, we showed that the number
of s-tuples in U ‚Ä≤ is at least 12 (Œ±n)s . It is then easy to verify that for half of these s-tuples U , we
have tU ‚âà t0 , xU ‚âà x and then x ‚âà 2k. (Quantifying this statement precisely requires more details,
which we omit here.) Note that this remark applies to Corollary 2.10 but not to Theorem 2.7 itself,
as evident from the matching upper bound in Subsection 3.1.

2.2

Tight lower bound for traces

Recalling the definition of ¬µ in (1), we now prove the lower bound in our main result Theorem 2.12.
Theorem 2.12. Let r ‚â• 1, Œ± ‚àà (0, 1]. If r, Œ±‚àí1 ‚â§ nŒ¥ then Tr(n, nr , Œ±n) ‚â• n¬µ(1‚àíO(Œ¥)) . Moreover,
if r = O(1), Œ±‚àí1 ‚â§ (log n)O(1) then Tr(n, nr , Œ±n) ‚â• ‚Ñ¶ÃÉ(n¬µ ).

Proof. Let H be a down-closed hypergraph6 on n vertices with |H| = nr . We will prove lower
bounds on Tr(H, Œ±n), which would complete the proof since
 assume
 we may
	 the given hypergraph
is down-closed (this is standard, see, e.g., [1]). Put Hi = e ‚àà H  |e| = i , and let F = Hk where
k maximizes |Hk |. Observe that since H is down-closed we have |H| ‚â• 2k , which implies that
k ‚â§ log |H|, and therefore |F| ‚â• |H|/(log |H| + 1). We assume Tr(F, Œ±n) ‚â§ 21 |F|, as otherwise we
are done since
1
Tr(H, Œ±n) ‚â• Tr(F, Œ±n) ‚â• |H|/(log |H| + 1) = ‚Ñ¶ÃÉ(nr ).
2
‚àö
Now, write Tr(F, Œ±n) = Bn with B > 0. Since span(F, Œ±n) ‚â§ Tr(F, Œ±n) and since k ‚â§ Œ±n
(i.e., k2 /Œ± ‚â§ n) for all large enough n, we apply Corollary 2.10 with Œ≥ = Œ± to obtain that
Bn = Tr(F, Œ±n) ‚â•

lower bound on B; we therefore deduce

C ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚â§ nO(Œ¥r) , which implies that Tr(H, Œ±n) ‚â• n¬µ(1‚àíO(Œ¥)) . Moreover, if r ‚â§ O(1), Œ±‚àí1 ‚â§ (log n)O(1)
then C ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚â§ (log n)O(1) , which implies that Tr(H, Œ±n) ‚â• ‚Ñ¶ÃÉ(n¬µ ). This completes the proof.

Remark. In the proof of Theorem 2.12 it seems tempting to write Tr(F, Œ±0 n) = B0 n with Œ±0 ‚â™ Œ±,
so that B0 ‚â™ B. Then, Corollary 2.10 would mean that the expected trace on Œ±n random vertices
|F |
|F |
, which seemingly contradicts the fact that our lower bound
‚â´ B 1‚àílog(1+Œ±)
would be roughly 1‚àílog(1+Œ±)
B0

is tight! The reason this cannot happen is that, for any Œ±0 that is not too small, though the average
trace on Œ±0 n vertices is substantially smaller than that on Œ±n vertices, the maximal traces can
actually be the same. Indeed, in the upper bound construction one can show that Tr(F, Œ±0 n) ‚âà
Tr(F, Œ±n) for any Œ±0 ‚â§ Œ± that is not too small.

Also called monotone. A hypergraph H is down-closed if for every edge H, all its subsets are also edges of H.

We will need the following lemma relating hypergeometric and binomial random variables.

Lemma 3.2. Let H be a hypergeometric random variable with parameters (n, x, y),7 and let B be

where the first inequality uses that h ‚â§ y (as otherwise Pr[H = h] = 0 and there is nothing to

inequality assumes n ‚â• 2, for otherwise x ‚â§ 1 in which case H = B so there is nothing to prove),

and the third inequality uses the fact that h(x ‚àí h) ‚â§ x2 /4 ‚â§ n/4 as x ‚â§ n. Recalling that B is
a binomial random variable with parameters (x, Œ±) with Œ± = y/n, we deduce

Proof. Put y = 3x ‚â• ¬µ. Then Pr(X ‚â• 6x) = Pr(X ‚â• 2y) ‚â§ Pr(X ‚àí ¬µ ‚â• y) ‚â§ exp(‚àíy/3) =

k-graph on each Sj , that is, F = [n], ‚Ñìj=1 Skj .
We next analyze the random k-graph F constructed above. Let E1 be the event that every two

proof of Theorem 3.1 with some effort. For completeness, we give here a self-contained proof.
Put x = (¬µ ‚àí 1) log n. Let S1 , . . . , S‚Ñì be ‚Ñì independent uniformly random subsets of [n], each of

Applications

In this section we give two easy applications of our results on traces, in geometry and in graph
theory.

4.1

Separating halfspaces using few points

We recall the necessary definitions and the statement of this application. Let H be a family of
halfspaces in Rd , and let P be a set of points in Rd . We say that P separates H if for every pair of
distinct halfspaces H1 6= H2 ‚àà H there is a point in P that lies in one and outside the other. Given
P and H such that P separates H, it is interesting to ask how few points in P can we choose while
still separating many of the hyperplanes in H.
Proposition 4.1. Let P ‚äÇ Rd be a set of n points and let H be a family of nr halfspaces in Rd ,
with 1 ‚â§ r ‚â§ nŒ¥ , such that P separates H. Then there exists a subset P ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ P of at most n1‚àíŒ¥
r+1
points and a subset H‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ H of at least n 2 (1‚àíO(Œ¥)) halfspaces such that P ‚Ä≤ separates H‚Ä≤ .
Proof. Let F be the hypergraph on P with edge set {H ‚à© P | H ‚àà H}. By assumption, for
any pair of distinct halfspaces H1 6= H2 ‚àà H there is a point p ‚àà P such that p ‚àà H1 and
p 6‚àà H2 , or p ‚àà H2 and p ‚àà
/ H1 . In particular, H1 ‚à© P 6= H2 ‚à© P , and therefore |F| = |H| = nr .
Applying Theorem 2.12 with r, Œ±‚àí1 = nŒ¥ , there exists a subset P ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ P of size n1‚àíŒ¥ such that
r+1
|FP ‚Ä≤ | ‚â• n¬µ(1‚àíO(Œ¥)) ‚â• n 2 (1‚àíO(Œ¥)) . Note that FP ‚Ä≤ = {H ‚à© P ‚Ä≤ | H ‚àà H}. Let H‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ H be obtained
by assigning to each member Q of FP ‚Ä≤ an arbitrary halfspace H ‚Ä≤ ‚àà H‚Ä≤ with H ‚Ä≤ ‚à© P ‚Ä≤ = Q. By
construction, |H‚Ä≤ | = |FP ‚Ä≤ |, hence it remains to show that P ‚Ä≤ separates H‚Ä≤ . Again by construction,
for every pair of distinct halfspaces H1 6= H2 ‚àà H‚Ä≤ we have H1 ‚à© P ‚Ä≤ 6= H2 ‚à© P ‚Ä≤ . This means that
there exists a point p‚Ä≤ ‚àà P ‚Ä≤ such that either p‚Ä≤ ‚àà H1 and p‚Ä≤ ‚àà
/ H2 , or p‚Ä≤ ‚àà H2 and p‚Ä≤ ‚àà
/ H1 , thus
completing the proof.
In fact, halfspaces can be replaced in Proposition 4.1 by any family of subsets of Rd , as long
as the set of points P separates them. Indeed, in the proof of Proposition 4.1 we considered for
each halfspace only the subset of points in P that are contained in it. The condition that P
separates H implies that all the corresponding subsets of P are distinct, and that is all that is
really needed. However, it does seem reasonable to expect that for ‚Äúfavorable‚Äù geometric objects,
such as halfspaces, better bounds hold‚Äîas we believe is the case.
Remark 4.2. It is worth noting that the number of halfspaces in Proposition 4.1 is necessarily polynomial if the dimension d is constant; in fact, an exact formula is known [10], which in particular
implies that the number of halfspaces in Rd separated by n points is at most O(nd ). As mentioned
above, the assertion in Proposition 4.1 holds also when we replace halfspaces by any family of nr
subsets, for example, general convex sets.

4.2

Retaining independent sets in induced subgraphs

An independent set in a graph is a vertex subset that spans no edges. Given a graph G, one can
ask how many independent sets are retained in small subgraphs of G. Using our result for traces,
o(1)
independent sets then it must have a subset of at most n1‚àíŒ¥
we easily obtain that if G has 2n
vertices, with Œ¥ a sufficiently small constant, retaining asymptotically more than square root of the
number of independent sets.
Proposition 4.3. Let G = (V, E) be an n-vertex graph, and assume that the number of independent
sets in G is nr with 1 ‚â§ r ‚â§ nŒ¥ . Then there exists a subset V ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ V of at most n1‚àíŒ¥ vertices such
r+1
that the number of independent sets in the induced subgraph G[V ‚Ä≤ ] is at least n 2 (1‚àíO(Œ¥)) .

17

Proof. Let F be the hypergraph on V whose edges are the independent sets in G. Apply Theorem 2.12 with r, Œ±‚àí1 = nŒ¥ to deduce that there is a subset S of V (F) = V with n1‚àíŒ¥ vertices such
r+1
that |FS |, the number of projections of the edges of F onto S, is at least n¬µ(1‚àíO(Œ¥)) ‚â• n 2 (1‚àíO(Œ¥)) .
The proof follows by observing that, by definition and construction,
FS = {I ‚à© S : I ‚àà F}

= {I ‚à© S : I is an independent set of G} = {I : I is an independent set of G[S]}.

We note that, since Theorem 2.12 is such an abstract statement, we could have replaced the
notion of independent sets in a graph by any other monotone family (i.e., a family closed under
taking subsets) of vertex subsets. Thus, for example, a statement analogous to Proposition 4.3
holds for independent sets in hypergraphs, for subsets inducing a subgraph not containing some
fixed graph H, and more.
