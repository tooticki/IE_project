Abstract. We introduce the notion of regularity for a relative holonomic D-module
in the sense of [18]. We prove that the solution functor from the bounded derived
category of regular relative holonomic modules to that of relative constructible complexes is essentially surjective by constructing a right quasi-inverse functor. When
restricted to relative D-modules underlying a regular mixed twistor D-module, this
functor satisfies the left quasi-inverse property.

Introduction
Let X and S be complex manifolds and let p be the projection X × S → S. We
will set dX = dimC X, dS = dimC S. In [18] (see Section 1 for a reminder), we have
considered a restricted notion of holomorphic family parametrized by S of holonomic
DX -modules. These are coherent modules on the sheaf DX×S/S of relative differential
operators whose characteristic variety, in the product (T ∗ X)×S, is contained in Λ×S
for some Lagrangean conic closed subset Λ of T ∗ X. This notion is restrictive in the
sense that Λ does not vary with respect to S. We have also introduced the derived
category of sheaves of p−1 OS -modules with C-constructible cohomology, also called SC-constructible complexes, together with the corresponding notion of perversity, and

we have proved that the de Rham functor DR and its adjoint by duality, the solution
functor Sol, on the bounded derived category of DX×S/S -modules with holonomic
cohomology take values in the derived category of S-C-constructible complexes. Denoting by p Sol(M ) resp. p DR(M ) the complex Sol(M )[dX ] resp. DR(M )[dX ], these
S-C-constructible complexes are related by duality: D p Sol(M ) = p DR(M ).
Many properties in the relative setting can be obtained from those in the “absolute case” (i.e., when S is reduced to a point), by specializing the parameter and
by considering analogous properties for the restricted objects by the functors Li∗so
when so varies in S. As a consequence, strictness, that is, p−1 OS -flatness (or absence
of p−1 OS -torsion if dim S = 1), plays an important role at various places. On the
other hand, for an S-C-constructible perverse complex F , the dual S-C-constructible
complex DF needs not be perverse, and the subcategory of S-C-constructible complexes F such that F and DF are perverse is specially interesting. Both notions
(strictness and perversity of F and DF ) are related.
Proposition 1. Assume that that F and DF are perverse. Let (X)α be a stratification
of X adapted to F . Then, for any open strata Xα , H −dX i−1
α F is a locally free
p−1 OS -module of finite rank (dX := dim X).
Conversely, let Y be a hypersurface of X and let F be a locally free p−1 OS -module
of finite rank on (X r Y ) × S. Then j! F [dX ] and its dual Rj∗ F [dX ] are perverse
(dX = dimC X, j : (X r Y ) × S ֒→ X × S).
Moreover, when F is the de Rham complex or the solution complex of a holonomic
DX×S/S -module, we have the following improvement of [18, Th. 1.2].
Proposition 2. Let M belong to Dbhol (DX×S/S ). Then the following conditions are
equivalent.
(1) M is concentrated in degree 0 and H 0 (M ) is strict.
(2) DM is concentrated in degree 0 and H 0 (DM ) is strict.
(3) p Sol(M ) and p DR(M ) = D p Sol(M ) are perverse.
Going further, it is natural to define the subcategory of regular relative holonomic
D-modules by imposing the regularity condition to each Li∗so M (cf. Section 2.1).
Our main objective in this article is to approach the problem of constructing a
quasi-inverse functor to Sol restricted to the category of regular holonomic DX×S/S modules. In analogy with the method of Kashiwara [6], we introduce the functor
RHS , from the derived category DbC-c (p−1 OS ) of S-C-constructible complexes to the
bounded derived category Dbrhol (DX×S/S ) of DX×S/S -modules with regular holonomic
cohomology. Roughly speaking, it is a relative version of the functor T H om(·, O)
of Kashiwara [6] using the language of ind-sheaves or sheaves on a subanalytic site
([11], [12], [19]). In the locally constant case it coincides with the construction due
to Deligne [2].
However, contrary to the absolute case, the behaviour by pull-back is not always
controlled, due to the lack of an existence theorem of a Bernstein-Sato polynomial, so
it remains conjectural that the derived category Dbrhol (DX×S/S ) is stable by inverse
images. This constitutes a major obstacle to obtain an equivalence of categories as
in the absolute case. Our first main result concerns essential surjectivity of Sol :
Dbrhol (DX×S/S ) 7→ DbC-c (p−1 OS ), when S is a curve. This restriction to dim S = 1 is
needed in order to find bases of open coverings of the subanalytic site Ssa formed by
OS -acyclic open subsets.

Theorem 3. Assume that dim S = 1 and let F ∈ DbC-c (p−1 OS ). Then RHS (F ) ∈
Dbrhol (DX×S/S ) and we have a functorial isomorphism p Sol(RHS (F )) ≃ F in
DbC-c (p−1 OS ).
As a consequence, we obtain:
Corollary 4. Assume that dim S = 1 and let F ∈ DbC-c (p−1 OS ) be such that F and DF
are perverse. Set M := RHS (F ) ∈ Dbrhol (DX×S/S ). Then M is concentrated in
degree 0 and H 0 M is strict.
Let A be a Q-vector subspace of R × C. The category MTM(X)A of A -mixed
twistor D-modules with KMS exponents in A on the complex manifold X, together
with the corresponding functors (pushforward by a projective map, duality, localization, etc.) has been introduced by T. Mochizuki in [16]. Roughly speaking (cf. [16,
§7.1.3] for details), for pure objects of MTM(X) := MTM(X)R×C , the set A bounds
the possible asymptotic behaviour of the norms of sections with respect to the corresponding harmonic metric, as well as the possible monodromies on nearby cycles
along functions of the associated holonomic DX -modules (formal monodromies in the
wild case), via the two functions
A × S ∋ (a, α, s) 7−→ a + 2 Re(αs) ∈ R,

(a, α, s) 7−→ α − as − αs2 ∈ C.

Let us recall the main properties we use. A more detailed reminder is given in Section
4.2. An object of MTM(X)A is a W -filtered triple whose first two components are
W -filtered sheaves on X × C and the third component is a sesquilinear pairing between their restriction to X × S 1 satisfying a number of properties. For our purpose,
we set S = C∗ and we restrict the first two components to X × S, which consist then
of W -filtered DX×S/S -modules (cf. [22, 15, 16]). For the sake of simplicity, we shall
say that a DX×S/S -module M underlies an A -mixed twistor D-module if it is the
second DX×S/S -module of the pair. This defines a subcategory of Modrhol (DX×S/S )
(morphisms are similarly induced by morphisms in MTM(X)), which is not full however, but is endowed with relative proper direct image functor, a duality functor and
a localization functor (cf. [16]). These properties are essential to prove our main
application.
Theorem 5. Let us fix A = R × {0} ⊂ R × C. Assume that M ∈ Modrhol (DX×S/S )
underlies an A -mixed twistor D-module. Then there exists a canonical isomorphism
(∗)

M ≃ RHS (p Sol(M ))

which is functorial with respect to morphisms in Mod(DX×S/S ) between objects M , N
of Modrhol (DX×S/S ) underlying A -mixed twistor D-modules. Moreover, we have a
natural isomorphism
(∗∗)

HomDX×S/S (M , N ) ≃ Homp−1 OS (p Sol N , p Sol M ).

Remark 6. More generally, if A ⊂ R × C is finite-dimensional over Q, the statement
of Theorem 5 holds for all M underlying an A -mixed twistor D-module away from
the subset S0 ⊂ S defined by the equations α − as − αs2 ∈ Z for (a, α) ∈ A , α 6= 0.
For a given M and locally on X, only a finite number of such equations are needed
to define the corresponding S0 , which is thus discrete in S (cf. Remark 4.6 below).

We do not know how to characterize the essential image of the category of regular
holonomic DX×S/S -modules underlying an A -mixed twistor D-module by the functor
p
Sol, although we know that, for such a module M , p Sol(M ) and its dual p DR(M )
are perverse in DbC-c (p−1 OS ).
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, we prove the complements to [18],
that is, Propositions 1 and 2. We establish in Theorem 2.6 and Corollary 2.8 the generalization of Deligne’s results on the extension of a relative holomorphic connexion on
the complementary of a normal crossing divisor. The construction of RHS , explained
in Section 3, is based on the notion of relative tempered distributions and holomorphic
functions introduced in [17], which form subanalytic sheaves in the relative subanalytic site. Note that the constraint to the case dim S = 1 is not inconvenient for
the application since mixed twistor D-modules satisfy this condition. In the locally
free case, the above extension is also obtained using the functor RHS as proved in
Lemma 4.2. Moreover, in this case, it provides an equivalence of categories (Theorem 2.11). We obtain Theorem 3 as a consequence of Lemma 4.2, and Theorem 5 is
proved in Section 4.3 by reducing to [6, Cor. 8.6]. In the appendix we collect various
results which are essential for the remaining part of the paper.
Acknowledgements. This work has benefited from discussions with Andrea d’Agnolo,
Masaki Kashiwara, Yves Laurent and Luca Prelli, whom we warmly thank. We also
thank Daniel Barlet for having kindly provided us with a proof of Lemma 2.12. We
finally thank the referee for useful suggestions leading to an improvement of the
presentation of the article.

1. Some complementary results to [18]
1.1. Notation and preliminary results. Throughout this work X and S, unless
specified, will denote complex manifolds and pX : X × S → S will denote the projection. We will set dX := dim X, dS := dim S, and for any complex space Z, we will
set similarly dZ = dim Z. We will often write p instead of pX when there is no risk
of ambiguity. We say that a p−1 OS -module is strict if it is p−1 OS -flat. Given so ∈ S,
we denote by Li∗so (•) the derived functor on Db (p−1 OS ) of
F −→ F ⊗p−1 OS p−1 (OS /mso ),
where mso denotes the maximal ideal of holomorphic functions on S vanishing at so .
The following results are straightforward.
Lemma 1.1. Let N ∈ D>0 (p−1 OS ) and let so ∈ S. Then Li∗so (N ) ∈ D>−dS (X). If
moreover, for any k, H k (N ) is strict then Li∗so (N ) ∈ D>0 (X).
Lemma 1.2. For any locally closed subset Z of X × S, for any F ∈ Db (p−1 OS ) and
for any so ∈ S, we have RΓZ (Li∗so (F )) ≃ Li∗so (RΓZ (F )).
We shall also need the following result which is contained in the proof of [18,
Prop. 2.2]:
Proposition 1.3. Let F belong to Db (p−1 OS ) and assume that for every (xo , so ) ∈ X ×S
and for every j, H j (F )(xo ,so ) is finitely generated over OS so . Assume that, for a
given j, H j (Li∗so (F )) = 0 for any so ∈ S. Then H j (F ) = 0. In particular, if, for a

given integer k and for every so , Li∗so (F ) ∈ D>k (X) (respectively Li∗so (F ) ∈ D6k (X)),
then F ∈ D>k (X × S) (respectively F ∈ D6k (X × S)).
1.2. S-C-constructibility and perversity. We refer to the appendix for the notion
of S-locally constant sheaf on X × S. We have defined in [18] the categories of S-Rconstructible sheaves (resp. S-C-constructible sheaves) and the corresponding derived
categories DbR-c (p−1 OS ) (resp. DbC-c (p−1 OS )). For an object F of Db (p−1 OS ), the
condition that it is an object of DbR-c (p−1 OS ) is a local property on X, since it is
characterized by the property that the microsupport of F is contained in Λ × (T ∗ S)
for some closed R∗+ -conic Lagrangean subanalytic subset Λ of T ∗ X. Similarly, the
condition that it is an object of DbC-c (p−1 OS ) is local, since it consists in adding that
the microsupport is C× -conic (cf. [18, Prop. 2.5 & Def. 2.19]).
The category DbC-c (p−1 OS ) is endowed with a natural t-structure, which however
is not preserved by duality, as seen by considering a skyscraper p−1 OS -module on
X × S. In this article, the adjective “perverse” refers to this t-structure. Recall
60 −1
−1
(cf. [18, Lem. 2.5]) that the category p DC-c
(p OS ) resp. p D>0
OS ) can be deC-c (p
b
fined as the full subcategory of DC-c (p−1 OS ) whose objects are the S-C-constructible
bounded complexes F such that, for some adapted µ-stratification (Xα ), denoting by
iα : Xα ֒→ X the inclusion,
∀ α and ∀ j > − dim(Xα ),
resp.

∀ α and ∀ j < − dim(Xα ),

H j (i−1
α F ) = 0,
H j (i!α F ) = 0.

As usual, an object F of DbC-c (p−1 OS ) is called perverse if it is an object of both

OS ) and p DC-c
(p OS ). There is a natural duality functor on DbR-c (p−1 OS )
C-c (p
and on DbC-c (p−1 OS ) (cf. [18, Prop. 2.23]), but in general it does not exchange
p 60 −1

DC-c (p OS ) and p D>0
OS ) and therefore does not preserve the heart of the
C-c (p
t-structure.

Lemma 1.4. For a given object F ∈ p DbC-c (p−1 OS ), F and DF are perverse if and

Conversely, since Li∗so commutes with j! , Lemma 1.4 implies that j! F [dX ] and its
dual are perverse. On the other hand, we have
D(j! F [dX ]) ≃ Rj∗ RH om p−1 OS (F, p−1 OS )[dX ].
Since F is locally free, D ′ (F ) := RH om p−1 OS (F, p−1 OS ) is concentrated in degree
zero and H 0 D′ (F ) is locally free. Thus the statement follows by biduality (cf. [18,
Prop. 2.23]).

1.3. Coherent DX×S/S -modules. We will use a notation similar to that of [7] for
the functors on D-modules, namely D f∗ denotes the pushforward by a map f , D f! the
“proper pushforward” and D f ∗ the pull-back (they are denoted respectively by Df∗ ,
Df! and Df ∗ in [7], but we try to avoid confusion with the duality functor).
Let i : Z ֒→ X be the inclusion of a closed submanifold in X. The following
adaptation of Kashiwara’s result (cf. e.g. [7, §4.8]) is straightforward.
Theorem 1.5 (Kashiwara’s equivalence). The pushforward functor D i∗ induces an equivalence between the category of coherent DZ×S/S -modules and that of coherent DX×S/S modules supported on Z ×S. A quasi-inverse functor is H − codim Z D i∗ , and H j D i∗ = 0
for j 6= − codim Z on objects of the latter category.
The behaviour of coherence by pushforward with respect to the parameter space
is obtained in the following proposition. Let π : S → S ′ be a morphism of complex
manifolds. Let M be a coherent DX×S/S -module which is π-good, that is, by definition, such that for any point (x, s′ ) ∈ X × S ′ there exists a neighborhood U × V ′ of
(x, s′ ) such that MU×π−1 (V ′ ) has a good filtration F• M . The proof of the following
proposition is similar to that given in [7, §4.7].
Proposition 1.6. Assume that π is proper and that M is π-good. Then Rπ∗ M ∈
Dbcoh (DX×S ′ /S ′ ). Moreover, if Char M ⊂ Λ × S with Λ ⊂ T ∗ X, then for each k ∈ N,
Char Rk π∗ M ⊂ Λ × S ′ . In particular, if moreover M is holonomic, then Rπ∗ M ∈
Dbhol (DX×S ′ /S ′ ).
There is a duality functor D : Db (DX×S/S ) 7→ Db (DX×S/S ) defined by
DM = RH om DX×S/S (M , DX×S/S ⊗ Ω⊗−1
X×S/S )[dX ],
and we set D ′ (•) = D(•)[−dX ].
Proposition 1.7 ([23, Prop. 5.10, Th. 5.15]). Let f : X → Y be a proper morphism
of complex manifolds. Then there exists a morphism D f! D(M ) → D(D f! M ) in
Db (DY ×S/S )op , which is functorial with respect to M ∈ Db (DX×S/S ). It is an isomorphism for M in Dbf -good (DX×S/S ).
As a consequence, using the projection formula for sheaves and replacing M by
D′ (M ) we recover the relative version of [7, Th. 4.33].
Corollary 1.8 (Adjunction formula). Let f : X → Y be a proper morphism of complex
manifolds. For M ∈ Dbf -good (DX×S/S ) and N ∈ Db (DY ×S/S ), there exists a canonical morphism Rf∗ RH om DX×S/S (M , D f ∗ N )[dX ] → RH om DY ×S/S (D f! M , N )[dY ]
which is an isomorphism.
1.4. Holonomic DX×S/S -modules. The notion of holonomic DX×S/S -module has
been recalled in the introduction. We refer to [18] for details on some of their properties. Recall (cf. Introduction) that, for such a DX×S/S -module, we set p DR M :=
DR M [dX ] and p Sol M = Sol M [dX ], and that p DR M ≃ D p Sol M .
Proposition 1.9. Let M be a holonomic DX×S/S -module and let M(xo ,so ) be its germ
at (xo , so ) ∈ X × S.
(1) Assume that Li∗so M = 0 for each so ∈ S. Then M = 0.

(2) Let Iso be an ideal of OS,so contained in the maximal ideal mso . Assume that
Iso M(xo ,so ) = M(xo ,so ) . Then M(xo ,so ) = 0.
Proof. Assume M 6= 0 and let Λ ⊂ T ∗ X be a closed conic complex Lagrangian
variety such that Char M ⊂ Λ × S. Let (Xα )α be a µ-stratification of X compatible
with Λ. We will argue by induction on maxβ dim Xβ , where Xβ runs among the strata
included in the projection of Λ in X.
Assume first that some stratum Xβ is open in X and let xo ∈ Xβ , so that
∗
Char M ⊂ (TX
X)×S in the neighborhood of xo . It follows that M is OX×S -coherent
in the neighborhood of xo × S, and Assumption 1.9(1) resp. (2) implies, according to
Nakayama, that M|xo ×S = 0 resp. M(xo ,so ) = 0.
We are thus reduced to the case where no stratum Xβ is open. Choose then a
maximal stratum Xβ . By applying Kashiwara’s equivalence 1.5, which commutes
with the OS -action, in the neighborhood of any point of Xβ we are reduced to the
previous case. By induction on the dimension of the maximal strata, we conclude
that Λ can be chosen empty, hence M = 0.
q.e.d.
Corollary 1.10. Let M be an object of Dbhol (DX×S/S ). Assume Li∗so M = 0 for each
so ∈ S. Then M = 0.
Proof. We first prove that if Li∗Σ M = 0 for every codimension-one germ of submanifold Σ, then M = 0. Let σ be a local equation of Σ. Then the assumption is that
the cone CΣ (M ) of σ : M → M is isomorphic to zero. From the long exact sequence
σ
· · · −→ H j M −−→ H j M −→ H j CΣ (M ) = 0 −→ · · ·
we conclude as in Proposition 1.9 that H j M = 0. We argue now by induction
on dS . In the case dS = 1, every point has codimension one, so there is nothing more
to prove. In general, for every germ of hypersurface Σ and every so ∈ Σ, we have
Li∗so Li∗Σ M ≃ Li∗so M = 0, so Li∗Σ M = 0 by induction, and the first part of the proof
gives the desired assertion.
q.e.d.
Corollary 1.11. Let M be an object of Dbhol (DX×S/S ). Assume that H j Li∗so M = 0 for
all j 6= 0 and all so ∈ S. Then H j M = 0 for all j 6= 0 and Li∗so H 0 M = H 0 Li∗so M
for all so ∈ S.
Proof. We prove it by induction on dS . Let s be part of a local coordinate system
centered at some so ∈ S and denote by iS ′ : S ′ = {s = 0} ֒→ S the inclusion. Then
Li∗S ′ M is an object of Dbhol (DX×S ′ /S ′ ) and by induction it is concentrated in degree
zero. Considering the long exact sequence
s
· · · H j M −−→ H j M −→ H j Li∗S ′ M −→ · · ·
one obtains that s : H j M → H j M is onto for j 6= 0. According Proposition 1.9(2),
we have H j M = 0 for j 6= 0. The remaining statement is clear.
q.e.d.
Corollary 1.12. Let M be a strict holonomic DX×S/S -module. Then H j DM = 0 for
j 6= 0 and H 0 DM is a strict holonomic DX×S/S -module.
Proof. By the strictness property, H j Li∗so M = 0 for j 6= 0, hence Li∗so M =
H 0 Li∗so M is a holonomic DX -module, so H j DLi∗so M = 0 for j 6= 0 and
H 0 DLi∗so M is DX -holonomic. Recall also (cf. [18, Prop. 3.1]) that Li∗so DM ≃
DLi∗so M for any so ∈ S. Therefore, H j Li∗so DM = 0 for j 6= 0. According

8

T. MONTEIRO FERNANDES & C. SABBAH

to [23, Prop. 2.5], DM has holonomic cohomology. As a consequence, according
to Corollary 1.11, H j DM = 0 for j 6= 0, H 0 DM is DX×S/S -holonomic, and
Li∗so H 0 DM has cohomology in degree zero at most for any so ∈ S, since
Li∗so H 0 DM ≃ H 0 Li∗so DM ≃ H 0 DLi∗so M
and Li∗so M is a holonomic DX -module. The conclusion follows from Lemma 1.13
below.
q.e.d.
Lemma 1.13. Let M be a coherent DX×S/S -module. Then M is strict if and only if
H j Li∗so M = 0 for each so ∈ S and each j 6= 0.
Proof. The “only if” part is clear. The “if” part is clear if dS = 1, since strictness
is then equivalent to the absence of OS -torsion. In general, assume M is not strict.
Recall (cf. [21, Cor. A.0.2]) that there exists then a morphism π : S1 → S from a
smooth curve S1 to S such that π ∗ M has OS1 -torsion. Let s1 be a local coordinate
on S1 such that K := ker[s1 : π ∗ M → π ∗ M ] 6= 0. Let i denote the composition
{s1 = 0} ֒→ S 1 ֒→ S. The exact sequence
s1
· · · −→ H −1 Li∗ M −→ H 0 Lπ ∗ M −−−
→ H 0 Lπ ∗ M −→ H 0 Li∗ M −→ 0
show that H −1 Li∗ M surjects onto K , hence is nonzero.

q.e.d.

Corollary 1.14. Let M be a strict holonomic DX×S/S -module and set F = p DR M or
p
Sol M . Then F and DF are S-perverse.
Proof. According to Corollary 1.12, this follows from Th. 1.2, Prop. 3.10, Th. 3.11 and
Prop. 2.28 in [18].
q.e.d.
Proof of Proposition 2.
(1) ⇔ (2) follows from Corollary 1.12.
(1) ⇒ (3) follows from Corollary 1.14.
(1) ⇐ (3): According to Lemma 1.4, for any so ∈ S, Li∗so p Sol(M ) is perverse,
therefore, for any so ∈ S, Li∗so (M ) is concentrated in degree 0 and H 0 Li∗so (M ) is
holonomic. The result then follows by Corollary 1.11 and Lemma 1.13.
q.e.d.
We now can make precise the behaviour of the functors p DR and p Sol. According
to Lemma 1.1, given M ∈ D>0 (DX×S/S ) and so ∈ S, we have Li∗so (M ) ∈ D>−dS (DX ).
If moreover, H k (M ) is p−1 OS -flat for every k, then Li∗so (M ) ∈ D>0 (DX ).
Proposition 1.15. The functor p DR has the following behaviour when considering the
standard t-structure on Dbhol (DX×S/S ) and the t-structure given on DbC-c (p−1 OS ):

2. Regular holonomic DX×S/S -modules
2.1. Regularity
As usual Dbrhol (DX ) denotes the bounded derived category of complexes with
regular holonomic cohomology sheaves (for an introduction to regular holonomic
D-modules in the absolute case, we refer to [7, 13, 14, 4], and to the references
therein for details).
Definition 2.1 (Regular holonomic DX×S/S -module). Let M be a holonomic DX×S/S module. We say that M is regular holonomic if, for any so ∈ S, Li∗so M belongs to
Dbrhol (DX ).

We similarly denote by Dbrhol (DX×S/S ) the bounded derived category of complexes
with regular holonomic cohomology sheaves. Note that, given an exact sequence in
Modhol (DX×S/S ),
0 −→ N −→ M −→ L −→ 0
if two of its terms are regular holonomic, then the third one is also regular holonomic.
Proposition 2.2. Given a distinguished triangle in Dbhol (DX×S/S ),

if two of its terms belong to Dbrhol (DX×S/S ) the same holds for the third.
Proposition 2.3. Assume that M is an object of Dbrhol (DX×S/S ). Then so is DM .
Proof. Since the functors D and Li∗so commute, the result follows by the definition
and the fact that Dbrhol (DX ) is stable by duality.

Corollary 2.4 (of Theorem 1.17). Let f : X → Y be a proper morphism of complex
manifolds. Let M belong to Dbrhol (DX×S/S ). Then Rf∗ (DY ←X/S ⊗L
DX×S/S M ) belongs
to Dbrhol (DY ×S/S ).
Proof. The regularity follows from the commutativity of Li∗so with Rf∗ and ⊗, for
any so ∈ S.

2.2. Deligne extension of an S-locally constant sheaf. Let D be a normal

be the associated coherent OX ∗ ×S -module with flat relative connection (cf. Remark
A.10). In particular, E is naturally endowed with the structure of a left DX ∗ ×S/S module and j∗ E with that of a DX×S/S -module. There exists a coherent OS -module G
such that, locally on X ∗ × S, F ≃ p−1 G (cf. Proposition A.2). More precisely, let U

neighborhood of (xo , so ) as above. In such a neighborhood, giving the local system
is equivalent to giving T1 , . . . , Tℓ ∈ Aut(G) which pairwise commute, according to
Proposition A.9. According to [24, Cor. 2.3.10 & (3.45)], in the neighborhood of so
there exists for each k a logarithm of Tk , hence there exists Ak ∈ End(G) such that
Tk = exp(−2πiAk ), and the formula (2.11) of [24] can be used to show that there

Proof. We keep the notation of the proof of Theorem 2.6. Since the statement is local
on X × S, we can work with E1 . We fix so ∈ S and we take a local coordinate s
centered at so . We denote by (S, so ) the germ of S at so .
b1
Step one: assume G is OS -locally free. In this case, we are reduced to proving that E
is strict holonomic with characteristic variety contained in Λ × S, since its restriction
to any so is a DX -module of Deligne type, hence is regular holonomic. Note that the
b1 is obvious. We regard Gso as an OS,so [A1 , . . . , Aℓ ]-module which is

OS,so -free. Let ρ : (S ′ , s′o ) → (S, so ) be the finite ramification of order N . Then Gso is

Proposition 1.6.

Lemma 2.9. There exists a finite ramification ρ : (S ′ , s′o ) → (S, so ) such that the
pull-back G′s′o of Gso has a finite filtration by OS ′ ,s′o [A1 , . . . , Aℓ ]-submodules whose
successive quotients have rank one over OS ′ ,s′o .
By the lemma and the previous remarks, we are reduced to the case where G has
b1 = OX×S (∗D)
rank one over OS , so Ak (s) is a holomorphic function λk (s) and E
endowed with the DX×S/S -action defined by ∂xk · 1 = λk (s)/xk if k = 1, . . . , ℓ, and
∂xk · 1 = 0 otherwise. This is the external product over OS of the DC×S/S -modules
OC×S (∗0) endowed with the connection xk ∂xk − λk (s) (k = 1, . . . , ℓ) or with the
connection ∂xk (k > ℓ). It is therefore enough to to show the corollary in the case
dX = 1. The latter case being obvious, we are reduced to proving the DC×S/S coherence of (OC×S (∗0), x∂x − λ(s)) and to showing that the characteristic variety is
contained in (TC∗ C) × S ∪ (T0∗ C) × S.
Up to isomorphism, we can assume that, if λ(0) ∈ N, then λ(0) = 0. We then
denote by µ its order of vanishing, i.e., λ(s) = sµ u(s) with u(0) 6= 0. Then one has
the relation

in which the numerator is thus invertible in OS,so . It follows that 1/x is a DC×S/S generator of this module. We thus have a surjective morphism
DC×S/S /DC×S/S (x∂x − (λ(s) − 1)) −→ (OC×S (∗0), x∂x − λ(s))
sending the class of 1 to 1/x. It obviously becomes an isomorphism after tensoring
with OC×S (∗0). Since the left-hand side has no OS -torsion (cf. [18, Ex. 3.12]), we
conclude that the above morphism is an isomorphism. Now, the assertions of the
corollary are clear for DC×S/S /DC×S/S (x∂x − (λ(s) − 1)).

Step two. We now relax the assumption of local freeness on G. If OS,s

onto, then the kernel is torsion free, hence OS,so -free, and we have an exact sequence

0 −→ G′′ −→ G′ −→ G −→ 0
where G′ , G′′ are OS,so -free of finite rank. By flatness of OX×S (∗D) over OS , we have

and cokernel of the morphism iso E1 → iso E1 , hence is also regular holonomic. q.e.d.

Proof of the lemma. Let us first work with the OS,so (∗0)-vector space Gso (∗0) :=
OS,so (∗0) ⊗OS,so Gso . There exists a finite ramification
ρ : (S ′ , s′o ) −→ (S, so )

such that each equation det(t Id −Ak (s′ )) = 0 has all its solutions in the field
OS ′ ,s′o (∗0). These solutions, being algebraic over OS ′ ,s′o , belong to this ring. We can
then assume from the beginning that all eigenvalues belong to OS,so . Then Gso (∗0)
decomposes as an OS,so (∗0)[A1 , . . . , Aℓ ]-module with respect to the multi-eigenvalues
L
λ(s) = (λ1 (s), . . . , λℓ (s)) as Gso (∗0) = λ Gso (∗0)λ , and Ak (s) − λk (s) is nilpotent
on Gso (∗0)λ . If we choose a total order on the set of λ’s, we can define a filtration
L
Gso (∗0)6λ :=
Gso (∗0)λ′ .
λ′ 6λ

It induces a filtration Gso ,6λ := Gso (∗0)6λ ∩ Gso , where the intersection is taken
in Gso (∗0), and every successive quotient Gso ,6λ /Gso ,<λ is an OS,so [A1 , . . . , Aℓ ]submodule of Gso (∗0)λ , hence is OS,so -locally free and Ak (s) − λk (s) is nilpotent
on it for every k = 1, . . . , ℓ.
We can therefore assume from the beginning that every Ak (s) is nilpotent on Gso .
We now argue by induction on ℓ. Consider the kernel filtration Gso (∗0)j := ker Aj1 .
This is a filtration by OS,so (∗0)[A1 , . . . , Aℓ ]-submodules and A1 acts by zero on the
quotient module Gso (∗0)j /Gso (∗0)j−1 for every j. As above, we can induce this
filtration on Gso by setting Gso ,j := Gso (∗0)j ∩ Gso and Gso ,j /Gso ,j−1 is contained
in Gso (∗0)j /Gso (∗0)j−1 , hence has no OS,so -torsion, i.e., is OS,so -free. By induction
on ℓ, we find a filtration whose successive quotients are free OS,so -modules and on
which every Ak acts by zero, so that every rank-one OS,so -submodule is also trivially
q.e.d.
an OS,so [A1 , . . . , Aℓ ]-submodule, and the lemma is proved.
The following definition is a relative version of [8, Def. 2.3.1].
Definition 2.10. A coherent DX×S/S -module L is said of D-type with singularities
along D if it satisfies the following conditions:
∗
(1) Char L ⊂ (π −1 (D) × S) ∪ (TX
X × S),
(2) L is regular holonomic and strict,
(3) L ≃ L (∗D).

the correspondences L 7→ F = H 0 DR L |(XrD)×S and F 7→ L = E.

Proof (provided by Daniel Barlet).
Case (1). Let us assume that F is S-constant. We may assume that the rank of F
is 1. The statement being local, we may take local coordinates in a neighborhood
of (xo , so ) ∈ D × S and assume that we are given a holomorphic function v(x, s) in
(U r D) × V , where U is an open ball centered in xo and V is an open ball centered
in so , such that, for any s ∈ V , v(x, s) is meromorphic with poles along D. To prove
that v is meromorphic with poles along D ×V it is sufficient, by Hartogs, to assume D
non singular, hence defined by a coordinate t = 0. Writing the Laurent’s expansion
of v
X
v(x, s) =
vi (x, s)ti ,
i∈Z

where the vi are holomorphic in U × V , we introduce, for m > 0, the increasing
sequence of closed analytic sets
Xm = {(x, s) | vk (x, s) = 0, ∀ k 6 −m}.
S
By the assumption, U × V = m Xm hence there must exist m0 such that Xm0 =
U × V , which proves the claim.
Case (2). Let us assume that D = {x1 · · · xℓ = 0}. For a general S-local system F
locally free of rank d, let G and
(Ti (s), Ai (s))i=1,...,ℓ ,

s∈V

be given by Proposition A.9 and Theorem 2.6, such that Ti (s) = exp(−2iπAi (s)),
i = 1, . . . , ℓ. Let (v1 , . . . , vd ) be a section of F ⊗p−1 OS O(XrD)×S defined in U ′ × V ,
XrD
for an open convex subset U ′ of U r D (where we keep the notation of Case (1)).

Proof of Proposition 2.11. According to Theorem 2.6, if F is a p−1 OS -local system
e is a coherent DX×S/S -module of D-type. Conversely,
locally free on (X r D) × S, E
suppose that L is a coherent DX×S/S -module of D-type along D. The strictness
assumption entails that F := H om DX×S/S (OX×S , L )|(XrD)×S is locally free of finite
type. Let ψ : L → j∗ (F ⊗p|−1
OS O(XrD)×S ) be the natural morphism of
(XrD)×S

DX×S/S -modules. Since ψ is an isomorphism on (X r D) × S and L = L (∗D), it is
injective. By definition, for each section u of ψ(L ) and each fixed so ∈ S, u(·, so ) is
a section of a regular holonomic DX -module, hence has moderate growth in the sense

3. Relative tempered cohomology functors
We shall keep the notations of Section 1 but for the main purpose of this section
we may have to allow X and S to be real analytic manifolds since we often make use
of subanalytic techniques which are naturally associated to real analytic structures.
Indeed, when X and S are complex, it is often convenient to use the “realification” tool
which enables one to go from the real to the complex analytic setting tensoring by the
Dolbeault complex OX×S , where X and S denote the respective complex conjugate
manifold. We shall specify each case whenever there is a risk of ambiguity.
3.1. Relative subanalytic site. We recall below the main constructions and results
contained in [17] and obtain complementary results to be used in the sequel. We refer
to [11] as a foundational paper and to [12] for a detailed exposition on the general
theory of sheaves on sites.
Let X and S be real analytic manifolds. On X × S it is natural to consider
the family T consisting of finite unions of open relatively compact subsets and the
family T ′ of finite unions of open relatively compact sets of the form U × V making
X × S both a T - and a T ′ -space in the sense of [3] and [10]. The associated sites
(X × S)T and (X × S)T ′ are nothing more than, respectively, (X × S)sa and the
product of sites Xsa × Ssa .
We shall denote by ρ, without reference to X × S unless otherwise specified,
the natural functor of sites ρ : X × S → (X × S)sa associated to the inclusion
Op((X × S)sa ) ⊂ Op(X × S). Accordingly, we shall consider the associated functors
ρ∗ , ρ−1 , ρ! introduced in [12] and studied in [19].
We shall also denote by ρ′ : X × S → (X × S)T ′ the natural functor of sites.
Following [3] we have functors ρ′∗ and ρ′! from Mod(CX×S ) to Mod(CXsa ×Ssa ).
Note that W is a T ′ -open subset or, equivalently, W ∈ Op(Xsa × Ssa ), if W is
a locally finite union of relatively compact subanalytic open subsets W of the form
U × V , U ∈ Op(Xsa ), V ∈ Op(Ssa ). We denote by η : (X × S)sa → Xsa × Ssa the
natural functor of sites associated to the inclusion Op(Xsa × Ssa ) ֒→ Op((X × S)sa ).
Remark 3.1. As well-known consequences of the properties of T -spaces (cf. [11,
Ch. 6, §6.4, Prop. 6.6.3], see also [19]) we recall:
•
•
•
•

ρ′−1 and ρ′! are exact and commute with tensor products.
If f : X → Y is a morphism, ρ′−1 commutes with f −1 and ρ′∗ commutes with f∗ .
ρ′−1 ◦ ρ′∗ = ρ′−1 ◦ ρ′! = Id.
Adjunctions:
ρ′∗ H om(ρ′−1 (•), •) ≃ H om(•, ρ′∗ (•)),
ρ′−1 H om(ρ′! (•), •) ≃ H om(•, ρ′−1 (•)).

ρ′∗ commutes with H om and RH om.
• Let f be a real analytic map X → Y . Still denoting by f the morphism f × IdS :
X × S → Y × S or the associated morphism of sites, Xsa × Ssa → Ysa × Ssa , according
to [12, 17.5], we have

and (f −1 , f∗ ) is a pair of adjoint functors.
•

ρ′−1 commutes with f −1 and ρ′∗ commutes with f∗ .

For example, the fourth item follows from adjunction and from the second item:
H om(ρ′∗ (•), ρ′∗ (•)) ≃ ρ′∗ H om(ρ′−1 ◦ ρ′∗ (•), •) ≃ ρ′∗ H om(•, •).
For the commutation with RH om one uses injective resolutions plus the property that ρ′∗ transform injective objects into quasi-injective objects which are
H om(ρ′∗ (F ), •)-acyclic for any F .
If R is a sheaf of rings on Xsa × Ssa , these properties remain true in Mod(R).
According to [12, Th. 18.1.6 & Prop. 18.5.4], Mod(R) is a Grothendieck category
so it admits enough injectives and enough flat objects. Hence the derived functors
appearing in the sequel are well-defined.
3.2. Complements on S-constructible sheaves. Along the proofs of the following results and the main constructions throughout this paper, as explained in the
introduction, we need to consider families of open subanalytic sets generating the
open coverings of Xsa formed by Stein, hence OS -acyclic open subsets. This requires
the assumption dS = 1.
Assumption 3.2. Throughout this section 3.2 we shall assume that S is a complex
manifold with complex dimension dS = 1 and we still denote by S the underlying real
analytic manifold.
The following result shows that ModR-c (p−1 OS ) is a ρ∗ as well as a ρ′∗ -acyclic
category.
Proposition 3.3. Let F ∈ ModR-c (p−1 OS ). Then H k ρ∗ (F ) = H j ρ′∗ (F ) = 0 for k > 0.
In particular ρ′∗ is exact on ModR-c (p−1 OS ).
Proof. Let U and V be open subanalytic relatively compact sets respectively in X
and in S. Since dimension of S is 1, we may assume that V is Stein. Similarly to the
proof of [19, Lem. 2.1.1], it is sufficient to prove that, for each k 6= 0, there exists a
finite covering {Uj × Vj }j∈I , Uj × Vj ∈ T ′ , of U × V , such that H k (Uj × Vj , F ) = 0.
S
Let X = α Xα be a Whitney stratification adapted to F . By [9, Prop. 8.2.5],
there exist a simplicial complex K = (K, ∆) and a homeomorphism i : |K| ≃ X such
that, for any simplex σ ∈ ∆, there exists α such that i(|σ|) ⊂ Xα and i(|σ|) is a
subanalytic manifold of X. Moreover, we may assume that U is a finite union of the
S
images by i of open subsets U (σ) of |K|, with U (σ) = τ ∈∆,τ ⊃σ |τ |. We shall see
that we may take for Uj × Vj the open sets i(U (σ)) × V . Therefore, still denoting by i
the homeomorphism |K| × S → X × S, it is enough to prove that for any σ ∈ ∆ and
any x ∈ |σ|, we have:
(i) H 0 (U (σ) × V ; i∗ F ) ≃ H 0 (V, F{x}×S ),
(ii) H k (U (σ) × V ; i∗ F ) = H k (V, F{x}×S ) = 0, for j 6= 0.
The proof of (i) and (ii) proceeds mimicking the proof of [9, Prop. 8.1.4], using
Proposition A.7, the fact that the F |{x}×S is OS -coherent and that V is Stein. q.e.d.

Remark 3.4. By construction the isomorphisms (i) commute with the restrictions to
open subsets V ′ ⊂ V in S.
Recall that, given an abelian category C , Kb (C ) denotes the category of complexes
in C having bounded cohomology, the morphisms being defined up to homotopy. For
a locally closed set of X ×S, CZ denotes both the constant sheaf on Z and its extension
by zero as a sheaf on X × S (cf. [9, Prop. 2.5.4]).
Proposition 3.5. Let F ∈ ModR-c (p−1 OS ). Then F is quasi-isomorphic to a complex
0 −→ ⊕iα ∈Iα p−1 OS ⊗ CUα,iα ×Vα,iα −→ · · · −→ ⊕iβ ∈Iβ p−1 OS ⊗ CUβ,iβ ×Vβ,iβ −→ 0,
where {Uj,ij }j,ij are locally finite families of relatively compact open subanalytic subsets of X and {Vj,ij }j,ij are locally finite families of relatively compact open subanalytic
subsets of S.
S
Proof. We shall adapt the outline of the proof of [1, Prop. A.2]. Let X = α Xα be
a Whitney stratification adapted to F . We keep the notation of Proposition 3.3 and
its proof when using [9, Prop. 8.2.5].
For each integer i, let ∆i ⊂ ∆ denote the subset of simplices of dimension 6 i and
set K i = (K, ∆i ). We shall prove by induction on i that there exists a morphism
φi : Gi → F in Kb (p−1 OS ) such that:
(a) The Gki are finite direct sums of p−1 OS ⊗ Ch(Uσ )×Vi,σ for some σ ∈ ∆i and
subanalytic open set Vi,σ of S,
(b) The family (h(U (|σ|)) × Vi,σ )σ∈∆i is a locally finite covering of h(|K i |) × S,
(c) One has
φi ||K 0 |×S : Gi ||K 0 |×S −→ F ||K 0 |×S
is a quasi-isomorphism.
Case i = 0. Let x ∈ h(|K 0 |), i.e., x = h(σ) for some σ ∈ K 0 and let so ∈ S. We have
that F |{x}×S ≃ G0,σ for some G0,σ ∈ Dbcoh (OS ); we then choose a subanalytic open
set Vσ ⊂ S such that so ∈ Vσ and that G0,σ |Vσ admits a bounded locally free OS |Vσ
resolution R0,σ → G0,σ |Vσ . Since dim S = 1, we may assume that Vσ is Stein.
Clearly, the family (h(U (σ)) × Vσ )σ∈∆0 is a locally finite covering of h(|K 0 |) × S.
By (i) of Proposition 3.3 we have isomorphisms of C-vector spaces
Γ(h(U (σ)) × V ′ ; F ) ≃ Γ(V ′ ; F |{x}×Vσ ).
In view of the freeness of Rσ,0 , of the fact that V ′ is Stein and of isomorphisms (i)
and (ii) of Proposition 3.3, we conclude quasi-isomorphisms in Kb (C)
(iii) Γ(V ′ ; Rσ,0 ) → Γ(h(U (σ)) × V ′ ; F ),
which commute with restrictions. On the other hand we have isomorphisms
(iv) φV ′ : Γ(h(U (σ)) × V ′ ; F ) ≃ Γ(V ′ ; p∗ H om Kb (CX×S ) (Ch(U(σ))×Vσ , F )),
which also commute with restrictions to open subsets V ′′ of V ′ .
Combining (iii) and (iv) we get a quasi-isomorphism in K(Mod(OVσ ))
Rσ,0 −→ p∗ H om Kb (CX×S )|Vσ (Ch(U(σ))×Vσ , F )|Vσ .
By adjunction, we get a morphism in Kb (Mod(p−1 OVσ )):
p|−1
Vσ Rσ,0 −→ H om Kb (CX×S ) (Ch(U(σ))×Vσ , F )|X×Vσ

which, by the functorial properties of H om and ⊗, induces a morphism
φσ,0 : p−1 Rσ,0 ⊗ Ch(U(σ))×Vσ −→ F.

(3.6)

By construction φ0 := ⊕σ∈Λ0 φσ,0 gives the desired morphism.
General case. Let us assume that φi is constructed and let us consider the distinguished triangle in Kb (Mod(p−1 OS )):
φi
vi
+1
→ Gi −−−→ F −−−→,
Hi −−−
where Hi |h(|K i |)×S is quasi-isomorphic to 0. Therefore
L
Hi |h(|σ|)×S −→ Hi |h(|K i+1 |)×S
σ∈∆i+1 r∆i

is a quasi-isomorphism.
Likewise the case i = 0, let us choose, for each σ ∈ ∆i+1 r ∆i and each so ∈ S, an
open subanalytic relatively compact open subset Vσ,i+1 in S containing s, a complex
Rσ,i+1 of free OVσ,i+1 -modules quasi-isomorphic to F |{x}×Vσ,i+1 , for arbitrary x ∈ |σ|,
and a morphism
Rσ,i+1 −→ p∗ H om(Ch(U(σ))×Vσ,i+1 , Hi )|Vσ,i+1 .
The family obtained as union of (h(Uσ ) × Vσ,i )σ∈∆i and (h(Uσ ) × Vσ,i+1 )σ∈∆i+1 r∆i
clearly satisfies (b) with respect to h(|K i+1 |) × S.
As above we deduce a morphism
L
p−1 Rσ,i+1 ⊗ Ch(U(σ))×Vσ,i+1 −→ Hi
φ′i+1 : G′i+1 :=
σ∈∆i+1 r∆i

such that, for (x, s) ∈ h(|K i+1 | r |K i |) × S, the φ′i+1 (x,s) are quasi-isomorphisms.
For (x, s) ∈ h(|K i |) × S, the condition on Hi entails that φ′i+1 (x,s) is trivially a
quasi-isomorphism. Therefore, φ′i+1 |h(|K i+1 |)×S is a quasi-isomorphism.
Let Gi+1 and Hi+1 be defined by the distinguished triangles
φ′i+1
+1
G′i+1 −−−−−→ Hi −→ Hi+1 −−−→

vi ◦ φ′i+1
+1
and G′i+1 −−−−−−−−→ Gi −→ Gi+1 −−−→ .

By construction and the induction hypothesis, Gi+1 satisfies (a). The octahedral
axiom applied to the preceding triangles induces a morphism φi+1 : Gi+1 → F and
hence a distinguished triangle
φi+1
+1
Hi+1 −→ Gi+1 −−−−−→ F −−−→ .
Since by its construction Hi+1 |h(|K i+1 |)×S is quasi-isomorphic to zero, φi+1 satisfies (c)
as desired.

Proof.
(a) According to Proposition 3.5, which provides a p−1 (OS )-flat resolution of F ,
we may assume that F = CU×V ⊗ p−1 OS . Similarly, as proved in [6], we may assume
F ′ = CU ′ for some open relatively compact subset U ′ ⊂ X. Therefore F ⊗ q −1 F ′ =
C(U∩U ′ )×S ⊗ p−1 (OS ⊗ CV ). So, on one hand, according to [17, Lem. 3.6(2)] we have
ρ′∗ (F ⊗ q −1 F ′ ) = ρ′∗ C(U∩U ′ )×S ⊗ ρ′∗ p−1 (OS ⊗ CV )
On the other hand we have, for the same reason,
ρ′∗ (F ) ⊗ ρ′∗ (q −1 F ′ ) = ρ′∗ (CU×S ⊗ p−1 (OS ⊗ CV )) ⊗ ρ′∗ (CU ′ ×S )
= ρ′∗ (CU×S ) ⊗ ρ′∗ p−1 (OS ⊗ CV )) ⊗ ρ′∗ (CU ′ ×S )
and the result follows from the equality ρ′∗ (C(U∩U ′ )×S = ρ′∗ (CU×S ) ⊗ ρ′∗ (CU ′ ×S )
(cf. [3, Th. 2.2.6(2)]).
b
(b) According to Proposition 3.3, ρ′∗ is exact on DR-c
(p−1 OS ) and, as above, we
−1
may assume that F = CU×V ⊗p OS . Up to shrinking V (possible by the construction
of the family {Vj,ij }j,ij mentioned in Proposition 3.5), we can also assume that there
is a holomorphic coordinate s vanishing at so defined on V . It remains to observe
s−s
that the left term in (b) is realized by the complex ρ′∗ F −→o ρ′∗ F and the right term
s−s
q.e.d.
by ρ′∗ (F −→o F ). They are thus isomorphic by the exactness of ρ′∗ .

3.3. Relative subanalytic sheaves. Subanalytic sheaves are defined on the subanalytic site of a real analytic manifold, so we start by assuming that X and S are real
analytic manifolds, and we denote by DX×S the sheaf of linear differential operators
with real analytic coefficients.
In the absolute case (S = pt), the functors of tempered cohomology from DbR-c (CX )
to Db (DX ), respectively denoted by T H om(·, DbX ) (DbX is the sheaf of distribution
on the underlying C ∞ manifold, with its DX -module structure) and T H om(·, OX )
(in the complex case), were introduced by M. Kashiwara in [6] and later, in [11], the
authors showed that they can be recovered using the language of subanalytic sheaves
t
as ρ−1 RH om(·, DbtX ) resp. ρ−1 RH om(·, OX
), where DbtX is the subanalytic sheaf
t
of tempered distributions, resp. OX is the subanalytic complex of tempered holomorphic functions on Xsa . Recall that, if U is an open relatively compact subanalytic
subset of X, for any open subset Ω ⊂ X, Γ(Ω, T H om(CU , DbX )) is the space of
distributions on Ω ∩ U which extend to Ω and, if moreover X is complex and U is
Stein, Γ(Ω, T H om(CU , OX )) is the space of holomorphic functions on Ω ∩ U which
have a moderate growth with respect to the distance to ∂U and so they extend as
distributions to Ω. Here we will adapt these notions to the relative case.
Let G be a sheaf on (X × S)T ′ . One defines the (separated) presheaf η ← G on
(X × S)sa by setting, for W ∈ Op((X × S)sa ),
η ← G(W ) = lim G(W ′ )

with W ′ ∈ Op((X × S)T ′ ) (cf. Section 3.1 for T ′ ). Let η −1 G be the associated sheaf.

defines a left exact functor on Mod(C(X×S)sa ). We will denote by (•)RS,♯ and (•)RS ≃
η −1 ◦ (•)RS,♯ the associated right derived functors.

Definition 3.10. We define Dbt,S

complex manifold of dimension dX . Throughout the rest of this work we assume
that S is complex and dS = 1.

(by (3.13)).

Similarly we have the chain of isomorphisms:
RΓ(U × V ; RH om ρ′! DX×S/S (ρ′! OX×S , Rρ′∗ OX×S ))
≃ RHom(ρ′∗ CU×V , RH om ρ′! DX×S/S (ρ′! OX×S , Rρ′∗ OX×S ))
≃ RHomρ′! DX×S/S (ρ′! OX×S , RH om(ρ′∗ CU×V , Rρ′∗ OX×S ))
≃ RHomDX×S/S (OX×S , ρ′−1 RH om(ρ′∗ CU×V , Rρ′∗ OX×S ))
≃ RHomDX×S/S (OX×S , RH om(CX×V , RH om(CU×S , OX×S )))
≃ RHom(CX×V , RH om DX×S/S (OX×S , RH om(CU×S , OX×S ))).
The isomorphisms of each chain are compatible with (3.14) because they come
from natural equivalences of functors. We have thus reduced the proof to showing
that the morphism
(i)

F1 := RH om DX×S/S (OX×S , T H om(CU×S , OX×S ))
−→ F2 := RH om DX×S/S (OX×S , RH om(CU×S , OX×S ))

is an isomorphism in Db (p−1 OS ), functorial in U . The functoriality on U is obvious.
According to Proposition 3.5 and Remark 3.7, we may assume that U is relatively
compact contractible and D′ CU ≃ CU . Moreover, since the statement is a local
question, we may also consider that X = Cn with the coordinates x = (x1 , . . . , xn )
and then OX×S is realized by
DX×S/S /DX×S/S ∂x1 + DX×S/S ∂x2 + · · · + DX×S/S ∂xn .
On the one hand, remarking that DX×S ⊗DX×S/S OX×S is nothing but the transfer
module DX×S→S associated to p : X × S → S, we deduce a functorial chain of
isomorphisms

where ρS denotes the morphism of sites S → Ssa thus satisfying ρS p = pρ, (3) follows
by the associative property relating the derived functors of ⊗ and H om and (4) follows
from [20, Cor. A.3.7].
Similarly, in the non-tempered case we have a chain of isomorphisms :
F2 ≃ RH om DX×S (DX×S ⊗DX×S/S OX×S , RH om(CU×S , OX×S ))
≃ RH om DX×S (DX×S→S , RH om(CU×S , OX×S ))
≃ RH om(CU×S , RH om DX×S (DX×S→S , OX×S ))
≃ RH om(CU×S , p−1 OS )
The isomorphisms of each chain are compatible with (i) because they come from
natural equivalences of functors. Hence it remains to prove that the natural morphism

3.4. The functors THS and RHS . Recall that ρ′−1 ρ′! = Id, so if X is either a real

following functors.
• If X is a real analytic manifold, let us consider the subsheaf DX×S /S of the sheaf

DX×SR of linear differential operators with real analytic coefficients on X × SR which
commute with p−1 OS . Hence the operators in DX×SR /S are those not containing holomorphic derivations with respect to S. Then THS : DbR-c (p−1 OS ) 7→ Db (DX×SR /S ) is

Clearly ρ−1 = ρ′−1 η∗ but ρ∗ 6= η −1 ρ′∗ hence, if in the preceding definitions we
replace ρ′ by ρ, we obtain a different notion.
When X is complex, considering the underlying real analytic structure on X, the
functor THS (•) is also defined on DbR-c (p−1 OS ) with values in Db (DXR ×SR /S ). Note
that DXR ×SR /S contains DX×S as a subsheaf. Note also that, by the adjunction
formula for ρ′ , we have an isomorphism in Db (DX×S/S )
(3.16)

RHS (F ) ≃ RH om DX×S (OX×S , THS (F ))[dX ].

We have a functorial isomorphism in Db (DX×S/S ):
RH om p−1 OS (F, OX×S ) ≃ ρ′−1 RH om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (ρ′∗ F, Rρ′∗ OX×S )
Combining this isomorphism with (3.14) we obtain a functorial morphism
(3.17)

RHS (F )[−dX ] −→ RH om p−1 OS (F, OX×S ),

and therefore, for any object M of Db (DX×S/S ), a bi-functorial morphism
(3.18) RH om DX×S/S (M , RHS (F )[−dX ])
−→ RH om DX×S/S (M , RH om p−1 OS (F, OX×S )).
Lemma 3.19. Let F ∈ DbR-c (p−1 OS ). Then the natural morphism
RH om DX×S/S (OX×S , RHS (F )[−dX ])
−→ RH om DX×S/S (OX×S , RH om p−1 OS (F, OX×S ))
is an isomorphism. In particular p DR(RHS (F )) ≃ DF .
Proof. We have a chain of functorial isomorphisms in Db (p−1 OS )
RH om DX×S/S (OX×S , RHS (F )[−dX ])
t,S,♯
≃ ρ′−1 RH om ρ′! DX×S/S (ρ′! OX×S , RH om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (Rρ′∗ F, OX×S
))
t,S,♯
≃ ρ′−1 RH om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (Rρ′∗ F, RH om ρ′! DX×S/S (ρ′! OX×S , OX×S
)).

Similarly, the other side, we have a chain of functorial isomorphisms
RH om DX×S/S (OX×S , RH om p−1 OS (F, OX×S ))
≃ ρ′−1 RH om ρ′! DX×S/S (ρ′! OX×S , RH om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (Rρ′∗ F, Rρ′∗ OX×S ))
≃ ρ′−1 RH om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (Rρ′∗ F, RH om ρ′! DX×S/S (ρ′! OX×S , Rρ′∗ OX×S )).
The first part of the statement then follows by Lemma 3.15. Let us prove the last
assertion. We have, functorially in F , a chain of isomorphisms
RH om DX×S/S (OX×S , RH om p−1 OS (F, OX×S ))
≃ RH om p−1 OS (F, RH om DX×S/S (OX×S , OX×S ))
≃ RH om p−1 OS (F, p−1 OS )) ≃ D ′ (F ).

Example 3.20. Let X be a complex manifold. For a given hypersurface Y of X (possibly with singularities) let us denote by j the open inclusion X r Y ֒→ X as well as
the associated map (X r Y ) × S ֒→ X × S.
(1) Assume F ≃ p−1 OSℓ |(XrY )×S for some ℓ ∈ N. Then T H om(C(XrY )×S , OX×S )
is a regular holonomic DX×S -module endowed with a natural structure of DX×S/S module, as proved in [6], hence it is regular holonomic as a DX×S/S -module. More
precisely, given locally an equation f = 0 defining Y , T H om(C(XrY )×S , OX×S ) is
the localized of OX×S with respect to f . By Corollary 3.8(a) we have in Db (DX×S/S )

RHS (j!F )[−dX ] ≃ ρ′−1 RH om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (ρ′∗ p−1 OSℓ ⊗ ρ′∗ C(XrY )×S , OX×S

and by (3.13) we get
RHS (j!F )[−dX ] ≃ T H om(C(XrY )×S , OX×S )ℓ .
(2) Let us assume that F ≃ p−1 G with G coherent over OS , that is, F is an
S-constant local system on (X r Y ) × S.
According to Case (1), by considering a local free resolution OS• of G on a sufficiently
small open subset V of S, we obtain that RHS (j! F )[−dX ]|p−1 V is quasi-isomorphic
to a complex for which the terms are finite direct sums of T H om(C(XrY )×S , OX×S )
and the differentials are given by the right multiplication by matrices with entries
in p−1 OS , hence DX×S/S -linear morphisms. Therefore the cohomology groups are
regular holonomic DX×S/S -modules.
(3) We assume X = C. For any F ∈ ModC-c (p−1 OS ) such that (C∗ , {0}) is an
adapted stratification we have F ⊗ C{0}×S ≃ p−1 G ⊗ C{0}×S for some coherent
OS -module G. Then, by Corollary 3.8(a),
RHS (F ) ≃ RH om p−1 OS (p−1 G, T H om(C{0}×S , OX×S ))[1]
≃ RH om p−1 OS (p−1 G, B{0}×S|X×S ).
3.5. Extension in the case of an open subanalytic set.
Assumption 3.21. In this section X is a complex manifold and U denotes an open
subanalytic subset of X.
Let UXsa be the subanalytic site induced by Xsa on U (cf. [19, Rem. 1.1.1]), and let
j : UXsa ×Ssa → Xsa ×Ssa denote the open embedding of subanalytic sites. Recall that
the authorized open coverings in UXsa are those obtained as intersections of coverings
of Xsa with U . We keep the notation j for the morphism j × IdS : U × S → X × S
and ρ′ for the morphism of sites U × S → UXsa × Ssa . One easily checks from the
notion of morphism of sites (see [12, Chap. 16] for details) that the items in Remark
3.1 still hold in this framework with f = j.
Lemma 3.22. Let F be a p−1 OS -coherent S-locally constant sheaf on U × S. Then, for
any ρ′∗ p−1
U×S OS -module L , the natural morphism
(3.22 ∗)

L

ρ′∗ D ′ F ⊗ρ′∗ p−1 OS L −→ RH om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (ρ′∗ F, L )

is an isomorphism.
Proof. The construction of (3.22 ∗) is similar to the case of usual sheaves:
(1) For any F , G , H ∈ Mod(ρ′∗ p−1 OS ), we have a natural morphism
H om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (F , G ) ⊗ρ′∗ p−1 OS H −→ H om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (F , G ⊗ρ′∗ p−1 OS H ).
We deduce a natural morphism
L

L

(3.23) RH om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (F , G ) ⊗ρ′∗ p−1 OS H −→ RH om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (F , G ⊗ρ′∗ p−1 OS H )
by considering a flat resolution of H and an injective resolution of G .
(2) We have D′ F := RH om p−1 OS (F, p−1 OS ). Recall that ρ′∗ commutes with
H om and RH om hence
ρ′∗ D ′ F ≃ RH om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (ρ′∗ F, ρ′∗ p−1 OS ).

T. MONTEIRO FERNANDES & C. SABBAH

26

Therefore, the desired morphism (3.22 ∗) is obtained from (3.23) with
F = ρ′∗ F, G = ρ′∗ p−1 OS , H = L .
To prove that it is an isomorphism it is sufficient to consider a locally finite covering
of U × S by open subsets of the form U ′ × V , U ′ ∈ Op(UXsa ), V ∈ Op(Ssa ),
such that F |U ′ ×V admits a free p−1 OS -resolution F • of finite length. It follows that ρ′∗ F • is a H om ρ′∗ p−1 OS (·, G )-injective resolution of ρ′∗ F |U ′ ×V , for any
G ∈ Mod(ρ′∗ p−1 OS |U ′ ×V ). Hence we are reduced to the case F = p−1 OS , which is
clear.

Corollary 3.24. Let F be a p−1 OS -coherent S-locally constant sheaf on U × S. Then
we have a natural isomorphism in Modcoh (DU×S/S ):

Lemma 3.25. With the preceding notations, let F ∈ DbR-c (p−1

natural isomorphisms in Db (DX×S/S )

Moreover, if U = X rD, where D is a normal crossing divisor, and F is p−1 OS -locally
free of finite rank,
RHS (j! F )[−dX ]
is concentrated in degree zero.
Proof. The proofs of (3.25 ∗) and (3.25 ∗∗) are similar so we only prove (3.25 ∗∗). Let
us start by noting that, from [11, (2.4.4), Prop. 2.4.4], one deduces an isomorphism of
functors on Db (CXsa ×Ssa )
RH om(ρ′∗ j! CU×S , (•)) −→ Rj∗ RH om(ρ′∗ CU×S , j −1 (•)) ≃ Rj∗ j −1 (•)
using the following facts:
ρ′∗ j! CU×S = (j! CU×S )Xsa ×Ssa since Xsa × Ssa is a T ′ -space as explained in the
beginning of this section.

The isomorphism (1) follows from Corollary 3.8(a), (2) follows from the commutation
of ρ′∗ and j∗ and the preceding remark, and (3) follows by adjunction.
Let us now prove the second part of the statement. We use a similar argument
as in [6, Lem. 7.4]. We assume that F is S-locally free of rank ℓ and let dX = n.
Note that, according to Example 3.20(1), the result is true if F is constant. Note
also that the commutation of ρ′−1 with j −1 together with Corollary 3.24 imply that
RHS (j! F )[−dX ]|(XrY )×S is concentrated in degree zero.
By [17, Prop. 5.2(i)] and the exactness of j −1 , j −1 Dbt,S,♯

Let us assume that D = {x1 · · · xd = 0} where (x1 , . . . , xn ) are local coordinates in
a neighborhood nbX (xo ) of xo ∈ D. Let also s denote a local coordinate in W ⊂ S.
Let us identify nbD (xo ) with an open subset of Cn and W to an open subset in C.
Let U ′ denote an open ball in nbD (xo ) and V denote an open ball in W . Let G and
(Ti (s), Ai (s))i=1,...,d ,

s∈V

be given by Proposition A.9 and Theorem 2.6 with respect to F , such that Ti (s) =

THS (j! F ) is concentrated in degree zero. Moreover, by the construction, the isomorphism (3.26) preserves the actions of j −1 ρ′! OX×S -modules and of j −1 ρ′! DX×S -modules.
Thus, by (3.16), (3.26) induces an isomorphism of ρ′−1 j∗ j −1 ρ′! OX×S -modules, hence
of ρ′−1 ρ′! OX×S ≃ OX×S -modules
RHS (j! F )[−n] ≃ RHS (j! D ′ p−1 G)[−n].
So we may assume from the beginning that F is constant and the result follows. q.e.d.
3.6. Functorial properties. In order to study the functorial properties of THS
and RHS useful for the sequel, we come back for a moment to the real framework
in the first factor but of course remain complex in the S factor. Let f : Y → X be
a morphism of real (or complex) analytic manifolds. We shall still denote by f the
associated morphism f × IdS : Y × S → X × S. We shall study the associated derived
functor D f∗ : Db (DY ×S/S ) 7→ Db (DX×S/S ). We begin with the relative version of [6,
Th. 4.1]:
Theorem 3.27. Let f : Y → X be a morphism of real analytic manifolds, let F ∈
DbR-c (pY −1 OS ), and assume that f is proper on Supp F . Then we have a canonical
isomorphism in D(DX×S/S ):
D

f∗ THS (F ) ≃ THS (Rf∗ F ).

Proof. We can replace F with a complex as in Proposition 3.5 and we argue by induction on its length, so it is sufficient to assume that F is of the form CU×V ⊗ p−1
Y OS ,
where U (resp. V ) is a relatively compact subanalytic open subset of Y (resp. S). In
that case, one has THS (F ) ≃ T H om(CU×V , DbY ×S ). On the other hand
Rf∗ (CU×V ⊗ pY−1 OS ) ≃ Rf∗ (CU×V ) ⊗ p−1 OS
hence
THS (Rf∗ (CU×V ⊗ p−1
Y OS )) ≃ T H om(Rf∗ (CU ) ⊗ CX×V , DbX×S ).
Therefore the statement follows by the absolute case in [6, Th. 4.1].

q.e.d.

Recalling (3.16) and adapting [6, Lem. 7.2] one obtains:
Theorem 3.28. Let f : Y → X be a morphism of complex analytic manifolds, let
F ∈ DbR-c (pY −1 OS ), and assume that f is proper on Supp F . Then we have a canonical
isomorphism in D(DX×S/S ):
D

f∗ RHS (F ) ≃ RHS (Rf∗ F ).

Proposition 3.29. Let X be a complex manifold. For any F ∈ DbR-c (p−1 OS ) and any
so ∈ S, there is a natural morphism
Li∗so RHS (F )[−dX ] −→ T H om(Li∗so F, OX )
which is an isomorphism, where we identify X with X ×{so } and Xsa with Xsa ×{so }.

which gives the desired result.

4. Proof of the main results
In order to apply the results of Sections 3.2–3.6, we continue to assume that dS = 1
and that X is a complex manifold of complex dimension dX .
Remark 4.1 (The locally constant case). In view of Corollary 3.24 and Remark A.10,
Theorem 3 is true if F is an S-locally constant coherent sheaf. Similarly, the isomorphism of Theorem 5 holds for M = F ⊗p−1 OS OX×S . Moreover, we recover Deligne’s
Riemann-Hilbert correspondence by means of RHS as an equivalence between the
category of S-local systems on X × S and the category of coherent OX×S -modules
endowed with a relative flat connexion.
4.1. Proof of Theorem 3. We first consider the setting of Section 2.2, that is, we
consider in X a normal crossing divisor D, j : (X r D) × S → X × S denotes the
open inclusion and F is an S-locally constant coherent sheaf of p−1
XrD OS -modules,
We set EF := O(XrD)×S ⊗p−1 OS F . The OX×S -module j∗ EF carries a natural
XrD
fF the
structure of DX×S/S -module. Recall that in Theorem 2.6 we denoted by E
subsheaf of j∗ EF consisting of local sections having moderate growth. Since dS = 1,
fF is regular holonomic and has a characteristic variety

For each α ∈ A we can choose an isomorphism

Lemma 4.3. Let F be an S-locally constant coherent p−1 OS -module on (X r D) × S.
Then RHS (j! F ) ∈ Dbrhol (DX×S/S ).
Proof. One considers the exact sequence of S-local systems
0 −→ Ftors −→ F −→ Flf −→ 0
where Ftors denotes the S-local system of p−1 OS -torsion sections of F and Flf denotes
the quotient F/Ftors . According to Lemma 4.2 and Theorem 2.6, the result holds
for Flf . By the functoriality of RHS , it will hold for F provided it holds for Ftors .
So we now assume that F is a torsion module. By definition, F is p−1

Since T H om(j! F ′ ⊠ CS , OX×S ) is in Modrhol (DX×S/S ), the result follows.

End of the proof of Theorem 3. We now consider the general situation. We have the
tools to follow the outline of Kashiwara’s proof in the absolute case [6, §7.3]. We
may assume that F is an S-C-constructible sheaf. Then we argue by induction on the
dimension of a closed analytic set Z such that Z × S ⊂ Supp F . Let Z0 be a closed
analytic subset of Z such that
(1) F |(ZrZ0 )×S is locally constant coherent over p−1 OS .
(2) Z r Z0 is non singular.
By the induction hypothesis, RHS (FZ0 ×S ) belongs to Dbrhol (DX×S/S ). So we may
assume that FZ0 ×S = 0. The question is local on Z. Consider then a projective
morphism π : X ′ → X such that X ′ is non singular and π(X ′ ) = Z, Z0′ := π −1 (Z0 )
is a normal crossing divisor in X ′ and π : X ′ r Z0′ → Z r Z0 is an isomorphism.

Let F ′ = π −1 (F ). Then we obtain that F ′ |Z0′ ×S = 0, F(X
′ rZ ′ )×S is locally constant
0
′
coherent, and Rπ∗ F = F . Now the first part of Theorem 3 follows straightforwardly
from Proposition 3.28 and Lemma 4.3.
For the second part, we note that, since RHS (F ) is holonomic by the first part,
Lemma 3.19, together with [18, Cor. 3.9], implies D p Sol(RHS (F )) ≃ DF , and we
conclude by bi-duality [18, Prop. 2.23]. As a consequence, p Sol is essentially surjective
q.e.d.
from Dbrhol (DX×S/S ) to DbC-c (p−1 OS ).
Proof of Corollary 4. Set M = RHS (F ). By Proposition 2, it is enough to check
that, if F and DF are perverse, then so are p Sol M and p DR M . But p Sol M ≃ F
by Theorem 3, and Lemma 3.19 gives p DR M ≃ DF .
q.e.d.
4.2. A reminder on mixed twistor D-modules. Let A be a subset of R × C.
The theory of A -mixed twistor D-modules on a complex manifold X has been developed in [16], after the pure regular case considered in [22, 15], leading to the
category MTM(X)A . Pure objects in MTM(X)A are triples (M ′ , M ′′ , C) (satisfying various conditions) consisting of coherent modules M ′ , M ′′ over the sheaf of
rings RX×C of operators in z∂xi with coefficients in OX×C (z is the coordinate on
the factor C, corresponding to the “twistor line”), and C is a sesquilinear pairing that
does not need to be made precise here. For our purpose, we restrict the setting to
S = C∗ , and we identify in a natural way RX×C∗ with DX×S/S since z is invertible.

The holonomy property imposed to define MTM(X)A implies the holonomy property of M ′ , M ′′ on X × S as defined in [18, §3.4]. Moreover, M ′ , M ′′ are strict.
Mixed objects are endowed with a finite weight filtration W• whose graded pieces
are pure objects. We say that M underlies an A -mixed twistor D-module if it is
equal to the restriction to X × S of the component M ′′ of an object of MTM(X)A
(in particular, we do neither care about the pairing C nor the weight filtration).
We denote by Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ) the category whose objects are regular holonomic DX×S/S -modules underlying an object of MTM(X)A , and whose morphisms
are induced from those of MTM(X) := MTM(X)R×C (since MTM(X)A is a full subcategory of MTM(X)). It is an abelian category, as follows from the abelianity of
MTM(X)A and Proposition 2.2. In Theorem 5 we consider objects in this category
with A = R × {0}, but morphisms are in Mod(DX×S/S ). One can define similarly
Modhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ).
As an example, let us recall the main theorem of [15] which implies that, when X
is smooth projective, any irreducible regular holonomic DX -module (or any finite
direct sum of such) gives rise, by a suitable twistor deformation, to an object of
Modrhol,MTM (DX×S/S ). When all local monodromies of the corresponding de Rham
complex have eigenvalues of absolute value equal to one, we obtain an object of
Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ) with A = R × {0}, as in Theorem 5.
The projective pushforward and duality functors are defined in MTMA (cf. [16,
§7.2.2 & §13.3] for the most general setting) and their restriction to the component
′′
M|X×S
are the corresponding functors for DX×S/S -modules. Also, Kashiwara’s equivalence holds in MTM(X)A (cf. [16, Prop. 7.2.8]) and, together with Theorem 1.5, we
obtain that it holds in Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ).
If Y is a hypersurface in X, there is a localization functor in the category MTM(X),
denoted by [∗Y ] (cf. [16, §11.2.2]). It preserves MTM(X)A for any A , and when
A = R × {0}, it induces the functor M (∗Y ) := OX×S (∗(Y × S)) ⊗OX×S M . This
explains our choice of A in Theorem 5, that we fix from now on. We have a natural
morphism M → M (∗Y ) induced from the natural morphism in MTM(X)A , whose
kernel and cokernel are supported on Y .
Lemma 4.4. The DX×S/S -module M (∗Y ) is an object of Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S )
if M is so.
Proof. It is a matter of proving regularity. Since M is strict, so is M (∗Y ), by flatness
of OX×S (∗(Y × S)) over OX×S . As a consequence, the functor Li∗so acts on them
as i∗so , and we have i∗so (M (∗Y )) = (i∗so M )(∗Y ) := OX (∗Y ) ⊗OX (i∗so M ) for all so .
We know that holonomic regularity of DX -modules is preserved by localization along
q.e.d.
a hypersurface, so i∗so (M (∗Y )) is regular holonomic.
Lemma 4.5. Let π : X ′ → X be a morphism between complex manifolds and let M
be an object of Modhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ) (resp. Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S )). Then the
cohomology sheaves of the pullback complex D π ∗ M are holonomic (resp. regular holonomic) and strict.
Proof. We can decompose π as the composition of a projection X ′ × X → X with a
closed inclusion of a smooth submanifold. The case of a projection is easily treated
since it corresponds to the external product with OX×S over p−1 OS and can be lifted

T. MONTEIRO FERNANDES & C. SABBAH

34

at the level of MTMA (cf. [16, §11.4.2]). The regularity property is easily seen to be
preserved.
Since the question is local, the case of a closed inclusion can be obtained by considering successive inclusions of closed smooth hypersurfaces. If i : Y ֒→ X is smooth,
Kashiwara’s equivalence identifies H −1 D i∗ M and H 0 D i∗ M with the kernel and cokernel of M → M (∗Y ), and the formers are therefore in Modhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ),
resp. Modhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ), according to Lemma 4.4.
q.e.d.
Together with strictness, these will be the main properties used the proof below.
Remark 4.6. With A and S0 as in Remark 6 of the introduction, the statements above
hold true provided that we replace S = C∗ with S r S0 , and the proof of Theorem 5
given below extends with this proviso.
4.3. Proof of Theorem 5. Let M , N be holonomic DX×S/S -modules and let F be
an object of DbC-c (p−1 OS ). Recall (cf. [9, (2.6.7)]) that we have a natural isomorphism
in D(p−1 OS ):
RH om DX×S/S (M , RH om p−1 OS (F, OX×S )) ≃ RH om p−1 OS (F, Sol M ),
which is bi-functorial with respect to M , F . By composing with (3.18), we obtain a
bi-functorial morphism
RH om DX×S/S (M , RHS (F )[−dX ]) −→ RH om p−1 OS (F, Sol M ).
Choosing F = Sol N finally produces a bi-functorial morphism
(4.7)

RH om DX×S/S (M , RHS (p Sol N )) −→ RH om p−1 OS (Sol N , Sol M ).

If (4.7) is an isomorphism, then by taking global sections we find a bi-functorial
isomorphism
HomDX×S/S (M , RHS (p Sol N )) −→ Homp−1 OS (Sol N , Sol M )
and the isomorphism (∗) stated in Theorem 5 is obtained as that corresponding to
IdSol M when N = M , while (∗∗) follows by applying (∗) to N . We consider the
following three statements.
(a) If M , N ∈ Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ), then the complex
RH om DX×S/S (M , RHS (p Sol N ))
is S-C-constructible.
(b) If M , N ∈ Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ), then (4.7) is an isomorphism.
(c) If M ∈ Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ), then so does RHS (p Sol M ).
We also denote by (a)n (resp. (b)n , (c)n ) the statement (a) (resp. (b), (c)) for
M , N with support in X of dimension 6 n. The first part of Theorem 5 follows
from (b)n for any n > 0 by setting N = M . We will prove (c)n for any n > 0, which
will be enough, according to the lemma below.
Lemma 4.8. For any n > 0, the statements (a)n , (b)n and (c)n are equivalent.
Notice already that (b)n ⇒ (c)n is obtained exactly as (4.7) ⇒ Theorem 5.

Proof of (a)n ⇒ (b)n . Assume that (a)n holds true. We will prove that so does (b)n
by applying the functor Li∗so for any so ∈ S, to reduce to [6, Cor. 8.6].
Assume that M , N ∈ Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ) have support of dimension 6 n.
According to (a)n and to [18, Prop. 2.2], (4.7) is an isomorphism as soon as
Li∗so (4.7) is an isomorphism for any so ∈ S, since we already know that the complex
RH om p−1 OS (Sol N , Sol M ) is S-C-constructible, as Sol M , Sol N are so (cf. [18,
Th. 3.7]).
On the other hand, arguing as for [18, Prop. 2.1] by using [7, (A.10)] (together
with [9, (2.6.7)]), Li∗so (4.7) is the morphism
RH om DX (Li∗so M , Li∗so RHS (p Sol N )) −→ RH om C (Li∗so Sol N , Li∗so Sol M ),
and still by [18, Prop. 2.1], we can replace the right-hand side with
RH om C (Sol Li∗so N , Sol Li∗so M ).
On the other hand, by Proposition 3.29, we can replace Li∗so RHS (p Sol N ) with
T H om(Li∗so Sol N , OX ). In such a way, Li∗so (4.7) is an isomorphism, according to
[6, Cor. 8.6], and this ends the proof of (b)n .
q.e.d.
Proof of (c)n ⇒ (a)n . This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 4.9 below.
q.e.d.
Proposition 4.9. Let M , N ∈ Modhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ). Then RH om DX×S/S (M , N )
is S-C-constructible.
Proof. We shall apply the following relative versions of Lemmas 1.8, 1.9 and Proposition 4.7 of [5]. Since they are trivial adaptations of the original ones, we omit their
proof.
Lemma 4.10. Let M ∈ Db (DX×S/S )op and N ∈ Db (DX×S/S ). Then

isomorphism
L

RH om DX×S/S (M , N ) ≃ RH om DX×S/S (ΩnX×S/S , D′ M ⊗OX×S N )[dX ].
Lemma 4.12. Let M and N be two strict DX×S/S -modules. Then
L

M ⊗OX×S N ≃ D i∗X (M ⊠ N ),
where X is identified to the diagonal of X × X by the inclusion iX and ⊠ denotes the
external product over p−1 OS .
Let us now return to the proof of Proposition 4.9. The assumption on M and N
entails that D′ M ⊠ N ∈ Modhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ), according to [16, Th. 13.3.1 &
Prop. 11.4.6]. So the cohomology sheaves of D i∗X (D′ M ⊠ N ) are holonomic, according to Lemma 4.5. In view of Lemmas 4.10, 4.11 and 4.12, the result follows from
[18, Th 3.7], which entails that the de Rham complex of an object of Dbhol (DX×S/S )
is S-C-constructible.

4.4. End of the proof of Theorem 5. We first notice the following lemma.
Lemma 4.13. Let X ′ be a complex manifold and let Y ′ be a divisor with normal crossing
in X ′ . Let M ′ be a DX ′ ×S/S -module of D-type along Y ′ (Definition 2.10) underlying
an object of MTM(X ′ ). Then (c) holds for M ′ .
fF for some locally free p−1′ ′ OS Proof. By Proposition 2.11, we can write M ′ = E
X rY
′
module F . Then Lemma 4.2 gives M ≃ RHS (p Sol M ′ ). This implies that
RHS (p Sol M ′ ) underlies an object of MTM(X ′ ).
q.e.d.
Proof of (c)n by induction on n. We note that (a)0 reduces to the case X = pt by
Kashiwara’s equivalence recalled in Section 4.2, and is nothing but Lemma 4.13 with
X = pt. Hence (c)0 holds and we can assume n > 1. By induction, we assume any of
(a)n−1 , (b)n−1 and (c)n−1 is true, according to Lemma 4.8.
Reduction to the localized case. As explained in Section 4.2, the main reason for restricting to the category Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ) is that, if Y is a hypersurface in X,
we have a localization morphism M → M (∗Y ) in this category (Lemma 4.4). The
localization enables us to argue by induction on the dimension of the support of M .
We will prove (a)n with N = M , and this will imply (c)n for M , according to
Lemma 4.8. We are thus proving a constructibility property, which is a local one
(cf. Section 1.2), so the question is local on X. Let Z ⊂ X denote the support of M .
We assume that dim Z = n.
Together with the induction hypothesis, we also assume that there exists a hypersurface Y in X intersecting Z in dimension 6 n − 1 such that (c)n holds true
for M (∗Y ) ∈ Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ). By the abelianity of the latter category
(cf. Section 4.2), the kernel K , image I and cokernel C of the natural morphism
M → M (∗Y ) are objects of Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ), and K , C have support of
dimension 6 n − 1. We can thus apply (c)n−1 to them by the induction hypothesis.
From the distinguished triangle
+1
RHS p Sol I −→ RHS p Sol M [∗Y ] −→ RHS p Sol C −−−→
and according to Proposition 4.9 applied to the last two terms, we find that
RH om DX×S/S (M , RHS (p Sol I )) is S-C-constructible. Then, from the distinguished
triangle
+1
RHS p Sol M −→ RHS p Sol I −→ RHS p Sol K [1] −−−→
and Proposition 4.9 applied similarly, we conclude that
RH om DX×S/S (M , RHS (p Sol M ))
is S-C-constructible, that is, (a)n holds for N = M . Then (b)n for N = M also
holds, and then (c)n for M too.
q.e.d.
Proof of (c)n in the localized case. Recall that we work locally on X. Given M ∈
Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ), we wish to find a hypersurface Y intersecting Supp M = Z
in dimension 6 n − 1 such that (c)n holds true for N := M (∗Y ). We choose Y such
that, moreover, Z ∗ := Z r Z ∩ Y is a smooth manifold of dimension n and M|XrY
is the pushforward (by the inclusion Z ∗ ֒→ X r Y ) of an object underlying a smooth
twistor D-module on Z ∗ , i.e., an admissible variation of twistor structure (cf. [16, §9]).
Lemma 4.4 entails that N ∈ Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ).

We can then choose a projective morphism π : X ′ → X such that X ′ is a complex
manifold, π −1 (Y ) = Y ′ is a normal crossing divisor in X ′ , and π induces an iso∼
morphism X ′ r Y ′ −→ Z r Z ∩ Y (hence dX ′ = dZ ). We set M ′ = (D π ∗ N )[dZ − dX ].
It satisfies M ′ = H 0 (M ′ ) = H 0 (M ′ )(∗Y ′ ). By Lemma 4.5, it is an object of
Modrhol (DX ′ ×S/S ) and it is strict. We conclude that M ′ is of D-type (Definition 2.10)
and, by Lemma 4.13, (c) holds for M ′ .
On the other hand, the adjunction isomorphism of Corollary 1.8 induces an isomorphism
∼
HomDX ′ ×S/S (M ′ , M ′ ) −→ HomDX×S/S (D π∗ M ′ , N ),
and IdM ′ provides the adjunction morphism D π∗ M ′ → M . Note that D π∗ M ′ =
(D π∗ M ′ )(∗Y ), so finally D π∗ M ′ ≃ N . We end the proof that (c)n holds for N by
considering the isomorphisms
1.17(c)
4.13
3.28
N ≃ D π∗ M ′ ≃ D π∗ RHS (p Sol M ′ ) ≃ RHS (Rπ∗ p Sol M ′ ) ≃ RHS (p Sol N ).

Proof of the functoriality in Theorem 5. Let ϕ : M → N be a morphism in the category Mod(DX×S/S ) and assume that M , N are objects of Modrhol,MTMA (DX×S/S ),
so that (4.7) is an isomorphism, according to the above proof. By the bi-functoriality
of (4.7), we have a commutative diagram

If ηM : M −→ RHS (p Sol M ) corresponds to IdSol M via the horizontal isomorphism,
and similarly for ηN , then the diagram shows that (RHS p Sol ϕ) ◦ ηM = ηN ◦ ϕ, since
both correspond to Sol ϕ via the middle horizontal isomorphism.

Appendix. Locally constant sheaves of p−1 OS -modules
In this appendix, S denotes a complex analytic space which is not necessarily
reduced, Sred denotes the associated reduced space and OS denotes its structure
sheaf (a sheaf of rings on Sred ). When there is no risk of confusion, we will use the
notation S instead of Sred as the underlying space. We state the results we need
without proofs, which are straightforward.
An S-constant sheaf of p−1 OS -modules on X × S is a sheaf of the form p−1 G for
some sheaf G of OS -modules. We say that F is p−1 OS -coherent if G is OS -coherent.
Similarly, there is the notion of S-constant sheaf of C-vector spaces.
Proposition A.1 (S-constant sheaves). Let X be a topological space. An S-constant
sheaf F of p−1 OS -modules on X × S satisfies the following properties.
(1) If f : Y → X is a continuous map, then f −1 F is S-constant on Y .
(2) If U ⊂ X is a connected open set in X and x ∈ U , the natural morphism
pU,∗ F → i−1
x F is an isomorphism of OS -modules. Conversely, if X is a connected

topological space and F is a sheaf of p−1 OS -modules on X × S such that the natural
morphism p∗ F → i−1
x F is an isomorphism of OS -modules for each x ∈ X, then F is
S-constant. In particular, if X is a connected topological space and G is a sheaf of
OS -modules, the sheaf p∗ p−1 G is naturally identified to G.
(3) If G, G′ are OS -modules, there are canonical isomorphisms:
p−1 (G ⊕ G′ ) ≃ p−1 G ⊕ p−1 G′ ,

p−1 (G ⊗OS G′ ) ≃ p−1 G ⊗p−1 OS p−1 G′ ,

and if moreover G is OS -coherent or X is locally connected
p−1 H om OS (G, G′ ) ≃ H om p−1 OS (p−1 G, p−1 G′ ).
(4) The functor p−1 , from the category of OS -modules to that of p−1 OS -modules
is exact. Moreover, if X is connected, this functor is fully faithful.
(5) If X is a connected topological space, the kernel, the image and the cokernel of
a morphism between S-constant sheaves of p−1 OS -modules are S-constant sheaves of
p−1 OS -modules.
We say that a sheaf F on X × S of p−1 OS -modules is S-locally constant if each
point (x, s) ∈ X × S has a neighborhood on which F is S-constant. We then say that
F is p−1 OS -coherent if it is locally (on X × S) isomorphic to the pull-back by p of a
OS -coherent sheaf.
Proposition A.2. If X is connected and locally connected, and if F is S-locally constant
on X × S, then there exists a sheaf G of OS -modules such that, locally on X × S, we
have F ≃ p−1 G. We can choose for G any of the sheaves i−1
x F for x ∈ X. Moreover,
F is p−1 OS -coherent if and only if G is OS -coherent.
In other words, the isomorphisms are locally defined, but the sheaf G exists globally
on S. However, this sheaf is not unique.
Proposition A.3. Assume that X is locally connected. Let F be a sheaf of p−1 OS modules on X × S. Then F is an S-locally constant sheaf of p−1 OS -modules if and
only if it is S-locally constant as a sheaf of C-vector spaces.
Proposition A.4. If F, F ′ are S-locally constant on X × S, and ϕ : F → F ′ is p−1 OS linear, then F ⊕ F ′ , F ⊗p−1 OS F ′ , H om p−1 OS (F, F ′ ), ker ϕ, im ϕ and coker ϕ are also
S-locally constant. If F and F ′ are moreover p−1 OS -coherent, so are these sheaves.
Corollary A.5. The category of S-locally constant sheaves of p−1 OS -modules (resp. and
p−1 OS -coherent) is a full abelian subcategory of the category of sheaves of p−1 OS modules.
Corollary A.6. Let 0 → F ′ → F → F ′′ → 0 be an exact sequence of sheaves of p−1 OS modules. If F, F ′ (resp. F, F ′′ ) are S-locally constant (resp. and coherent), then so
are F ′ (resp. F ′′ ).
Proposition A.7. Set I = [0, 1]. Let F be an S-locally constant sheaf of p−1 OS -modules
on X × S, with X = I or X = I × I. Then F is S-constant.
Let γ : I → X be a continuous map, with γ(0) = xo , γ(1) = x1 . If F is S-locally
constant on X × S, then so is γ −1 F on I × S, hence it is S-constant, and it defines
∼

an isomorphism Tγ : i−1
xo F −→ ix1 F of OS -modules.

Proposition A.8. If γ and γ ′ are homotopic with fixed endpoints, then Tγ = Tγ ′ . If γ
and γ ′ can be composed, we have Tγ·γ ′ = Tγ ◦ Tγ ′ .
Let us now assume that X is connected and locally path-connected, and let us fix
a base point xo ∈ X. We consider the category RepOS (π1 (X, xo )) whose objects are
representations ρ : π1 (X, xo ) → AutOS (G) for some sheaf G of OS -modules and the
morphisms ρ → ρ′ are OS -linear morphisms ϕ : G → G′ which satisfy ρ′ (γ) ◦ ϕ =
ϕ ◦ ρ(γ) for any γ ∈ π1 (X, xo ).
Given an S-locally constant sheaf F on X × S, Proposition A.8 shows that γ 7→ Tγ
defines a representation ρ : π1 (X, xo ) → AutOS (i−1
xo F ), called the monodromy representation attached to F . A morphism of S-locally constant sheaves obviously gives
rise to a morphism of their monodromy representation. We thus get a functor from
the category of S-constant local systems of p−1 OS -modules to RepOS (π1 (X, xo )).
Proposition A.9. The monodromy representation functor is an equivalence of categories.
Remark A.10 (Riemann-Hilbert). By the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for coherent
S-local systems proved in [2, Th. 2.23 p. 14], the functor F 7→ OX×S ⊗p−1 OS F induces
an equivalence between the category of coherent S-locally constant sheaves of p−1 OS modules and the category of coherent OX×S -modules F equipped with an integrable
relative connection ∇ : F → Ω1X×S/S ⊗OX×S F .
Proposition A.11. Let F be a coherent S-locally constant local system on X × S. Then
the following properties are equivalent:
(1) there exists an OS -locally free sheaf of finite rank G such that locally F ≃ p−1 G;
(2) any coherent OS -module G such that locally F ≃ p−1 G is OS -locally free of
finite rank.
If S is a complex manifold with its reduced structure, (1) and (2) are also equivalent to
(3) the dual DF := RH om p−1 OS (F, p−1 OS ) is an S-locally constant sheaf.
If X is connected and locally path-connected, and if π1 (X, xo ) has finite presentation, so that Hom(π1 (X, xo ), GLr (C)) is naturally an affine complex algebraic variety,
then (1) and (2) are also equivalent to
(4) for any open subset V of S on which some G as in (2) is free or rank r, giving
F|X×V is equivalent to giving a holomorphic map V → Hom(π1 (X, xo ), GLr (C)).
Proposition A.12. Let Y be a contractible topological space and let F be an S-locally
constant sheaf on Y × S. Then Rk pY,∗ F = 0 for each k > 1 and F is constant.
