Let K ⊂ R2 be an o-symmetric convex body, and K ∗ its polar
body. Then we have |K| · |K ∗ | ≥ 8, with equality if and only if K is a
parallelogram. (|·| denotes volume). If K ⊂ R2 is a convex body, with
o ∈ int K, then |K| · |K ∗ | ≥ 27/4, with equality if and only if K is a
triangle and o is its centroid. If K ⊂ R2 is a convex body, then we have
|K| · |[(K − K)/2)]∗ | ≥ 6, with equality if and only if K is a triangle.
These theorems are due to Mahler and Reisner, Mahler and Meyer,
and to Eggleston, respectively. We show an analogous theorem: if K
has n-fold rotational symmetry about o, then |K|·|K ∗ | ≥ n2 sin2 (π/n),
with equality if and only if K is a regular n-gon of centre o. We
will also give stability variants of these four inequalities, both for the
body, and for the centre of polarity. For this we use the BanachMazur distance (from parallelograms, or triangles), or its analogue
with similar copies rather than affine transforms (from regular n-gons),
respectively. The stability variants are sharp, up to constant factors.
We extend the inequality |K| · |K ∗ | ≥ n2 sin2 (π/n) to bodies with
o ∈ int K, which contain, and are contained in, two regular n-gons,
the vertices of the contained n-gon being incident to the sides of the
containing n-gon. Our key lemma is a stability estimate for the area
product of two sectors of convex bodies polar to each other. To several
of our statements we give several proofs; in particular, we give a new
proof for the theorem of Mahler-Reisner.

Notations

We write o for the origin, h·, ·i for the scalar product, k · k for the Euclidean
norm, [x1 , . . . , xk ] for the convex hull of {x1 , . . . , xk }, and | · | for the volume
(area in R2 ). We write vert (·), int (·), ∂(·), for the vertex set of a convex
polytope, or interior, or boundary of a set in Rd .
A convex body in Rd is a compact convex set with non-empty interior. If
o ∈ int K, then its polar (w.r.t. the unit sphere with centre o) is
K ∗ = {x ∈ Rd : ∀y ∈ K hx, yi ≤ 1}.
If A : Rd → Rd is a non-singular linear map, then (AK)∗ = (A−1 )∗ K ∗ ,
where (A−1 )∗ is the transpose of the inverse of A. It is known (Santaló [69],
or Meyer-Pajor [55]), that there exists a unique point s(K) ∈ int K, called
Santaló point of K, such that
| (K − s(K))∗ | = min {|(K − z)∗ | : z ∈ int K}.
Additionally, the origin is the centroid of (K − s(K))∗ . The uniqueness and
the affine invariance of the Santaló point yields that s(K) = o if K is osymmetric, or if d = 2 and K has n-fold symmetry about o for some n ≥ 3.
For convex bodies K, L ⊂ Rd , the Banach-Mazur distance δBM (K, L)
is min {λ2 /λ1 | λ1 , λ2 ∈ (0, ∞), ∃ affinity A, ∃x ∈ Rd , λ1 A(K) ⊂ L ⊂
λ2 A(K) + x}. If we allow for A only similarities, then we obtain the defs
s
(K, L). If both K, L are
(K, L). (Clearly, δBM (K, L) ≤ δBM
inition of δBM
o-symmetric, or d = 2 and both have n-fold rotational symmetry about o,
s
with n ≥ 3 an integer, then in the definition of δBM (K, L), or δBM
(K, L), we
may assume x = o.) We will write T, P, Rn for a triangle, parallelogram, or
regular n-gon, respectively.
We write κd = π d/2 /Γ(d/2 + 1) for the volume of the unit ball in the
d-dimensional Euclidean space.

Introduction

Generalities. Let K ⊂ Rd be a convex body, with o ∈ int K. Blaschke [8]
was the first who considered the so called volume product |K| · |K ∗ | of the
body K, and proved that for d ≤ 3, and o the barycentre of K, its maximum
is attained, e.g., if K is an ellipsoid. He was motivated by the investigation
5

of the affine geometry of convex bodies, e.g., of the so called affine surface
area (a definition cf. in [43], or [11]), that is intimately related to the volume
product (cf. [43], [11]). The volume product is invariant under non-singular
linear transformations, cf. [43], p. 109. The investigation of the question of
the lower estimate of the volume product was initiated by Mahler [44], [45].
He had in view applications in the geometry of numbers (i.e., investigation of
the relation of convex, or more generally, of star-bodies, and lattices, i.e., nonsingular linear images of Zd in Rd ). The volume product, in particular, for
o-symmetric K, is a basic quantity, that later has arisen in several branches
of mathematics, cf. later in this introduction.
Lower bound, o-symmetric case. For a while we suppose that K is
o-symmetric. Mahler [45], for d ≥ 2, conjectured for the volume product the
lower bound 4d /d! = d−d (4e + o(1))d , and proved the lower bound 4d /(d!)2 .
It is usually credited to Saint Raymond [68] that this conjectured lower bound
is attained not only for parallelotopes and cross-polytopes. However, this
had already been observed by Guggenheimer [30] some years earlier, where
the way of obtaining all examples of [68] had already been described. These
examples are the following. Beginning with [−1, 1] ⊂ R, we define inductively
convex bodies in Rd , from examples in lower dimensions: if d = d1 + d2 is
an arbitrary decomposition of d as a sum of positive integers d1 , d2, then
for the already defined bodies in Rdi we take either their Minkowski sum,
or the convex hull of their union. The Banach spaces with these unit balls
are called Hansen-Lima spaces, and their unit balls are called Hansen-Lima
bodies. They are called also Hanner bodies. Since they were introduced
already by Hammer [31] in 1956, while Hansen-Lima [32] dates to 1981, it
would be more correct to call them Hanner-Hansen-Lima spaces, and bodies.
Also the well known book of Grünbaum on polytopes [29] calls these bodies
Hanner polytopes. Moreover, [31] and [32] proved two characterizations of
these convex bodies K: (1) (a Helly type property): K is o-symmetric, and if
three translates of K pairwise intersect, then their intersection is not empty.
(2): K is an o-symmetric convex polytope, and for any two disjoint faces (of
any dimensions ≤ d − 1), say, K1 , K2 , of K, there are two distinct parallel
supporting hyperplanes Π1 and Π2 of K, such that K1 ⊂ Π1 , and K2 ⊂ Π2 .
[68] conjectured that the volume product attains its minimum exactly for
the Hanner-Hansen-Lima bodies. (However, the claim of [30] that its author
settled the 3-dimensional case is incorrect.)
Mahler [44] proved the sharp lower bound |K| · |K ∗ | ≥ 8 for d = 2 and K
o-symmetric. Morerover, [44] showed that, for K a polygon, the lower bound
6

is attained, for the o-symmetric case, if and only if K is a parallelogram.
The above lower estimate of [45] for Rd , for the o-symmetric case, was
sharpened to 2d κd /(d!dd)1/2 by Dvoretzky-Rogers [16], and to κ2d /dd/2 by
Bambah [4]. Then it has become clear that the volume product is very important in functional analysis, where it is just the product of the volumes of
the unit balls of a finite dimensional Banach space and its dual. This has importance in the so called local theory of Banach spaces, i.e., the asymptotic
study of finite dimensional Banach spaces, of high dimension, cf. Pisier’s
book [62]. A number of other geometric characteristics of these Banach
spaces have a connection to the volume product. Therefore functional analysts became strongly interested in the subject, which resulted in ever better
lower estimates, namely d−d (log d)−d ·constd by Gordon-Reisner [27] and later
by Kuperberg, G. [39], and to d−d · constd by Bourgain-Milman [14] (with an
unspecified constant). Quite recently (π/4)d−1 4d /d! = d−d (eπ + o(1))d was
proved by Kuperberg, G. [40]. Observe that the quotient of Kuperberg G.’s
estimate and the conjectured minimum is (π/4 + o(1))d. The paper Nazarov
[59] proved the bit weaker estimate (4d /d!)(π/4)3d, using an unexpected connection of the volume product problem to the theory of functions of several
complex variables.
A class of o-symmetric convex bodies in Rd , for which the lower bound
4d /d! is known, is the class of (non-singular) linear images of convex bodies symmetric with respect to all coordinate hyperplanes (also called unconditional convex bodies), cf. Saint Raymond [68]. The equality cases were
proved by Meyer [52] and Reisner [65] — these are just the Hanner-HansenLima bodies. The combinatorial aspect of the proof was later studied by Bollobás-Reader-Radcliffe [9]. Actually [68] proved this inequality for a larger
class of o-symmetric convex bodies. These are the ones, for which the associated norm satisfies the following. There exists a base, such that for
the coordinates x1 , . . . , xd w.r.t. this base, the projections (x1 , . . . , xd ) →
(x1 , . . . xi−1 , xi+1 , . . . xd ), where 1 ≤ i ≤ d, are contractions. Moreover, [68]
also extended his inequality, for unconditional convex bodies, in the following
way. Let k ≥ 2 be an integer, let an unconditional norm k · k on Rk be given
(i.e., the unit ball is unconditional), and let d1 , ..., dk ≥ 1 be integers. Let
Ki ⊂ Rdi be o-symmetric
convex bodies, which are the unit balls of norms
Qk
di
k·ki . We consider i=1 R , with the norm k(kxi ki )k (where xi ∈ Rdi ), where
we consider k · ki as fixed, and k · k as variable. Then the volume product
of the unit ball of this
P norm attains its minimum, e.g., for the cases, when
k(λ1 , ..., λk )k equals i |λi |, or maxi |λi |.

Mahler’s conjecture in the o-symmetric case, together with the conjecture
about the equality cases, is also proved for convex polytopes with (at most)
2d + 2 vertices or facets, for d ≤ 8, cf. Lopez-Reisner [42].
Mahler’s conjecture is also proved for zonoids K in Rd (i.e., limits in
the Hausdorff-metric of finite sums of segments), with centre at o, and with
int K 6= ∅. This is due to Reisner [63], [64], and in these papers it is also
proved that the lower bound for zonoids is attained if and only if K is a
parallelotope, with centre at o. Later, a simpler proof was given by GordonMeyer-Reisner [26]. Observe that this settles the case of equality for osymmetric convex bodies in R2 , since each such body is a zonoid. Both
[63], [64] use the connection of the volume product problem with stochastic
geometry (geometric probability), as is done also later in Böröczky, K. J.Hug [12], in another context. A variety of other connections to geometric
probability are contained in Thompson’s book [73], in particular in Ch. VI.
[63] also gave an analogue of the last mentioned Saint Raymond’s theorem:
if each Ki , there considered, is either a zonoid, or the polar of a zonoid,
then |K| · |K ∗ | ≥ 4d /d!. Reisner [65] clarified the equality cases in the last
mentioned Saint Raymond’s theorem ([68]): this is the case if and only if k · k
is a norm of a Hanner-Hansen-Lima space.
Barthe-Fradelizi in the paper [6] proved that if K is a convex body and P
is a regular convex polytope in Rd such that the origin is the centroid of P , and
K has all the symmetries of P — thus the origin is also their common Santaló
point — then |K|·|K ∗ | ≥ |P |·|P ∗|, with equality if and only if K is a dilate of
P or of P ∗ . Its particular case for d = 2 is given in a bit stronger form in our
Corollary 4; however, we have as well a stability variant of our Corollary 4, in
our Theorem 5. [6] has some generalizations of the above cited inequality as
well. Let d = d1 + ... + dk be a decomposition of d into positive integers. Let
us have in Rd a convex body K, whose symmetry group O(K) (i.e., the group
of congruences mapping K onto K) contains the group O(P1 ) × ... × O(Pk ),
where each Pi is either a regular convex polytope or a ball in Rdi , of centre o.
Then we have V (K)V (K ∗ ) ≥ V (P1 × ... × Pk )V ((P1 × ... × Pk )∗ ). Here the
equality cases are not clarified. However, there are a lot of equality cases:
for each i, we may take Pi or Pi∗ , and may construct from these inductively
new bodies, like in case of the Hanner-Hansen-Lima bodies. We remark that
our §4 has a considerable overlap with [6].
Upper bound, o-symmetric case. In the o-symmetric case, the sharp
upper bound is κ2d = d−d (2eπ + o(1))d , and it is attained if and only if K is
an o-symmetric ellipsoid, which is due to Blaschke [8] (d ≤ 3) and Santaló
8

[69] (for general d), with the equality case proved by Saint Raymond [68].
Ball [2] and Meyer-Pajor [54] pointed out that a proof of the inequality can
be given by Steiner symmetrization: namely that Steiner symmetrization
does not decrease |K| · |K ∗ |. A number of simplifications of these proofs has
appeared.
Fradelizi-Meyer [21] also considers the upper estimate for the volume
product for measures other than the Lebesgue measure.
Lower bound, general case. As an application to the original volume product problem, Meyer-Reisner [56] gives the following statement. If
all non-empty intersections of K with horizontal hyperplanes are positive
homothets of a given (d − 1)-dimensional convex body L, and these intersections have their Santaló points (taken in their affine hull) on a line, then
|K| · |K − s(K)|/(|L| · |L − s(L)|) attains its minimum (d + 1)d+1 /d d+2 (that
is independent of L), if and only if K is a cone, with base a translate of
L. (Examples of such bodies are bodies rotationally symmetric about the
xd -axis.)
Mahler [44] proved the sharp lower bound |K| · |K ∗ | ≥ 27/4, for K ⊂ R2
a convex body, with o ∈ int K. Morerover, [44] showed that, for K a polygon,
the lower bound is attained, for the case o ∈ int K, if and only if K is a
triangle with barycentre at o. Later Meyer [53] showed that for the case
d = 2 and o ∈ int K, the lower bound is attained only for triangles, with
barycentre at o. A simpler proof of this is contained in Meyer-Reisner [57],
Theorem 15.
For the case o ∈ int K, Mahler [45] conjectured that |K| · |K ∗ | ≥ (d +
1)d+1 /(d!)2 ∼ const · d−d e2d , where equality stands only
 for a simplex with
barycentre at o. The lower bound (d + 1)d+1 / dd (d!)2 is due to Mahler [46],
that was sharpened to κ2d /(d!)2 by Bambah [4], to constd · d−d by BourgainMilman [14] (with an unspecified constant), while (π/(2e))d−1 (d+1)d+1 /(d!)2
has been recently proved by Kuperberg, G. [40]. Observe that the quotient of
this estimate and the conjectured minimum is (π/(2e) + o(1))d . Mahler’s
conjecture, for the asymmetric case, together with the conjecture about the
equality cases, is proved for convex polytopes with at most d + 3 vertices or
facets, cf. Meyer-Reisner [57], Theorem 10.
Observe that, for bodies K having all symmetries of a regular simplex, the
Barthe-Fradelizi result, from [6], above cited, implies Mahler’s conjecture, in
the asymmetric case, together with the cases of equality. [6] contains also
the following. Let us have in Rd a convex body K, such that the group of

9

affinities preserving K contains not necessarily orthogonal symmetries w.r.t.
affine hyperplanes H1 , ..., Hm , where ∩m
i=1 Hi is a one-point set. Then we
have |K| · | (K − s(K))∗ | ≥ (d + 1)d+1 /(d!)2 , with equality if and only if K
is a simplex. In other words, for these bodies Mahler’s conjecture, in the
asymmetric case, about the lower bound of the volume product is true.
Cf. also, e.g., the recent papers Hug [33], Klartag-Milman [38], CampiGronchi [15], Meyer-Reisner [57], Fradelizi-Meyer [21], Fradelizi-Meyer [22],
Fradelizi-Meyer [23], Böröczky, K. J. [11], Lin, Youjiang and Leng, Gangsong [41], Böröczky, K. J.-Hug [12], Fradelizi-Gordon-Meyer-Reisner [20],
Fradelizi-Meyer [24], and the references therein.
Upper bound, general case. One has for |K| · |[K − s(K)]∗ | the
upper estimate κ2d , with equality if and only if K is an ellipsoid, cf. Blaschke
[8], Santaló [69] for the inequality, and Petty [61], Meyer-Pajor [55] for the
cases of equality. Again, [55] used for the proof, among others, Steiner’s
symmetrization, but in a more involved manner, than in the o-symmetric
case. Recently Artstein-Avidan-Klartag-Milman [1] and Meyer-Reisner [57]
showed that Steiner symmetrization proves the Blaschke-Santaló inequality,
namely that Steiner symmetrization does not decrease |K| · |(K − s(K))∗ |
(the case when K is o-symmetric, was cited above). [57] proved in this
way also the case of equality. Actually the same upper estimate κ2d holds for
|K|·|[K −b(K)]∗|, where b(K) is the barycentre of K, and again with equality
if and only if K is an ellipsoid, cf. [43], p. 165. Actually, if s(K), or b(K),
is o, then b(K ∗ ), or s(K ∗ ), is o, respectively, cf. [43], p. 165, which explains
the symmetric role of the Santaló point, and the barycentre.
A general reference to these problems, and their connections to other
affine inequalities for convex bodies, is Lutwak [43]. A more recent survey
on the volume product is Thompson [74].
Eggleston-Zhang type problems. For another generalization of the
volume product, from the o-symmetric case to the general case, Eggleston [17]
proved the following. If K ⊂ R2 is a convex body, then |K| · |[(K − K)/2]∗ | ≥
6, with equality if and only if K is a triangle.
A generalization of this to Rd , however not for polar bodies, but for polars of projection
bodies, was given by Zhang [75]: his inequality is |K|d−1 ·

|(ΠK)∗ )| ≥ 2d
d−d , with equality if and only if K is a simplex. (The prod
jection body ΠK of a convex body K ⊂ Rd is the o-symmetric convex body
— actually a zonoid — whose support function at a point u ∈ S d−1 is given
as the (d − 1)-volume of the orthogonal projection of K to the linear subspace orthogonal to u. Observe that for d = 2 the bodies ΠK and K − K
10

can be obtained from each other by a rotation through π/2 about the origin, hence their polars have equal areas.) Böröczky, K. J. [10], Theorem 3
proved an almost sharp
simplex,
 stability version of this inequality: for S a1/d
2d −d
d−1
∗
|K| · |(ΠK) )| ≤ d d (1 + ε) implies δBM (K, S) ≤ 1 + constd · ε , while
the actual error term cannot be less than constd · ε1/(d−1) ([10], Example 19),
which quantity is conjectured to be the exact order of the error term.
For the original question about the lower estimate of |K| · |[(K − K)/2]∗ |,
for K ⊂ Rd a convex body, the sharp lower bound is conjectured to be
(d + 1)2d /d! ∼ 2d ed d−d (1 + o(1))d , with equality for K a simplex, cf. [47].
(A calculation, that for K a simplex we have equality, is given in [51].)
This quantity occurs in a number of problems of the theory of packings
and coverings, and more generally in density estimates of sytems of convex sets (for the non-symmetric case seemingly even more than the original
volume product), cf. e.g., [47], [48], [50] Theorem 5.2, Remark 5.3. Since
|K|·|[(K −K)/2]∗ | = [|K|/|(K −K)/2|]·[|(K −K)/2|·|[(K −K)/2]∗ |], Kuper
berg G.’s result and the difference body inequality (i.e., |K − K|/|K| ≤ 2d
,
d

2d
∗
d−1 d
cf. Rogers-Shephard [67]) imply |K|·|[(K −K)/2] | ≥ (π/4) 8 / d! d ∼
d−d (eπ/2)d (1 + o(1))d . Observe that the quotient of this value and the conjectured value is (π/4 + o(1))d .
Florian’s inequalities. A question of another character was treated by
Florian in [18] and [19]. He investigated convex bodies in R2 , contained in the
unit circle about o, and showed the sharp estimate |K| + |K ∗ | ≥ 6, attained
for a square inscribed to the unit circle. He gave as well a stability result in
a more special case. See references to earlier results of this type as well in
[18] and [19].
Local and global stability results. A stability version of the BlaschkeSantaló inequality, for d ≥ 3, is proved by Böröczky, K. J. [11] (stability
meant for the Banach-Mazur distance). For d = 2 the same is done in BallBöröczky, K. J. [3], Böröczky, K. J.-Makai, Jr. [13].
After essentially finishing our paper we were informed from the paper
Nazarov-Petrov-Ryabogin-Zvavitch [60] about the following theorem. For
d ≥ 2 an integer there exist εd > 0 and cd > 0 with the following properties.
If the Banach-Mazur distance of an o-symmetric convex body K ⊂ Rd from
the class of parallelotopes is 1 + ε ∈ (1, 1 + εd ], then the volume product
|K| · |K ∗ | is at least [4d /d!](1 + cd ε). Here the order of the error term is
optimal. Together with the paper Böröczky, K. J.-Hug [12] (which calls the
attention to the fact that, although [60] states its theorem in the form that
11

parallelotopes are strict local minima, the proof in [60] actually gives this
stronger, namely, stability variant, cited above; cf. [60], §4), this gives the
following. For the case of o-symmetric zonoids K in Rd , with int K 6= ∅, in
particular, for o-symmetric convex bodies in R2 , we have global stability of
the parallelotopes, i.e., the above inequality, without a restriction of the form
0 < ε ≤ εd . For R2 , this is our Theorem 1, without the specification of the
coefficient of ε in the lower estimate. Once more, the order of the error term
is optimal.
Since optimality of the order of the above two error terms was not proved
in [60] or [12], we show it. Of course, it suffices to deal with the case of
o-symmetric zonoids only, for which we give the following example. For
d = 2 we take [−1, 1]2 , and cut off small isosceles right triangles of legs
ε at each vertex. For d ≥ 3 we take the product of this example with
[−1, 1]d−2 . Thus we obtain an o-symmetric zonoid, K, say. Then |K| ·
|K ∗ | = (4d /d!) (1 + c1 ε + O(ε2 )), for some c1 > 0. Clearly δBM (K, [−1, 1]d ) ≤
1 + c2 ε + O(ε2), for some c2 > 0. Now we estimate δBM (K, [−1, 1]d ) =
δBM (K ∗ , conv {±ei | 1 ≤ i ≤ d}) from below, by 1 + c3 ε + O(ε2), for some
c3 > 0 (the ei ’s are the standard unit vectors). Thus, we have to consider
cross-polytopes Ci contained in K ∗ , and Co containing K ∗ , with centres at
o. Of course, it suffices to show
|Ci |/|K ∗| ≤ 1 − c4 ε + O(ε2 ), for some c4 > 0 .

(1)

We may assume that vert Ci ⊂ vert K ∗ . Here vert K ∗ consists of ±ei , for
1 ≤ i ≤ d, and still four vertices, close to (±e1 ± e2 )/2. If for some i ≥ 3 we
have ±ei 6∈ Ci , then |Ci | = 0. If ±e1 , ±e2 ∈ Ci , then (1) holds. Otherwise,
e.g., ±(1/2, 1/2) ∈ vert Ci , and either e.g. ±e1 ∈ vert Ci , or ±(1/2, −1/2) ∈
vert Ci ; in both cases |Ci |/|K ∗| = 1/2 + O(ε). So (1) is shown.
In a still more recent paper, namely Kim-Reisner [36], there is proved
the asymmetric variant of the theorem of Nazarov-Petrov-Ryabogin-Zvavitch
[60]. For d ≥ 2 an integer there exist ε′d > 0 and c′d > 0 with the following
properties. If the Banach-Mazur distance of a convex body K ⊂ Rd , with
o ∈ int K, from the class of simplices is 1 + ε ∈ (1, 1 + ε′d ], then the volume
product |K| · |K ∗ | is at least [(d + 1)d+1 /(d!)2](1 + c′d ε). Again, also here the
order of the error term is optimal. (An example is obtained from a regular
simplex of edge length 1, and barycentre o, with small regular simplices of
edge lengths ε cut off at each vertex. The argument showing optimality of
the order of the error term is like above.)

Functional variants. Also variants of the volume product problem have
been treated. E.g., functional forms of the inverse Blaschke-Santaló inequality (i.e., of the lower estimate of the volume product), cf. Meyer-Reisner [56]
(which states in p. 219 that a special case of its Theorem is the Mahler-Meyer
theorem), functional forms of the Blaschke-Santaló inequality, cf. FradeliziMeyer [21] (which states in pp. 386-387, 393-394 that its results imply the
Blaschke-Santaló theorem — with the equality case for o-symmetry) and
Artstein-Avidan-Klartag-Milman [1] (which states in p. 37 that its results
imply the Blaschke-Santaló theorem, with the case of equality — however,
this holds, strictly speaking, only in the o-symmetric case, cf. this introduction, the second paragraph following this paragraph).
Functional variants are of different natures. E.g., the case of “fractional
dimension”, cf. Fradelizi-Meyer, [24]. Also, convex bodies can be generalized
to log-concave functions, i.e., functions Rd → [0, ∞), whose logarithm is
concave. To a convex body K ⊂ Rd , with o ∈ int K, one has to associate the
log-concave function exp(−kxk2K /2), whereR k · kK is the asymmetric norm
with unit ball K. Then V (K) = constd · Rd f (x) dx, so here the integral
on the right hand side is the proper substitute of V (K). Moreover, the
polarity between K and K ∗ goes over to the following. If we take the negative
logarithms of two log-concave functions f and f ∗ , then they are the Legendre
transforms of each other. The Legendre transform of a function ϕ : Rd →
[−∞, ∞] is Lϕ : Rd → [−∞, ∞], where
(Lϕ)(y) := sup{hx, yi − ϕ(x) | x ∈ Rd } .
Thus, the subject of investigation is
Z

where one supposes

f (x) dx ∈ (0, ∞) .

Cf. the nice expositions in Artstein-Avidan-Klartag-Milman [1] and KlartagMilman [38]. A straightforward calculation shows that this product of integrals is invariant under non-singular linear substitutions of the variable x
13

(analogously as for the volume product of convex bodies), and under taking
positive multiples of the function f .
Unfortunately, translations of convex bodies have no (good) generalizations to log-concave functions. Thus, in place of a translation K 7→ K − x,
where x ∈ int K, one considers an arbitrary translate of the function f (i.e.,
x 7→ f (x − x0 )). Then one proves the sharp upper bound (2π)d for a suitable translate of the original function f , cf. Artstein-Avidan, Klartag, Milman [1], Klartag-Milman [38]. Here, for even functions f , one may choose
x0 = o (as for o-symmetric bodies one may consider (K − o)∗ , see §1), and,
in the general case one can choose for x0 the barycentre
Rmore generally,
R
xf (x)dx/ f (x)dx of f (as for general convex bodies K one may consider
[K − b(K)]∗ , see above in this introduction) cf. [1]. Of course, this does
not concern the question of the lower bound (as it is a minimum problem),
but, in case of the upper bound, only the o-symmetric case of the volume
product problem generalizes this way to even log-concave functions. (Observe that to translates of convex bodies there do not correspond translates
of the respective functions. Already for d = 1, with unit ball [−1, 1], to
translates of [−1, 1], by some c ∈ (−1, 1), there correspond the functions
exp [−x2 / (2(1 + sg x · c)2 )], whose graphs have no vertical axis of symmetry,
while translates of the corresponding function have them. This shows that
this functional variant of the Blaschke-Santaló inequality generalizes the case
of convex bodies only in the o-symmetric case.)

bound constd , using Bourgain-Milman’s theorem, [14]. However, if we rather
use the currently best lower bounds for the o-symmetric, and the general
cases, due to Kuperberg, G., [40], both cited above, then, by the proof of
[22] Theorem 7, we obtain the above given lower estimates.)
The conjectured minima, for the even, or the general case, are 4d , or
ed , respectively, cf. Fradelizi-Meyer [23]. The minimizing functions are
14

conjectured to be, in a suitable system of coordinates, with the origin at
o, the following ones, cf. [23], Conjectures (1′ ), (2′ ) (in the general case
this is stated there not so explicitly). For the even case, f (x1 , ..., xd ) =
const · e−k(x1 ,...,xk)kK1 χK2 (xk+1 , ..., xd ), where 0 ≤ k ≤ d, and K1 ⊂ Rk and
K2 ⊂ Rd−k are Hanner-Hansen-Lima bodies, and χ denotes characteristic
function. (The constant
was missing in [23].) For the general case,
Qd factor
−xi
f (x1 , ..., xd ) = const · i=1 e χ[−1,∞) (xi ). (We remark that [23] considered
actually the class
of a function, and considered the infimum
R of allRtranslates
∗
of the product Rd f dx· Rd f dx on this class. However, a straightforward calculation gives that theQminimum of this product on the class of all translates
of the function const · di=1 e−xi χ[−1,∞) (xi ) is attained, when we translate this
function with the 0 vector.) Still we note that the quotients of the above lower
estimates and the conjectured minima are (π/(8e) + o(1))d , in the even case,
d
and (π/(4e2 ) + o(1)) , in the general case.
In the case of unconditional functions (i.e., f (x1 , ..., xn ) = f (|x1 |, ..., |xn |)),
the sharp lower bound, namely 4d , is known, cf. Fradelizi-Meyer [22], [23],
with the case of equality characterized in Fradelizi-Gordon-Meyer-Reisner
[20]: these are just the above given conjectured extremal functions for the
o-symmetric case. Observe that this includes the case d = 1, even functions.
For general functions, Fradelizi-Meyer [23] proved the conjectured lower
bound ed for functions f being translates of functions g, that vanish outside
[0, ∞)d, and are monotonically non-increasing in each variable on [0, ∞)d .
They characterized the case of equality: these are just those of the above given
conjectured extremal functions for the general case, that verify the hypotheses
of their theorem. Also for d = 1, for general f , one has the sharp lower bound
e, cf. Fradelizi-Meyer [23], who also determined the cases of equality: these
are just the above given conjectured extremal functions for the general case.
Still we note that the conjectures in Rd about the lower bound for the
functional variant, for the even, or the general case (i.e., 4d , or ed ), would
imply the conjectures about the lower bound for the volume product, in the
o-symmetric case, or in the case o ∈ int K, in Rd , or Rd−1 (that is, 4d /d!, or
dd /[(d − 1)!]2 ]), respectively, cf. [23]. However, the conjecture about the lower
bound for the functional variant, for the even, or the general case, for all d,
is equivalent to the conjecture of Mahler-Guggenheimer-Saint Raymond, or
of Mahler, for all d, respectively, cf. [23].
Miscellaneous (added 5. April 2013) [71] and [66] proved that the volume product | (K − s(K))∗ | · |K|, or |K ∗ | · |K| can be (locally) minimal
15

only if the generalized Gauss curvature of K is a.e. 0, for the general, or osymmetric case, respectively. [35] proved the following: if K is o-symmetric,
and (1 + ε)-close to some Hanner-Hansen-Lima body, in Banach-Mazur distance (for suitable ε > 0), then Mahler’s conjecture holds for K, and there
is also a stability variant of this statement. [37] proved a stability variant
of the statement that among unconditional bodies Mahler’s conjecture is
true. They also proved the following: among o-symmetric convex bodies,
(1 + ε)-close to unconditional convex bodies, in Banach-Mazur distance (for
suitable ε > 0), the minimum of the volume product is attained exactly
for the Hanner-Hansen-Lima bodies, and they proved also a certain stability
variant of this statement. [5] proved a stability variant of functional forms of
the Blaschke-Santaló inequality. [25] also proved a version of the BourgainMilman theorem. A small survey is given in [49].

Main statements

For stability versions of the Mahler-Reisner, Mahler-Meyer, and Eggleston
theorems, we prove the following theorems.
As mentioned in the introduction, the following theorem was obtained
also, independently, by Böröczky, K. J.-Hug [12], even for zonoids in Rd (the
constants in [12] are unspecified, and stability of the centre of polarity is not
investigated in [12]).
Theorem 1 Let K be a centrally symmetric convex body in R2 with o ∈ int K
and P a parallelogram, and
|K| · |K ∗ | ≤ (1 + ε) · 8 , with ε > 0 .
Then δBM (K, P ) ≤ 1 + 200ε. Moreover, let x ∈ R2 and λi > 0, and let P be
a parallelogram such that λ1 P +x ⊂ K ⊂ λ2 P +x, and λ2 /λ1 ≤ 1+200ε < 2.
Then, in the Euclidean norm, for which [(λ1 +λ2 )/2]P is a square of diameter
1, we have √
that the distance of the centre of [(λ1 + λ2 )/2]P + x from o is at
most 336 · ε.
Theorem 2 Let K be a convex body in R2 with o ∈ int K and T a triangle,
and
|K| · |K ∗ | ≤ (1 + ε) · 27/4 , with ε > 0 .
16

Then δBM (K, T ) ≤ 1 + 900ε. Moreover, let x ∈ R2 and λi > 0, and let T be
a triangle such that λ1 T + x ⊂ K ⊂ λ2 T + x, and λ2 /λ1 ≤ 1 + 900ε < 4.
Then, in the Euclidean norm, for which [(λ1 + λ2 )/2]T is a regular triangle
of side 1, we have√that the distance of the centre of [(λ1 + λ2 )/2]T + x from
o is at most 917 · ε.
We note that, for Rn a regular n-gon with centre o,
|Rn | · |Rn∗ | = (n/2) sin(2π/n) · n tan(π/n) = n2 sin2 (π/n).
We prove the following generalization of the Mahler-Reisner and MahlerMeyer theorems.
Theorem 3 Let Ki and Ko be regular n-gons, n ≥ 3, and let each vertex of
Ki lie on a side of Ko , and hence Ki and Ko have a common centroid z. If
Ki ⊂ K ⊂ Ko for a planar convex body K with o ∈ int K, then
|K| · |K ∗ | ≥ n2 sin2 (π/n),
with equality if and only if o = z, and either K = Ki , or K = Ko .
Let us show how Theorem 3 yields the Mahler-Reisner and Mahler-Meyer
theorems. For the o-symmetric case, one considers an (o-symmetric) parallelogram P of maximal area contained in K. Applying a linear map, we
may assume that P is a square. Now the Mahler-Reisner theorem follows as
K ⊂ Q for the square Q satisfying that the midpoints of its sides are the
vertices of P .
For the Mahler-Meyer theorem, let T be a triangle of maximal area contained in K. Applying a linear map, we may assume that T is regular, and
let S be the regular triangle satisfying that the midpoints of the sides of S
are the vertices of T . Since K ⊂ S, Theorem 3 yields the Mahler-Meyer
theorem.
Another consequence of Theorem 3 is the following.
Corollary 4 If a convex body K in R2 has n-fold rotational symmetry about
o, where n ≥ 3, then
|K| · |K ∗ | ≥ n2 sin2 (π/n),
with equality if and only if K is a regular n-gon.
17

To prove Corollary 4 based on Theorem 3, one just chooses a point x ∈ ∂K
that is the farthest from o, and Ki is the inscribed regular n-gon, of centre
o, such that x is one of its vertices, and Ko is the regular n-gon such that
the midpoints of the sides of Ko are the vertices of Ki .
Theorem 5 Let n ≥ 3 be an integer, let K be an n-fold rotationally symmetric convex body in R2 with o ∈ int K and Rn a regular n-gon, and let
|K| · |K ∗ | ≤ (1 + ε) · n2 sin2 (π/n) , with ε > 0 .
s
Then δBM
(K, Rn ) ≤ 1 + 18ε. Moreover, let x ∈ R2 and λi > 0, and let Rn be
a regular n-gon such that λ1 Rn + x ⊂ K ⊂ λ2 Rn + x, and λ2 /λ1 ≤ 1 + 18ε <
1/ cos(π/n) ≤ 2. Then, in the Euclidean norm, for which [(λ1 + λ2 )/2]Rn
is a regular n-gon of diameter 1, we have that
√ the distance of the centre of
[(λ1 + λ2 )/2]Rn + x from o is at most 263 · ε.

The following theorem proves the conjecture mentioned in §2, concerning
the exact error term in the stability variant of the Zhang projection body
inequality, for the planar case.
Theorem 6 Let K be a convex body in R2 with
|K| · | ((K − K)/2)∗ | ≤ (1 + ε) · 6 , with ε > 0 .
Then δBM (K, T ) ≤ 1 + 87ε.
Remark. In Theorems 1, 2 we restricted ourselves to the case λ2 /λ1 < 2,
or, λ2 /λ1 < 4, respectively. This we did since λ2 /λ1 = 2, or λ2 /λ1 = 4 is
no restriction at all for the body K. Namely, if Ki ⊂ K is an o-symmetric
inscribed parallelogram of maximal area (for K o-symmetric), or an inscribed
triangle of maximal area (for o ∈ int K), then K ⊂ Ko , where Ko is a
parallelogram, or triangle, with side midpoints at the vertices of Ki . If K ′ is
a parallelogram, or triangle, with side midpoints at the vertices of Ko , then
Ki and K ′ are homothetic, with homothety ratio 2, or 4, respectively, and
Ki ⊂ K ⊂ Ko ⊂ K ′ . (For Theorem 5 the analogous inequality would be
λ2 /λ1 ≤ 1/ cos2 (π/n) < 4, but this does not suffice to prove (17), in the
proof of Theorem 5, with positive right hand side.)
Example. 1. We show that the stability statements in Theorems 1, 2,
5, 6, concerning the bodies, are of the exact order of magnitude. For this,
18

let the regular n-gon Rn be inscribed in the unit circle U about o, and let us
define Kn as the convex polygon with vertices the vertices of Rn , and 1 + ε
times the side-midpoints of Rn , where ε ∈ (0, 1/ cos(π/n)] (thus Kn ⊂ U).
Then |Kn | · |(Kn )∗ | = n2 sin2 (π/n) + n2 sin2 (π/n) · (ε − ε2 cot2 (π/n)) /(1 + ε).
Letting n = 3, we have |K3 | · | ((K3 − K3 )/2)∗ | = 6 · (9 + 15ε + 3ε2 − 3ε3 )/(3 +
s
ε)2 . Clearly, δBM
(Rn , Kn ) ≤ 1 + ε. On the other hand, for suitable A and
x, we have λ1 ARn ⊂ Kn ⊂ λ2 ARn + x and δBM (Rn , Kn )2 = (λ2 /λ1 )2 ≥
|Kn |/|λ1 ARn | ≥ (1+ε)|Rn |/|Rn | (at the last step we have used that λ1 ARn ⊂
U is a convex n-gon, hence |λ1 ARn | ≤ |Rn |, similarly as in the end of the
introduction, at the proof
√ of the optimality of the order of the error term).
Hence, δBM (Rn , Kn ) ≥ 1 + ε. (For Theorems 1, 2 we use the cases n =
4, 3.)
2. For the stability of the centre of polarity (for Theorems 1, 2, 5),
we proceed analogously to [36], Proposition 2. An example is a regular ngon K of centre o, and diameter 1 (with λi = 1). We use the well-known
formula (11) from the proof of Lemma 11,
for
√
√ which comes in the sequel,
d = 2. The inradius of K is at least 1/(2 3). We let kxk ≤ 1/(4 3), and
estimate (∂/∂x2 )2 |(K − x)∗ | from above by replacing, in the inequality in
√

(11), hK (u)
by
1/(2

and
then
(1

by

R
using still S 1 u22 du = π, we get
(∂/∂x2 )|(K − x)∗ | = 0 and (∂/∂x2 )2 |(K − x)∗ | ≤ 28 · 33 · π .

By diam K = 1 we have |K| ≤ π/4. Thus we get (∂/∂x2 )2 (|K| · |(K − x)∗ |) ≤
26 · 33 · π 2 , and the analogues of these formulas hold for the first and second
directional derivatives in any direction. Thus, for |K| · |(K − x|∗ | ≥ (1 + ε) ·
n2 sin2 (π/n), we have
ε · 27/4 ≤ ε · n2 sin2 (π/n) ≤ |K| · |(K − x)∗ | − |K| · |K ∗ | ≤ 25 · 33 · π 2 kxk2 ,

hence, for any x — i.e., without the restriction kxk ≤ 1/(4 3) — we have

In a forthcoming paper, by the first two named authors of this paper, we
will show that, for convex n-gons K, the product |K|·|[K −s(K)]∗| is maximal
19

exactly for the affine regular n-gons. We remark that the o-symmetric case
of this statement is obtained, independently, also by Tabachnikov, in a more
general form, namely for star-polygons, [72], Theorem 2. Moreover, the
general case is obtained independently, also by the last two named authors
of this paper; see [58]. Further, in the above mentioned forthcoming paper,
we will give stability estimates for the Blaschke-Santaló inequality in the
plane, for the o-symmetric case. Here the deviation from the ellipses will be
measured by the quotient of the areas of the convex body, and the maximal
area inscribed/minimal area circumscribed ellipse of the convex body, and
the order of the error term will be optimal. If any of these ellipses is the unit
circle about o, then even the arithmetic mean of the areas of the body and
the polar body is at most π.

Proof of Theorem 3

First we prove a lower bound for the volume product in sectors. The idea
of giving lower bounds in sectors separately, and then using the arithmeticgeometric mean inequality, is due to Saint Raymond [68], proof of Théorème
28. There it is also noted that this approach settles the two-dimensional
o-symmetric case. Our proofs of our Theorems 1, 2, 3, 5 all use this idea.
The particular case u = u∗ = (0, 1), and v = v ∗ = (1, 0) of our following
lemma reduces to the two-dimensional case of [68], Théorème 28.
Lemma 7 Let K be a planar convex body with o ∈ int K. Let, for some
linearly independent u, v ∈ ∂K, and linearly independent u∗ , v ∗ ∈ ∂K ∗ , the
supporting lines to K with exterior normals u∗ and v ∗ intersect K, e.g., at u
and v, respectively, and intersect each other at p ∈ R2 , where [p, o]∩[u, v] 6= ∅.
Furthermore, let the supporting lines to K ∗ with exterior normals u and v
intersect K ∗ , e.g., at u∗ and v ∗ , respectively, and intersect each other at
p∗ ∈ R2 with [p∗ , o] ∩ [u∗ , v ∗ ] 6= ∅. Then, for C = K ∩ [o, u, v, p] and C ∗ =
K ∗ ∩ [o, u∗ , v ∗ , p∗ ], we have
|C| · |C ∗ | ≥ |[o, u, v, p]| · |[o, u∗, v ∗ ]| = |[o, u, v]| · |[o, u∗ , v ∗, p∗ ]| ,
with equality if and only if either C = [o, u, v] or C = [o, u, v, p].
Remark. We may assume C 6= [o, u, v]. Then, for p = λu + µv and
λ, µ > 0, we have λ + µ > 1 and p∗ = µu∗ + λv ∗ . We choose a coordinate
20

system, assuming
u = (1, 0), and v = (0, 1) .
Then
p = (λ, µ), p∗ = (1, 1), u∗ = (1, (1 − λ)/µ) , v ∗ = ((1 − µ)/λ, 1) ,
and

(
|[o, u, v, p]| · |[o, u∗ , v ∗]| = |[o, u, v]| · |[o, u∗ , v ∗ , p∗ ]| =
(λ + µ)(λ + µ − 1)/(4λµ) = (2 − hu, v ∗i − hu∗, vi)/4 .

First we show that Mahler’s original proofs ([44]) yield our lemma, except
the case of equality.
First proof. We exclude C = [o, u, v], [o, u, v, p]. Let k ≥ 0 be an
integer, and let us suppose that both C and C ∗ are polygons, such that the
total number of their vertices in int [u, v, p], or int [u∗ , v ∗ , p∗ ], respectively, is
at most k. (This case suffices to prove the inequality.) Let C, C ∗ realize the
minimum under these hypotheses. If e.g. C has a vertex c ∈ int [u, v, p], then
we can move c a bit, parallel to the diagonal connecting its neighbours, hence
keeping |C| fixed. Then, for C ∗ , the polar side line will rotate about some
of its points. Since the lines of the neighbours of this side intersect outside
this side line, by some small rotation |C ∗ | strictly decreases, a contradiction.
Hence we have a situation as for k = 0.
If k = 0, then C has a vertex c, e.g. in relint [u, p], and then C = [o, u, v, c],
since else C ∗ would have a vertex in int [u∗ , v ∗ , p∗ ]. Then c = (αλ+1−α, αµ),
where α ∈ (0, 1), and |C| · |C ∗ | = (1/4) (1 + (λ + µ − 1)α) · [1 − (1 − λ/µ) −
((1 − µ)/λ − 1) (1 − αλ)/(1 − α + αµ)]. The fact that this is at least (λ +
µ)(λ + µ − 1)/(4λµ) can be written, after multiplying with the product of
the denominators (each of them being positive), and rearranging (using the
program package GAP [70]), as λ(λ + µ − 1)2 · α(1 − α) ≥ 0. 
The second proof follows the lines of Meyer [52], proof of Théorème I. 2
(more exactly, its two-dimensional case, that gives our lemma for u = u∗ =
(0, 1), and v = v ∗ = (1, 0)).
Second proof. We have
1 = hu∗ , ui = hu∗, pi = hv ∗ , pi = hv ∗, vi = hu, p∗i = hv, p∗ i.
21

For x ∈ K ∩ [p, u, v], the sum of the heights of the triangles [o, u, v] and
[x, u, v], belonging to their common side [u, v], is hp∗ , xi/kp∗ k. Thus the
vectors w := [ku∗ − v ∗ k/(2kpk)]p and w ∗ := [ku − vk/(2kp∗k)]p∗ satisfy
|C| ≥ |[o, u, v, x]| = hw ∗ , xi for x ∈ K ∩ [u, v, p], and
|C ∗ | ≥ |[o, u∗, v ∗ , x∗ ]| = hw, x∗i for x∗ ∈ K ∗ ∩ [u∗ , v ∗ , p∗ ].

(2)
(3)

Since hw ∗, pi = |[o, u, v, p]| ≥ |C|, and hw ∗, xi < hw ∗ , ui for x ∈ K\[p, u, v],
we have w
e∗ := |C|−1w ∗ ∈ K ∗ ∩ [u∗ , v ∗ , p∗ ], and analogously w
e := |C ∗ |−1 w ∈
K ∩ [u, v, p]. It follows by applying (2) to x = w,
e that
(
|C| · |C ∗ | ≥ hw ∗, |C ∗ |wi
e = hw ∗ , wi =
hw ∗, pi · ku∗ − v ∗ k/(2kpk) = |[o, u, v, p]| · |[o, u∗ , v ∗]|.

We also have hw ∗ , wi = |[o, u, v]| · |[o, u∗, v ∗ , p∗ ]| by the remark following the
statement of this Lemma, hence we have equality in the Lemma if C = [o, u, v]
or C ∗ = [o, u, v, p].
Assume that equality holds in Lemma 7. It follows by (2) and (3) that
C = [o, u, v, w]
e and C ∗ = [o, u∗, v ∗ , w
e∗ ].

In particular C ∗ has vertices a∗ and b∗ satisfying

ha∗ , ui = ha∗ , wi
e = 1 and hb∗ , vi = hb∗ , wi
e = 1.

Checking the vertices of C ∗ , we have only two choices. Either a∗ = u∗ and
b∗ = v ∗ , and hence C = [o, u, v, p], or a∗ = b∗ = w
e∗ , and hence C = [o, u, v].


The third proof will use an idea of Behrend, [7], proof of (77), pp. 739740, and of (112), pp. 746-747. Its idea, intuitively, is the following. “If C
is close to [o, u, v], then C ∗ is close to [o, u∗, v ∗ , p∗ ], hence |C ∗ | will be a lot
greater than |[o, u∗, v ∗ ]|. On the other hand, if C is close to [o, u, v, p], then
|C| will be a lot greater than |[o, u, v]|.”
Third proof. Using the notations of the second proof, we have
|C| ≥ |[o, u, v, x]|,

where now x is a point of C ∩ [u, v, p], that is farthest from (p∗ )−1 (1), which
line passes through u, v. Then there is a supporting line (x∗ )−1 (1) at x to K,
parallel to (p∗ )−1 (1). Then
|C ∗ | ≥ |[o, u∗ , v ∗ , x∗ ]| ,
22

so,
|C| · |C ∗ | ≥ |[o, u, v, x]| · |[o, u∗, v ∗ , x∗ ]| .
Observe that, if x varies in [u, v, p], then |[o, u, v, x]| is proportional to dist (o,
(x∗ )−1 (1)) = 1/kx∗ k. Simultaneously, x∗ varies in [o, p∗ ] ∩ [u∗ , v ∗ , p∗ ], hence
|[o, u∗, v ∗ , x∗ ]| is proportional to kx∗ k. Hence, |[o, u, v, x]| · |[o, u∗, v ∗ , x∗ ]| does
not depend on x, so has the same value, as for x ∈ [u, v], and for x = p.
For the case of equality we have C = [o, u, v, x] and C ∗ = [o, u∗ , v ∗ , x∗ ].
We exclude x ∈ [u, v] and x = p. Then x∗ varies in relint (C ∗ ∩ [o, p∗ ]), and
we get a contradiction as in the second proof. 
Proof of Theorem 3. We may assume that o is the Santaló point of K.
First we show that o ∈ int Ki .
We note that as the origin is the centroid of K ∗ , there exists no line l,
with o ∈ l, and bounding the half planes l− and l+ , such that the reflected
image of K ∩ l− through the line l is strictly contained in K ∩ l+ . If n ≥ 4
then the angles of a regular n-gon are at least π/2, thus o ∈ int Ki by the
property of the Santaló point above.
If n = 3 then we may assume that K is not a parallelogram. In this
case for each triangle S cut off by a side s of Ki from Ko , there is a linear
transformation A such that the reflected image of A(S) through the line A(s)
is strictly contained in A(Ki ) (here we use that K is not a parallelogram).
Therefore the property of the Santaló point above, applied to A(K), yields
o ∈ int Ki .
When indexing the vertices of an n-gon, we identify vertices with indices
j and j ± n. Let x1 , . . . , xn , and y1 , . . . , yn denote the vertices of Ki and Ko
in counterclockwise order, and x∗1 , . . . , x∗n , and y1∗ , . . . , yn∗ denote the vertices
of Ki∗ and Ko∗ , respectively, so that, for j = 1, . . . , n, we have xj ∈ [yj , yj+1],
and
1 = hx∗j , xj−1 i = hx∗j , xj i = hyj∗, yj+1i = hyj∗, yj i.

In particular, yj∗ ∈ [x∗j , x∗j+1 ]. For j = 1, . . . , n, let Cj = K ∩ [o, xj−1 , xj , yj ]
∗
, yj∗ , x∗j ]. Therefore Lemma 7 yields that
and Cj∗ = K ∗ ∩ [o, yj−1
∗
|Cj | · |Cj∗ | ≥ |[o, xj−1 , xj , yj ]| · |[o, yj−1
, yj∗ ]|,

(4)

with equality if and only if Cj = [o, xj−1 , xj , yj ] or Cj = [o, xj−1 , xj ].
By the n-fold rotational symmetry of Ki and Ko about their common
centre, there exist common distances a = kxj−1 − yj k and b = kxj − yj k for
23

j = 1, . . . , n, and hence a + b is the side length of Ko . Since the distance of
o from the line yj yj+1 is dj := kyj∗ k−1 , for j = 1, . . . , n, it follows that
|Cj | · |Cj∗ | =

(adj−1 + bdj ) sin(2π/n)

Additionally, we have
n(a + b)2
(a + b)(d1 + . . . + dn )

Assume that equality holds in Theorem 3. It follows by (6) and (7) that
all dj are equal, thus o is the common centre of Ki and Ko . Further, all Cj
have the same area by (5). Therefore the equality conditions in (4) imply
that either K = Ki or K = Ko . 
Remark. In the particular case of Lemma 7, when C is an n-th part of a
convex body K with n-fold rotational symmetry about o, we could have referred in the first proof to [57], to the so called “shadow movement” (although
this is more involved than the elementary proof of Mahler used above). That
is, we have an ln-gon K = x1 ...xln (where l ≥ 2), having n-fold rotational
symmetry about o. The movement of the vertices x2 , x2+l , ...x2+(n−1)l , parallel to the diagonals x1 x3 , etc., preserving the rotational symmetry, and giving
a polygon K ′ , of course does not determine a shadow movement. However,
24

we can move only x2 , in the above way, and this determines a shadow movement, giving a polygon K ′′ . (More exactly: only the points of [x1 , x2 , x3 ] are
moved, in the direction of x1 x3 . At this motion, the points of any chord,
parallel to x1 x3 , are moved with the same velocity, so that at any moment
the moved chords constitute a triangle with vertices x1 , x3 , and the translate
of x2 ). Then |K| = |K ′ | = |K ′′ |, and |(K ′ )∗ | = |K ∗ | + n(|(K ′′ )∗ | − |K ∗ |), so
|(K ′ )∗ | is a linear function of |(K ′′ )∗ |. Moreover, K ′′ and K are not affinely
equivalent (consider the barycentres of the subpolygons with vertices each
l’th vertex of K ′′ , K).

Proofs of the stability theorems

The main result in this section is the following stability version of Lemma 7.
Lemma 8 Let C, C ∗ , u, u∗, v, v ∗, p, p∗ be as in Lemma 7, and let p = λu + µv
for λ, µ > 0. If
|C| · |C ∗ | ≤ (1 + ε)|[o, u, v, p]| · |[o, u∗, v ∗ ]|,
for positive ε < min {λ, µ}/(λ + µ), then for γ := 3[(λ + µ)/(min {λ, µ})](1 +
√
λ + µ),
(
either C ⊂ (1 + γε)[o, u, v] ,
or (1 + γε)−1 [o, u, v, p] ⊂ C, that is C ∗ ⊂ (1 + γε)[o, u∗ , v ∗] .
First proof. We may assume C 6= [o, u, v]. We use the notations from
the Remark after Lemma 7, and from the second proof of Lemma 7. We have
w
e = tp and w
e∗ = sp∗ for some t, s ∈ (0, 1]. Since hw,
e w
e∗ i ≤ 1, we have
ts(λ + µ) ≤ 1.

(8)

Further, for ũ∗ := (1, (1 − tλ)/(tµ)) and ṽ ∗ := ((1 − tµ)/(tλ), 1), we have
1 = hũ∗ , ui = hũ∗ , wi
e = hṽ ∗ , vi = hṽ ∗ , wi.
e

It follows by the second proof of Lemma 7, using the notations w,
e w
e∗ introduced there, that
[o, u, v, w]
e ⊂ C and |C| ≤ (1 + ε)|[o, u, v, w]|,

[o, u , v , w

It follows that if hũ∗ , xi ≥ hũ∗ , ui = 1 for x ∈ C then
|[x, u, w]|
e ≤ ε · |[o, u, v, w]|
e = ε · [(λ + µ)/µ] · |[o, u, w]|,
e

and hence hũ∗ , xi ≤ 1 + ε · (λ + µ)/µ. For e
γ := (λ + µ)/ min {λ, µ}, we deduce
that C ⊂ (1 + γe · ε)[o, u, v, w],
e and hence [o, u∗ , ũ∗, v ∗ , ṽ ∗ , w
e∗ ] ⊂ (1 + e
γ · ε)C ∗
by polarity, and analogously C ∗ ⊂ (1 + e
γ · ε)[o, u∗, v ∗ , w

e∗] ⊂ (1 + 3e
γ · ε)[o, u∗, v ∗ , w

For a := (λ − sλ, sλ + µ − 1), we have ha, v ∗ i = ha, w

then a similar argument leads to (1 + γε)−1 [o, u∗ , v ∗ , p∗ ] ⊂ C ∗ , and hence
C ⊂ (1 + γε)[o, u, v]. 

The second proof of Lemma 8, where however the constant γ will be
different, and which iterates the construction in the proof of Behrend ([7],
proof of (77), pp. 739-740, and of (112), pp. 746-747) will be broken up into
two parts.
Lemma 9 Under the hypotheses of Lemma 7, and with p = λu + µv, for
λ, µ > 0, we have
|C| · |C ∗ | ≥ f (λ, µ) + g(λ, µ)α(1 − α) ,
where
f (λ, µ) := (λ + µ)(λ + µ − 1)/(4λµ) ,

g(λ, µ) := (1/4)·(λ+µ−1)2·min {1/[µ(1+λ/4+µ)], 1/[λ(1+λ+µ/4)], 1/(λµ)} ,
α := max {|[u, v, x]|/|[u, v, p]| | x ∈ C ∩ [u, v, p]} ∈ [0, 1] .
26

Proof. Again we use the notations from the Remark after Lemma 7.
We may suppose α ∈ (0, 1). Let x = (x1 , x2 ) ∈ C \ [o, u, v] realize
α = max |[u, v, x]|/|[u, v, p]. We write Ci := [o, u, v, x], and Co := {(ξ, η) ∈
[o, u, v, p] | ξ + η ≤ x1 + x2 }. Then Ci ⊂ C ⊂ Co . Let x divide the chord of
[o, u, v, p], parallel to the line uv, and containing x in the ratio β : (1 − β),
where β ∈ [0, 1], and where the part of the chord with ratio β has an endpoint
in [u, p].
We iterate this construction. Let y, z ∈ C, and y, z ∈ Co lie on the
other sides of the lines ux, vx than o, and let them realize max |[u, x, y]|, or
max |[v, x, z]| and max |[u, x, y]|, or max |[v, x, z]| under these conditions, respectively. We define γ := |[u, x, y]/|[u, x, y]| ∈ [0, 1] and δ := |[v, x, z]|/
|[v, x, z]| ∈ [0, 1]. Let Ci′ := Ci ∪ [u, x, y] ∪ [v, x, z], and let Co′ be the intersection of Co and the support half-planes of C at y, z, with boundaries parallel
to the lines ux, vx. Then Ci ⊂ Ci′ ⊂ C ⊂ Co′ ⊂ Co . So for their polars (in
the angular domain u∗ ov ∗ ) we have (Co )∗ ⊂ (Co′ )∗ ⊂ C ∗ . Hence,

|Ci | · |(Co )∗ | + (|Ty | + |Tz |) · |(Co)∗ | + |Ci | · (|(T ∗)y | + |(T ∗)z |) .
Here Ty := [u, x, y] and Tz := [v, x, z], and the triangles (T ∗ )y and (T ∗ )z
have as their vertices the polars of the three first, or three last consecutive
side lines of Co′ in the open angular domain u∗ ov ∗ , taken in the positive
orientation, respectively.
First we estimate |Ty | · |(Co )∗ | + |Ci | · |(T ∗ )y | from below. We have
|Ci | = [1 + (λ + µ − 1)α]/2 ,
|(Co )∗ | = (1/2) · [1/ (1 + (λ + µ − 1)α)] · (λ + µ)(λ + µ − 1)/(λµ) ,
|Ty | = γβ ((λ + µ − 1)/2) α(1 − α) .

Here the denominator is a product of three factors, all being positive. (For
the third factor observe that the coefficients of λ, or µ are non-negative or
27

positive, respectively, and the constant term is minimal for γ = 1, and is then
non-negative.) The second factor of the denominator will cancel with |Ci |,
and its third factor will be estimated from above as follows. The coefficients
of λ, or µ, in it, are estimated from above by setting β = γ = 1, and the
constant term is estimated from above by setting γ = 0, and β = 1. Thus
we obtain the upper estimates α(1 − α), or α(2 − α), or 1 − α, respectively.
These can be further estimated from above by 1/4, or 1, or 1, respectively.
Hence, minimizing for γ ∈ [0, 1],
(
|Ty | · |(Co )∗ | + |Ci | · |(T ∗ )y | ≥
(1/4) · ((λ + µ − 1)2 /µ) · min {1/(1 + λ/4 + µ), 1/λ} · βα(1 − α)
(the first term being estimated from below by setting α = 1 in the denominator of the second factor of |(Co )∗ |). Changing the roles of λ, µ, of β, 1 − β,
and of γ, δ, we obtain similarly
(
|Tz | · |(Co )∗ | + |Ci | · |(T ∗ )z | ≥
(1/4) · ((λ + µ − 1)2 /λ) · min {1/(1 + λ + µ/4), 1/µ} · (1 − β)α(1 − α) .
Hence,
(

either C ⊂ [1 + (λ + µ − 1)α− ] · [o, u, v],
or C ⊃ [α+ + (1 − α+ ) · min {(1 − λ)/µ, (1 − µ)/λ}] · [o, u, v, p] .

28

Proof. We use the notations from the proof of Lemma 9.
By the hypotheses and Lemma 9, for α from Lemma 9, we have
f (λ, µ) · (1 + ε) ≥ |C| · |C ∗ | ≥ f (λ, µ) + g(λ, µ)α(1 − α) ,
hence
α2 − α + (f (λ, µ)/g(λ, µ)) ε ≥ 0 ,
i.e., α ≤ α− , or α ≥ α+ , where α± ∈ (0, ∞) and α− < α+ .
Let x ∈ C ∩ [u, v, p], with |[u, v, x]| maximal. Then C lies below the line
l := {y | y lies above the line uv, and |[u, v, y]| = α · |[u, v, p]|}. If α ≤ α− ,
then C lies below the line l− , defined analogously to l, but using α− rather
than α. If α ≥ α+ , then C ⊃ [o, u, v, x], hence C ⊃ [o, u, v, νx], where νx
lies on the line l+ , defined analogously to l, but using α+ rather than α.
Hence C contains the quadrangle obtained from [o, u, v, νx], by replacing its
side lines u(νx), v(νx) by lines through νx, parallel to up, vp. We further
diminish this last quadrangle by translating its side lines parallel to up or vp
so that they should contain the points of intersection of the sides vp or up
with the line l+ , respectively. The formulas in the corollary then follow by
simple calculations. 
Remark. It is probable that with more work one could sharpen the
stability estimates in the second proof of Lemma 8, iterating further the
construction of inscribed/circumscribed polygons (defining, in an analogous
manner, some closer approximations Ci ⊂ Ci′ ⊂ Ci′′ ⊂ C ⊂ Co′′ ⊂ Co′ ⊂ Co ,
etc.). However, this way does not seem to be suitable to give estimates which
are sharp, up to a quantity o(ε).
The first inequality in the next lemma is related to [36], Proposition 1,
but is formulated with constants according to our particular needs in this
paper. The second inequality in our next lemma is related to an opposite
inequality as in Proposition 2 of [36], but the idea of the proof is similar.
Lemma 11 Let d ≥ 2 be an integer, K0 ⊂ Rd be a convex body, and let
0 < ε1 ≤ ε1 (K0 ) := min {1/2, 2−2d−1 (κd−1 /(dκ2d )) · |K0 |/(diam K0 )d }. Let
K ⊂ Rd be a convex body, and let (1 − ε1 )K0 + a ⊂ K ⊂ (1 + ε1 )K0 + b,
where a, b ∈ Rd . Then
ks(K) − s(K0 )k ≤ c1 (K0 ) · ε1 ,
29

where

2

c1 (K0 ) := (diam K0 )(d+1) |K0 |−d−2 · d(dκd /κd−1 )d+2 .

If, moreover, ε2 > 0 and |K0 | · | (K0 − s(K0 ))∗ | ≤ |K| · (K − s(K))∗ | and
c ∈ int K, and |K| · |(K − c)∗ | ≤ |K0 | · | (K0 − s(K0 ))∗ | + ε2 ≤ κ2d , then
√
kc − s(K0 )k ≤ c1 (K0 ) · ε1 + c2 (K0 ) · ε2 ,
where
c2 (K0 ) :=

Proof. We will suppose that the point of homothety of (1−ε1 )K0 +a and
(1 + ε1 )K0 + b, that is in the first body, is o (this does not change K0 − s(K0 ),
K − s(K), K − c; namely, we consider c as “fixed to K”). Thus a = b = o
can be supposed.

where u = (u1 , . . . , ud), and hK is the support function of K, and κd the
volume of the unit ball in Rd . The analogues of these formulas hold for the
first and second directional derivatives in any direction.
First we estimate δ := ks(K) − s(K0 )k from above. We may assume that
s(K) − s(K0 ) = (0, . . . , 0, δ), where δ > 0.
We begin by showing that s(K) ∈ int ((1 − ε1 )K0 ), and even estimate
dist (s(K), bd [(1 − ε1 )K0 ]) from below. Let η := dist (s(K), bd K) ≤ dist
(s(K), bd [(1 + ε1 )K0 ]). Then (K − s(K))∗ contains (diam K)−1 B d , and a
point at distance η −1 from o (with B d the unit ball about o). Therefore
κ2d ≥ |K| · | (K − s(K))∗ | ≥ |K| · (diam K)−d+1 (κd−1 /d)η −1 .

kc − s(K0 )k ≤ kc − s(K)k + ks(K) − s(K0 )k ≤ kc − s(K)k + c1 (K0 )ε1 (14)
and
|K| · |(K − c)∗ | ≤ |K0 | · | (K0 − s(K0 ))∗ | + ε2 ≤ |K| · | (K − s(K))∗ | + ε2 .

Proof of Theorem 5. 1. First we estimate δBM
(K, Rn ) from above.
Here we may assume that o is the Santaló point of K, i.e., its centre of
rotational symmetry. As explained in §3, there exist regular n-gons Ki and
Ko centred at the origin, such that Ki ⊂ K ⊂ Ko , and the midpoints of the
sides of Ko are the vertices of Ki . Assuming that the unit circular disc about
o is the incircle of Ko , we have Ko∗ = Ki . Now the radii from o to the vertices

We deduce by Lemma
√ 8 that either C1 ⊂ (1 + γε)C1 , or (1 + γε) C1 ⊂ C1 ,
where γ := 6(1 + 2λ) ≤ 18. Therefore the rotational symmetry yields that
either K ⊂ (1 + 18ε)Ki , or (1 + 18ε)−1Ko ⊂ K.
2. Now we turn to the proof of the stability of the centre of polarity. The
point x is the point of homothety of λ1 Rn +x and λ2 Rn +x, and x ∈ λ1 Rn +x.
We will suppose x = o ; then o ∈ Rn . Simultaneously, we have to replace K ∗
with (K −c)∗ , for some c ∈ int K (“fixed to K”). Let K0,n := [(λ1 + λ2 )/2]Rn
(this will take over the role of K0 from Lemma 11). Then λ1 Rn ⊂ K ⊂ λ2 Rn
and λ2 /λ1 ≤ 1 + 18ε imply
(
K0,n (1 − 9ε) ⊂ K0,n /[(1 + λ2 /λ1 )/2] ⊂ K
(16)
⊂ K0,n /[(1 + λ1 /λ2 )/2] ⊂ K0,n (1 + 9ε) .

Note that by hypothesis ε < 1/18, so here
1 − 9ε > 1/2 (> 0) .

(17)

Restricting Lemma 11 to d = 2, we have ε1 (K0,n ) = [1/(32π 2)] · |K0,n |/
(diam
K0,n )2 and c1 (K0,n ) = 2π 4 · (diam K0,n )9 |K0,n |−4 , and c2 (K0,n ) = 4

= 8 2/π3−3/4 .
We apply Lemma 11 for d = 2, replacing there ε1 (K0,n ) by minn ε1 (K0,n )
and c1 (K0,n ) by maxn c1 (K0,n ), and c2 (K0,n ) by maxn c2 (K0,n ). By (16) we

(19)

However, we will use (18) only for 0 < ε ≤ ε∗∗ , for some ε∗∗ ∈ (0, ε∗ ], to be
chosen later.
First let 0 < ε ≤ ε∗∗ . Then (18) gives

Second let ε ≥ ε∗∗ . Then we have c ∈ int K ⊂ λ2 Rn + x = λ2 Rn , and
s(K0,n ) ∈ K0,n = [(λ1 + λ2 )/2]Rn ⊂ λ2 Rn (the last inclusion following from
o ∈ Rn ). Hence, also using λ2 /λ1 ≤ 2, we have

Now we minimize the coefficient of ε in (22), that is a function of ε∗∗ . This
minimum occurs when the two terms under the maximum sign are equal,
that occurs for ε∗∗ = 0.0000258... , and its value is 262.30682... . (Observe
that in fact 0 < ε∗∗ < ε∗ ). 

(It is easy to give the sharp version of this inequality. Fixing a2 +...+an−1 ,
the minimum occurs when a2 = ... = an−1 ; let their common value be x ∈
[a1 , an ]. Then derivation w.r.t. x gives for the minimum that x = (a1 +an )/2.
However, the formula given above will be more convenient to apply.)
Proof of Theorem 1. 1. First we estimate δBM (K, P ) from above. Here
we may assume that o is the Santaló point of K, i.e., its centre of symmetry.
As explained in §3, after Theorem 3, we may assume that Ki ⊂ K ⊂ Ko ,
where Ko and Ki are squares centered at o, the midpoints of the sides of Ko
are the vertices of Ki , and the sides of Ko have length 2. In particular, Ki
and Ko are polar to each other. It also follows that δBM (K, P ) ≤ 2, and
hence if ε ≥ 0.005, then we are done. Therefore we assume that ε < 0.005.
Now, in a suitable coordinate system, Ko can be dissected into four unit
squares So1 := [0, 1] × [0, 1], So2 := [−1, 0] × [0, 1], −So1 and −So2 . We write
Sij = Soj ∩ Ki , and Cj = Soj ∩ K and Cj∗ = Soj ∩ K ∗ for j = 1, 2, and hence
Lemma 7 implies |Cj | · |Cj∗ | ≥ |Si1| · |So1 | for j = 1, 2. We deduce by the
hypothesis |K| · |K ∗ | ≤ (1 + ε) · 8 and Lemma 7 that
(
(1 + ε) · |Si1 | · |So1 | ≥ [(|C1 | + |C2 |)/2] · [(|C1∗ | + |C2∗ |)/2]
p
(24)
≥ |C1| · |C2 | · |C1∗ | · |C2∗ | , and |Cj | · |Cj∗ | ≥ |Si1 | · |So1 |.
In particular,

|Cj | · |Cj∗ | ≤ (1 + ε)2 · |Si1 | · |So1 | ≤ (1 + 2.005ε) · |Si1 | · |So1 | for j = 1, 2.
√
To apply Lemma 8, we have λ = µ = 1 and γ = 6(1 + 2) < 15
both in the cases of C1 and C2 . Therefore, for each of j = 1, 2, either
Cj ⊂ (1 + γ · 2.005ε)Sij , or (1 + γ · 2.005ε)−1 Soj ⊂ Cj . If both of C1 and C2
satisfy either the first or the second condition, then δBM (K, P ) ≤ 1 + 31ε,
and we are done. Therefore we suppose that C1 ⊂ (1 + γ · 2.005ε)Si1, and
(1 + γ · 2.005ε)−1So2 ⊂ C2 , and seek a contradiction. We have |C1| ≤ (1 +
γ · 2.005ε)2/2, and since the diagonal of So2 not containing o is a subset of
−1
C2 , we also have
√ |C2 | ≥ (1 + γ · 2.005ε) . It follows by ε < 0.005 that
|C1 | < (1 − 2√ 2ε)|C2 |. On the other hand, (23) applied in (24) leads to
|C1 | ≥ (1 − 2 2ε)|C2 |, a contradiction.
34

2. The stability of the centre of polarity is deduced from Lemma 11 like
in Theorem 5, by supposing x = 0. Simultaneously, we have to replace K ∗
with (K − c)∗ , for some c ∈ int K (“fixed to√K”). Let K0 := [(λ1 +p
λ2 )/2]P .
2
4
Now ε1 (K0 ) = 1/(64π ), and c1 (K0 ) = 64 2π , and c2 (K0 ) = 16 2/(3π).
We only note that by hypothesis ε < 0.005, and then we use the sharper
estimate δBM (K, P ) = δBM (K, K0 ) ≤ 1 + 31ε. Then, rather than (16) and
(17), we have
(
K0 (1 − (31/2)ε) ⊂ K0 /[(1 + λ2 /λ1 )/2] ⊂ K
(25)
⊂ K0 /[(1 + λ1 /λ2 )/2] ⊂ K0 (1 + (31/2)ε) ,
for
1 − (31/2)ε > 1 − (31/2)/200 (> 0) .

(26)

By (25) we may choose ε1 := (31/2)ε, and by hypothesis of the theorem we
may choose ε2 := 8ε.
Then we have, analogously to (18) and (19), that

Proof of Theorem 2. 1. First we estimate δBM (K, T ) from above. We
may assume that K is not a parallelogram, and o is the Santaló point of K.
As it is explained in §3, after Theorem 3, we may assume that Ki ⊂ K ⊂ Ko ,
where Ki and Ko are regular triangles, and the midpoints of the sides of Ko
are the vertices of Ki . It also follows that δBM (K, T ) ≤ 4, and hence if
ε ≥ 1/300, then we are done. Therefore we assume that ε < 1/300.
We use the notation and ideas of the proof Theorem 3; in particular
o ∈ int Ki . We may assume √
that the circumradius of Ki is 1, and hence
d1 + d2 + d3 = 3, and a = b = 3.
Since |K| · |K ∗| ≤ (1 + ε) · |Ko| · |Ko∗|, and we used the inequality between
arithmetic and geometric means for |C1 |, |C2|, |C3| in (5), and for d1 , d2, d3 in
the step from (6) to (7), for j, k = 1, 2, 3, we deduce by (23) that
√
(32)
|Cj |/|Ck | ≥ 1 − 2 3ε ≥ 4/5 , and
√
dj /dk ≥ 1 − 2 3ε ≥ 4/5.
(33)
Since d1 + d2 + d3 = 3, we have
dj ≥ 3/(1 + 5/4 + 5/4) = 6/7, and
dj ≤ 3/(1 + 4/5 + 4/5) = 15/13.

Hence, for each j = 1, 2, 3, we have

|Cj | · |Cj∗ | ≤ (1 + 3.1ε)|[o, xj−1, xj , yj ]| · |[o, yj−1

Let j = 1, 2, 3. To apply Lemma 8, we define λj , µj > 0 by
yj = λj xj−1 + µj xj .
Since λj /µj = |[o, xj , yj ]|/|[o, xj−1, yj ]| = dj /dj−1, (33) implies
λj + µ j
≤ 1 + 5/4 = 9/4.

(36)

Now the distances of yj , or o from the line through xj−1 , xj are 3/2, or
kx∗j+1 k−1 = 3/2 − dj+1 ≥ 9/26, by (35), respectively, and hence
(
λj + µj = hx∗j , yj i = hx∗j , xj i + kx∗j k · hkx∗j k−1 x∗j , yj − xj i

We define γj := 3[(λj + µj )/ min {λj , µj }](1 +

p

λj + µj ), and hence
√
3.1γj ≤ 3.1 · 3 · (9/4) · (1 + 4/ 3) < 70.

In particular, it follows by Lemma 8 and (36) that
either (1 + 70ε)−1[o, xj−1 , xj , yj ] ⊂ Cj , or Cj ⊂ (1 + 70ε)[o, xj−1, xj ] .
√
We note that 1 + 70ε ≤ 5/4 and kxj−1 − xj k = 3. If (1 + 70ε)−1 [o, xj−1 ,
xj , yj ] ⊂ Cj , then (35) yields
(
|Cj | ≥ |[o, xj−1 , xj , (4/5)yj ]| =

√
(37)
(4/5) · ( 3/2) · (3/2 − dj+1 + 3/2) ≥ (2 3/5) · 48/26 > 1.27.
On the other hand, if Cj ⊂ (1 + 70ε)[o, xj−1, xj ], then (34) yields
(
√
|Cj | ≤ (5/4)2 · |[o, xj−1, xj ]| = (5/4)2 · ( 3/2) · (3/2 − dj+1 ) ≤
√
(5/4)2 · ( 3/2) · (9/14) < 0.87.

(38)

Comparing (32), (37) and (38) shows that either (1+70ε)−1[o, xj−1 , xj , yj ]
⊂ Cj for all j = 1, 2, 3, or Cj ⊂ (1 + 70ε)[o, xj−1, xj ] for all j = 1, 2, 3.
Therefore either (1 + 70ε)−1Ko ⊂ K, or K ⊂ (1 + 70ε)Ki , and hence the
Banach-Mazur distance of K from the triangles is at most 1 + 70ε.
2. The stability of the centre of polarity is deduced from Lemma 11
like in Theorem 5 and Theorem 2, by supposing x = o. Simultaneously, we
have to replace K ∗ with (K − c)∗ , for
Let
√ some c 2∈ int K (“fixed to K”).

K0 := [(λ1 +
pλ2 )/2]T . Now ε1 (K0 ) = 3/(128π ) and c1 (K0 ) = 512π /9 and
c2 (K0 ) = 8 2/(3π) · 3−1/4 . We only note that by hypothesis ε < 1/300, and
then we use the sharper estimate δBM (K, T ) = δBM (K, K0 ) ≤ 1 + 70ε. Then,
rather than (16), (25) and (17), (26), we have
(
K0 (1 − (70/2)ε) ⊂ K0 /[(1 + λ2 /λ1 )/2] ⊂ K

(40)

By (39) we may choose ε1 := (70/2)ε, and by hypothesis of the theorem, we

The optimal choice of√ε∗∗ is ε∗ . The distance to be estimated from above is

We turn to the proof of Theorem 6. We proceed analogously as in
Lemma 9 and Corollary 10. Again, the proof of Lemma 12 will use an idea
of Behrend, [7], proof of (77), pp. 739-740, and of (112), pp. 746-747.
As in the proof of Theorem 2, we assume that Ki ⊂ K ⊂ Ko , where
Ko = [a, b, c] and Ki = [a′ , b′ , c′ ] are regular triangles, and a′ = (b + c)/2 ,
b′ = (c + a)/2 , c′ = (a + b)/2. Now we assume ka − bk = 2. We let α1 :=
max {|[x, b′ , c′ ]|/|[a, b′ , c′ ]| | x ∈ K ∩ [a, b′ , c′ ]}, and α2 := max {|[x, c′ , a′ ]|/
|[b, c′ , a′ ]| | x ∈ K ∩ [b, c′ , a′ ]}, and α3 := max {|[x, a′ , b′ ]|/|[c, a′, b′ ]| | x ∈
K ∩ [c, a′ , b′ ]}. Then αi ∈ [0, 1], and we let α := (α1 + α2 + α3 )/3 ∈ [0, 1].
38

Lemma 12 With the above notations, we have
|K| · |[(K − K)/2]∗ | ≥ 6 + (3/2)α(1 − α) .
Proof. The supporting lines of K, parallel to and different from the side
lines of Ko , contain points a′′ , b′′ , c′′ of K, with a′′ lying in the triangle b′ ac′ ,
etc. We let Ki′ := [a′ , c′′ , b′ , a′′ , c′ , b′′ ], and let Ko′ be the hexagon bounded by
all supporting lines of K parallel to the sides of Ko . We have
Ki′ ⊂ K ⊂ Ko′ .
Hence,
Here

|K| · |[(K − K)/2]∗ | ≥ |Ki′ | · |[(Ko − Ko )/2)]∗ | .
√
|Ki′ | = ( 3/4)(1 + α1 + α2 + α3 ) ,
(
√
|[(Ko′ − Ko′ )/2]∗ | = 2(4/ 3)2 [(1 + α1 )−1 (1 + α2 )−1 +
(1 + α2 )−1 (1 + α3 )−1 + (1 + α3 )−1 (1 + α1 )−1 ] sin(π/3)/2 .

(46)
(47)
(48)

Now, (47), (48), and the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality imply
(
|Ki′ | · |[(Ko − Ko )/2]∗ | = 2(1 + 3α)(3 + 3α)×
(49)
(1 + α1 )−1 (1 + α2 )−1 (1 + α3 )−1 ≥ 6(1 + 3α)(1 + α)−2 .
Taking in account (46), it suffices to show that the last quantity in (49) is at
least
6 + (3/2)α(1 − α) .
However, if we replace in the last expression 3/2 by some c ≥ 0, this claimed
inequality becomes equivalent to

α(1 − α) 1 − (c/6)(1 + α)2 ≥ 0 ,
that is (just) satisfied for c = 3/2. 

Proof of Theorem 6. We will use the notations in Lemma 12 and its
proof. By hypotheses and Lemma 12,
6 · (1 + ε) ≥ |K| · |[(K − K)/2]∗ | ≥ 6 + (3/2)α(1 − α) ,
hence
α2 − α + 4ε ≥ 0 ,
39

i.e., α ≤ α− , or α ≥ α+ , where α± are the roots of the last polynomial. They
are real, with α− < α+ , for
ε ∈ [0, 1/16) ,
which last inequality will be supposed preliminarily.
For α ≤ α− we have
δBM (K, T ) ≤ 1 + α1 + α2 + α3 = 1 + 3α− .

(50)

Now let α ≥ α+ . We proceed analogously, as in the proof of Corollary
10.
P
We write βi := 1 P
− αi ∈ [0, 1], and β := 1 − α ∈ [0, 1]. Then β = ( βi )/3 ≤
α− , hence βi ≤
βi ≤ 3α− . We have K ∩ [a′ , b′ , c] ⊃ [a′ , b′ , c′′ ]. We diminish this last triangle by retaining its side line a′ b′ , and replacing its sides
[a′ , c′′ ], [b′ , c′′ ] by sides containing c′′ , and parallel to [a′ , c], [b′ , c]. We further
diminish this last triangle by retaining its side line a′ b′ , and translating its side
lines parallel to [a′ , c], [b′ , c], so that they should contain c′′ (b′ ), c′′ (a′ ), where
[c′′ (a′ ), c′′ (b′ )] ∋ c′′ is a chord of [a′ , b′ , c] parallel to [a′ , b′ ], with c′′ (a′ ) ∈ [c, a′ ]
and c′′ (b′ ) ∈ [c, b′ ]. Of course this is only possible for β3 ≤ 3α− ≤ 1/2;
therefore we preliminarily suppose also
α− ≤ 1/6 , or, equivalently, ε ∈ [0, 1/28.8] (⊂ [0, 1/16)) .
In this case the vertex c′′′ of the last triangle opposite its side on [a′ , b′ ] depends only on β3 :√it lies on the angle bisector of the triangle [a′ , c, b′ ] at c,
and kc′′′ −ck = β3 3. Lastly we replace c′′′ by c′′′′ , which is constructed analogously as c′′′ , but replacing at the beginning β3 by 3α− (≥ β3 ). Analogously
we define the points a′′′′ , b′′′′ . Then [a′′′′ , b′′′′ , c′′′′ ] ⊂ [a′ , c′′′′ , b′ , a′′′′ , c′ , b′′′′ ] ⊂ K,
hence
δBM (K, T ) ≤ 1/ (1 − (9/2)α− ) .
(51)

Here we have 1 − (9/2)α− ≥ 1/4, i.e., α− ≤ 1/6, thus a′′′′ , b′′′′ , c′′′′ 6∈ int [a′ , b′ ,
c′ ].
Now, (50) and (51) give


Thus, by (52) and (53),
δBM (K, T ) ≤ 1 + 18α− ≤ 1 + 86.4ε .

(54)

There remains the case ε ≥ 1/28.8. Then
δBM (K, T ) ≤ 4 ≤ 1 + 86.4ε .

A short proof of the inequality of MahlerReisner

Theorem 13 (Mahler-Reisner [44], [64]). If K is an o-symmetric convex
body in R2 , then
|K| · |K ∗ | ≥ 8 ,
with equality if and only if K is a parallelogram.
In the proof of this theorem we use the results of [57], more exactly, the
proof of their Theorem 15. Actually we will make only slight modifications
in its proof.
Proof of Theorem 13. Like in [57], proof of their Theorem 15, we may
suppose that a diameter of K (a segment of maximal length contained in
K) is [(−1, 0), (1, 0)], where K ⊂ R2 has a minimal volume product among
0-symmetric convex bodies. Let
K = {(x, y) | x ∈ [−1, 1], −f (−x) ≤ y ≤ f (x)} ,
where
(

f (x) is a concave function on [−1, 1], with
f (−1) = f (1) = 0, and f (x) > 0 for x ∈ (−1, 1) .

(56)

If the graph of f consists of two segments, we are done. If not, then, by
Lemma 14 of [57], there are functions g, h, both satisfying (56) above, both
not proportional to f , such that f = (g + h)/2.

41

Let t ∈ [−1, 1]. Let ft := f + t(h − g)/2. Then the area of the convex
body
Kt := {(x, y) | x ∈ [−1, 1], −ft (−x) ≤ y ≤ ft (x)}

is a linear function of t. By Theorem 1 of [57] the reciprocal of ϕ(t) :=
|[Kt − s(Kt )]∗ | is a convex function of t. Hence min ϕ is attained either for
t = −1 or for t = 1. Since K = K0 has minimum volume product, ϕ is
constant. Then, by Proposition 7 of [57], K1 is an affine image of K, by an
affinity of the form (x, y) → (x, ux + vy + w). By [57], p. 140, Remark to
Proposition 7, we have h(x) = vf (x) + ux + w. Putting here x = ±1, we see
u = w = 0. Hence, h is proportional to f , a contradiction. 
