Abstract. Let f : S → B be a fibred surface and f∗ ωS/B = U ⊕A be the second Fujita decomposition
of f. We study a Massey product related with variation of the Hodge structure over flat sections of
U. We prove that the vanishing of the Massey product implies that the monodromy of U is finite and
described by morphisms over a fixed curve. The main tools are a lifting lemma of flat sections of U to
closed holomorphic forms of S and two classical results due (essentially) to de Franchis. As applications
we find a new proof of a theorem of Luo and Zuo for hyperelliptic fibrations. We also analyze, as for
the surfaces constructed by Catanese and Dettweiler, the case when U has not finite monodromy.

1. Introduction
We study fibrations f : S → B over smooth complex curves B of smooth complex surfaces S with
general fibre a smooth projective curve F of genus g(F ) ≥ 2. Information on the geometry of fibred
surfaces can be obtained relating the direct image sheaf f∗ ωS/B of the relative dualizing sheaf ωS/B ,
which is a vector bundle of rank g(F ) (see for instance [Fuj78a]), the first order deformations and the
geometric variation of the Hodge structure defined by the smooth fibres of f. In [Fuj78a], Fujita proved
that f∗ ωS/B is nef (numerically effective) and admits a decomposition, the first Fujita decomposition,
as the direct sum f∗ ωS/B = O⊕h ⊕ E of the trivial bundle of rank h = h1 (f∗ ωS ) (which is just the
relative irregularity qf of f on fibred surfaces) and a locally free sheaf E such that h1 (E(ωB )) = 0.
Later in the paper [Fuj78b], Fujita announced the existence of a splitting on f∗ ωS/B , the second Fujita
decomposition, as the direct sum f∗ ωS/B = U ⊕ A of a unitary flat bundle U and an ample bundle A,
which allows to move the study of the semiampleness from f∗ ωS/B to U . A key point lies in the fact
that the geometry of a unitary flat bundle is completely determined by its monodromy group. The
missing details of the proof appeared later, first in the paper [CD14] (see also [CD] and [CD16]). In
these Catanese and Dettweiler were interested in the study of semiampleness of f∗ ωS/B , suggested by
a question posed by Fujita himself. They faced it using a criterion for semiapleness on unitary flat
bundles (see [CD, Theorem 2.5]), which states that semiapleness is equivalent to the finiteness of the
monodromy. Then they provided counterexamples to the conjecture of Fujita, constructing fibrations
with unitary flat factor U of non finite monodromy. Our first motivation lies in the interest on the
mentioned examples. We remark indeed that whenever the monodromy is finite, by the theorem of
the fixed part proved by Deligne in [Del71], U defines (up to finite base changes) a constant Hodge
substructure in the geometric variation of the Hodge structure of the fibers (that is a fixed abelian

subvariety of the Jacobian of the general fiber F ). In other words, the non-finiteness of the monodromy
implies that the flat bundle U ⊕ U ⊂ R1 f∗ C ⊗ OB is not defined over the rational. This is consistent
with a result contained in [Bar00], where the author proved that the unitary factor U of fibrations over
elliptic curves has always finite monodromy. We refer to [FGP17] for details of the previous argument,
where it has been developed, in a more general setting, in order to apply it to the study of the Hodge
loci.
In the paper we study obstructions to the non-finiteness of the monodromy using some techniques from
deformation theory and Infinitesimal Variation of the Hodge Structure (IVHS). In [LZ17][theorem A.1],
the authors proved that the monodromy of the unitary flat bundle on hyperelliptic fibrations is finite.
On the other hand it is well known that in the hyperelliptic locus the canonical normal function
induced by the Ceresa cycles vanishes (see subsection 7.1). These facts suggested us to look at the
vanishing of a second order cohomological invariant (the Griffiths infinitesimal invariant) in relation
with the monodromy of U .
The property we study is called in the paper Massey-trivial property. The Massey product has been
introduced in [CP95] under the name of adjoint image to compute the infinitesimal invariant of the
Ceresa cycle and then studied by many authors in [GA16], [BNP07], [PZ03], [RZ17], [Riz08] for different purposes. We follow the terminology introduced in the last cited paper, where adjoint images
have been interpreted as Massey products in the Dolbeault complex. We now briefly recall the construction, postponing details to subsection 3. Let F be a smooth fiber of f over b ∈ B (F = f −1 (b)),
ξ ∈ H 1 (TF ) be the Kodaira-Spencer class attached to the first-order deformation of F. Let Kξ be
the kernel of the cup product ∪ξ : H 0 (ωF ) → H 1 (OF ), describing the IVHS of the family at b,
and assume that dim Kξ ≥ 2. We define the Massey-product mξ (s1 , s2 ) of a pair (s1 , s2 ) of independent elements in Kξ (Definition 3.2) as the cohomological class v1 c2 − v2 c1 ∈ H 0 (ωF ) modulo the
C-vector space < s1 , s2 >C , where c1 , c2 are C ∞ -functions on F given by computing the cohomology
of ξ ∪ si = 0 ∈ H 1 (OF ) through the Dolbeault resolution (i.e. ξ∂ ∪ si = ∂ci , where ξ∂ is a Dolbeault
representative of ξ and ci are determined modulo H 0 (OF ) ≃ C). In particular, a pair (s1 , s2 ) is
Massey-trivial if mξ (s1 , s2 ) lies in < s1 , s2 >C . Then the definition extends in families considering
sections of the kernel K∂ = ker ∂ of the connecting morphism ∂ : f∗ Ω1S/B → R1 f∗ OF ⊗ ωB defined by
the pushforward of the short exact sequence

where Ω1S/B is the sheaf of relative differentials of f. The restriction of the connecting morphism over
a regular value of b gives exactly the cup product with the Kodaira-Spencer class of the fibre F over
b and thus describes the above situation.
Looking at the natural inclusion U ֒→ K∂ , we study families of Massey-products defined on local flat
sections of the unitary flat bundle U given by the second Fujita decomposition of f. Let U be the
local system of stalk U, underlying the unitary flat bundle U , and ρU be the associated monodromy
representation (see section 2). The second Fujita decomposition defines an inclusion U ⊂ H 0 (ωF ),
where F is the general fibre of f. We remark that the space Γ(A, U) of sections of U over a contractible
subset A of B is naturally isomorphic to U (see Remark 2.5) and we will use this isomorphism as an
identification. We consider a Massey-trivial subspace W ⊂ Γ(A, U) of local sections over an open
contractible subset A of B and the unitary flat subbundle M of U generated by W. Just to fix the

ideas, a subspace of sections is Massey-trivial if each pair of sections is Massey-trivial (Definition 3.7)
and a pair of sections is Massey-trivial if the Massey-product vanishes at the general point of A. By
Definition 2.7, the bundle M is associated to the smallest local subsystem M of U of stalk M ⊂ U
such that W ⊂ M. In general, the subspace M is not Massey-trivial even if W is. Anyway, using a
standard argument of analytic continuation it is easy to show that this condition does not depend on
the open set A (see Remark 5.8) and therefore is actually a condition on M generated by W.
We are now able to state the main results of the paper. The first one provides a sufficient condition for
the finiteness of the monodromy group, while the second one gives a more precise geometric description
of the structure of unitary flat subbundles which are Massey-trivial generated.
Theorem 1.1. Let f : S → B be a complete fibration of genus g(F ) ≥ 2 and U be the unitary factor in
the second Fujita decomposition of f. Let M ⊂ U be a flat subbundle of U generated by a Massey-trivial
subspace. Then M has finite monodromy.
Theorem 1.2. Let f : S → B be a semistable complete fibration of genus g(F ) ≥ 2 and M ⊂ U be
a unitary flat subbundle generated by a maximal dimensional Massey-trivial subspace. Then there is
an injection of monodromy group GM of M inside the group of bijection on a set K of morphisms
kg : F → Σ from the general fiber F to a smooth compact curve Σ of genus g(Σ) ≥ 2. Moreover, after
a finite étale base change uM : BM → B trivializing the monodromy, the pullback bundle of M becomes
P
the trivial bundle V ⊗ OBM of fibre V = g∈GM kg∗ H 0 (ωΣ ) ⊂ H 0 (ωF ).
The key examples of Massey trivial bundles are given by the trivial fibrations f : S = F ×B → B. The
finiteness of the monodromy in general allows (up to base changes) to define fibred maps S → A × B,
where A is an abelian subvariety of the Albanese of S, contained in the kernel of the map induced by
f between the Albanese variety of S and B. In the above case the abelian variety A seen inside the
Jacobian of the general fibre F is defined by a morphism of curves.
A few comments on the assumptions on the statements. The geometric description given in Theorem
1.2 needs that f allows at most semistable singularities. This is because in this case U has a good
direct description in terms of variation of the geometric Hodge structure (we will recall details in
subsection 2.1). The reason depends on the behavior of local monodromies around the singularities
of f, which are trivial, and this is what one has to check in order to generalize the result.
Theorem 1.1 instead holds for fibrations with arbitrary singularities, even if it follows from Theorem
1.2. This is because of the semistable reduction theorem (see e.g. [CD, Theorem 2.7]), which states
that up to a finite possibly ramified base change we can reduce to a semistable fibration.
The heart of our proof is the description of U given in the Lifting lemma 4.3. We prove in fact that the
local system U is the image of the sheaf f∗ ΩS,d via the map f∗ ΩS,d → R1 f∗ C defined by the external
differential (4.4), where ΩS,d is the sheaf of holomorphic closed forms on S.
Then we use a version of Castelnuovo-de Franchis theorem generalized to the case of surfaces properly
fibred over a non-compact base [GST17]. In fact the Massey-trivial condition produces pairs of closed
independent holomorphic forms ω1 , ω2 defined in an open neighborhood of the general fiber F with
wedge zero, that is ω1 ∧ ω2 = 0. Then the above theorem produces morphisms F → Σ from the general
fiber F to a smooth compact curve Σ of genus greater than 2. We remark that in [Cat91] Catanese

4

studied the Castelnuovo de-Franchis theorem in higher dimension. Unfortunately, there is no a natural
generalization of the definition of Massey-products in higher dimension and it should be interesting
to find an analogous condition. At this point, the proof of the finiteness of the monodromy follows
from a classical theorem of de Franchis (see [Mar88] and also [AP90]), which states that the number
of morphisms between two smooth compact curves of genus greater than 2 is finite.
In the final section we apply our results. A first application is obtained just reading our result in
term of the infinitesimal Griffiths invariant of the canonical normal function induced by the Ceresa
cycle. It turns out that the non-finiteness of the monodromy is an obstruction to the vanishing of the
infinitesimal Griffiths invariant. A second application is obtained using the triviality of the Massey
product (a local condition) to get a semiampleness criterion on U (a global condition) and in particular
this applies to families of hyperelliptic curves and gives a new proof of [LZ17, Theorem A.1].
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to local systems, flat bundles, monodromy
representations on curves. We fix the general setting and then we focus on some constructions given by
fibrations, that is the variation of the Hodge structure and the second Fujita decomposition (subsection
2). Section 3 deals with infinitesimal deformation theory and contains the definition of Massey products
together with some ad-hoc developments and constructions in the theory. In section 4 we prove the
lifting lemma 4.3 and more that it gives a splitting. In section 5 we apply the lifting lemma on
Massey-trivial generated subbundles and fix the relation with on adapted version of Castelnuovo de
Franchis theorem for fibrations. In section 6 we give the proof of the main theorems contained in the
paper. Section 7 contains the applications.

Assumptions and notations. Let Y be a smooth variety of dimension r defined over C. We will
denote by TY the tangent sheaf of Y, with ΩkY = ∧k Ω1Y the sheaf of holomorphic k-forms on Y, with
ωY = ∧r Ω1Y the canonical sheaf of Y and with ΩkY,d the subsheaf ΩkY of the closed holomorphic k−forms
on Y with respect to the de-Rham differential d (ΩiY,d = dΩi−1
Y ). Through all the article S will be a
smooth surface and B a smooth curve. A fibration f : X → B over a curve B is a proper surjective
and holomorphic morphism with connected fibres between a smooth analytic variety X (namely, a
complex manifold) of dimension dim X = n and a smooth irreducible curve B. We also call X a fibred
space over the base B. The base B is not always complete and when it is we will say that the fibration
f is complete (that is, B is projective and thus X is compact). We denote by F the general fibre of
∨ be the relative
f, which we is a smooth variety of dimension dim F = n − 1. Let ωX/B = ωX ⊗ f ∗ ωB
dualizing sheaf and Ω1X/B be the sheaf of relative differentials defined by the exact sequence

obtained dualizing the morphism df : TX → f ∗ TB induced by the differential. Let Z ⊂ X be the locus

singular fibres of f and also B 0 = B \ B0 the locus of regular values and X 0 = X \ D. We recall that

by f 0 : X 0 → B 0 the restriction of f over the curve B 0 (which is by definition a smooth fibration). A
fibred surface S over a smooth curve B is a 2−dimensional fibred space as above and we will say that
f : S → B is a fibration of genus g(F ) if the general fibre F is a smooth irreducible complete curve of
geometric genus g(F ). A fibration f : S → B has isolated singularities if Z is supported over isolated
points and it is called semistable if it is relatively minimal, that is it does not contain (−1)−curves
on its fibres, and has at most nodes as singularities.
2. Local systems, flat vector bundles and monodromy representations on fibrations
over curves.
In this section we set the notations and we recall some preliminaries about local systems, flat vector
bundles, monodromy representations over a smooth curve B. We refer to [Voi02], [Voi03], [PS08] and
also [Kob87] for the details.
Definition 2.1. Let B be a smooth irreducible curve, π1 (B, b) be the fundamental group of B with
base point b.
(LS) A Local system of C-vector spaces over B is a sheaf V of C-vector spaces which is locally
isomorphic to the constant sheaf of stalk a C-vector space V .
(FB) A flat vector bundle over B of fibre a C-vector space V is a pair (V, ∇) given by a locally free
sheaf V of OB -modules such that Vb ⊗OB,b OB,b /mb ≃ V and a flat connection ∇ : V → V ⊗ Ω1B
(i.e. such that the curvature Θ = ∇2 is identically zero).
(MS) A Monodromy representation of B over a C-vector space V is a representation of the fundamental group π1 (B, b), that is a homomorphism
ρV : π1 (B, b) → Aut(V ),
and the image Im ρV is called the monodromy group.
Morphisms in the respective category are the natural ones: maps of sheaves of C−vector spaces on
local systems, maps of vector bundles preserving the connection on flat vector bundles and maps
of representations on monodromy representations. We remark that the above definitions can be
generalized replacing C-vector spaces with Z−modules. In the sequel we assume that V has finite
dimension.
Proposition 2.2. There are one to one correspondences between local systems, flat vector bundles
and monodromy representations modulo isomorphisms in the respective categories. More precisely, it

where ”iso” denotes the action given by isomorphisms in the correspondent category, while ”con”
denotes the action given by conjugation.
We shortly recall the constructions of the stated correspondences.
Correspondence 2.1. Correspondence V 7→ (V, ∇) is constructed taking V the vector bundle V :=
V ⊗C OB and ∇ the flat connection defined by ker ∇ ≃ V; the inverse (V, ∇) 7→ V is given setting V
to be the sheaf ker ∇, called the local system of flat sections of V.
Correspondence 2.2. Correspondence V 7→ ρV is constructed fixing a point b ∈ B, considering the
isomorphism α : Vb ≃ V and defining ρV (γ) = α ◦ γ ∗ α−1 , where γ ∗ : Vb ≃ Vb is the isomorphism
e × V,
induced by γ ∈ π1 (B, b). Conversely, ρV 7→ V is given by looking at the action of π1 (B, b) on B
e is the universal covering of B, induced by ρV .
where B
We have the following properties about local systems and behaviour of their monoromy groups.

Proposition 2.3. Let u : B ′ → B be a morphism of curves and V be a local system over B. Then
u−1 V is a local system over B ′ . Moreover, the associated monodromy representation factors through
u∗ : π1 (B ′ , b′ ) → π1 (B, b), where b′ ∈ u−1 (b).
Proposition 2.4. Let V1 and V2 be two local subsystems of the local system V. If they both have finite
monodromy, then the local subsystem V1 + V2 of V has finite monodromy.
Proof. Let ρV be the monodromy representation of V, H the kernel of ρV and Hi the kernel of the
sub-representations induced by ρ on Vi , for i = 1, 2. Then H12 := H1 ∩ H2 is the kernel of the subrepresentation of V1 + V2 . We prove that H12 has finite index in π1 (B, b). By assumption, V1 and
V2 have both finite monodromy, which means that π1 (B, b)/Hi , for i = 1, 2, are finite. Consider the
chain of normal extensions H12 ⊳ H1 ⊳ H. Then H1 ⊳ H has finite index by assumption, while H12 ⊳ H1
has finite index since there is a natural injective morphism H1 /H12 ֒→ π1 (B, b)/H2 and π1 (B, b)/H2
is finite by assumption. Thus H12 ⊳ H has finite index too.

Remark 2.5. There is a natural isomorphism Γ(A, V) → V over any contractible subset A of B since
V is trivial over A.
The correspondences given in proposition 2.2 generalize when some suitable metric structures are
introduced: a unitary local system (V, h), with h an hermitian structure on V; a unitary flat vector
bundle (V, ∇, h), with h an hermitian metric compatible with the holomorphic connection ∇; a unitary
monodromy representation (ρV , (V, h)), with (V, h) a hermitian vector space and h preserved under
the monodromy action. Under this assumption, there is a fundamental structure theorem due to
Narasimhan and Seshadri [NS65], which links unitarity to stability. We recall that a holomorphic
vector bundle on a complete smooth curve B is stable if the slope (i.e. the number given by the degree
over the rank of a vector bundle) decreases on subbundles.
Theorem 2.6. Let B be a smooth complete irreducible curve of genus g(B) ≥ 2. Then a holomorphic
vector bundle V on B of degree zero is stable if and only if it is induced by a irreducible unitary
representation of the fundamental group of B.

Let V be a local system over a smooth curve B of stalk V and let ρV : π1 (B, b) → Aut(V ) be
its monodromy representation. We will always denote by HV = ker ρV the kernel of ρV and GV =
π1 (B, b)/HV the quotient group which is isomorphic to the monodromy group Im ρV . We want to
attach a local subsystem of V to a vector subspace W ⊂ V. Given a vector subspace W of V we define
X
GV · W :=
g · W,
g∈GV

where g · W := ρV (g)(W ) (we will also write shortly gW ). We remark that GV · W is smallest subspace
of V containing W and invariant under the action ρV . Thus it defines the smallest sub-representation
of V containing W.
Definition 2.7. Let V be a local system over a smooth curve B of stalk the C-vector space V and W
be a vector subspace of V . The local system c
W generated by W is the local sub-system of V of stalk
c
W = GV · W.
c
As usual, we denote by ρW
c the monodromy representation of W , with HW
c the kernel and with GW
c
the quotient. We also denote by HW the subgroup of HV , which fixes pointwise W. We remark that
HW
c is the normalization of HW .
Let V be a local system of stalk V over a smooth curve B and let A ֒→ B be an open contractible
subset of B and we allow to identify V ≃ Γ(A, V) via the canonical isomorphism between the stalk V
and the sections over A. In the following we prove some properties of generated local systems.
Proposition 2.8. Let W1 and W2 be two subspaces of Γ(A, V) such that W1 ⊂ W2 . If the local system
c
W2 generated by W2 has finite monodromy, then the local system c
W1 generated by W1 has finite
monodromy.
Proof. Let H = ker ρ be the kernel of the unitary representation of V, and Hi = ker ρi be the kernel of
the sub-representations ρi defining c
Wi , for i = 1, 2. Then we have an inclusion H2 ⊳ H1 of subgroups
which gives a surjection

Proposition 2.9. Let V be a local system over a curve B, W ⊂ Γ(A, V) a vector subspace and W

2.1. Local systems on fibred surfaces: geometric variation of the Hodge structure and
the second Fujita decomposition. In this subsection we briefly recall the construction of two local
systems naturally attached to a fibration f : S → B of genus g(F ). The first is given by the geometric
VHS of weight one and the second by the unitary flat factor in the second Fujita decomposition. For
details in Hodge theory please consult [Gri70], [Voi03], [CEZGT14] and [PS08]. The references for the
second Fujita decomposition are [Fuj78b], [CD14], [CD], [CD16] and also [Bar00].
(1) Geometric variation of the Hodge structure and semistable fibrations. Let f : S → B be
a smooth fibration (i.e. f is a submersive morphism). In this case, (HZ = R1 f∗ Z, F 1 = f∗ ωS/B , Q) is
a polarized variation of the Hodge structure of weight one pointwise defined by the polarized geometric
R
Hodge structure of weight one {HZ,b = H 1 (Fb , Z), Hb1,0 = H 0 (ωFb ), Qb (−, =) = Fb −∧ =}. The sheaf
R1 f∗ Z is indeed a local system of Z−modules of stalk H 1 (F, Z), where F is the general fibre of f,
the sheaf R1 f∗ C is a local system of C−vector spaces of stalk H 1 (F, C) ≃ H 1 (F, Z) ⊗Z C and there is
an injection f∗ ωS/B ֒→ R1 f∗ C ⊗ OB of vector bundles pointwise defined by H 0 (ωFb ) ֒→ H 1 (Fb , C) ≃
H 1 (F, C).
Let us now assume that f : S → B acquires isolated singularities. The sheaf R1 f∗ C is no more a local
system in general, since the homology of the singular fibres can differ from the one of the general fibre
and this fact is related with the behaviour under the local monodromies.
Let B 0 be the locus of regular values of f and j : B 0 ֒→ B be natural the inclusion. Then the
restriction f 0 : S 0 → B 0 of f to B 0 is smooth and defines a polarized geometric VHS of weight one
(HZ 0 = R1 f∗0 Z, F01 = f∗0 ωS 0 /B 0 , Q0 ) as above. Consider the morphism
(2.5)

α : R1 f∗ CS → j∗ j ∗ R1 f∗ CS ,

locally given by restriction to the local system j ∗ R1 f∗ C ≃ R1 f∗0 C. We briefly recall the role played by
the local monodromies around the singularities. Let bi be a singular value of f and ∆ be a coordinate
complex disk centered in bi , which does not contain any other critical values of f. Let f∆ : S∆ → ∆,
S∆ = S|∆ , be the morphism given by restriction of f to ∆ and Ft be a fibre over a regular value t 6= 0.
Then the monodromy action of π1 (∆ \ {0}) on H 1 (Ft ) naturally defines a homomorphism
(2.6)

Ti : H 1 (Ft ) → H 1 (Ft )

called monodromy operator or Picard-Lefschetz transformation around bi . This describes the local
monodromy around bi . Let r : Ft → Fbi be the map given by composition of the inclusion Ft → S∆
and the retraction S∆ → Fbi .
Definition 2.10. Let f : S → B be a fibration of genus g(F ) with isolated singularities and bi be a
singular value of f . We say that f satisfies the Local invariant cycle property around bi if the sequence

given by f∆ : S∆ → ∆ is exact. In this case, the vector space H 1 (Ft )INVi := ker(Ti − I) of invariants
under the local monodromy Ti : H 1 (Ft ) → H 1 (Ft ) is given by the cohomology of the singular fibre Fbi .
We remark that when the property introduced above holds on each singularity of f, the morphism
(2.5) is surjective. Moreover, from [PS08, Lemma C.13, pag. 440] and [CEZGT14, Theorem 5.3.4,
pag. 266]) we get the following result.
Lemma 2.11. Let f : S → B be a complete fibration of genus g(F ) with isolated singularities (e.g.
semistable). Then f satisfies the local invariant cycle property near all singular values, the morphism
(2.5) is an isomorphism and R1 f∗ C is completely determined by the local system j ∗ R1 f∗ C.
(2) The second Fujita decomposition of f. Let f : S → B be a complete fibration of genus g(F )
and f∗ ωS/B the direct image of the relative dualizing sheaf. The second Fujita decomposition ([Fuj78b],
[CD14]) states that there exists a unitary flat bundle U giving a splitting
(2.8)

f∗ ωS/B = U ⊕ A

on f∗ ωS/B , with A an ample vector bundle. As explained of subsection 2, there exists a unitary local
system U of stalk the fibre U of U such that U = U ⊗ OB , uniquely determined up to isomorphisms
of sheaves, and a unitary monodromy representation ρU : π1 (B, b) → Aut(U, h), determined up to
conjugacy classes. We briefly denote by ρ (instead of ρU ) the monodromy representation, with H the
kernel and with G the quotient π1 (B, b)/H. We recall that G is naturally isomorphic to the monodromy
group of U and we identify them.
Let f 0 : S 0 → B 0 be the restriction of f to the locus of regular values B 0 . The restriction U|B 0 of U
to B 0 is the unitary flat sub-bundle of j ∗ R1 f∗ C ⊗ OB 0 of fiber (U, h), where U ֒→ H 0 (ωF ) ≃ H 1,0 (F )
and h is the hermitian form induced by the polarization Q on the fibers (i.e. h(−, −) = iQ(−, −)
where bar is the complex conjugation). Thus it is described by the geometric variation of the Hodge
structure of weight one as the sheaf of locally flat sections of f∗0 ωS 0/B 0 , under the inclusion f∗0 ωS 0 /B 0 ⊂
j ∗ R1 f∗ C⊗OB 0 . The relation between U|B 0 and U depends on the behaviour under locals monodromies.
According to previous results, in [CD] the authors proved that U|B 0 extends trivially on B when f is
semistable, that is U is precisely described by variation of the Hodge structure (see also [CD]). This is
a consequence of the unipotency of the local monodromies. Let f : S → B be a fibration and assume
it is not semistable. The existence of U has been proven [CD] using different techniques concerning the
behaviour of quotients of f∗ ωS/B , which is nef ([Fuj78a]) and then applying the semistable-reduction
theorem (see [CD, Theorem 2.7 and Proposition 2.9 ], ), which allows to reduce to the semistable case.
The theorem provides a base change u : B ′ → B given by a ramified finite morphism of curves and a
resolution of the fiber product

and the unitary factor U ′ of its semistable reduction is the following.
Lemma 2.12. There exists a short exact sequence

which is split. Moreover, KU is unitary flat and the splitting is compatible with the underlying local
systems.
Proof. Let U ′ be the unitary factor of the semistable reducted fibration f ′ of f and U be the unitary
factor of f. Recall that there is a short exact sequence ([CD14, Proposition 2.9])

which induces by projection a morphism U ′ → u∗ U . Using standard arguments of vector bundles, it
is easy to see that a map from an ample bundle to a unitary flat bundle must be the null map. Using
the characterization of unitary flat bundle over curves of genus greater that 2 recalled in section 2,
it turns out that the morphism above is surjective of vector bundles. The cases of genus 0 and 1 are
trivial. We refer to [CD14], [CD] and also [CD16] for details.

In this section we recall the construction of the ”Massey-products” on families of curves. Some
references in this topics are [CP95], [GA16], [PZ03], [NPZ04], [Riz08]. For details on deformation
theory and variation of the Hodge structure instead we refer to [Gri83],[GH83a],[GH83b],[Voi02] and
also [Voi03].

induced by sequence (3.2). On any pair (s1 , s2 ) of linearly independent elements of Kξ , we can choose
a pair of liftings (s˜1 , s˜2 ) in H 0 (Ω1S|F ) and take the image s˜1 ∧ξ s˜2 ∈ H 0 (ωF ) of the map ∧ξ , where we
have set s˜1 ∧ξ s˜2 := ∧ξ (s˜1 ∧ s˜2 ). Such image depends on the choice of both liftings but it turns out to
be well defined modulo the C-vector space < s1 , s2 >C generated by (s1 , s2 ), since each lifting must
differ from the previous one for an element in H 0 (OF ) ≃ C according to (3.3).

Definition 3.1. The equivalence class
mξ (s1 , s2 ) := [(s̃1 ∧ξ s̃2 )] ∈ H 0 (ωF )/ < s1 , s2 >C

(3.5)

is called Massey product of (s1 , s2 ) along ξ.
A vanishing request natural in setting of Massey-products is the following.
Definition 3.2. A pair (s1 , s2 ) ⊂ Kξ is Massey-trivial if mξ (s1 , s2 ) = 0, that is s̃1 ∧ξ s̃2 ∈< s1 , s2 >C ,
for a (hence every) pair (s̃1 , s̃2 ) of liftings of (s1 , s2 ) in H 0 (Ω1S|F ). Equivalently, we also say that the
pair (s1 , s2 ) ⊂ Kξ has vanishing Massey-products.

12

P. PIROLA AND S. TORELLI

torsion, the restriction of K∂ outside the singular locus of f is locally free with fibre equal to the kernel
of the cup product with the Kodaira-Spencer class of the (smooth) fibre Fb . Moreover, as a subsheaf
of f∗ Ω1S/B , the sheaf K∂ injects in f∗ ωS/B outside the singular locus of f. Indeed, we recall that the
relation between the direct images f∗ ωS/B and f∗ Ω1S/B of the the relative dualizing sheaf and the sheaf
of the relative differential, respectively, is given by the following proposition (see [GA13] or [GA16]).
Proposition 3.3. Let f : S → B be a complete fibration over the curve B. Then f∗ ωS/B is a locally
free sheaf of OB -modules (namely, a vector bundle) of rk f∗ ωS/B = g(F ). Moreover, f∗ Ω1S/B is a sheaf
of the same rank and there is injection of sheaves

Thus under the assumption of isolated singularities, f∗ Ω1S/B is torsion free over a curve (i.e, locally
free) and the previous proposition provides an injection ν ′ : f∗ Ω1S/B ֒→ f∗ ωS/B . Consequently, K∂ is
locally free and injects ν : K∂ ֒→ f∗ ωS/B by restriction. In general, we have to consider (K∂ )∨∨ instead
of K∂ .
We introduce local families of Massey-products around a regular value b of a fibration f. Let A be an
open contractible subset of B 0 around b (that is all the fibres Fb′ of f over b′ ∈ A are smooth). Up to
shrinking A, we can take σ ∈ Γ(A, TB ) a local trivialization of TB over A. Then σ defines a generator

modulo the OB (A)−submodule < s1 , s2 >OB (A) of Γ(A, f∗ ωS/B ) generated by s1 , s2 . We remark that
the definition works since the injection K∂ ֒→ f∗ ωS/B is compatible withe the restriction to each fibre
over b′ ∈ A.
Definition 3.4. We say that a local family of Massey-products of the pair (s1 , s2 ) of sections in K∂
along σ in TB is a section

(Definition 3.2).
We remark that up to the choice of a pair of liftings of s1 , s2 ∈ Γ(A, f∗ ωS/B ) in Γ(A, f∗ Ω1S ) the section
mσ (s1 , s2 ) ∈ Γ(A, f∗ ωS/B ) is computed by the map

where the last isomorphism is given by the projection formula. This is indeed a local version of the
adjoint map. The above construction naturally globalizes to a sheaf map under the assumption of
isolated singularities, where K∂ is locally free. We remark that one can repeat a similar construction
on K∂ modulo torsion in the general set-up.

Proof. We show that the coboundary map induced in cohomology δ : H 0 (B, K∂ ) → H 1 (B, ωB ) is
the zero map. It is indeed the dual of the classifying map δ∨ : H 0 (B, OB ) → H 1 (B, K∂∨ ⊗ ωB ) ≃
Ext1OB (K∂ , ωB ). We consider the map H 1 (B, ωB ) → H 1 (B, f∗ Ω1S ) induced by the long exact sequence
in cohomology and we prove that it is an injection. First, observe that the pullback map H 1 (B, ωB ) →
H 1 (S, Ω1S ) is an injection, as it sends the class of a point b on B (which corresponds to a Kähler form)
to the class of the fibre F in S, which is non zero. Then, also the map H 1 (B, ωB ) → H 1 (B, f∗ Ω1S ) is
non zero, since it must factorize through the Leray spectral sequence

We remark that a direct computation shows that ωB ⊗ K∂ has image via the morphism ∧ in K∂ ֒→
f∗ ωS/B . The Massey-product mσ (s1 , s2 ) ∈ Γ(A, f∗ ωS/B ) of the pair of sections s1 , s2 of K∂ over a
subset A of B is computed by (3.19) modulo the the O(A)−submodule < s1 , s2 > of Γ(A, f∗ ωS/B ).
Remark 3.6. Let A be a connected open subset of B. Then it is equivalent that a pair (s1 , s2 ) of
sections in Γ(A, K∂ ) is Massey-trivial (Definition 3.4) and that the restriction of s1 and s2 to the
general point b is Massey-trivial.
3.1. Massey-trivial products on sections of K∂ and liftings. Assume K∂ has rank greater than
2. Let A be an open subset of B and W ⊂ Γ(A, K∂ ) be a subspace of sections over A such that
dimC W ≥ 2. We study a vanishing condition of Massey-products on subspaces of sections in K∂ in
relation with suitable liftings in f∗ ΩS . The vanishing property is the following.
Definition 3.7. A subspace W ⊂ Γ(A, K∂ ) is Massey-trivial if each pair of sections on W is Masseytrivial (Definition 3.4).
It is clear that the splitting (3.15) lifts W to f∗ Ω1S and then we can apply the morphism (3.19), which
uses the above liftings to compute the Massey-products of each pair of W. We get sections of f∗ ωS/B
and, by definition of Massey-trivial pairs, they lie in < s1 , s2 >OB (A) . In the following we are able to
prove that one can choose suitable liftings on f∗ Ω1S with wedge zero. We remark that these can be
different from the ones given by the splitting fixed in (3.15), which is actually far away to be unique.
Proposition 3.8. Let A be an open set of B, iA : A ֒→ B be the inclusion and W ⊂ Γ(A, K∂ ) be a
Massey-trivial subspace of sections of K∂ over A. Assume that the evaluation map W ⊗ OA → i∗A K∂
f ⊂ H 0 (A, f∗ Ω1 ) which lifts

β ∈ i∗A TB∨ ≃ i∗A ωB ≃ ωB its dual (that is, τ · β = 1). By composition of W ⊗ OA → i∗A K∂ with the
splitting K∂ → f∗ Ω1S , we obtain a lifting map ρ : W → Γ(A, f∗ Ω1S ). Let V = ρ(W ) be its image and
let vi = ρ(si ) be the images of a base {s1 , v2 , . . . , sn } of W. Since the Massey products are zero on any
pairs of section of W, we have
∧A (v1 ∧ vi , σ) = fi s1 + gi si

where the fi and the gi are holomorphic function on A. Now assume n = 2 and set ṽ1 = v1 − g2 β and
ṽ2 = v2 − f2 β. Then ∧A (ṽ1 ∧ ṽ2 , σ) = 0 and thus ṽ1 ∧ ṽ2 = 0 ∈ Γ(A, f∗ ωS ). We remark that the unicity
of the liftings ṽ1 and ṽ2 follows at once.
Now we assume n > 2 and, by induction, that the proposition holds for k < n. We apply this to the
space W ′ generated by {s1 . . . sn−1 } and we find liftings ṽi i = 1, . . . n − 1 such that ṽi ∧ ṽj = 0 for i, j
smaller than n. We also have that ∧A (ṽ1 ∧ vn , σ) = es1 + f sn and

Therefore, we get es1 + f sn = ls1 + m( n2 si ) and since the sections are independent we conclude that
e = l and f = 0 = m. As a consequence, the sections ṽn = vn − eβ are such that ∧A (ṽ1 ∧ ṽn , σ) = 0
and thus ṽ1 ∧ ṽn = 0. The condition ṽi ∧ ṽn = 0 and the unicity of the lifting follow immediately.

4. The local system U and liftings to the sheaf of closed holomorphic forms on S.
In this section we study the relation between the unitary flat bundle U in the second Fujita decomposition of f : S → B and the subsheaf Ω1S,d ⊂ Ω1S of the closed holomorphic 1-forms on S. In subsection
4.1 we introduce a suitable short exact sequence which allows to describe U as a local system contained in the sheaf R1 f∗ C (which is not a local system as previously recalled). Then, in Lemma 4.3
of subsection 4.2, we prove that the local system U underlying U can be described in terms of local
sections of f∗ Ω1S,d , that is in terms of holomorphic forms on the fibres of f which locally attach to
closed local holomorphic forms on S. Moreover, suggested by a lifting of U on Ω1S contained in the
work [CLZ16], we prove that the sequence involved in Lemma 4.3 is split (Lemma 4.5), providing a
special a lifting for U.
4.1. Relative holomorphic de-Rham: a useful short exact sequence. Given a fibration f :
S → B there is a suitable short exact sequence which can be constructed by comparing the holomorphic
de Rham sequences of the surface S and the base B.
Let us consider the holomorphic de-Rham sequence on S

b is a local system over B and this case
Lemma 4.2. Let f : S → B be a semistable fibration. Then D
we denote it with D. Moreover, the stalk D of D is isomorphic over the general fiber F to the greatest
subspace of H 1,0 (F ) ⊂ H 1 (F, C) defining a local system over B.
Proof. Let B0 be the singular locus of f and j : B 0 = B \ B0 → B be the natural injection. Let kDb :

whenever f is semistable (see Lemma 2.11) and j ∗ R1 f∗ C is always a local system of stalk H 1 (F, C),
where H 1 (F, C) is the first cohomology group of the general fiber F of f.

b is a local subsystem of j ∗ R1 f∗ C
and we identify D
with stalk over each value b ∈ B 0 a vector subspace Db of H 1,0 (Fb ) ֒→ H 1 (Fb , C) ≃ H 1 (F, C). We
b ≃D
b is a local system over B. To prove this it is enough to look
claim that the direct image j∗ j ∗ D
at the local monodromies around singular values and recall that under the assumption of semistable
b extends to a local system on
singularities they act trivially on Db (see subsection 2.1). Thus j ∗ D
B. Moreover, it defines the greatest local subsystem of j ∗ R1 f∗ C with stalk D isomorphic over the
general fiber F to a subspace of H 1,0 (F ) ⊂ H 1 (F, C). Otherwise, one should have a local subsystem
D′ ֒→ j ∗ R1 f∗ C together with a not identically zero map j∗ D′ → R1 f∗ OS . This is impossible since the
stalk of R1 f∗ OS over a regular value b ∈ B is H 0,1 (Fb ).

4.2. The local system U and the sheaf f∗ Ω1S,d . In this subsection we describe local sections of U in
terms of the sheaf f∗ Ω1S,d . The result, which we will call Lifting lemma, follows immediately from the
preparation done in the previous section. It is enough to remark that the local system D in Lemma 4.2
is by construction the local system U underlying the unitary factor U (see subsection 2.1, or directly
[CD14]).
Lemma 4.3 (Lifting lemma). Let f : S → B be a complete semistable fibration and U be the local
system underlying the unitary factor U in the second Fujita decomposition of f. Then, there is a short
exact sequence of sheaves

Proof. Since sequence (4.9) is simply the Relative holomorphic de Rham sequence (sequence (4.5)) in
the case of semistable fibrations, where we have set D ≃ U, we just have to remark that by taking the
long exact sequence in cohomology on each proper open subset A of B, then H 1 (A, ωB ) is zero since
A is Stein.

Remark 4.4. The analogue description of the trivial trivial factor O⊕qf of rank the relative irregularity
of f in terms of H 0 (S, ΩS )/f ∗ H 0 (B, ωB ) has been given in [GA13].
We remark that the local liftings of U provided by the above lemma are all closed holomorphic forms
since they differs from pullback of holomorphic forms from the curve B, which are automatically

we provide a splitting of the kernel K∂ to f∗ Ω1S and of the local system U underlying U to f∗ Ω1S,d .

Then the proof follows immediately since the kernel of the two sequences is the same. The morphism

5. Massey-trivial families on U and the Castelnuovo-de Franchis theorem for fibred
surfaces
In this section we relate the geometry of Massey-trivial subspaces W ⊂ Γ(A, U) of flat local sections of
the unitary factor U of a fibration f : S → B of genus g(F ) ≥ 2 to the existence, up to base change, of
morphisms from the surface into a smooth compact curve Σ of genus greater than 2. The construction
is given by a Castelnuovo de Franchis theorem for fibred surfaces proved in [GST17], which we adapt
to our setting.
Let us drop the assumption of compactness on the surface S. Let f : S → B be a fibration of S over
a smooth curve B (not necessarily compact or algebraic) and let F be the general fibre of f. Assume
g(F ) ≥ 2. Let Ω1S,d be the sheaf of closed holomorphic 1−forms on S and consider the wedge map
(5.1)

∧:

H 0 (S, Ω1S,d ) → H 0 (S, ωS ).

We recall the following definition.
Definition 5.1. A subspace V of H 0 (S, Ω1S,d ) is isotropic if the ∧−map restricts to the null map on
V2
V. Moreover, it is maximal if it is not properly contained in any larger isotropic space.
Then the theorem is the following.

MASSEY PRODUCTS AND FUJITA DECOMPOSITIONS

Theorem 5.2 (Castelnuovo-de Franchis for fibred surfaces). Let f : S → B be a fibred surface over
a smooth curve B and let V ⊂ H 0 (S, Ω1S,d ) be a maximal isotopic subspace of dimension r ≥ 2 such
that the restriction V → H 0 (ωF ) to a general fibre F is injective. Then there is a non-constant
morphism ϕ : S → Σ from the surface S to a smooth compact curve Σ of genus g(Σ) ≥ 2 such that
ϕ∗ H 0 (ωΣ ) = V.
Remark 5.3. The above theorem has been stated in [GST17] for B equal to a complex disk. We
remark that the proof generalizes to proper fibrations since the key point is that closed forms give rise
to integrable foliations.
We relate the above theorem with the existence of Massey-trivial subspaces W of flat local sections of
U . Let W ⊂ Γ(A, U) be a subspace of sections over an open subset A. In section 4, we showed that
there is an injection U ֒→ K∂ and moreover each lifting of U to f∗ Ω1S lies in f∗ ΩS,d (Lemma 4.5). We
get the following.
Proposition 5.4. Let A be an open set of B, let iA : A ֒→ B be the inclusion and let W ⊂ Γ(A, U)
f ⊂ H 0 (A, f∗ Ω1 )
be a Massey-trivial subspace of sections of U over A. Then there exists a unique W

f → Γ(A, f∗ ωS ) is the zero map.
which lifts W to f∗ Ω1S,d and such that 2 W
Proof. The proof follows immediately by Proposition 3.8. It is enough to observe that we can choose
liftings in f∗ Ω1S,d by Lemma 4.5 and then all the other admissible splittings are still sections of f∗ Ω1S,d
since they must differs from the first ones by sections of ωB . Moreover, the evaluation map W ⊗ OA →
i∗A K∂ is automatically an injective map of vector bundles since Γ(A, U) is the space of flat sections of
U.

The above proposition shows that Massey-trivial subspaces W of sections on U correspond to isotropic
subspaces of sections on f∗ ΩS,d . Let H < π1 (B, b) be the kernel of the monodromy representation of
U (see section 2.1) and set HW be the subgroup of H which acts trivially on W, that is
(5.2)

HW = {g ∈ H | g · w = w, ∀w ∈ W }.

As an application of the Castelnuovo-de Franchis for fibred surfaces 5.2 we obtain the following.
Theorem 5.5. Let f : S → B be a complete semistable fibration of genus g(F ) ≥ 2 and let W ⊂
Γ(A, U) be a maximal Massey-trivial subspace of sections over A. Then for any subgroup K of HW ,
the fibred surface fK : SK → BK defined by the étale base change uK : BK → B classified by K has an
irrational pencil hK : SK → Σ over a smooth compact curve Σ such that W ≃ h∗K H 0 (ωΣ ).
Proof. Let uW : BW → B be the étale covering classified by HW < H. By construction, the pull
c of global sections Γ(BW , UW ), where UW is the unitary factor
back of W extends to a subspace W
of the fibration fW : SW → BW defined by the base change. The proof follows for HW by applying
c and then also for each étale covering uK : BK → B given by a subgroup K of
Proposition 5.4 to W
HW , in a natural way.

f ⊂ h∗ H 0 (ωΣ ).

We remark that a subspace W ⊂ Γ(A, U) of local sections over a contractible open subset A of B is
not necessarily invariant under the monodromy action of U. This motivates the following definition,
discussed in a more general setting in section 2.1.
Definition 5.7. Let M be a local subsystem of U of stalk M. We say that M is Massey-trivial if the
stalk M is isomorphic to a Massey-trivial subspace of Γ(A, U) of sections over an open contractible
subset A of B. Moreover, we say that M is Massey-trivial generated if the stalk M is generated by a
Massey-trivial subspace of Γ(A, U).
Remark 5.8. Massey-triviality over the general point b of A is a strong condition. By using a standard
argument of analytic continuation, the above property on subspaces W ⊂ Γ(A, U) of local flat sections
on U is stable under the monodromy action.

6. Proof of the main theorems
In this section we give the proof of Theorems 1.2 and 1.1. Let f : S → B be a complete fibration of
genus g(F ) ≥ 2 and let U be the unitary factor in the second Fujita decomposition of f. Let b ∈ B be a
regular value and Fb the (smooth) fibre over b. Let U be the underlying local system (i.e U = U ⊗ OB ),
rU the rank of U , ρ : π1 (B, b) → U (rU , C) the unitary representation of U, H = ker ρ the kernel and
G = π1 (B, b)/H. We recall that G is naturally isomorphic to the monodromy group Im ρ of U and we
identify them.
Let W ⊂ Γ(A, U) be a Massey-trivial subspace of sections over a contractible open subset A of B around
b and M the local sub-system of U generated by W. We recall that M has stalk M = G · W and defines
a unitary flat subbundle M of rank rM = dim M of U together with a unitary sub-representation
ρM : π1 (B, b) → U (rM , C) of ρ. We denote by HM the kernel and by GM = π1 (B, b)/HM the quotient,
again isomorphic to the monodromy group Im ρM (see section 2).
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Assume f : S → B to be a semistable complete fibration. We prove the
following.
Thesis. There is a one to one correspondence between the monodromy group GM of M and the
automorphisms group of a finite set of morphisms K = {kg : F → Σ}g∈GM from the general fiber F to
a smooth compact curve Σ of genus g(Σ) ≥ 2. Moreover, after a finite étale base change uM : BM → B
trivializing the monodromy, the pullback bundle of M becomes the trivial bundle V ⊗ OBM of fibre
P
V = g∈GM kg∗ H 0 (ωΣ ) ⊂ H 0 (ωF ).
The proof is developed in three steps.
(1) The construction of the set K of morphisms of curves;
(2) The proof of the finitness of the monodromy group G;
(3) The geometric description of M.
(1) The construction of the set K of morphisms of curves. Let uM : BM → B be the Galois
covering map classified by the normal group HM of π1 (B, b) and with Galois group GM = π1 (B, b)/HM

of M. By construction, uM : BM → B trivializes the monodromy of M (that is, u−1
M M is a trivial local
system on BM ). We consider the étale base change

where SM is a smooth surface (not necessarily compact) given by the fibred product S ×B BM and
ϕM : SM → S is an étale Galois covering. The action of GM × SM → SM sends a point (p, b′ ) to the
point g(p, b′ ) := (p, gb′ ), for g ∈ GM , where b′ 7→ gb′ is the automorphism of BM defined by the action
of GM on BM . Note that g : SM → SM is an automorphism of SM compatible with the fibration fM .
Let W ⊂ Γ(A, U) be a maximal Massey-trivial subspace of sections over A around b and generating
M. From now on we identify W with a subspace of H 0 (ωFb ) (Remark 2.5). It is easy to check that
HM can be described as
(6.2)

HM = {g ∈ π1 (B, b)| gg′ w = g′ w, ∀w ∈ W, ∀g′ ∈ GM }.

Applying Proposition 5.5 to K = HM < HW , we get an non-constant map h : S M → Σ of S M onto
a smooth compact curve Σ such that u∗M W ≃ h∗ H 0 (ωΣ ). We want to construct a family H := {hg :
S M → Σ}g∈GM of non-constant morphisms and a family K := {kg : Fb → Σ}g∈GM of morphisms of
curves from the smooth fiber Fb over b parametrized by GM . The construction is as follows.
Let b0 a preimage of a point b ∈ A via uM and F0 be the fibre of fM over b0 (which is isomorphic to
the fibre of f over b). For any g ∈ G, we consider the automorphism g : SM → SM and we define hg
and kg by composition

Moreover, we have the following formula.

A. We identify W ⊂ H 0 (ωFb ) as a subspace W ⊂ H 0 (ωF0 ) via the isomorphism H 0 (ωF0 ) ≃ H 0 (ωFb ).

Proof. Let e be the neutral element in GM and g1 ∈ GM , g1 6= e. We want to prove that ΨM (g1 ) 6=
ΨM (e), that is there exists g2 ∈ GM such that g1 · kg2 6= e · kg2 (i.e. kg1 g2 6= kg2 ) It is enough to
prove that kg∗1 g2 6= kg∗2 . Since g1 6= e, then g1 ∈
/ HM . Thanks to description (6.2) of HM , there exists
w ∈ W ⊂ H 0 (ωF ) and g2 ∈ GM such that g1 g2 w 6= g2 w. Let α ∈ H 0 (ωΣ ) be such that ke∗ α = w.
Then by formula (6.4) with g = g1 g2 we get g1 g2 w = (g1 g2 )−1 ke∗ (α) = kg∗1 g2 w, while applying the
same formula with g = g2 we get g2 w = g2−1 ke∗ (α) = kg∗2 (α). By assumption, g1 g2 w 6= g2 w and thus
kg∗1 g2 6= kg∗2 .

(2) The proof of the finiteness of the monodromy group G. The proof follows from a classical
de-Franchis’s theorem (see [Mar88]) applied to the set of morphisms M (F, Σ). Let C and C ′ be smooth
compact curves and let M (C, C ′ ) be the set of non-constant morphisms between them.
Theorem 6.3 (de Franchis). Let C, C ′ be smooth compact curves of genus ≥ 2. Then the set M (C, C ′ )
is finite.
As a consequence, we also have the following.
Proposition 6.4. Let C, C ′ be smooth projective curves of genus ≥ 2. Then the map
(6.8)

M (C, C ′ ) → hom(H 1,0 (C), H 1,0 (C ′ ))

given by the pullback functor is injective.
Sketch of the proof. Let φi : C → C ′ be two morphims between C and C ′ , for i = 1, 2. They induce
linear maps φ1,0
: H 1,0 (C ′ ) → H 1,0 (C) and φ0,1
: H 0,1 (C ′ ) → H 0,1 (C) by pullback. Assume that
i
i
1,0
1,0
φ1 = φ2 . Applying complex conjugation, also φ0,1
= φ20,1 . Using the Hodge decomposition, the
1
maps φ∗iC : H 1 (C ′ , C) → H 1,0 (C, C) and φ∗iZ : H 1 (C ′ , Z) → H 1,0 (C, Z) must be equal. By the above
argument, the same holds on the map from the Jacobians. The result follows by the standard proof
of de Franchis given by Martens in [Mar88] (see also [AP90]). This concludes the argument.
Applying de-Franchis’s theorem to the set of morphisms M (F, Σ), we have that this is a finite set. Thus
also K and consequently Aut(K ) are finite. By Lemma 6.2, ΨM (GM ) is in one to one correspondence
with GM , thus the monodromy GM is finite group and uM is a finite covering.

(3) The geometric description of M. Let M be the local system generated by W, with stalk the
P
vector space M = G · W and recall that GM · W = g∈GM g · W, since HM fixes W. The inverse image
u−1
M M of the local system M via the base change u M : B M → B is by construction a trivial local
system on BM of the same stalk on M. Using the family K of morphisms hg parametrized by GM ,
we get kg∗ H 0 (ωΣ ) = i∗ h∗g H 0 (ωΣ ) = gW, for each g ∈ GM and then the stalk of M is described by
P
∗ 0

a∈G kg H (ωΣ ) ⊂ H (ωF )
6.1. Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let f : S → B be a complete fibration and assume that f is not
semistable (otherwise we can apply Theorem 1.2). Let U be the unitary factor in the second Fujita
decomposition of f, let W ⊂ Γ(A, U) be a Massey-trivial subspace and let M be the generated local
subsystem of U. We want to prove that M has finite monodromy.
Following [CD], we apply the semistable-reduction theorem to reduce to the semistable case. Then
the proof follows using Theorem 1.2 together with some basic facts concerning the behaviour of the
monodromy on local systems.
Indeed, by applying the semistable-reduction theorem (see e.g. [CD, Theorem 2.7 and Proposition
2.9]), we get a base change u : B ′ → B given by a ramified finite morphism of curves and a resolution
on the fiber product

which is split and compatible with the underlying structure of local systems (see section 2.1).
Thus in particular u−1 M is a local subsystem of the local system U′ underlying U ′ . We prove that
u−1 M has finite monodromy, which is enough to prove that M has finite monodromy (by Proposition
2.9). Let c
Wgi be the local system generated by u∗ gi W via Im ρ−1
W , for gi ∈ Iu and Iu ⊂ π1 (B, b) be
′
′
a set of generators of the quotient given by u∗ : π1 (B , b ) → π1 (B, b). We apply Theorem 1.2 to the
local system generated by the maximal Massey-trivial subspace of U containing u∗ gi W, which remains
Massey-trivial by pullback, and we get that this one has finite monodromy. By Proposition 2.8, we
get that maximality is not not an obstruction to the finiteness of the monodromy group. Thus we can
conclude that c
Wgi has finite monodromy. Finally, Propositions 2.9 and 2.4 showthat u−1 M has finite
monodromy.

24

P. PIROLA AND S. TORELLI

Fujita decomposition of a fibration f : S → B of genus g(F ) ≥ 2. The formula together with Theorem
1.2 provides a non-vanishing criterion for the Griffiths infinitesimal invariant of the canonical normal
function in terms of the monodromy of U . This is the content of Corollary 7.2.
We briefly recall the construction of the objects involved and refer to [Voi03], [?], [Gri83] [Voi88]
for details and formal definitions. Let f : S → B be a complete fibration with general fiber F. Let
j : B 0 ֒→ B be the natural inclusion and consider the restriction of f to B 0 , which is a smooth fibration
f 0 : S 0 → B 0 . Then we can associate to such a family the Jacobian fibration j(f 0 ) : J (f ) → B 0 of
general fiber the Jacobian J(F ). This is a fibration of g−dimensional polarized abelian varieties over
the smooth curve B 0 and has a variation of the Hodge structure. The (g − 1)−Griffiths intermediate
Jacobian of J(F ) is defined by the Hodge structure {HZ2g−3 = H 2g−3 (J(F ), Z), F p H 2g−3 (J(F ), C), p ≥
0} of J(F ) as
(7.1)
J g−1 (J(F )) = H 2g−3 (J(F ), C)/(F g−1 H 2g−3 (J(F ), C) ⊕ HZ2g−3 ) ≃ F 2 H 3 (J(F ), C)∗ /H3 (J(C), Z),
where F p H 2g−3 (J(F ), C), p ≥ 0 is the Hodge filtration (see [Voi02] for details). The intermediate
Jacobians fit into a fibration j g−1 (f ) : J g−1 (f 0 ) → B 0 of complex tori over the smooth curve B 0 .
The construction is compatible with the decomposition given by the Lefschetz operator in terms of
primitive cohomology and we get the intermediate Primitive Jacobian family p(f 0 ) : P(f ) → B 0 ,
defined on the general fibre F of f as
(7.2)

P (F ) = F 2 P 3 (J(F ), C)∗ /H3 (J(C), Z)prim ,

where H3 (J(F ), Z)prim is the image of H3 (J(F ), Z) in F 2 P 3 (J(F ), C)∗ . Integration over the group
of one dimensional algebraic cycles Z g−1 (J(F ))hom homologically equivalent to zero in J g−1 (F ) =
F 2 H 3 (J(F ), C)∗ /H3 (J(C), Z) provides a higher Abel-Jacobi map, which is independent on the choice
of the base point of the projection J g−1 (F ) → P (F ) over P (F ). The Ceresa cycle of the general fibre
F is defined as the one cycle given by the image of F − F − in J(F ) via the Abel Jacobi map. The
canonical normal function is defined to be the section ν : B 0 → P(f ) associating to each b ∈ B 0
the image of the Ceresa cycle [Fb − Fb− ] ∈ Z g−1 (J(Fb ))hom via the higher Abel-Jacobi map. The
Griffiths infinitesimal invariant δ(ν) of the canonical normal function contains information on flatness
of local liftings of those normal functions. We refer to [CP95] for the explicit definition. The link with
our result is given by the fact that this infinitesimal invariant induces over a point b ∈ B 0 a linear
map ker(γ) → C, where γ : TB,b ⊗ P 2,1 J(Fb ) → P 1,2 J(Fb ) is naturally defined by the IVHS on the
primitive cohomological groups P 1,2 J(Fb ) and P 1,2 J(Fb ) in H 3 (J(Fb ), C). The infinitesimal invariant
has been computed in [CP95], for some special elements. Let {H 1 (Fb , Z), H 1,0 = H 0 (ωFb ), Q)} be
R
the geometric Hodge structure on Fb , polarized by the intersection form Q(−, −) = 2i Fb − ∧ −,

which as usual induces a hermitian form on H 0 (ωFb ) using the conjugation H 0,1 (Fb ) ≃ H 1,0 (Fb ). Let
ξb ∈ H 1 (TFb ) be the Kodaira-Spencer class of Fb . We have the following.
Lemma 7.1. ([CP95]) Let ω1 , ω2 , σ ∈ H 0 (ωFb ) be such that ξb · ω1 = ξb · ω2 = 0 and Q(ω1 , σ̄) =
Q(ω2 , σ̄) = 0. Then ω1 ∧ ω2 ∧ σ̄ lies, up to a natural isomorphism, in ker γ and we have
(7.3)

δ(ν)(ξb ⊗ ω1 ∧ ω2 ∧ σ̄) = −2Q(mξb (ω1 , ω2 ), σ̄).

As an application of Theorem 1.1, we get the following.

Corollary 7.2. Let f : S → B be a fibration of genus g(F ) ≥ 2 and U be the unitary factor in the
second Fujita decomposition of f. If the monodromy of U is not finite, then the Griffiths infinitesimal
invariant on the canonical normal function ν : B 0 → P(f ) is not zero at the general point b ∈ B 0 . In
particular, ν is not a torsion section.
Proof. We apply the previous formula to sections of j ∗ U ⊂ j ∗ K∂ . Since the monodromy of U is not
finite, then by Theorem 1.2 is not Massey-trivial generated and we can find a pair (ω1 , ω2 ) ⊂ H 0 (ωFb )
of independent element such that mξb (ω1 , ω2 ) 6= 0. Applying the formula 7.3 to ω1 , ω2 ∈ H 0 (ωFb )
(which are such that ξb · ω1 = ξb · ω2 = 0) and σ = mξb (ω1 , ω2 ) ∈ H 0 (ωFb ) we get
(7.4)

δ(ν)(ξb ⊗ ω1 ∧ ω2 ∧ σ̄) = −2Q(mξb (ω1 , ω2 ), m̄ξb (ω1 , ω2 )) < 0

This concludes the proof, since the fact that the normal function is non-torsion when the Griffiths
infinitesimal invariant in not zero has been proven in [GH83b], [Gre89],[Voi88].

In particular, the previous result applies to the examples provided in [CD14], in [CD] and also in
[CD16], concerning the construction of fibrations where the monodromy of U is not finite. More
precisely, one can state the following.
Corollary 7.3. Let f : S → B be a fibration as those constructed in [CD14], [CD] and [CD16] with
U of not finite monodromy. Then the canonical normal function is not torsion.
7.2. Semiampleness criterion for the Hodge bundle and hyperelliptic fibrations. In this
section we state a criterion for the semiampleness of f∗ ωS/B , where f : S → B is a fibration of genus
g(F ) ≥ 2 in terms of Massey-trivial generated bundles, which is a corollary of Theorem 5.8, together
with a characterization for semiampleness on unitary flat bundles ( see e.g [CD, Theorem 2.5]). Then
we show that hyperelliptic fibrations naturally satisfy the condition.
Let f : S → B be a projective fibration of genus g(F ) ≥ 2 and f∗ ωS/B be the Hodge bundle of f .
According to the second Fujita decomposition, we have a splitting f∗ ωS/B = U ⊕ A as a direct sum of
a unitary flat bundle U and an ample bundle A. Since A is semiample, the semiampleness of f∗ ωS/B
depends only on U . We recall the following characterization of semiampleness of unitary flat bundles,
referring to [CD] for a complete proof.
Proposition 7.4. A unitary flat bundle V over a smooth compact curve B is semiample if and only
if it has finite monodromy.
As a consequence, applying Theorem 1.1 we get the following criterion.
Corollary 7.5. Let f : S → B be a projective semistable fibration of genus g(F ) ≥ 2 and U be the
unitary factor in the second Fujita decomposition of f. If U is Massey-trivial generated, then f∗ ωS/B
is semiample.
Now we analyze the case of hyperelliptic fibrations, where it turns out that the unitary factor U is
more than Massey-trivial generated. Indeed, the hyperelliptic involution forces it to be Massey-trivial.
We recall that a fibration f : S → B is hyperelliptic of genus g(F ) ≥ 2 if the general fibre F of f is
hyperelliptic curve of genus g(F ) ≥ 2 and we denote by σ : F → F the hyperelliptic involution of F.

Proposition 7.6. Let f : S → B be a hyperelliptic fibration of genus g(F ) ≥ 2. Then f∗ ωS/B is
semiample.
Proof. We prove that U is Massey-trivial generated whenever f is hyperelliptic. Then the proof follows
immediately applying Criterion 7.5. Let F be the general fibre of f and ξ ∈ H 1 (TF ) the extension
of F. Consider s1 , s2 ∈ U ⊂ H 0 (ωF ) two independent vectors in the fibre U of U . Observe that
since f is hyperelliptic, each s ∈ U lies in Kξ and we can compute the Massey product of the pair
(s1 , s2 ). By formula (3.5), mξ (s1 , s2 ) is antisymmetric in s1 , s2 . Applying the hyperelliptic involution,
which acts on H 0 (ωF ) by pullback σ ∗ : H 0 (ωF ) → H 0 (ωF ) as the −1 multiplication map, we get
σ ∗ mξ (s1 , s2 ) = −mξ (s1 , s2 ). On the other hand, σ ∗ mξ (s1 , s2 ) = mξ (−s1 , −s2 ) = mξ (−s1 , −s2 ) and
thus by antisymmetry it must be zero.

We remark that the same conclusion has been proven in [LZ17] using different techniques.
