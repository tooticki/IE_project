TRANSLATION INVARIANT FILTERS
AND VAN DER WAERDEN’S THEOREM
MAURO DI NASSO
Abstract. We present a self-contained proof of a strong version of van der
Waerden’s Theorem. By using translation invariant filters that are maximal
with respect to inclusion, a simple inductive argument shows the existence of
“piecewise syndetically”-many monochromatic arithmetic progressions of any
length k in every finite coloring of the natural numbers. All the constructions
presented are constructive in nature, in the sense that the involved maximal
filters are defined by recurrence on suitable countable algebras of sets. No use
of the axiom of choice or of Zorn’s Lemma is needed.

Introduction
The importance of maximal objects in mathematics is well-known, starting from
the fundamental examples of maximal ideals in algebra, and of ultrafilters in certain
areas of topology and of Ramsey theory. In this paper we focus on maximal filters
on suitable countable algebras of sets which are stable under translations. By using
such maximal objects, along with ultrafilters extending it, we give a proof of a
strong version of the following classical result in Ramsey theory:
Theorem (van der Waerden - 1927) In every finite partition N = C1 ∪ . . . ∪ Cr
there exists a piece C = Ci that contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions,
that is, for every k there exists a progression x + y, x + 2y, . . . , x + ky ∈ C.
In fact, we will prove the existence of “piecewise syndetically”-many monochromatic arithmetic progressions of any length k.
Usually, van der Waerden’s Theorem is proved either by double induction using
elaborated, but elementary, combinatorial arguments in the style of the original
proof [5], or by using properties of the smallest ideal K(βN, ⊕) in the algebra of
ultrafilters (see [4, Ch.14]; see also [2, 1] for stronger versions). In our proof, for
any given piecewise set, we restrict to a suitable countable algebra of sets, and
explicitly construct by recursion a maximal translation invariant filter, and then
an ultrafilter extending it. The desired result is finally obtained by a short proof
by induction, that is essentially a simplified version of an argument that was used
in [3] in the framework of the compact right-topological semigroup (βN, ⊕). It is
worth remarking that, contrarily to the usual ultrafilter proof, we make no explicit
use of the algebra in the space of ultrafilters; in fact, we make no use of the axiom
of choice nor of Zorn’s Lemma.

1. Preliminary notions
N denotes the set of positive integers, and N0 = N ∪ {0} the set of non-negative
integers. For A ⊆ N and n ∈ N0 , the leftward shift of A by n is the set:
A − n := {m ∈ N | n + m ∈ A}
Elemental notions in combinatorics of numbers that we will use in this paper are
those of thick set, syndetic set, and piecewise syndetic set. For completeness, let
us recall them here.
A set A ⊆ N is thick if it includes arbitrarily long intervals. Equivalently, A is
thick if every finite set F = {n1 , . . . , nk } ⊂ N has a rightward shift included in A,
that is, there exists x such that
x + F := {x + n1 , . . . , x + nk } ⊆ A.
Notice that such an x can be picked in A. In terms of intersections, the property
of thickness of A can be rephrased by saying that the family {A − n | n ∈ N0 } has
Tk
the finite intersection property (FIP for short), that is, i=1 (A − ni ) 6= ∅ for any
n1 , . . . , nk .
A set A ⊆ N is syndetic if it has “bounded gaps”, that is, there exists k ∈ N such
that A meets every interval of length k. Equivalently, A is syndetic if a finite number
Sk
of leftward shifts of A covers all the natural numbers, that is, N = i=1 (A − ni )
for suitable n1 , . . . , nk ∈ N0 .
A set is piecewise syndetic if it is the intersection of a thick set with a syndetic
set. Equivalently, A is piecewise syndetic if a finite number of leftward shifts cover
Sk
a thick set, that is, i=1 (A − ni ) is thick for suitable n1 , . . . , nk ∈ N0 .
Notice that the families of thick, syndetic, and piecewise syndetic sets are all
invariant with respect to shifts. A well-known relevant property of piecewise syndetic sets that is neither satisfied by thick sets nor by syndetic sets, is the Ramsey
property below. For the sake of completeness, we include here a proof.
Proposition 1.1. In every finite partition A = C1 ∪. . .∪Cr of a piecewise syndetic
set A, one of the pieces Ci is piecewise syndetic.
Proof. For simplicity, let us say that an interval I is k-good for the set B if for every
sub-interval J ⊆ I of lenght k one has J ∩ B 6= ∅. By the hypothesis of piecewise
syndeticity of A, there exists k ∈ N and a sequence of intervals hIn | n ∈ Ni with
increasing length such that every In is k-good for A. It is enough to consider the
case when A = C1 ∪ C2 is partitioned into two pieces, because the general case
r ≥ 2 will then follow by induction. We distinguish two cases.
Case # 1: There exists h and there exist infinitely many intervals In that are
h-good for C1 . In this case C1 is piecewise syndetic.
Case # 2: For every h, there are only finitely many intervals In that are h-good
for C1 . So, for every h we can pick an interval Inh of length ≥ h that is not h-good.
Let Jh ⊆ Inh be a sub-interval of length h such that Jh ∩ C1 = ∅. The sequence
of intervals hJh | h ∈ Ni shows that C2 is piecewise syndetic. Indeed, given h, for
every sub-interval J ⊆ Jh of length k we have that J ∩ C1 ⊆ Jh ∩ C1 = ∅; and so
J ∩ C2 = J ∩ A 6= ∅, since J ⊆ Inh and Inh is k-good for A.

2. Maximal filters
An algebra of sets on N is a family of subsets of N that contains N and is closed
under finite unions, finite intersections, and complements. Given a countable family
A, one can explicitly construct the (countable) algebra of sets generated by A, that
is, the smallest algebra that contains A.1
A filter on an algebra of sets B is a nonempty family F ⊆ B such that:
• F is closed under finite intersections, that is, A, B ∈ F ⇒ A ∩ B ∈ F ;
• F is closed under supersets, that is, if B ∈ B and B ⊇ A ∈ F then B ∈ F .
Every family G ⊆ B with the finite intersection property (FIP for short) generates
a filter hGi, namely
hGi := {B ∈ B | B ⊇ A1 ∩ . . . ∩ Ak where Ai ∈ G}.
An ultrafilter U on the algebra of sets B is a filter with the additional property
that A ∈ U whenever A ∈ B and the complement Ac ∈
/ U. Equivalently, an
ultrafilter is a filter U with the Ramsey property: If A1 ∪ . . . ∪ Ak ∈ U where all
sets Ai ∈ B, then Aj ∈ U for some j. Ultrafilters can also be characterized as the
filters that are maximal under inclusion and so, by a straight application of Zorn’s
Lemma, it is proved that every filter can be extended to an ultrafilter.
The main ingredient in our proof of van der Waerden’s Theorem are those filters
that are stable under shifts.
Definition 2.1. F is a translation invariant filter (TIF for short) if F is a filter
with the additional property that if A ∈ F then also A − 1 ∈ F (and hence,
A − n ∈ F for all n ∈ N0 ).
The notions of TIF and thick set are closely related.
Proposition 2.2. A set A is thick if and only if it belongs to a TIF F .
Proof. Recall that A is thick if and only if the family G = {A − n | n ∈ N0 } has the
FIP. It is easily verified that the generated filter hGi is translation invariant.
Conversely, assume that A ∈ F for some TIF F . Then trivially the family
G = {A − n | n ∈ N0 } has the FIP because G ⊆ F .

Similarly to ultrafilters, by a straightforward application of Zorn’s Lemma it
can be shown that every TIF can be extended to a maximal TIF. However, in
the countable case, recursive constructions suffice to produce both ultrafilters and
maximal TIFs, which are thus obtained in a constructive manner, without any use
of the axiom of choice.
Proposition 2.3. Let B = {Bn | n ∈ N} be a countable algebra of sets.
1 Let hA | n ∈ Ni be an enumeration of the elements of A, and let hF | n ∈ Ni be an

the following family B is the algebra generated by A, where we denoted A1 = A and A−1 = Ac :

(1) Given a family G ⊆ B with the FIP, define G0 = G; Gn+1 = Gn ∪ {Bn }
in case
S Bn ∩ A 6= ∅ for every A ∈ Gn ; and Gn+1 = Gn otherwise. Then
U := n Gn is an ultrafilter that extends G.
(2) Given a family G ⊆ B with the FIP and such that A ∈ G ⇒ A − 1 ∈ G,
define G0 = G; Gn+1 = Gn ∪ {Bn − k | k ∈ NS
0 } in case that union has the
FIP; and Gn+1 = Gn otherwise. Then M := n Gn is a maximal TIF that
extends G.
Proof. (1). By the definition, it is clear that all families Gn have the FIP, and so also
U has the FIP. Now assume by contradiction that A ∈ B is such that both A, Ac ∈
/ U.
If A = Bn and Ac = Bm , then, by the definition of U, there exist U ∈ Gm and
U ′ ∈ Gm such that A ∩ U = Ac ∩ U ′ = ∅. But then U ∩ U ′ ⊆ (A ∩ U ) ∪ (Ac ∩ U ′ ) = ∅,
against the FIP of U. Finally, if B ⊇ A where B ∈ B and A ∈ U then B ∈ U, as
otherwise, by what just proved, B c ∈ U, and hence ∅ = B c ∩A ∈ U, a contradiction.
(2). By induction, it directly follows from the definition that all families Gn have
the FIP and satisfy the property “A ∈ Gn ⇒ A − 1 ∈ Gn ”; so, the same properties
hold for M. If B ⊇ A where B ∈ B and A ∈ M, say A ∈ Gn , then B ∈ Gn+1 because
trivially the FIP of Gn ∪ {A − n | n ∈ N0 } implies the FIP of Gn ∪ {B − n | n ∈ N0 }.
This shows that M is a TIF. As for the maximality, let M′ ⊇ M be a TIF. Given
A ∈ M′ , pick n with A = Bn . The family Gn ∪ {A − n | n ∈ N0 } has the FIP, since
it is included in the filter M′ , and so A ∈ Gn+1 . This shows that M′ ⊆ M, and
hence the two TIFs are equal.

Two properties of maximal TIFs that will be relevant to our purposes are the
following.
Proposition 2.4. Let U be an ultrafilter that includes a maximal TIF M. Then:
(1) Every B ∈ U is piecewise syndetic.
(2) For every B ∈ U, the set BU := {n ∈ N | B − n ∈ U} is syndetic.2
Proof. Notice first that for every B ∈ U there exist n1 , . . . , nk such that the union
Sk
c
i=1 (B − ni ) ∈ M. Indeed, if Λ := {B − n | n ∈ N0 } then the union M ∪ Λ
does not have the FIP, as otherwise M ∪ Λ would generate a TIF that properly
extends M, against the maximality. So, there exist A ∈ M and n1 , . . . , nk such
T
S
that A ∩ ki=1 (B c − ni ) = ∅. But then ki=1 (B − ni ) ∈ M, as a superset of A ∈ M.
Sk
(1). Pick a finite union of shifts i=1 (B − ni ) ∈ M. By Proposition 2.2, that
union is thick as an element of a TIF, and hence B is piecewise syndetic.
Sk
(2). As above, pick a finite union of shifts i=1 (B − ni ) ∈ M. By translation
Sk
invariance, for every m ∈ N one has that i=1 (B − ni − m) ∈ M ⊆ U and so, by
the Ramsey property of ultrafilters, there exists i such that B − ni − m ∈ U, that
S
is, m ∈ BU − ni . This shows that N = ki=1 (BU − ni ) is a finite union of shifts of
BU , and hence BU is syndetic.

3. A strong version of van der Waerden’s Theorem
The following property of piecewise syndetic sets was proved by exploiting the
properties of ultrafilters in the smallest ideal of the right-topological semigroup
(βN, ⊕) (see [2, 1]).
2 We remark that in general the set B does not belong to the algebra of sets B.

Theorem 3.1. Let A be a piecewise syndetic set. Then for every k ∈ N, the set
APk (A) := {x ∈ A | ∃y ∈ N s.t. x + iy ∈ A for i = 1, . . . , k} is piecewise syndetic.
Notice that, as a straight consequence, one obtains the following strong version
of van der Waerden’s Theorem.
Corollary 3.2. In every finite partition N = C1 ∪ . . . ∪ Cr there exists a piece
C = Ci such that, for every k ∈ N, the set APk (C) is piecewise syndetic.
Proof. By the Ramsey property of piecewise syndetic sets (see Proposition 1.1), we
can pick a color Ci which is piecewise syndetic.

In this section we will give a new proof of the above theorem which only relies on
the existence of a maximal TIF M that contains A, and of an ultrafilter U ⊇ M.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. Let B be the countable algebra of sets generated by the
family {A − n | n ∈ N0 }. By the property of piecewise syndeticity, a finite union
Sk
of shifts T = i=1 (A − ni ) is thick. Then the family G := {T − n | n ∈ N0 } ⊆ B
has the FIP, and since G trivially satisfies the shift invariance property “A ∈ G ⇒
A − 1 ∈ G”, by Proposition 2.3 we can pick a maximal TIF M on B with M ⊇ G,
and an ultrafilter U on B with U ⊇ M. The desired result is a consequence of the
following general property.
Claim. Let U be an ultrafilter that extends a maximal TIF. If a shift B − ℓ ∈ U
for some ℓ ∈ N0 , then BU − ℓ contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.
Sk
Indeed, since T = j=1 (A − nj ) ∈ F ⊆ U, there exists nj such that A − nj ∈ U.
Then for every k ∈ N there exists an arithmetic progression ℓ + iy ∈ AU − nj
Tk
for i = 0, 1, . . . , k. But then i=0 (A − nj − ℓ − iy) ⊆ APk (A) − nj − ℓ ∈ U.
In consequence, APk (A) is piecewise syndetic by Proposition 2.4, as a shift of a
member of U.
We are left to prove the Claim. We proceed by induction on k, and prove that if
B − ℓ ∈ U for some ℓ ∈ N0 , then BU − ℓ contains a k-term arithmetic progression.3
If B − ℓ ∈ U, then the set (B − ℓ)U = BU − ℓ is syndetic by Proposition 2.4. In
particular, BU − ℓ 6= ∅, and this proves the induction base k = 1.
Let us turn to the inductive step k + 1, and assume that B − ℓ0 ∈ U. By
syndeticity of BU − ℓ0 , there exists a finite F ⊂ N0 such that for every n ∈ N there
exists x ∈ F with ℓ0 + n + x ∈ BU . For convenience, let us assume that 0 ∈ F . By
the inductive hypothesis, there exist ℓ1 ∈ N0 and y1 ∈ N such that ℓ1 +iy1 ∈ BU −ℓ0
for i = 1, . . . , k, that is, ℓ0 + ℓ1 + x0 + iy1 ∈ BU where x0 = 0 ∈ F . Pick x1 ∈ F
with ℓ0 + ℓ1 + x1 ∈ BU . If x1 = x0 then we already found a (k + 1)-term arithmetic
progression in BU , as desired. Otherwise, let us consider the intersection
B1 = (B − x1 ) ∩

(B − x0 − iy1 ).

i=1

Since ℓ0 + ℓ1 + x1 ∈ BU and ℓ0 + ℓ1 + x0 + iy1 ∈ BU , the shift B1 − ℓ0 − ℓ1 ∈ U and
so, by the inductive hypothesis, there exist ℓ2 ∈ N0 and y2 ∈ N such that ℓ2 + iy2 ∈
(B1 )U − ℓ0 − ℓ1 for i = 1, . . . , k. In consequence, ℓ0 + ℓ1 + ℓ2 + x0 + i(y1 + y2 ) ∈ BU
and ℓ0 + ℓ1 + ℓ2 + x1 + iy2 ∈ BU for every i = 1, . . . , k. Pick x2 ∈ F with

ℓ0 + ℓ1 + ℓ2 + x2 ∈ BU . Notice that if x2 = x0 or x2 = x1 then we have a (k + 1)term arithmetic progression in BU . Otherwise, let us consider the intersection

Since B2 − ℓ0 − ℓ1 − ℓ2 ∈ U, by the inductive hypothesis we can find an arithmetic
progression in BU − ℓ0 − ℓ1 − ℓ2 of lenght k. We iterate the procedure. As the set
F is finite, after finitely many steps we will find elements xn = xm where n > m,
and finally obtain the following arithmetic progression of length k + 1:
ℓ0 + ℓ1 + . . . + ℓn + xn + i(ym+1 + . . . + yn )

i = 0, 1, . . . , k.

4. TIFs and left ideals in the space of ultrafilters
The usual ultrafilter proof of van der Waerden’s Theorem (see [4, §14.1]) is
grounded on the existence of minimal ultrafilters, that is, on ultrafilters that belong
to minimal left ideals of the compact right-topological semigroup (βN, ⊕). In this
final section, we show how (maximal) translation invariant filters are in fact related
to the closed (minimal) left ideals of (βN, ⊕). Let us recall here the involved notions.
The space βN is the topological space of all ultrafilters U over the full algebra of
sets B = P(N) where a base of (cl)open sets is given by the family {OA | A ⊆ N},
with OA := {U ∈ βN | A ∈ U}. The space βN is Hausdorff and compact, and
coincides with the Stone-Cĕch compactification of the discrete space N.
The pseudosum U ⊕ V of ultrafilters U, V ∈ βN is defined by letting:
A ∈ U ⊕ V ⇐⇒ {n ∈ N | A − n ∈ V} ∈ U.
The operation ⊕ is associative (but not commutative), and for every V, the map
U 7→ U ⊕ V is continuous. This makes (βN, ⊕) a right-topological semigroup.
A left ideal L ⊆ βN is a nonempty set such that V ∈ L implies U ⊕ V ∈ L for all
U ∈ βN. Right ideals are defined similarly. Left ideals that are minimal with respect
to inclusion are particularly relevant objects, as they satisfy special properties.
For instance, their union K(βN, ⊕) is shown to be the smallest bilater ideal (i.e.
both a left and a right ideal). Moreover, all ultrafilters U in K(βN, ⊕), named
minimal ultrafilters, have the property that every set A ∈ U includes arbitrarily
long arithmetic progressions.4
It is well-known that there are natural correspondences between families with the
finite intersection property on the full algebra P(N), and closed nonempty subsets
of βN. Indeed, the following properties are directly verified from the definitions.
• If G ⊆ P(N) is a family with the FIP then C(G) := {V ∈ βN | V ⊇ G} is a
nonempty closed subspace.
T
• If X ⊆ βN is nonempty then F(X) := {V | V ∈ X} is a filter on P(N).
• C(F(X)) = X for every nonempty X ⊆ βN.
• F(C(F )) = F for every filter F on P(N).
Proposition 4.1. Let B = P(N) be the full algebra of all subsets of N. If F is a
TIF then C(F ) is a closed left ideal of (βN, ⊕); and conversely, if L is a left ideal of
(βN, ⊕) then F(L) is a TIF. Moreover, M is a maximal TIF if and only if C(M)
4 For all notions and basic results on the space of ultrafilters and on its algebraic structure,
including properties of the smallest ideal K(βN, ⊕), we refer the reader to the book [4].

is a minimal left ideal of (βN, ⊕); and L is a minimal left ideal of (βN, ⊕) if and
only if F(L) is a maximal TIF.
Proof. Let V ∈ C(F ) and let U ∈ βN be any ultrafilter. For every A ∈ F , by
translation invariance we know that A − n ∈ F for all n, and so {n | A − n ∈ V} =
N ∈ U. This shows that A ∈ U ⊕ V. As this is true for every A ∈ F , we conclude
that U ⊕ V ∈ C(F ), and so C(F ) is a closed left ideal.
Now let A ∈ F(L) where L is a left ideal. For every V ∈ L, we have that
U1 ⊕ V ∈ L, where U1 := {B ⊆ N | 1 ∈ B} is the principal ultrafilter generated
by 1. Then A ∈ U1 ⊕ V, which is equivalent to A − 1 ∈ V. As this holds for every
V ∈ L, we have proved that A − 1 ∈ F(L), as desired.
Let F be a TIF. If the left ideal C(F ) is not minimal, pick a minimal L ( C(F ).
Then F ( F(L), and hence F is not maximal. Indeed, L ⊆ C(F ) ⇒ F(L) ⊇
F(C(F )) = F ; moreover, F =
6 F(L), as otherwise C(F ) = C(F(L)) = L = L, against
our assumptions. (Recall that a minimal left ideal L is necessarily closed because,
by minimality, L = βN ⊕ V := {U ⊕ V | U ∈ βN} for every given V ∈ L, and βN ⊕ V
is closed as the image of the compact Hausdorff space βN under the continuous
function U 7→ U ⊕ V.) In a similar way, one shows the converse implication: If the
TIF F is not maximal then the left ideal C(F ) is not minimal. In consequence,
L = C(F(L)) is minimal if and only if F(L) is maximal, and also the last equivalence
follows.

As a straight consequence, we obtain the desired characterization.
Corollary 4.2. Let B = P(N) be the full algebra of all subsets of N. An ultrafilter
U includes a maximal TIF if and only if U belongs to the smallest ideal K(βN, ⊕).
Proof. Recall that U ∈ K(βN, ⊕) if and only if U belongs to some minimal left
ideal. Now let U ⊇ M where M is a maximal TIF. Since M = F(C(M)), we
have that U ∈ C(M), where C(M) is a minimal left ideal. Conversely, let U ∈ L
where L is a minimal left ideal. Then F(L) is a maximal TIF and U ⊇ F(L), since
U ∈ L = C(F(L)).

Remark 4.3. One can generalize the contents of this paper from the natural numbers
to arbitrary countable semigroups (S, ·). Indeed, the notion of translation invariant
filter also makes sense in that more general framework.5 Precisely, if B is an algebra
of subsets of S, one defines a TIF on B as a filter F with the additional property
that A ∈ F ⇒ s−1 A := {t ∈ S | s · t ∈ A} ∈ F for every s ∈ S. Then, by the same
arguments as used in this paper, one can prove that Theorem 3.1 holds, provided
one adopts a suitable generalization of the notion of piecewise syndetic set.6

there exists x ∈ S with F · x := {y · x | y ∈ F } ⊆ T ; a set A ⊆ S is syndetic if a suitable finite
