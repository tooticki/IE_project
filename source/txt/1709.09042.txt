A BSTRACT. In this article, we study the order of vanishing and a quantitative form of Landis’
conjecture in the plane for solutions to second-order elliptic equations with variable coefficients and
singular lower order terms. Precisely, we let A be real-valued, bounded and elliptic, but not necessary
symmetric or continuous, and we assume that V and Wi are real-valued and belong to L p and Lqi ,
respectively. We prove that if u is a real-valued, bounded and normalized solution to an equation of
the form − div (A∇u + W1u) + W2 · ∇u + Vu = 0 in Bd , then under suitable conditions on the lower
order terms, for any r sufficiently small, the following order of vanishing estimate holds
||u||L∞ (Br ) ≥ rCM ,
where M depends on the Lebesgue norms of the lower order terms. In a number of settings, a scaling
argument gives rise to a quantitative form of Landis’ conjecture,


inf ||u||L∞ (B1 (z0 )) ≥ exp −CRβ log R ,

where β depends on p, q1 , and q2 . The integrability assumptions that we impose on V and Wi are
nearly optimal in view of a scaling argument. We use the theory of elliptic boundary value problems
to establish the existence of positive multipliers associated to the elliptic equation. Then the proofs
rely on transforming the equations to Beltrami systems and applying a generalization of Hadamard’s
three-circle theorem.

1. I NTRODUCTION
In this paper, we study quantitative versions of Landis’ conjecture for real-valued solutions to
second-order, uniformly elliptic equations with singular lower order terms. Over an open, connected Ω ⊂ R2 , define the second-order divergence-form operator
2

L := − div (A∇) ,

where we assume that A = ai j i, j=1 is real-valued, measurable, and is not necessarily symmetric.
We also assume that A is uniformly elliptic and bounded, i.e., there exist λ ∈ (0, 1], Λ > 0 so that
for every z ∈ Ω,
ai j (z) ξ i ξ j ≥ λ |ξ |2 for all ξ ∈ R2 ,


ai j (z) ≤ Λ.

For real-valued W1 ,W2 ,V belonging to appropriate Lebesgue spaces, we study the unique continuation properties of real-valued solutions to the following second-order elliptic equation in the
plane:
− div (A∇u +W1 u) +W2 · ∇u +Vu = 0.
(3)
We use the notation Br (z0 ) to denote the ball of radius r centered at z0 ∈ R2 . Often, we abbreviate
this notation and simply write Br when the centre is understood from the context. For the order
of vanishing estimates, we consider solutions to (3) in Bd , where d is a constant to be specified
below (see (17)). The constants b, b̃ will also be specified later on (see (57) and (72)), once we
have introduced quasi-balls. Quasi-balls are sets associated with the levels sets of fundamental
solutions, and are therefore appropriate generalizations of standard balls to the variable coefficient
setting.
Our first collection of theorems describe the order of vanishing for solutions to equations of the
form (3). First we consider very general equations with smallness and non-negativity conditions
on the singular lower order terms.
Theorem 1. Assume that conditions (1) and (2)nare satisfied,
o and that for some q1 , q2 ∈ (2, ∞],
p ∈ (1, ∞], ||W1 ||Lq1 (Bd ) ≤ K, ||W2 ||Lq2 (Bd ) ≤ min 2cλq , 3C1q , and ||V ||L p (Bd ) ≤ 3C1 p , where K ≥ 1

and cq2 ,Cq2 ,C p ≥ 1 are specific constants. Assume further that

W1 · ∇φ ≥ 0 for every φ ∈ W 1,q1 (Ω) such that φ ≥ 0,
ˆ

′
W2 · ∇φ +V φ ≥ 0 for every φ ∈ W 1,q2 (Ω) ∩ L p (Ω) such that φ ≥ 0,
(5)
where q′1 , q′2 , p′ denote the conjugate exponent of q1 , q2 , p, respectively. Let u be a real-valued
solution to (3) in Bd that satisfies
||u||L∞ (Bd ) ≤ exp (C0 K)
||u||L∞ (Bb ) ≥ 1.

(6)
(7)

Then for any r sufficiently small and any ε > 0,

||u||L∞ (Br ) ≥ rCK
where C depends on λ , Λ, q1 , q2 , p, C0 , and ε .

,

(8)

In the case where W2 ,V ≡ 0, the previous result holds with ε = 0 in the absence of condition (4).
Theorem 2. Assume that conditions (1) and (2) are satisfied, and that for some q ∈ [2, ∞], ||W ||Lq(Bd ) ≤
K. Let u be a real-valued solution to
− div (A∇u +Wu) = 0

(9)

in Bd that satisfies (6).
(a) If q > 2 and u satisfies (7), then for any r sufficiently small, (8) holds with ε = 0 and C
depending on λ , Λ, q, and C0 .
(b) If q = 2, then the strong unique continuation property holds.
When W1 ,V ≡ 0 and we have additional assumptions on the coefficient matrix, we get another
order of vanishing estimate. Again, we do not require any smallness or non-negativity on the lower
order terms.
Theorem 3. Let A be symmetric and uniformly elliptic with Lipschitz continuous coefficients. That
is, (1) and (2) hold, a12 = a21 , and as a consequence of Rademacher’s theorem, there exists µ > 0
such that


∇ai j  ∞ ≤ µ for each i, j = 1, 2.

Assume that for some q ∈ [2, ∞], ||W ||Lq (Bd ) ≤ K. Let u be a real-valued solution to
− div (A∇u) +W · ∇u = 0.

(11)

in Bd .
(a) If q > 2 and u satisfies (6) and (7), then for any r sufficiently small, (8) holds with ε = 0
and C depending on λ , Λ, µ , q, and C0 .
(b) If q = 2 and u satisfies ||u||L∞ (Bd ) ≤ M, ||∇u||L2 (B ) ≥ 1, then for any r sufficiently small
b̃

2
||u||L∞ (Br ) ≥ rC(log M+K ) ,

(12)

where C depends on λ , Λ, and µ .

Finally, we consider a very general form of the equation without any smallness assumptions on
the three lower order terms. In this setting, we impose a comprehensive sign condition on the lower
order terms.
Theorem 4. Let A be a symmetric matrix for which (1), (2), and (10) hold. Assume that ||W1 ||Lq (Bd ) ≤
K for some q ∈ [2, ∞], ||W2 ||L∞ (Bd ) ≤ K, and ||V ||L∞ (Bd ) ≤ K 2 . Assume further that W1 is weakly
curl-free and that V −W1 ·W2 ≥ 0 a.e. Let u be a real-valued solution to (3) in Bd .
(a) If A = I, q = ∞ and u satisfies (6) with d replaced by 9/5 and (7) with b replaced by 1, then
for any r sufficiently small, (8) holds with ε = 0 and C depending on C0 .
(b) If q = 2, W2 ,V ≡ 0, and ||u||L∞ (Bd ) ≤ M, ||∇u||L2 (B ) ≥ 1, then for any r sufficiently small,
b̃
(12) holds with C depending on λ , Λ, and µ .
As usual, the order of vanishing estimates are used in combination with a scaling argument
to prove the following quantitative unique continuation at infinity estimates. Since the smallness
conditions required in Theorem 1 do not hold up under scaling, we do not have a corresponding
Landis theorem for that type of equation. However, the three other settings described by Theorems
2, 3, and 4 lead to Landis-type results.

(a) If q > 2 and (13) and (14) hold, then for any R sufficiently large, (15) holds with C depending on λ , Λ, µ , q, α , and C1 .

α1 for some q ∈ [2, ∞], ||W2 ||L∞ (R2 ) ≤ α2 , ||V ||L∞ (R2 ) ≤ α0 , where W1 is weakly curl-free and

V −W1 ·W2 ≥ 0 a.e. Let u be a real-valued solution to (3) in R2 .
(a) If A = I, q = ∞ and (13) and (14) hold, then for any R sufficiently large, (15) holds with C
depending on α1 , α2 , α0 , and C1 .
(b) If q = 2, W2 ,V ≡ 0, there exists m > 0 so that |u (z)| ≤ |z|m when |z| ≥ 1, and ||∇||L2 (B ) ≥
1/2
1, then for any R sufficiently large, (16) holds with C depending on λ , Λ, µ , α1 and m.

We point out now that the estimates in Theorems 5 – 7 are (almost) sharp in an exterior domain.

then − div (∇u +W1 u) +W2 · ∇u +Vu = 0, W1 ,W2 ,V ∈ L∞ and V −W1 · W2 ≥ 0. Moreover, W1 is
curl-free. Therefore, Theorem 7 is sharp in an exterior domain.
Since we are working with real-valued solutions and equations in the plane, the best approach
to proving these theorems is to the use the relationship between our solutions and the solutions to
first order equations in the complex plane, Beltrami systems. Therefore, we will closely follow
the proof ideas that were first developed in [13], with further generalizations in [5]. Since we are
no longer working with bounded lower order terms, but rather with singular potentials, we also
borrow some of the ideas that were presented in [14] where the authors considered drift equations
with singular potentials.
Our results generalize those previously established in [13], [14], and [5] in a few ways. First, in
a couple of the settings that we consider, the leading operator is no longer assumed to be Lipschitz
continuous and symmetric as in [5]. (In [13] and [14], the leading operator is the Laplacian.) In
those cases, we only assume that A is bounded and uniformly elliptic. Second, we consider when
all of the lower order terms are unbounded. In [13] and [5], the two lower order terms, V and W ,
are assumed to be bounded; whereas in [14], one lower order term, W , can be unbounded, but V
has to be zero. One of our settings deals with equations that have three singular lower order terms.
Third, we consider some very general elliptic equations that can have two non-trivial first order
terms. In [13], [14], and [5], it is always assumed that either W1 ≡ 0 or W2 ≡ 0.
When the lower order terms are not assumed to be bounded, our approach to the construction
of the positive multipliers is completely new in this article. We use the existence of solutions
to Dirichlet boundary value problems in combination with the maximum principle to argue that
positive multipliers with appropriate pointwise bounds exist.

We remark that our current methods do not apply to the scale-invariant case of V ∈ L1 R2 .
This is not surprising since the counterexample of Kenig and Nadirashvili in [15] implies that
weak unique continuation can fail for the operator ∆ +V with V ∈ L1 .
A similar problem was investigated by the first-named author and Zhu in [6] and [7]. In these
papers, the authors studied the quantitative unique continuation properties of solutions to equations
of the form (3) under the assumption that L = −∆, W1 ≡ 0, and the other lower order terms belong
to some admissible Lebesgue spaces. Since the proof techniques are based on certain L p − Lq
Carleman estimates, the results apply to complex-valued solutions and equations in any dimension
5

n ≥ 2. Consequently, the estimates derived in [6] and [7] are not as sharp as those that we prove
in the current paper. For a broader survey of related works, we refer the reader to [13] and the
references therein.
The organization of this article is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss quasi-balls. Quasi-balls are
a natural generalization of standard balls and they are associated to a uniformly elliptic divergenceform operator. Section 3 deals with the positive multipliers. In particular, we construct a positive
multiplier, prove that it has appropriate pointwise bounds, satisfies generalized Caccioppoli-type
inequalities, and then show that its logarithm also has good bounds in some Lt spaces. The Beltrami
operators are introduced in Section 4. Much of this section resembles work that was previously
done in [5], and we therefore omit some of the proofs. In Section 5, we use the tools that have
been developed to prove Theorem 1. Sections 6, 7, and 8 treat the proofs of Theorems 2, 3, and 4,
respectively. The proofs of Theorems 5 – 7 are presented in Section 9.
In addition to the main content of this paper, we rely on some theory regarding elliptic boundary
value problems, and this content has been relegated to the appendices. In Appendix A, we prove
a maximum principle. Appendix B presents a collection of results regarding the Green’s functions
for general elliptic operators in open, bounded, connected subsets of R2 . This work is based on
the constructions that appear in [10], [12], and [4]. We include this section for completeness since
the specific representation that we sought was not available in the literature. The results of the
appendices are used in Section 2 where we argue that the positive multipliers satisfy appropriate
pointwise bounds.

2. Q UASI - BALLS
Since we are working with variable-coefficient operators instead of the Laplacian, we will at
times need to work with sets that are not classical balls. Therefore, we introduce the notion of
quasi-balls.
Throughout this section, assume that L := − div (A∇) is a second-order divergence form operator
acting on R2 that satisfies the ellipticity and boundedness conditions described by (1) and (2). Let
L (λ , Λ) denote the set of all such operators. We start by discussing the fundamental solutions of
L. These results are based on the Appendix of [16].
Definition 1. A function G is called a fundamental solution for L with pole at the origin if

• |G (z)| ≤ C log |z|, for some C > 0, |z| ≥ C.
Lemma 1 (Theorem A-2, [16]). There exists a unique fundamental solution G for L, with pole
at the origin and with the property that lim G (z) − g (z) = 0, where g is a solution to Lg = 0 in
|z|→∞

|z| > 1 with g = 0 on |z| = 1. Moreover, there are constants C1 ,C2 ,C3 ,C4 , R1 < 1 < R2 , that depend
6

on λ and Λ, such that

for |z| < R1
|z|
|z|
C3 log |z| ≤ G (z) ≤ C4 log |z| for |z| > R2 .

The level sets of G will be important to us.
Definition 2. Define a function ℓ : R2 → (0, ∞) as follows: ℓ (z) = s iff G (z) = ln s. Then set

	 
	
Zs = z ∈ R2 : G (z) = ln s = z ∈ R2 : ℓ (z) = s .

We refer to these level sets of G as quasi-circles. That is, Zs is the quasi-circle of radius s. We also
define (closed) quasi-balls as

	
Qs = z ∈ R2 : ℓ (z) ≤ s .
Open quasi-balls are defined analogously. We may also use the notation QLs and ZsL to remind
ourselves of the underlying operator.

The following lemma follows from the bounds given in Lemma 1. The details of the proof may
be found in [5].
Lemma 2. There are constants c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 , c5 , c6 , S1 < 1 < S2 , that depend on λ and Λ, such that
if z ∈ Zs , then
sc1 ≤ |z| ≤ sc2 for s ≤ S1

c5 sc1 ≤ |z| ≤ c6 sc4 for S1 < s < S2

sc3 ≤ |z| ≤ sc4 for s ≥ S2 .

Thus, the quasi-circle Zs is contained in an annulus whose inner and outer radii depend on s, λ ,
and Λ. For future reference, it will be helpful to have a notation for the bounds on these inner and
outer radii.

Remark. These functions are defined so that for any operator L in L (λ , Λ), Bσ (s;λ ,Λ) ⊂ QLs ⊂
Bρ (s;λ ,Λ) .
The quasi-balls and quasi-circles just defined above are centered at the origin since G is a fundamental solution with a pole at the origin. As a reminder, we may sometimes use the notation Zs (0)
and Qs (0). If we follow the same process for any point z0 ∈ R2 , we may discuss the fundamental
solutions with pole at z0 , and we may similarly define the quasi-circles and quasi-balls associated
7

to these functions. We denote the quasi-circle and quasi-ball of radius s centred at z0 by Zs (z0 ) and
Qs (z0 ), respectively. Although Qs (z0 ) is not necessarily a translation of Qs (0) for z0 6= 0, both sets
are contained in annuli that are translations.
3. P OSITIVE

MULTIPLIERS

In [13] and [5], the first step in the proofs of the order of vanishing estimates is to establish
that a positive multiplier associated to the operator (or its adjoint) exists and has suitable bounds.
Unlike the settings in those papers, since our lower order terms are unbounded, we cannot simply construct positive super- and subsolutions in Bd , then argue that a positive solution exists.
Therefore, our approach here is more involved. Instead, we use solutions to the Dirichlet boundary
value problem for constant boundary data and rely on the maximum principle and Green’s function
representations to give us desirable bounds.
From now on, we set
d = ρ (7/5) + 2/5,
(17)
where ρ (s) = ρ (s; λ , Λ) is as defined in the previous section. Throughout this section, assume
that A satisfies (1) and (2), while W1 ∈ Lq1 (Bd ), W2 ∈ Lq2 (Bd ), and V ∈ L p (Bd ) for some q1 , q2 ∈
(2, ∞], p ∈ (1, ∞]. Note that AT also satisfies (1) and (2). Associated to an operator of the type
L := − div (A∇ +W1 ) +W2 · ∇ +V is the bilinear form B : W01,2 (Ω) ×W01,2 (Ω) → R given by
ˆ
B [u, v] =
A∇u · ∇v +W1 u · ∇v +W2 · ∇u v +V u v.
(18)
Ω

In every case, we take Ω = Bd .
Since we need the existence of solutions to various elliptic equations, the following lemma
serves as a useful tool.

Lemma 3. Let g ∈ C1 Bd . Assume that the bilinear form given by (18) is bounded and coercive
in W01,2 (Bd ). That is, there exist constants c and C so that for any u, v ∈ W01,2 (Bd )
|B [u, v] | ≤ C ||u||W 1,2 (Bd ) ||v||W 1,2 (Bd )
2
B [v, v] ≥ c ||v||W

Then there exists a weak solution φ ∈ W 1,2 (Bd ) to


on ∂ Bd

(19)

Proof. To establish that a solution to (19) exists, we prove that there exists a ψ ∈ W01,2 (Bd ) for
which
− div (A∇ψ +W1 ψ ) +W2 · ∇ψ +V ψ = − div G + f in Bd ,
(20)

where G ∈ L (Bd ) and f ∈ L (Bd ) for some q ∈ (2, ∞] and p ∈ (1, ∞]. With ψ = φ − g, wehave
G = −A∇g −W1 g and f = −W2 · ∇g −V g, and this gives the claimed result since g ∈ C1 Bd and
Bd is bounded.
To show that (20) is solvable, we need to show that for any v ∈ W01,2 (Bd ), there exists a ψ ∈
W01,2 (Bd ) for which

B [ψ , v] =

where the last line follows from an application of the Sobolev inequality with 2∗ = p′ ∈ (2, ∞).
Hereafter, we use the notation 2∗ to denote the Sobolev exponent of 2, and it will be chosen in
(2, ∞). In either case,
ˆ
G · ∇v + f v| ≤ C ||v||W 1,2 (Bd ) ,
|
Bd

so the functional defined by (22) is bounded on W01,2 (Bd ).
By assumption, B [·, ·] is a bounded, coercive form on W01,2 (Bd ). Therefore, we may apply
the Lax-Milgram theorem to conclude that there exists a unique ψ ∈ W01,2 (Bd ) that satisfies (21).
Consequently, (20) has a unique solution, and therefore, (19) is solvable.

Using the lemma above, we now prove that a general positive multiplier exists. With an appropriate choice of boundary data, we show that this positive multiplier has the required pointwise
bounds from above and below.

Let Γ (z, ζ ) denote the Green’s function for the operator − div(A∇ +W1 ) in Bd , and let Γ∗ (z, ζ ) denote the Green’s function for the adjoint operator − div AT ∇ +W1 · ∇ in Bd . Note that Γ∗ (ζ , z) =

In addition to the pointwise bounds for φ that were established in the previous lemmas, we also
prove gradient estimates for all solutions to (3). A similar argument shows that analogous bounds
hold for φ , and hence for all solutions to equations of the form (23). The following estimates
follow from a standard integration by parts argument (a Caccioppoli estimate) in combination with
Theorem 2 from [17].
Lemma 5. For any r > 0 and α > 1 for which α r < d, let v be a weak solution to (3) in Bα r .

For the positive function φ given in Lemma
 4, define Φ = log φ . From Lemma 4, it is clear that
|Φ (z)| ≤ c for a.e. z ∈ Bd . Since div AT ∇φ = W1 · ∇φ − div (W2 φ ) +V φ weakly in Bd , then

div AT ∇Φ + (W2 −W1 ) · ∇Φ + AT ∇Φ · ∇Φ = − divW2 +V weakly in Bd .

The following estimates for ∇Φ will be crucial to our proofs. We begin with an L2 -estimate for
∇Φ.

OPERATORS

We define a Beltrami operator that allows us to the reduce the second-order equation to a first
order system. For a complex-valued function f = u + iv, define
D f = ∂¯ f + η (z) ∂ f + ν (z) ∂ f ,
(39)
where

∂¯ = 21 (∂x + i∂y )
∂ = 21 (∂x − i∂y )

Lemma 9. For η , ν defined above, there exists K < 1 so that
|η (z)| + |ν (z)| ≤ K.
The following proof is purely computational and relies on the assumption (1).
Proof. We have
|η | =

Note that it follows from (1) that

This presentation will be useful in subsequent sections.
In addition to the operator D, we will also make use of an operator that is related to D through
some function w. For a given function w, set

ηw (z) = η (z) + ν (z) ∂ w for ∂ w 6= 0 ,

where η and ν are as defined in (40) and (41), respectively. By Lemma 9, it follows that |ηw | ≤ K.
Define
Dw f = ∂ f + ηw (z) ∂ f .

(42)

If ηw (z) = αw (z) + iβw (z), then

Therefore, Â satisfies the same ellipticity and boundedness given in (1) and (2) with possibly
different constants λ , Λ.
Remark. Note that if D is given as in (39) and D f = 0, then Dw f = 0 with w = f , where Dw is
defined in (42).
4.1. A Hadamard three-quasi-circle theorem. Within this subsection, we present the Hadamard
three-quasi-circle theorem. We originally proved this result in [5, Theorem 4.5], but include the
proof here for completeness. The related lemmas are all presented, but we refer the reader to [5]
for their computational proofs.
The following lemmas show that D̂ relates to L̂ in some of the same ways that ∂ relates to ∆.
These properties will allow us to prove the Hadamard three-quasi-circle theorem.
Lemma 10. [5, Lemma 4.2] If D̂ f = 0, where f (x, y) = u (x, y) + iv (x, y) for real-valued u and v,
then
L̂u = 0 = L̂v.
18

We find another parallel with the Laplace equation. As in the case of L̂ = ∆, the logarithm of the
norm of f is a subsolution to the second-order equation whenever D̂ f = 0. To see this, it suffices
to prove that
Lemma 11. [5, Lemma 4.3] If D̂ f = 0 and f 6= 0, then L̂ [log | f (z)|] = 0.
Using the fundamental solution Ĝ for the operator L̂, we can now prove the following Hadamard
three-quasi-ball inequality. We would like to mention that similar theorems were proved by
Alessandrini and Escauriaza in [1], see Propositions 1, 2, using quasi-regular mappings.
Theorem 8. Let f be a function for which D̂ f = 0 in Qs0 . Set
M (s) = max {| f (z)| : z ∈ Zs } .

Proof. Let As1 ,s3 = {z : s1 ≤ ℓ (z) ≤ s3 } = Qs3 \ Qs1 , where ℓ is associated to Ĝ, the fundamental solution of L̂. By Lemma 2, this set is contained in an annulus with inner and outer radius
depending on s1 , s3 , λ , and Λ. In particular, it is bounded and does not contain the origin.
Therefore, Ĝ (z) is bounded on As1 ,s3 . Let z0 be in the interior of As1 ,s3 . If f (z0 ) = 0, then
aĜ (z0) + log | f (z0 )| = −∞
 for any a ∈ R. On the other hand, if f (z0 ) 6= 0, then Lemma 11 implies
that L̂ aĜ (z) + log | f (z)| = 0 for z near z0 . By the maximum principle, z0 cannot be an extremal
point. Therefore, aĜ (z) + log | f (z)| takes it maximum value on the boundary of As1 ,s3 . We will
choose the constant a ∈ R so that
	
	


max aĜ (z) + log | f (z)| : z ∈ Zs1 = max aĜ (z) + log | f (z)| : z ∈ Zs3 ,
or rather

log (sa1 M (s1 )) = log (sa3 M (s3 )) .

It follows that for any z ∈ As1 ,s3 ,

aĜ (z) + log | f (z)| ≤ log (sai M (si ))

for i = 1, 3.

Furthermore, for any s2 ∈ (s1 , s3 ),
	

max aĜ (z) + log | f (z)| : z ∈ Zs2 ≤ log (sai M (si ))

for i = 1, 3,

or

log (sa2 M (s2 )) ≤ log (sai M (si ))

for i = 1, 3.

Consequently,
sa2 M (s2 ) ≤ sai M (si ) for i = 1, 3,
so that for any τ ∈ (0, 1), since sa1 M (s1 ) = sa3 M (s3 ), then

sa2 M (s2 ) ≤ [sa1 M (s1 )]τ [sa3 M (s3 )]1−τ

4.2. The similarity principle. This subsection is similar to Section 4.4 of [5]. As usual, we

Lemma 12. Suppose that g ∈ L p for some p ≥ 2. Then T g exists everywhere as an absolutely
convergent integral and Sg exists almost everywhere as a Cauchy principal limit. The following
relations hold:
∂¯ (T g) = g

Lemma 13 (see Theorems 4.1, 4.3 [2]). Let w be a generalized solution (possibly admitting isolated singularities) to

in a bounded domain Ω ⊂ R2 . Assume that |q1 (z)| + |q2 (z)| ≤ α0 < 1 in Ω, and A, B belong to
Lt (Ω) for some t ≥ 2. Then w (z) is given by
w (z) = f (z) eφ (z) ,

where f is a solution to

∂¯ f + q0 (z) ∂ f = 0
and

φ (z) = T ω (z) .
Here, q0 is defined by

The proof ideas are available in [2] and detailed arguments can be found in [5]. We repeat the

We have |q0 (z)| ≤ |q1 (z)| + |q2 (z)| ≤ α0 . Consider the integral equation
q0 (z) =

ω + q0 Sω = h.

Let p ∈ [2,t] be such that C p q0 < 1. That is, ||q0 S||L p (Ω)→L p (Ω) ≤ C p q0 . Since Ω is bounded,
then h ∈ L p (Ω) and using a Neumann series or fixed point argument, we see that this integral
equation has a unique solution ω (z) ∈ L p . Set φ (z) = T ω (z), then define f (z) = w (z) e−φ (z) . A

computation shows that ∂¯ f + q0 ∂ f = 0, as required.
Corollary 3. Let w be a generalized solution (possibly admitting isolated singularities) to
∂¯ w + q1 (z) ∂ w + q2 (z) ∂ w = A (z) w + B (z) w̄
in a bounded domain Ω ⊂ R2 . Assume that |q1 (z)| + |q2 (z)| ≤ α0 < 1 in Ω, and A, B belong to
Lt (Ω) for some t > 2. Then w (z) is given by

Proof. From the previous lemma, we have that g (z) = exp (T ω (z)), where ω is the unique solution
to (48). As above, ||ω ||L p ≤ C ||h||L p ≤ C ||h||Lt . It follows from the third fact in Lemma 12 that

T HEOREM 1

Here we present the proof of the first order of vanishing estimate, that of Theorem 1. We
follow the approach used previously in [13] and [5] and use the positive multiplier to transform the
equation for u into a divergence-free equation.
Let u be a solution to (3) in Bd ⊂ R2 . That is,
− div (A∇u +W1 u) +W2 · ∇u +Vu = 0

in Bd .

Conditions (4) and (5) in combination with the bounds on W1 , W2 , V imply that Lemma 4 is
applicable, and therefore there exists a positive function φ satisfying (24) that weakly solves

− div AT ∇φ +W2 φ +W1 · ∇φ +V φ = 0 in Bd .
Set b = −AT ∇Φ +W1 −W2 and observe that

div [φ (A∇u + bu)]


= div φ A∇u − uAT ∇Φ + uW1 − uW2

= div φ A∇u − uAT ∇φ + uφ W1 − uφ W2


= ∇φ · A∇u + φ div (A∇u) − ∇u · AT ∇φ − u div AT ∇φ + div (uφ W1 − uφ W2 )

= φ [Vu +W2 · ∇u − div(W1 u)] − u [V φ +W1 · ∇φ − div (W2 φ )] + div (uφ W1 − uφ W2 )
= 0.
Therefore, the PDE for u can be transformed into a divergence-free equation. Let v be the stream
function associated to the vector φ (A∇u + bu) with v (0, 0) = 0. That is, for every (x, y) ∈ Bd ,
ˆ 1
[−φ (a21 ux + a22 uy + b2 u) (tx,ty)x + φ (a11 ux + a12 uy + b1 u) (tx,ty)y] dt. (49)
v (x, y) =

To verify the validity of (49), we let P = (P1 , P2) = φ (A∇u + bu), then

where we use the notation Wi = (Wi,1 ,Wi,2) for i = 1, 2. By Lemma 5 applied to u and φ , along

PROOF OF

T HEOREM 2

6.1. The case of q > 2. When W2 ,V ≡ 0, the proof above carries through with φ = 1. Since
there is no need to construct a positive multiplier using Lemma 4, the positivity condition on W1
described by (4) is unnecessary. In this simplified setting, we see that α given in (52) is equal to
zero and then (54) holds with ε = 0. The remainder of the proof is unchanged and the estimate (8)
therefore holds with ε = 0.
6.2. The case of q = 2. Here we need to prove that the strong unique continuation property
(SUCP) holds for solutions to − div (A∇ +Wu) = 0 when W ∈ L2 (Bd ). Recall the following definition of SUCP:
1,2
Definition 4. Suppose u ∈ Wloc
(Bd ) is a solution to − div (A∇u +Wu) = 0. We say that the strong
unique continuation property holds if whenever u vanishes to infinite order at some point z0 ∈ Bd ,
i.e. for every N ∈ N,



|u (z)| ≤ O |z − z0 |N

this implies that u ≡ 0.

26

as z → z0 ,

Assume that z0 = 0. That is, we assume that u vanishes to infinite order at 0 and we will prove
that u ≡ 0 in Bd . Let v be the stream function associated to − div (A∇u +Wu) = 0 defined by
ˆ 1
[− (a21 ux + a22 uy +W2 u) (tx,ty)x + (a11 ux + a12 uy +W1 u) (tx,ty) y] dt.
v (x, y) =
0

Here we write W = (W1 ,W2 ). With w = u + iv and D as defined in (39), we see that in Bd ,
Dw = β w,
where

otherwise

It follows from (1), (2), and the bound on W that ||β ||L2 (Bd ) ≤ CK. The similarity principle given
in Lemma 13 implies that
w = f (z) g (z) ,
with
Dw f = 0 in Bd ,
and
g (z) = exp (T ω (z)) ,
where ω ∈ L2 with ||ω ||L2 (Bd ) ≤ C ||β ||L2 (Bd ) ≤ CK. As
ˆ

h (z) := T ω (z) =
dξ ,
π Bd ξ − z
we have that
||h||W 1,2 (Bd ) = ||h||L2 (Bd ) + ||∇h||L2 (Bd ) ≤ CK.

Since we do not have T ω ∈ L∞ for ω ∈ L2 , we rely on the following result from [14].
Lemma 15 (cf. Lemma 3.3 in [14]). Let h be as defined above. For s > 0 and 0 < r ≤ ρ (7/5), we
have that
Br

exp(s|h|) ≤ Cr−sCK exp(sCK + s2CK 2 ).

(58)

Now we demonstrate how a modification of the ideas in [14] leads to the proof of our theorem.
Following the arguments in the proof of Theorem 1, we see that (55) holds with f = w exp (−h).

As this leads to a contradiction, we must have ||u||L2(Bb ) < exp (−k) for every k > 0. This means
that u ≡ 0 in Bb .
In the case where z0 6= 0, a translation and scaling allows us to reduce to the case of z0 = 0.

PROOF OF

T HEOREM 3

For the proof of Theorem 3, we follow the ideas used previously in [5] to rewrite the equation
as a product of Beltrami operators, then we invoke a number of the ideas that were used above in
the proof of Theorem 1.
Let u be a solution to (11) in Bd ⊂ R2 . That is,

− div (A∇u) +W · ∇u = 0 in Bd .

depends on λ , Λ, and µ . Moreover, the ellipticity constant of A/ detA is λ . Thus, there is no
loss of generality in assuming that u is a solution to (11) where A is symmetric with determinant
equal to 1.
When A is symmetric and has determinant equal to 1, the term ν defined in (41) is equal to zero
and the definition of D is greatly simplified. Further, we have the following decomposition result
from [5].

Lemma 16 (Lemma 4.4 in [5]). Assume that A is uniformly elliptic, bounded, symmetric, Lipschitz
continuous and has determinant equal to 1. Then the operator div (A∇) may be decomposed as

div (A∇) = (D + Γ) D,

To complete the proof, we need to bound the left-hand side from below using the assumption that
||u||L∞ (Bb) ≥ 1. We repeat the argument from [13] here. Since Bb ⊂ Q1 , this assumption implies
that there exists z0 ∈ Q1 such that |u (z0 )| ≥ 1. Without loss of generality, we assume that u (z0 ) ≥ 1.
Since u is real-valued, then for any a > 0, we have that either u (z) ≥ a for all z ∈ Q6/5 , or there
exists z1 ∈ Q6/5 such that u (z1 ) < a. If the second case holds, then we see that u (z1 ) ≤ a, while
u (z0 ) ≥ 1. If we set a = exp (−K) then it follows that
1
C ||∇u||L∞ (Q ) ≥ |u (z0 ) − u (z1 )| ≥ 1 − exp (−K) ≥ .

Combining this bound with (71) and rearranging leads to the proof of the theorem. If we are in the
former case, then u (z) ≥ a for all z ∈ Q6/5 and the conclusion of the theorem is obviously satisfied.
The proof of the Theorem 3(a) is now complete.

Since we do not have T ω ∈ L∞ for ω ∈ L2 , we again use the result from [14] described in

PROOF OF

T HEOREM 4

8.1. The case of A = I, q = ∞. We first consider case (a) of Theorem 4. Let u be a solution to (3)
with A = I. The first step is to prove that there exists a positive solution to the equation
− ∆φ + (W1 +W2 ) · ∇φ + (V −W1 ·W2 ) φ = 0

(73)

in B9/5 . Let η be some constant to be determined and set

φ1 (x, y) = exp (η x) .
Then by the bounds on W1 , W2 and V , we see that


−∆φ1 + (W1 +W2 ) · ∇φ1 + (V −W1 ·W2 ) φ1 ≤ −η 2 + 2K η + 2K 2 φ1 .

If η = 3K, then φ1 is a subsolution. Now define φ2 = exp (6K) so that φ2 ≥ φ1 on B9/5 . Since
V −W1 · W2 ≥ 0, then −∆φ2 + (W1 +W2 ) · ∇φ2 + (V −W1 ·W2 ) φ2 ≥ 0, so φ2 is a supersolution. It
follows that there exists a positive solution φ to (73) such that
exp (−C1 K) ≤ φ (z) ≤ exp (C1 K)

for all z ∈ B9/5 .

D = ∂x − i∂y +W11 − iW12 ,
where W1 = (W11 ,W12 ). Then
Dv = ∂x v − i∂y v +W11 v − iW12 v

D̄Dv = (∂x + i∂y +W11 + iW12 ) (∂x v − i∂y v +W11 v − iW12 v)

= div (∇v +W1 v) +W1 · ∇v + |W1 |2 v + i (∂yW11 − ∂xW12 ) v.

Since we have assumed that the scalar curl of W1 vanishes weakly, then
D̄Dv = div (∇v +W1 v) +W1 · ∇v + |W1 |2 v.

Now we need to use (7) to bound the left-hand side. Recall that w = (∂x v +W11 v) − i (∂y v +W12 v).
Since W1 is assumed to be weakly curl-free, the function Φ given by

satisfies ∇Φ = W1 . Moreover, for any Ω ⊂ B9/5 , ||Φ||L∞ (Ω) ≤ C ||W1 ||L∞ (B ) ≤ CK. Using this

To bound ∇ e v L∞ (B ) from below, we again repeat the argument from [13]. The lower

bound on u given in (7) implies that there exists z0 ∈ B1 such that |u (z0 )| ≥ 1. Without loss of
generality, we assume that u (z0 ) ≥ 1. Since u is real-valued, then for any a > 0, we have that
either u (z) ≥ a for all z ∈ B6/5 , or there exists z1 ∈ B6/5 such that u (z1 ) < a. If the second case
holds, then we see that u (z1 ) ≤ a so that by (74) and the bound on Φ, eΦ v (z1 ) ≤ a exp (CK), while
u (z0 ) ≥ 1 so that eΦ v (z0 ) ≥ exp (−CK). If we set a = 21 exp (−2CK), then

It follows that ||w||L∞ (B ) ≥ e−CK . Substituting this bound into (75) and rearranging leads to the

of the theorem is obviously satisfied.

9.1. The proof of Theorem 5. Let u be a solution to (9) in R2 . Choose z0 ∈ R2 so that |z0 | = bR.
Define uR (z) = u(z0 + Rz), AR (z) = A (z0 + Rz), WR (z) = RW (z0 + Rz). Notice that for any r > 0,

and define uR , AR and WR as above. As before, ||WR ||Lq (Bd (0)) ≤ α R1− q . Since
− div [AR (z) ∇uR (z)] +WR (z) · ∇uR (z)

= R2 {− div [A (z0 + Rz) ∇u (z0 + Rz)] +W (z0 + Rz) · ∇u (z0 + Rz)} = 0,

then uR satisfies a scaled version of (11) in Bd .
2
If q > 2, then as above, (13) implies that (76) holds with Ĉ ≥ C1 (b + d)1− q /α and (14) implies
that (77) also holds. Assuming that R is sufficiently large, Theorem 3(a) applied to uR with K =

uR as above, and set Wi,R (z) = RWi (z0 + Rz) for i = 1, 2 and VR (z) = R2V (z0 + Rz). We have
||Wi,R ||L∞ (B (0)) ≤ αi R for i = 1, 2 and ||VR ||L∞ (B (0)) ≤ α0 R2 . Since

then uR satisfies a scaled version of the equation in B9/5 . Let α = max {α1 , α2 , α0 }. As above,
(13) implies that (76) holds with Ĉ ≥ 3C1 /α , d = 59 and q = ∞, while (14) implies that (77) also
holds with b = 1. Assuming that R is sufficiently large, Theorem 4(a) applied to uR with K = α R
and C0 = Ĉ shows that
||u||L∞ (B1 (z0 )) ≥ exp (−Cα R log R) ,
where C depends on Ĉ.
For the cases where q < ∞ and W2 ,V ≡ 0, the reduction described in Section 8.2 allows us to
reduce to the setting described by Theorem 6 and the result is immediate.

Here we prove the maximum principle that is used in the proof of Lemma 4. In particular, we
generalize some of the standard theorems from Chapter 8 of [9] to extend to elliptic operators with
singular lower order terms. To this end, we employ roughly the same techniques, but with applications of Hölder and Sobolev inequalities to accommodate for the unbounded potential functions.

FUNCTIONS

The purpose of this appendix is to establish a representation formula for solutions to nonhomogeneous uniformly elliptic equations with vanishing Dirichlet boundary data. To this end,
we mimic the main technique presented in [4], which is based on the ideas in [12] and [10]. Since
we only require such results for reasonably nice, bounded domains (balls), we assume throughout
that Ω ⊂ R2 is open, bounded, and connected. Finally, we point out that the bounds given for
the Green’s functions are not sharp. As is well known, pointwise logarithmic bounds for Green’s
functions in the plane are the best possible. However, since we work using the methods of [10],
[12], and [4], and seek integrability properties for the Green’s function instead of sharp pointwise
bounds, our estimates will have power bounds.
We consider second-order, uniformly elliptic, bounded operators of divergence form with one
first order term. We use coercivity, the Caccioppoli inequality, and De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory
to establish existence, uniqueness, and a priori estimates for the Dirichlet Green’s functions.
Notation and properties of solutions. Let Ω ⊂ R2 be open, bounded, and connected. In contrast
to the main body of the article where we use the notation z = (x, y) to denote a point in R2 , here
we let x, y, etc. denote points in R2 .
For any x ∈ Ω, r > 0, we define Ωr (x) := Ω ∩ Br (x) and Σr (x) := ∂ Ω ∩ Br (x). Let Cc∞ (Ω) denote
the set of all infinitely differentiable functions with compact support in Ω.
For future reference, we mention that for Ω,U ⊂ R2 open and connected, the assumption
u ∈ W 1,2 (Ω),

u = 0 on U ∩ ∂ Ω,

is always meant in the weak sense of
u ∈ W 1,2 (Ω) and uξ ∈ W01,2 (Ω) for any ξ ∈ Cc∞ (U ).
38

(B.1)

This definition of (weakly) vanishing on the boundary is independent of the choice of U . Indeed,
suppose V is another open and connected subset of R2 such that V ∩ ∂ Ω = U ∩ ∂ Ω and let ξ ∈
Cc∞ (V ). Choose ψ ∈ Cc∞ (U ∩V ) such that 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 1 and ψ ≡ 1 on the support of ξ in some neighborhood of the boundary. Then ξ (1 − ψ ) |Ω ∈ Cc∞ (Ω), so that uξ (1 − ψ ) ∈ W01,2 (Ω). Additionally,
ξ ψ ∈ Cc∞ (U ), so by (B.1), uξ ψ ∈ W01,2 (Ω). Therefore, uξ = uξ ψ + uξ (1 − ψ ) ∈ W01,2 (Ω), as
desired.
2
Let A = ai j i, j=1 be bounded, measurable coefficients defined on Ω. We assume that A satisfies
an ellipticity condition described by (1) and the boundedness assumption given in (2). Choose
W ∈ Lq (Ω) for some q ∈ (2, ∞] so that (5) holds with qi = q. The non-homogeneous second-order
operator is

All operators are understood in the sense of distributions on Ω. Specifically, for every u ∈ W 1,2 (Ω)
and v ∈ Cc∞ (Ω), we use the naturally associated bilinear form and write the action of the functional
e
Lu on v as
ˆ
(e
Lu, v) = B [u, v] =
A∇u · ∇v +W · ∇u v.
(B.4)
Ω

It is not hard to check that for such u, v and for the coefficients as described above, the bilinear
form above is well-defined and finite. Similarly, B∗ [·, ·] denotes the bilinear operator associated to
e
L∗ , given by
ˆ
∗
∗
(e
L u, v) = B [u, v] = AT ∇u · ∇v +W u · ∇v.
(B.5)
Clearly,

B [v, u] = B∗ [u, v] .

(B.6)

For any distribution F = ( f , G) on Ω and u as above, we always understand e
Lu = F on Ω in the
∞
weak sense, that is, as B [u, v] = F(v) for all v ∈ Cc (Ω). Typically
f and G will be elements of
ˆ
some L p (Ω) spaces, so the action of F on v is then simply
f v + G · Dv. The identity e
L∗ u = F is
interpreted similarly.

Remark. Assumption (2) and that W ∈ Lq (Ω), q > 2, in combination with Hölder and Sobolev
inequalities imply that there exists Λ > 0 so that for every u, v ∈ W01,2 (Ω),
|B [u, v] | ≤ Λ ||u||W 1,2 (Ω) ||v||W 1,2 (Ω) .

(B.7)

Since (5) holds, then (1) and the Poincaré inequality implies that there exists γ > 0 so that for every

Green’s functions. This subsection resembles the work done in [12] and [4]. We use the properties of our operator as well as the properties of solutions to e
Lu = F or e
L∗ u = F described above
to establish existence, uniqueness, and a collection of a priori estimates for the Dirichlet Green’s
function associated to Ω ⊂ R2 . We follow closely the arguments in [12] and [4], adapting to n = 2.
As previously mentioned, our estimates are not sharp since we do not obtain logarithmic bounds
for the Green’s functions.
First, we clarify the meaning of the Green’s function.
Definition 5. Let Ω be an open, connected, bounded subset of R2 . We say that the function Γ (x, y)
L if it satisfies the following
defined on the set {(x, y) ∈ Ω × Ω : x 6= y} is the Green’s function of e
properties:
1) Γ (·, y) is locally integrable and e
LΓ (·, y) = δy I for all y ∈ Ω in the sense that for every
∞
φ ∈ Cc (Ω),
B [Γ (·, y) , φ ] = φ (y) .
(B.12)
40

2) For all y ∈ Ω and r > 0, Γ (·, y) ∈ W 1,2 (Ω \ Ωr (y)). In addition, Γ(·, y) vanishes on ∂ Ω in
the sense that for every ζ ∈ Cc∞ (Ω) satisfying ζ ≡ 1 on Br (y) for some r > 0, we have

Moreover, since Γρ ∈ W01,2 (Ω), then Γρ ∈ W 1,2 Ωr/2 (x) and Γρ = 0 on Σr/2 (x), so we may use

Let φ ∈ Cc∞ (Ω) and r > 0. Choose η ∈ Cc∞ (Br (y)) to be a cutoff function so that η ≡ 1 in

Note that ηφ and D (ηφ ) belong to Cc∞ (Ωr (y)). From this and the boundedness of A given by

Therefore, it follows from (B.53) that

where we have used (B.33) - (B.35).
Let η ∈ Cc∞ (Br (y)) be as defined in the previous paragraph. Then η f ∈ Lℓ0 (Br (y)). Since Ω

is bounded, then f ∈ Lℓ (Ω) for some ℓ ∈ (1, 2) and it follows that (1 − η ) f ∈ Lℓ Ω \ Br/2 (y) .
Equation (B.53) in combination with a Sobolev inequality implies that for all 0 < r0 < r,
′

Γρµ ⇀ Γ in Lℓ (Ω \ Ωr0 (y)) ,

where ℓ′ ∈ (2, ∞) denotes the Hölder conjugate to ℓ. Consequently, using the property above and

Since m0 > 2, then m′0 ∈ (1, 2) and then according to (B.52) we can pair η G with DΓρµ in
 Br (y)
and take the limit. As Ω is bounded, then G ∈ L2 (Ω) so that (1 − η ) G ∈ L2 Ω \ Br/2 (y) . With
the aid of (B.52) with s = m′0 and (B.53), we see that

Combining the last two equations with (B.56) gives (B.14). Property (B.15) follows as well.
The first part of each of the estimates (B.12)–(B.16) follow almost directly by passage to the
limit and recalling that we use the notation Γ = Γy = Γ (·, y). Indeed, for any r > 0 and any
g ∈ L∞ (Ωr (y)), (B.49) implies that for any s ∈ [1, ∞)

where ε > 0 is arbitrarily small and
that for every s ∈ [1, ∞) and r > 0,

s′

is the Hölder conjugate exponent of s. By duality, we obtain
2

||Γ (·, y)||Ls (Ωr (y)) ≤ Cs r−ε + s ,
that is, the first part of (B.17) holds. A similar argument using (B.48), (B.44) and (B.46) yields the
first parts of (B.18) and (B.16), respectively. Now, as in the proofs of (B.45) and (B.47), the first
part of (B.16) gives the first parts of (B.19) and (B.20).
Passing to the proof of (B.21), fix x 6= y. For a.e. x ∈ Ω, the Lebesgue differentiation theorem
implies that
ˆ

Γ = lim

Γ (x) = lim

where χ denotes an indicator function. Assuming as we may that 2δ ≤ min {dx , |x − y|}, it follows
∗
that χΩδ (x) = χBδ (x) ∈ L2 (Ω \ Ωδ (y)) for any 2∗ ∈ (2, ∞), where dx = dist(x, ∂ Ω). Therefore,
(B.52) implies that

If ρµ ≤ 31 |x − y|, ρµ < dy , then (B.40) implies that for a.e. z ∈ Bδ (x)
|Γρµ (z)| ≤ C |z − y|−ε ,

where C is independent of ρµ . Since |z − y| > 12 |x − y| for every z ∈ Bδ (x) ⊂ B|x−y|/2 (x), then
||Γρµ ||L∞ (Bδ (x)) ≤ C |x − y|−ε .

By combining with the observations above, we see that for a.e. x ∈ Ω,
ˆ
1
Γ χΩδ (x) = lim lim
Γ (x, y) = lim
Γρµ ≤ lim lim C |x − y|−ε = C |x − y|−ε ,
δ →0+ |Ωδ |
δ →0+ µ →∞ Bδ (x)
δ →0+ µ →∞

which is (B.21).
Now we have to prove that Γ(·, y) = 0 on ∂ Ω in the sense that for all ζ ∈ Cc∞ (Ω) satisfying ζ ≡ 1
on Br (y) for some r > 0, equation (B.13) holds. By Mazur’s lemma, W01,2 (Ω) is weakly closed
in W 1,2 (Ω). Therefore, since (1 − ζ )Γρµ = Γρµ − ζ Γρµ ∈ W01,2 (Ω) for all ρµ > 0, it suffices for
(B.13) to show that
(B.57)
(1 − ζ )Γρµ ⇀ (1 − ζ )Γ in W 1,2 (Ω) .
Since (1 − ζ ) ≡ 0 on Br (y), the result (B.57) follows from (B.53). Indeed,

so that (B.13) holds. Since Γ(x, y) satisfies (B.12) – (B.15), it is the unique Green’s function
associated to e
L.
Fix x, y ∈ Ω and 0 < R ≤ R0 < |x − y|. Then e
LΓ (·, y) = 0 on BR0 (x). Therefore, by Hölder
continuity of solutions described by (B.11) and the pointwise bound (B.21), whenever |x − z| < R2
we have

This is the Hölder continuity of Γ(·, y) described by (B.22).
Using the pointwise bound on Γρ in place of those for Γ, a similar statement holds for Γρ with
ρ ≤ 38 |x − y|, and it follows that for any compact set K ⋐ Ω \ {y}, the sequence {Γρµ (·, y)}∞
µ =1

is equicontinuous on K. Furthermore, for any such K ⋐ Ω \ {y}, there are constants CK < ∞ and
ρK > 0 such that for all ρ < ρK ,
||Γρ (·, y)||L∞ (K) ≤ CK .
Passing to a subsequence if necessary, we have that for any such compact K ⋐ Ω \ {y},
Γρµ (·, y) → Γ (·, y)

(B.58)

uniformly on K.
We now aim to show

bσ = Γ
bσx = Γ
bσ (x, ·) denote the averaged

bσν
By the same arguments used for Γρ , we obtain a sequence {σν }∞
ν =1 , σν → 0, such that Γ (·, x) =
bσx ν converges to Γ∗ (·, x) uniformly on compact subsets of Ω \ {x}, where Γ∗ (·, x) is a Green’s

L∗ that satisfies the properties analogous to those for Γ (·, y). In particular, Γ∗ (·, x) is
Hölder continuous.

Therefore, for all x 6= y,

Γ∗ (·, x) = Γ∗ (y, x) .

Γ (x, y) = Γ∗ (y, x) .
(B.60)
Consequently, all the estimates which hold for Γ (·, y) hold analogously for Γ (x, ·) and the proof is
complete.

Remark. We have seen that there is a subsequence ρµ µ =1 , ρµ → 0, such that Γρµ (x, y) →
