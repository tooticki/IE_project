BÁLINT FARKAS 1, a AND SVEN-AKE WEGNER 2
Abstract. It is not hard to prove that a uniformly continuous real function, whose integral up to
infinity exists, vanishes at infinity, and it is probably little known that this statement runs under
the name “Barbălat’s Lemma.” In fact, the latter name is frequently used in control theory, where
the lemma is used to obtain Lyapunov-like stability theorems for non-linear and non-autonomous
systems. Barbălat’s Lemma is qualitative in the sense that it asserts that a function has certain
properties, here convergence to zero. Such qualitative statements can typically be proved by “soft
analysis”, such as indirect proofs. Indeed, in the original 1959 paper by Barbălat, the lemma was
proved by contradiction and this proof prevails in the control theory textbooks. In this short note
we first give a direct, “hard analyis” proof of the lemma, yielding quantitative results, i.e. rates of
convergence to zero. This proof allows also for immediate generalizations. Finally, we unify three
different versions which recently appeared and discuss their relation to the original lemma.

1. Direct proof of Barbălat’s Lemma
In 1959, Barbălat formalized the intuitive principle that a function whose integral up to infinity exists,
and whose oscillation is bounded, needs to be small at infinity.
Theorem 1. (Barbălat’s Lemma [1, p. 269]) Suppose that f : [0, ∞) → R is uniformly continuous
Rt
and that limt→∞ 0 f (τ )dτ exists. Then limt→∞ f (t) = 0 holds.

Barbălat’s original proof, as well as its reproductions in textbooks, e.g., Khalil [5, p. 192], Popov
[6, p. 211] and Slotine, Li [9, p. 124], are by contradiction. Our first aim in this note is to give a
direct proof of Theorem 1 which also reveals the essence of the statement and enables us to generalize
Barbălat’s Lemma to vector valued functions without difficulty. This is based on the following two
lemmas.

Lemma
R s2. Let f : [0, ∞) → R be a continuous function. We define S : [0, ∞) → R via S(t) :=
sups>t  t f (τ )dτ  and put ω(a, b, δ) := sup{|f (x)−f (y)| | x, y ∈ (a, b) with |x−y| 6 δ} for a < b 6 ∞
and δ > 0. Then |f (t)| 6 S(t)1/2 + ω(t, t + S(t)1/2 , S(t)1/2 ) holds for t > 0.
Proof. Fix t > 0. If S(t) = 0, then f (t) = 0 and the assertion follows immediately. Also, if S(t) = ∞,
then there is nothing to prove. Suppose therefore 0 < S(t) < ∞, put s = S(t)1/2 > 0, and compute
|f (t)| =

We recall that given a uniformly continuous function f : [0, ∞) → R, a function ω : [0, ∞) → R is said
to be a modulus of continuity for f if limt→0 ω(t) = ω(0) = 0 and |f (t) − f (τ )| 6 ω(|t − τ |) for all t,
τ ∈ [0, ∞).
Lemma 3. Let f : [0, ∞)
R s→ R be uniformly continuous and let ω be a modulus of continuity for f .
Consider S(t) = sups>t | t f (τ )dτ |. Then we have |f (t)| 6 S(t)1/2 + ω(S(t)1/2 ) for all t > 0.

Proof. Let f and ω be given. We define ω(t) := ω(0, ∞, t), where ω(0, ∞, ·) is the function defined in
Lemma 2. Then, ω(t) 6 ω(t) holds for all t > 0. Since ω(a, b, t) 6 ω(0, ∞, t) holds for all a < b 6 ∞,
we can use Lemma 2 to obtain
|f (t)| 6 S(t)1/2 + ω(t, t + S(t)1/2 , S(t)1/2 ) 6 S(t)1/2 + ω(S(t)1/2 ) 6 S(t)1/2 + ω(S(t)1/2 )
as desired.



We now give the direct proof of Barbălat’s Lemma.
Proof of Theorem 1. Let f be uniformly continuous and ω be a modulus of continuity for f . By the
Cauchy criterion for indefinite integrals, we obtain (with a direct proof!) that S(t) → 0 for t → ∞.
Therefore, Lemma 3 yields |f (t)| 6 S(t)1/2 + ω(S(t)1/2 ) → 0 for t → ∞.

Since Lemmas 2 and 3 remain true for functions with values in a Banach space E (the proofs are
verbatim the same), we immediately obtain the next generalization.
Theorem 4. Let E be a Banach space and suppose that f : [0, ∞) → E is uniformly continuous such
Rt

that limt→∞ 0 f (τ )dτ exists. Then limt→∞ f (t) = 0 holds.
2. Barbălat’s Lemma in a different context

We pointed out that all proofs of Barbălat’s Lemma given in the relevant textbooks are indirect. On
the other hand, there appeared recently several “alternative versions” in the literature whose proofs,
or hints for a proof, are based on direct estimates. Tao [7, Lemma 1] states that limt→∞ f (t) = 0
holds, whenever f ∈ L2 (0, ∞) and f ′ ∈ L∞ (0, ∞). Desoer and Vidyasagar [3, Ex. 1 on p. 237] indicate
that it is enough to require that f and f ′ are in L2 (0, ∞) and Teel [8, Fact 4] notes that in the latter
the Lebesgue exponent 2 can be replaced by p ∈ [1, ∞). Here, f ′ can be interpreted in the sense of
distributions or, equivalently, in the sense that f is absolutely continuous with the almost everywhere
existing derivative being essentially bounded.
Indeed, the three results extend the classical statement, that for 1 6 p < ∞ all functions in the
Sobolev space W 1,p (0, ∞) tend to zero for t → ∞ (see, e.g., Brezis [2, Corollary 8.9]) to the “mixed
Sobolev space”

	
W 1,p,q (0, ∞) = f | f ∈ Lp (0, ∞) and f ′ ∈ Lq (0, ∞)
for p = 2, q = ∞, and p = q ∈ [1, ∞), respectively. Our first aim in this section is to prove the
following common generalization of the results of Tao [7], Desoer and Vidyasagar [3], and Teel [8].

Theorem 5. Let p ∈ [1, ∞) and q ∈ (1, ∞]. Every function f ∈ W 1,p,q (0, ∞) tends to zero at infinity.
Notice, that our proof below shows that all three alternatives are immediate consequences of the
original Barbălat Lemma. The latter cannot be applied a priori, but in view of the following lemma.
Lemma 6. Let p ∈ [1, ∞) and q ∈ (1, ∞] be arbitrary. A function f ∈ W 1,p,q (0, ∞) is bounded and
uniformly continuous. More precisely, f is q−1
q -Hölder continuous if q < ∞ and Lipschitz-continuous
if q = ∞.
2

Proof. For the proof let q ′ ∈ [1, ∞) be such that 1/q ′ + 1/q = 1 holds, where we use the convention
1/∞ = 0. In particular, we read (q − 1)/q = 1/q ′ = 1 if q = ∞. By our assumptions we have
Z y
f ′ (s)ds
f (y) − f (x) =
x

for almost every x, y ∈ [0, ∞). Thus, f can be identified with a continuous function satisfying
Z y

|f (x) − f (y)| 6 
f ′ (s)ds 6 |x − y|1/q kf ′ kq .
x

Here we used Hölder’s inequality for q, q ′ with 1/q + 1/q ′ = 1, so that f is indeed Hölder continuous
with exponent 1/q ′ = (q − 1)/q. Let r := p(q − 1)/q. Then we have r > 0 and

where the last step is again an application of Hölder’s inequality for q, q ′ with 1/q + 1/q ′ = 1.



Lemma 6 enables us to employ the original Barbălat Lemma to prove Theorem 5.
Proof of Theorem 5. By Lemma 6 the function f is bounded and uniformly continuous, hence so is
|f |p . Indeed, we have by the mean-value theorem


|f (x)|p − |f (y)|p  ≤ sup p|t|p−1 · |f (x) − f (y)| = pkf kp−1 |f (x) − f (y)|.

This inequality implies the asserted uniform continuity of |f |p . By assumption, we can apply Barbălat’s
Lemma and obtain the statement.


Tao’s formulation [7, 3rd paragraph on p. 698] might erroneously establish the impression that his
alternative [7, Lemma 1] uses a weaker assumption than Barbălat’s Lemma, but has the same conclusion. Our second aim in this section is to illustrate that this is not the case. The following example
of a function which satisfies the assumptions of Barbălat’s Lemma, but not those of [7, Lemma 1]
combines two effects. The difference between Lebesgue and improper Riemann integral on the one
hand, and that between uniform continuity and having a bounded derivative on the other.
Example 7. Let f (x) = 0 for x ∈ [0, 2) and f (x) = (−1)n fn (x) for x ∈ [n, n + 1) with n > 2 and

i.e., f looks as follows.

uniformly continuous. On the other hand f 6∈ L (0, ∞) and f 6∈ L (a, ∞) for any a > 0.

For given 1 6 p < ∞, the function f in Example 7 can easily be modified such that f 6∈ Lp (a, ∞)
holds. With some additional work, it is also possible to construct a single f such that f 6∈ Lp (a, ∞)
is true for all 1 6 p < ∞. Finally, in all these cases f can also be changed into a C ∞ –function;
3

|f ′ | is then bounded on any finite interval, but unbounded at infinity. Thus, for every p ∈ [1, ∞)
and q ∈ (1, ∞] there is a function f to which Barbălat’s Lemma can be applied, but which fails the
assumptions of Theorem 5.
Concerning the other direction, it is easy to construct a function f that satisfies the condition
R ∞ of [7,
Lemma 1], i.e., f ∈ L2 (0, ∞) and f ′ ∈ L∞ (0, ∞), but whose improper Riemann integral 0 f (t)dt
does not exist. Thus, Tao’s alternative is incomparable with the original Barbălat Lemma. The same
is true for the statement of Theorem 5 whenever p 6= 1. Only in the case p = 1, Theorem 5 is a
special case of Barbălat. Let f ∈ W 1,1,q with q ∈ (1, ∞]. By Lemma 3, f is uniformly
R ∞ continuous and
bounded. Therefore, f ∈ L1 (0, ∞) implies that the improper Riemann integral 0 f (t)dt exists.
3. Rates of convergence
In this section we use the methods of Section 1 to derive estimates for the speed of decay in the
previous versions of Barbălat’s Lemma so as to make the statement quantitative. We start with a
modification of Theorem 1.
Rt
Theorem 8. Suppose that for f : [0, ∞) → R the limit limt→∞ 0 f (τ )dτ exists, and that f is Hölder
continuous of order α ∈ (0, 1], i.e., ω(τ ) = cτ α is a modulus of continuity
for a constant c > 0. Then
Rs
we have |f (t)| 6 (1 + c)S(t)α/(1+α) for t > 0, where S(t) = sups>t | t f (τ )dτ |.
Proof. It is enough to repeat the proof of Lemmas 2 and 6 but with s = S(t)1/(1+α) .



Next, we specialize to the situation of Theorem 5.
Corollary 9. Let f ∈ W 1,p,q (0, ∞) for some p ∈ [1, ∞) and
∞]. Then we have |f (t)|p 6
R ∞ q ∈ (1,
p
p−1
′
(q−1)/(2q−1)
(1 + pkf k∞ kf kq )S(t)
for t > 0, where S(t) = t |f (τ )| dτ .

Proof. By Lemma 6, under our assumptions, f is bounded, and τ 7→ kf ′ kq τ (q−1)/q is a modulus of continuity for f . As in equation (1) in the proof of Theorem 5, we conclude that ω(τ ) =
′
(q−1)/q
is a modulus of continuity of |f |p . It is therefore enough to apply Theorem
pkf kp−1
∞ kf kq τ
8 to the latter function and to α = (q − 1)/q to obtain the assertion, because then α/(1 + α) =
(q − 1)/(2q − 1).

We point out that Corollary 9 contains the quantitative versions of the results of Tao [7, Lemma 1],
Desoer and Vidyasagar [3, Ex. 1 on p. 237], and Teel [8, Fact 4].
We finish this short note by illustrating how Barbălat’s Lemma, and its variations are typically used in
the control theoretic literature, for instance, to obtain (asymptotic) stability of solutions of ordinary
differential equations. The next example is taken from Hou, Duan, Guo [4, Example 3.1].
Example 10. Consider the system
(

ė(t) = −e(t) + θ(t)ω(t),
θ̇(t) = −e(t)ω(t),

with ω bounded and continuous. For some solution (e, θ) of this equation we define V = e2 + θ2 and
compute V̇ (t) = −2e2 (t) 6 0 for every t > 0. Thus, V and therefore e and θ are bounded. We put
f := 2e2 and in view of the positivity of V and f we obtain

f (t)dt =

−V̇ (t)dt = −V (R) + V (0) 6 V (0),

so that f ∈ L1 (0, ∞). Since f˙(t) = 4ė(t)e(t) = −4e(t)2 + 4θ(t)e(t)ω(t) holds and θ, e, ω are bounded,
we conclude f˙ ∈ L∞ (0, ∞). That is f ∈ W 1,1,∞ (0, ∞) and by Theorem 5 it follows f (t) → 0 for
t → ∞. From the definition of f we finally obtain that also e(t) → 0 for t → ∞.
