Abstract
In this work we prove that a family of explicit numerical finite-difference methods is convergent when applied to a nonlinear Volterra equation with a power-type nonlinearity. In that
case the kernel is not of Lipschitz type, therefore the classical analysis cannot be applied. We
indicate several difficulties that arise in the proofs and show how they can be remedied. The
tools that we use consist of variations on discreet Gronwall’s lemmas and comparison theorems.
Additionally, we give an upper bound on the convergence order. We conclude the paper with a
construction of a convergent method and apply it for solving some examples.

Introduction

Integral equations are one of most useful tools used in mathematical analysis and modelling. Many
essential problems formulated as differential equations can be transformed into the equivalent integral equations which, many times, are more useful for showing existence, uniqueness and deriving
estimates. This field has reached its maturity and there is a wealth of literature reviewing many
subjects such as the theory for Volterra [5, 18, 13] and Fredholm equations [40, 37, 21], numerical
methods [2, 22, 5, 19, 4, 3] and topics in integro-differential equations [12, 31] and fractional calculus
[26, 16, 23, 36].
In this work we consider a family of numerical finite-difference methods for solving a certain class
of nonlinear Volterra equations. These, in particular, arise as models of dynamics in porous media
[41, 29, 30], heat transfer [24], propagation of shock-waves in gas filled tubes [20] and anomalous
diffusion [32, 34]. The latter application is the main motivation behind our investigations (more
details can be found in [33]). The general form of the family of equations that we consider can be
written as follows
Z x
1
(1)
u(x) =
K(x, t)u(t) m+1 dt, m > 0, x ∈ [0, X].
0

Notice that the nonlinearity is not Lipschitz so that we cannot use the most of the classical theory.
However, there are many results concerning existence and uniqueness. In the seminal papers [9, 17]
the problem was stated and several conditions for existence and uniqueness were given. Later, in
a number of work those results were strengthened and generalized (see [29, 10, 11, 27, 28]). Abel
integral equations with power-type nonlinearities have also been recently investigated [8, 42]. For
further details see other works of cited authors.

According to the best of authors’ knowledge, the literature consists of only very few papers
concerning numerical methods for this kind of equations. In [6] a iterative fixed-point way of solving
(1) was proposed. Also, in [7] a short review article concerning theoretical and numerical concepts
of nonlinear Volterra equation has been published.
In what follows we consider a family of explicit methods for solving (1) and prove that under
certain boundedness assumptions on the kernel they are convergent. Moreover, we find a bound on
the convergence rate and illustrate the theory with the numerical simulations.

Finite difference method

Consider the following nonlinear Volterra equation which arises from (1) via the transformation
y(x)m+1 = u(x)
Z x
m+1
y(x)
=
K(x, t)y(t)dt, m > 0, x ∈ [0, X].
(2)
0

We will need the boundedness assumption on the kernel K ∈ C([0, X]2 )
0 < C ≤ K(x, t) ≤ D,

(3)

from which only the lower one is a nontrivial requirement. It can be shown that the positive solution
of (2) with (3) exists and is unique (see [9] and other papers mentioned in the Introduction).
In order to construct the numerical method fix a natural number N and introduce the grid
xn = nh,

h=

X
,
N

n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N.

(4)

The next step is to discretize the integral in (2), say
Z

xn

K(xn , t)y(t)dt = h
0

n−1
X

wn,i K(xn , xi )y(xi ) + δn (h),

(5)

i=1

where δn (h) is the local consistency error. Next, we define
δ(h) := max |δn (h)|,
1≤n≤N

(6)

and further assume that
0 < wn,i ≤ W,

n, i = 0, 1, 2, ..., N,

(7)

for some W > 0. Denoting yn as a numerical approximation to y(nh) we may then propose the
following explicit finite difference scheme for solving (2)
ynm+1 = h

n−1
X

wn,i Kn,i yi ,

n = 2, 3, ..., N,

(8)

i=1

where Kn,i := K(xn , xi ). Since the equation (2) has a trivial solution, it is necessary to start the
above iteration with a value which will force the convergence to the nontrivial one. In the next
section we will show one way of making that choice.
Below we will prove that (8) is convergent to the unique positive solution of (2). Before that,
however, we need some auxiliary results. The first is a simple observation concerning the iteration
scheme (8).
Proposition 1. Let y be a solution of (2) and construct yn via the iteration (8). If δn (h) in (5)
is positive (negative) for n = 1, 2, ..., N , then y(nh) ≥ yn (y(nh) ≤ yn ) provided that y(h) ≥ y1
(y(h) ≤ y1 ).
2

Proof. It suffices to consider only the case δn ≥ 0 for all n = 1, 2, ..., N . Since by assumption we
have y(h) ≥ y1 then, by induction, we can assume that the assertion holds for the n first terms. The
inductive step can be conducted as follows
Z (n+1)h
n
X
m+1
K((n + 1)h, t)y(t)dt = h
wn+1,i Kn+1,i y(ih) + δn+1 (h)

≥h

i=1

n
X

wn+1,i Kn+1,i yi + δn+1 (h) ≥

(9)

m+1
yn+1
.

i=1

The first inequality is a consequence of the inductive assumption, while in the second we use the fact
that δn+1 ≥ 0 and (8). It follows that y((n + 1)h) ≥ yn+1 what ends the proof.
Next, we prove a comparison theorem that can be thought as a generalization of the GronwallBellman’s Lemma.
Lemma 1. Let y ∈ C[0, 1] be a positive function satisfying
Z x

where the sign ≶ denotes either less or greater than.
Proof. The proof will proceed for the ≥-case. The reasoning for the other follows exactly the same
route. Let y be as in the assumption, and denote
Z x
tν y(t)dt,
(12)
z(x) :=
0

with z(0) = 0. We have then

and therefore

In a similar vein we can prove the following asymptotic result.

we have

because y is positive while 0 ≤ τ (x) ≤ x. Similarly as before we substitute

z(x) :=

(21)

and therefore

1

z 0 (x) = y(x) = (K(x, τ (x))z(x)) m+1 .

The proof is complete.
The second lemma is a discrete analogue of the above.
Lemma 3. Let {yn }, n = 1, 2, ..., N be a sequence of positive numbers satisfying the recurrence (8)
with (3) and (5). Assume that the initial value is chosen to satisfy

where (h) is the maximal local consistency error (6) of the quadrature (5) applied to the function

Proof. Due to the assumption we can proceed to the inductive step. To this end, let yi satisfy (27)

(31)

Now, due to convexity we have the inequality (1 − x)m ≤ 1 − x for m ≥ 1 which grants the validity
of the above estimate. This ends the proof.
Finally, we prove a variant of the discreet generalization of the Gronwall-Bellman’s lemma.

then

(33)

(34)

Proof. First, notice that −1 < Aζ(1 − A) < 0 for 0 < A < 1 [39]. Therefore, the above bounds are
well-defined. To prove them we proceed by induction. Assume (33) and notice that obviously we
have e1 ≤ M .
Next, we make the inductive step and assume that (34) holds for all terms up to a fixed n. We
will show that this assertion is also true for the (n + 1)th term. First, assume that A ≥ 1 and use
the inductive assumption

where the last inequality follows from the fact that B ≤ −M Aζ(1−A). This concludes the reasoning.
As we noted, the above two lemmas are generalizations of the Gronwall-Bellman’s results. Similar
theorems arise in many situations when considering integral equations and numerical methods used in
solving them. There is a large collection of papers about various generalizations of the aforementioned
inequalities from which the monograph [1] gives a thorough exposition of the continuous case. Many
other results concerning the discreet version can be found for instance in [43, 38, 15, 25].
We can now proceed to the main theorem. We claim that the numerical method (8) is locally
convergent to the unique positive solution of (2). We difficulty of the proof lies in the non-Lipschitz
behaviour of the nonlinearity in (2). The usual method do not work since we cannot make estimate
which will invoke the standard Gronwall-Bellman’s lemma. To overcome this difficulty we use a
comparison result which helps us to bound the solution from below with a known function for which
the numerical method is convergent.
Theorem 1. Let y = y(x) be the nontrivial solution of (2) with (3). Moreover, by en := y(nh) − yn
m+1
denote the error of the numerical scheme (5)-(8) and assume that (h)h− m < 1 as h → 0+ , where
(h) is defined in Lemma 3. Then, if y1 satisfies (26) with |e1 | = O(hp ) for some p > 0, we have

Proof. First, we can use the Langrange’s mean-value theorem


y(nh)m+1 − ynm+1  = (m + 1)ξ m |y(nh) − yn | ,

m > 0,

where ξ is between y(nh) and yn . Now, we use the above estimate with (2) and (5) to obtain

Now, when h → 0+ with nh → const. we obtain the assertion. The proof is

The analysis of the above proof can lead to a stronger convergence result for a specific family of
quadratures.
Corollary 1. Let y = y(x) be a solution of (2) with (3). Moreover, choose a quadrature with δn ≤ 0
for each n = 1, 2, ..., N . If the starting value y1 has |e1 | = O(hp ) for some p > 0, then

Proof. If δn ≤ 0, then by Proposition 1 we have y(nh) ≤ yn . The proof follows the same steps as in
Theorem 1 with the difference that we always have ξ ≥ y(nh) in (42). Hence the conclusion can be
drawn from (47) without any subsequent estimates.

Construction of a quadrature and numerical examples

In this section we will construct a convergent numerical method for solving (8). By Lemma 2, we can
identify several problems in numerically solving this integral equation. For example, when m > 1
the non-smooth behaviour of the solution at x = 0 can severely slow down the convergence. Recall
that for a smooth function, its Newton-Cotes quadrature has an error bounded by the value of a
sufficiently high derivative. If the considered function is not smooth enough, the order of the method
can be reduced [35, 14]. On the other hand, when 0 < m < 1 the Corollary 1 can give very weak
estimates on the convergence rate. Having these remarks in mind, in what follows, we will illustrate
the above results by constructing a numerical method for the case m ≥ 1 leaving the other case for
the future work.
To maximize the theoretical convergence rate we will use a quadrature with δn (h) ≤ 0 and use
1
Corollary 1. Notice that y(x) ∝ x m so that for m ≥ 1 the solution is locally concave. As a quadrature
we choose the midpoint method which is of second order for sufficiently smooth functions. However,
1
near x = 0 the method will be only O(h1+ m ). In order to see this fact we use the result from [14]
stating that for any function with bounded variation the local consistency error is the following
Z h
 

h  h h

f
(t)dt
−
hf
= V (f ).
(51)

Now, due to the monotonicity we have V0h (t m ) = h m , which states that the quadrature has order
1 + m1 . Note that this is in contrast with usual estimate for smooth functions.
Moreover, we can restrict ourselves only to an arbitrary and fixed interval [0, ξ], so that the
derivative singularity at the origin would be integrated. For the rest of the interval any other
quadrature can be used since the nonlinearity of the equation (2) is of the Lipschitz class.
In order to convince oneself that the midpoint quadrature will yield a greater area under a curve
than the exact integral consider an arbitrary interval [xi , xi+1 ]. Construct a line tangent to xi+ 1 and
2
notice that due to concavity, the area of a trapezium generated by it is greater than the are area
under y. On the other hand, the trapezium theorem states that its area is equal to the area of a
rectangle spanned by its height and the midline. This precisely is the midpoint quadrature. These
considerations can be confirmed by the standard error analysis but this reasoning requires existence
of a second derivative.
Before we construct the quadrature we have to choose the starting value for the iteration (8). We
have several ways of doing this. Keeping in mind that we have to choose y1 ≥ y(h), we can try to
bound the defining integral equation by some simple, not necessarily open, quadrature. The simplest
choice is to use the rectangle rule
Z h
Z h
m+1
y(h)
=
K(h, t)y(t)dt ≤ y(h)
K(h, t)dt,
(52)

because y is increasing and K positive. We can thus define the initial step for the iteration as
Z
y1 :=

h

 m1
.
K(h, t)dt

(53)

0
1

This choice has a disadvantage of producing a large starting error O(h m ), since by Lemma 2 we have

 m1 !
1
m
|y(h) − y1 | ∼ 1 −
(Ch) m as h → 0+ .
(54)
m+1
Therefore we can put p = m1 in the Corollary 1. In order to increase the accuracy we can always use
Richardson’s extrapolation and we implicitly assume that it is utilized in our quadrature.

(55)

The first term y1 is calculated by the formula (53) and y0 = 0. This quadrature uses intervals of
length 2h and approximates the integral by the midpoint rule. Therefore, we have to distinguish
between the even and odd steps (k = 0, 1 respectively) with regard to whether or not the terminal
point is a midpoint of the interval. The first term on the right-hand side of the above formula is
nonzero only in the odd term and is a result of a trapezoid rule applied to the interval [0, h]. We will
illustrate the above results with some numerical examples.
Example 1. As a first example we consider the following equation
Z x
m+1
y(x)
=
y(t)dt, x ∈ [0, 1],

(56)

0

which can be readily solved with

y(x) =

m+1

 m1
.

(57)

Here, K(x, t) ≡ C = D = 1 and hence, thanks to (55) we have W = 2. From (41) we immediately
deduce that the scheme is convergent with order at least equal to 1 + m1 − m2 = 1 = m1 . Recall, that
1
since the solution is proportional to x m , the midpoint method will converge with an order of 1 + m1 .
The results for numerical simulations are given in Tab. 3. We can see that the real order of
convergence depends very weakly on m and is close to 1. Note that we are comparing the exact with
numerical solution at a fixed point x = 0.001. In order to compute the order we use the standard
technique of linear regression on a log-log plot of the error versus the iteration step which, in our
simulation, changes from 10−1 to 10−5 . Notice that the integration is exact for m = 1 which is not
surprising since midpoint rule is exact for the linear functions.

Here, C = 1, D = eX and W = 2, hence the order of convergence can be estimated as equal to at
least 1 + m1 − m2 eX > 1 − m1 . Choosing a sufficiently small X assures that the method is convergent
(specifically X < ln m+1
). Results of the simulations are given in Tab. 3. Once again, the order of

convergence is very close to 1.

Conclusion

We have shown that an explicit method for solving the Volterra integral equation with a power-type
nonlinearity is convergent. The subjects of the future work consist of generalizing our results to
the implicit schemes for integral equations with kernels bounded from below by an arbitrary power
functions.
