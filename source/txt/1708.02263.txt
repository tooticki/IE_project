CLAUDIANOR O. ALVES, RONALDO C. DUARTE AND MARCO A. S. SOUTO
Abstract. In this paper we show an abstract theorem involving the existence
of critical points for a functional I, which permit us to prove the existence of
solutions for a large class of Berestycki-Lions type problems. In the proof of
the abstract result we apply the deformation lemma on a special set associated
with I, which we call of Pohozaev set.

1. Introduction
At the last years a lot of authors have dedicated a special attention for existence
of solution for elliptic problems of the type
(1.1)

− ∆u = g(u),

in RN ,

where N ≥ 2, ∆ denotes the Laplacian operator and g is a continuous function
verifying some conditions.
The main motivation comes from of the seminal paper due to Berestycki and
Lions [15], which has considered the existence of solution for (1.1) by assuming
that N ≥ 3 and the following conditions on g:
−∞ < lim inf
s→0+

there is ξ > 0 such that G(ξ) > 0,

where G(s) = 0 g(t) dt.
In [16], Berestycki, Gallouet and Kavian have studied the case where N = 2 and
the nonlinearity g possesses an exponential growth of the type

s→0+

g(s)
= 0,

∀β > 0.

In the two above mentioned papers, the authors have used the variational method
to prove the existence of solution for (1.1). The main idea is to solve the minimization problems

for N ≥ 3 and N = 2 respectively. After that, the authors showed that the
minimizer functions of the above problems are in fact ground state solutions of
(1.1). By a ground state solution, we mean a solution u ∈ H 1 (RN ) \ {0} that
satisfies
E(u) ≤ E(v) for all nontrival solution v of (1.1),
where E : H 1 (RN ) → R is the energy functional associated to (1.1) given by

After, Jeanjean and Tanaka in [37] showed that the mountain pass level of E is
a critical level and it is indeed the lowest critical level.
A version of the problem (1.1) for the critical case have been made in Alves,
Souto and Montenegro [5] for N ≥ 3 and N = 2, see also Zhang and Zhou [51] for
N = 3. The reader can found in Alves, Figueiredo and Siciliano [4], Chang and
Wang [20] and Zhang, do Ó and Squassina [52] the same type of results involving
the fractional Laplacian operator, more precisely, for a problem like
(1.2)

(−∆)α u = g(u),

in RN ,

with α ∈ (0, 1) and N ≥ 1.
We would like point out that the method used in the above papers works well
because g does not depend on x, −∆ and (−∆)α are homogeneous operators and
there is a Pohozaev identity associated with (1.1) and (1.2) . When one of these
facts is not verified it is necessary to change the arguments. In [43], Pomponio
and Watanabe have studied the existence of solution for (1.1) changing −∆ by
−∆p − ∆q , that is, the following problem has been considered
(1.3)

− ∆p u − ∆q u = g(u),

in RN .

In this case, there is a loss of homogeneity in the operator, then the arguments
used in the previous paper does not work well. To overcome this difficulty, the
authors have used a result found in Jeanjean [38, Theorem 1.1] to solve the problem.
However, the fact that above problem has a Pohozaev identity is crucial in their
approach. In [12], Azzollini and Pomponio have considered the existence of solution
for the following class of problem
(1.4)

− ∆u + V (x)u = g(u),

in RN .

By supposing some geometry conditions on V , the authors also used [38, Theorem
1.1] as well as the fact that there is a Pohozaev identity associated with the problem.
The read is invited to see that in the papers [43] and [12] a Pohozaev identity is
a key point to prove that a sequence of approximate solutions for (1.3) and (1.4)
are bounded.
Motivated by above papers, we were led for the following problem: If g is a
discontinuous function how to get a solution for problems (1.1), (1.2) or (1.3) ?
The main difficulty is related to the fact that the classical variational methods to
C 1 functional cannot be applied. Moreover, in this situation, there is no Pohozaev

3

identity associated with the problem. A second problem that we are interesting is
a version of (1.3) involving fractional Laplacian problem, more precisely,
(1.5)

(−∆)α u + (−∆)β u = g(u),

in RN ,

where α, β ∈ (0, 1), N > 2 max{α, β} and g be a continuous function. This problem
becomes interesting, because the authors do not know a Pohozaev identity associated with it. Finally, another problem that we are interesting is the following
Anisotropic problem

where 1 < p1 < ... < pn < N and g be a continuous function. Here, as in
last problem the authors do not know a Pohozaev identity associated with (1.6).
From these above commentaries a new approach must be developed to solved them.
Having theses problems in mind, in the present paper we show that there is an
abstract result behind of the famous result due to Berestycki and Lions [15], which
can be used to solve a lot of problems where the existence of a Pohozaev identity
is not clear. An advantage of our main result is related to the fact that it can be
applied for a lot of problems where the nonlinearity g is continuous, and also, for
some problems where the nonlinearity g is discontinuous.
Before stating our abstract theorem we need to fix some notations. In the sequel (X, || ||) is a reflexive Banach space and ψ1 , ..., ψn , Φ : X → R are continuous
functionals verifying:
There is an application ∗ : [0, ∞) × X → X and λ1 , ..., λn , λΦ ∈ R such that
(X1 ) ψi (∗(t, u)) = tλi ψi (u);
(X2 ) Φ(∗(t, u)) = tλΦ Φ(u);
(X3 ) 0 < max {λ1 , ..., λp } < λΦ ;
(X4 ) ∗(0, u) = 0, ∀u ∈ X;
(X5 ) For each u ∈ X fixed, the application t 7−→ ∗(t, u) is continuous.
There are subsets X + , X r ⊂ X that are weak closed and a function Q : X + → X r
verifying:
(X6 ) ψi (Q(u)) ≤ ψi (u), ∀u ∈ X + , ∀i ∈ {1, ..., n};
(X7 ) Φ(Q(u)) ≥ Φ(u), ∀u ∈ X + ;
(X8 ) If u ∈ X r , then ∗(t, u) ∈ X r for all t ≥ 0.
Before writing our next assumptions, we would like to fix the following notations
ut := ∗(t, u),
J(u) :=

∀t ≥ 0 and u ∈ X,

n
X

ψi (u),

∀u ∈ X

i=1

and

I(u) = J(u) − Φ(u),

∀u ∈ X.

Moreover of the above conditions, we also assume the following:

4

C. O. ALVES, R.C. DUARTE AND M.A.S. SOUTO

(F1 ) Φ(0) = 0 and there is u ∈ X such that Φ(u) > 0.
(F2 ) ψi (u) ≥ 0 for all i ∈ {1, ..., n} and u ∈ X. Moreover, J(u) = 0 ⇔ u = 0.
(F3 ) There exists r > 0 such that if 0 < ||u|| < r, then
n
X

λi ψi (u) > λΦ Φ(u).

i=i

(F4 ) For any sequence (uk ) satisfying Φ(uk ) ≥ 0 and J(uk ) → 0, we have ||uk || → 0.
Moreover, if (J(uk )) is bounded, then (uk ) is also bounded.
(F5 ) If (uk ) ⊂ X r is weakly convergent for u in X, then
lim sup Φ(uk ) ≤ Φ(u).
k→∞

(F6 ) If (uk ) is weakly convergent for u in X, then
ψi (u) ≤ lim inf ψi (uk ),
k→∞

∀i ∈ {1, 2, ...., n}.

In throughout this article, we denote by P and P + the sets
P = {u ∈ X \ {0} : λ1 ψ1 (u) + ... + λn ψn (u) = λΦ Φ(u)}
and


	
P + = u ∈ X + \ {0} : λ1 ψ1 (u) + ... + λn ψn (u) = λΦ Φ(u) .
The set P will called of Pohozaev set and associated with it we have the operator
K(u) = λ1 ψ1 (u) + ... + λn ψn (u) − λΦ Φ(u),

which will call of Pohozaev operator. Note that K −1 ({0}) = P ∪ {0}.
Now, we are ready to state our main result.
Theorem 1.1. Let X, Φ, ψ1 ,..., ψn satisfying (X1 ) − (X8 ) and (F1 ) − (F6 ). If
inf I(w) = inf + I(w),

w∈P

w∈P

then there is u ∈ P such that I(u) = inf I(w) > 0. If I is locally Lipschitz, then u
w∈P

is a critical point of I in X, that is, 0 ∈ ∂I(u).
The plan of the paper is as follows: In Section 2 we have proved some preliminary
results that will be used in Section 3 to show the Theorem 1.1. In Section 4 we
study the existence of solution for a large class of problem, which includes the
problem
(−∆)α u + (−∆)β u = g(u), in RN ,
(P1 )
where α, β ∈ (0, 1), (−∆)α and (−∆)β denote the fractional Laplacian of order α
and β respectively, N > 2 max{α, β} and g(s) = f (s) − s is a continuous function.
In Section 5, we consider the existence of solution for an Anisotropic problem like

where 1 < p1 < ... < pn < N and g = f (s) − |s|p0 −2 s is a continuous function. Finally, in Section 6, we establish the existence of solution for a class of discontinuous
problem of the type
−∆u(x) ∈ ∂G(u(x)),

a.e. in RN ,

(P3 )

5

where N ≥ 1, G is the primitive of a function g(s) = f (s) − s, which can have a
finite numbers of discontinuity and ∂G(s) is the generalized gradient of G at s ∈ R.
2. Preliminary results
In this section, we have showed some technical lemmas that will be used in the
next section to prove Theorem 1.1.
Lemma 2.1. Let u ∈ X satisfying Φ(u) > 0. Then, there exists a unique t∗ > 0
such that ut∗ ∈ P. Hence,
I(ut∗ ) = max I(ut )
t≥0

and for u ∈ P,
I(u) = max I(ut ).
t≥0

Proof. Let u ∈ X satisfying Φ(u) > 0. By (F1 ), u 6= 0. For each t ≥ 0, we fix
h(t) := I(ut ),

∀t ∈ [0, +∞).

By (X1 ) − (X2 ),
h(t) = tλ1 ψ1 (u) + ... + tλn ψn (u) − tλΦ Φ(u).
Now, From (X3 ) and (F2 ), h(t) > 0 for t > 0 large small and
lim h(t) = −∞.

t→+∞

These informations ensure that h possesses a maximum in some t∗ ∈ (0, +∞), that
is,
I(ut∗ ) = max I(ut ).
t>0

′

∗

Since h (t ) = 0, we derive that u
recall that ut ∈ P if, and only if,

t∗

∈ P. To show the uniqueness of t∗ , we first

λ1 tλ1 ψ1 (u) + ... + λn tλn ψn (u) = λΦ tλΦ Φ(u).
In the sequel, without loss of generality, we assume that λ1 = max {λi }ni=1 . Then,
ut ∈ P if, and only if,
(2.7)

λ1 ψ1 (u) = −

n
X

λi t(λi −λ1 ) ψi (u) + λΦ t(λΦ −λ1 ) Φ(u).

i=2

Combining (X3 ) with (F2 ) and the fact that Φ(u) > 0, it follows that the function
m(t) = −

n
X

λi t(λi −λ1 ) ψi (u) + λΦ t(λΦ −λ1 ) Φ(u),

for t ≥ 0

i=2

has a positive derivative in (0, +∞). Therefore, m is increasing, m(0) = 0 and
m(t) → +∞ as t → +∞. These facts guarantee the existence of a unique t > 0
satisfying (2.7).

Corollary 2.2. The Pohozaev set P is not empty.
Proof. The result follows by combining the last lemma with (F1 ).
Lemma 2.3. There exists r > 0 such that
||u|| ≥ r,

∀u ∈ P.



6

C. O. ALVES, R.C. DUARTE AND M.A.S. SOUTO

Proof. For all u ∈ P,
n
X

K(u) =

λi ψi (u) − λΦ Φ(u) = 0.

i=1

On the other hand, by (F3 ), there exists r > 0 such that
Pn
K(u) = i=1 λi ψi (u) − λΦ Φ(u) > 0, ∀ 0 < ||u|| < r.
Thus,

||u|| ≥ r,

∀u ∈ P.


Proposition 2.4. The functional I is bounded from below in P and there exists
u0 ∈ P satisfying
I(u0 ) = inf I(u).
u∈P

Moreover, inf I(u) > 0.
u∈P

Proof. If u ∈ P, (F2 ) combined with (X3 ) gives

showing the boundedness of I from below in P. In what follows,
I∞ = inf I(u) = inf I(u)
u∈P

u∈P +

and (uk ) is a minimizing sequence associated with I∞ , that is, (uk ) ⊂ P + and
I(uk ) → I∞ .
From (2.8), (J(uk )) is a bounded sequence. Hence, by (F4 ), the sequence (uk ) is
also bounded in X. On the other hand, by conditions (X6 ) − (X7 ), we know that
(Q(uk )) ⊂ X r and
J(Q(uk )) ≤ J(uk ), ∀k ∈ N
and
Φ(Q(uk )) ≥ Φ(uk ) > 0, ∀k ∈ N.
By Lemma 2.1, there exits t∗k > 0 such that (Q[uk ])t∗k ∈ P. Therefore,


I∞ ≤ I (Q[uk ])t∗k ≤ I (uk )t∗k ≤ max I ((uk )t ) = I(uk ).
t>0

The last inequality yields


I (Q[uk ])t∗k → I∞ .
From this, without loss of generality we can assume that (uk ) ⊂ X r . As X is
reflexive and X r is weak closed, we can suppose that for some subsequence, (uk ) is
weakly convergent for some u ∈ X r . Since, uk ∈ P, we must have Φ(uk ) > 0, and
so, by (F5 ),
Φ(u) ≥ 0.
We claim that Φ(u) > 0. Indeed, assume by contradiction that Φ(u) = 0. Then,
Φ(uk ) → 0

as k → +∞.

Using the fact that uk ∈ P, we derive
J(uk ) → 0

as k → +∞.

7

Now, applying (F4 ) we get
||uk || → 0,
which contradicts Lemma 2.3. Thereby, Φ(u) > 0, and so, u 6= 0. Consequently,
the Lemma 2.1 guarantees the existence of t∗ > 0 verifying
ut∗ ∈ P.
From (X1 ) − (X2 ),
I(uk )

= Pi=1 ψi ((uk )t∗ ) − Φ((uk )t∗ )

The last inequality combines with (F5 ) − (F6 ) to give

= I(ut∗ ).
Recalling that ut∗ ∈ P, we deduce that

I∞ = I(ut∗ ).
Now, we are going to show that I∞ = inf I(u) > 0. In fact, by (2.8), I∞ ≥ 0. If
u∈P

I∞ = 0, we can argue as above to find a minimizing sequence (uk ) ⊂ P + satisfying
Φ(uk ) ≥ 0 and J(uk ) → 0. However, this information together with (F4 ) leads
to ||uk || → 0, contradicting Lemma 2.3. Therefore, inf I(u) > 0, finishing the
u∈P

proof.


3. Proof of Theorem 1.1

In this section our main goal is proving the Theorem 1.1, however to do that, we
need to prove more some preliminary lemmas.
Lemma 3.1. Let u ∈ P and set γ(t) := ut . Then,
lim I(γ(t)) = −∞.

t→+∞

Proof. First of all, note that
(3.9)

I(γ(t)) =

n
X

i

tλ ψi (u) − tλΦ Φ(u),

∀t ∈ [0, +∞).

i=1

As u ∈ P, we have Φ(u) > 0. This combined with (X3 ) gives the desired result. 
Lemma 3.2. Let γ : R → X be a continuous path satisfying
γ(0) = 0

and

lim I(γ(t)) = −∞.

t→+∞

Then, there exists t0 > 0 such that γ(t0 ) ∈ P.
Proof. We begin by supposing that γ(t) 6= 0 for all t > 0. Since
K(u) =

n
X
i=1

λi ψi (u) − λΦ Φ(u),

8

C. O. ALVES, R.C. DUARTE AND M.A.S. SOUTO

by (F3 ), there exists r > 0 such that
K(u) > 0,

for ||u|| < r.

As γ(0) = 0 and γ, K are continuous functions, for t small enough we must have
K(γ(t)) > 0.
On the other hand, the definition of I, (X3 ) and (f3 ) lead to
K(u) = λΦ I(u) +

n
X

(λi − λΦ )ψi (u) ≤ λΦ I(u),

∀u ∈ X.

i=1

Hence,

K(γ(t)) ≤ λΦ I(γ(t)),

∀t ∈ [0, +∞).

Then, K(γ(t)) < 0 for t large enough. From this, there is t > 0 verifying
K(γ(t)) = 0,
implying that γ(t) ∈ P. For the general case, fix t̃ > 0 satisfying
t̃ = sup {t ∈ [0, +∞); γ(t) = 0} .
By continuity, γ(t̃) = 0. Setting
β(t) = γ(t + t̃)

∀t ∈ [0, +∞),

we have that β(0) = 0, lim I(β(t)) = −∞ and β(t) 6= 0, for all t > 0. By the
t→∞
above arguments, there exists t0 > 0 such that
β(t0 ) ∈ P,
showing that γ(t0 + t̃) ∈ P.



Next, we recall the deformation lemma for locally Lipschitz functional found in
Figueiredo and Pimenta [35] that will be used in the proof of Theorem 1.1.
Theorem 3.3. (Deformation Lemma) Let X be a Banach space and I : X → R be
a locally Lipschitz functional. Assume that there are c ∈ R, S ⊂ E and α, δ, ǫ0 > 0
satisfying
β(x) := min {||z||X ∗ ; z ∈ ∂I(x)} ≥ α, for all x ∈ I −1 ([c − ǫ0 , c + ǫ0 ]) ∩ S2δ .
where S2δ is a 2δ-neighborhood of S. Then, for each 0 < ǫ < min{ δα
2 , ǫ0 } there
exists a homeomorphism η : X → X satisfying
• η(u) = u, se u ∈
/ I −1 ([c − ǫ0 , c + ǫ0 ]) ∩ S2δ ;
c+ǫ
• η(I
∩ S) ⊂ I c−ǫ ;
• I(η(u)) ≤ I(u) for all u ∈ X,
where I a = {u ∈ X; I(u) ≤ a} for all a ∈ R.
Now, we are ready to proof Theorem 1.1.
Proof. (Proof of Theorem 1.1 ) By Proposition 2.4, there is u ∈ P with
I(u) = I∞ = inf I(w) > 0.
w∈P

Assume by contradiction that 0 ∈
/ ∂I(u). Then, there is α > 0 such that
(3.10)

|x − u| < α ⇒ β(x) = min {||z||X ∗ ; z ∈ ∂I(x)} > α.

9

Indeed, otherwise for each α = k1 , it would exist xk ∈ X with
1
k

|u − xk | <

and

β(xk ) <

1
,
k

∀k ∈ N.

Consequently, it would exist zk ∈ ∂I(xk ) with
1
||zk ||X ∗ < .
k
By definition and properties of I 0 (u, v) (see [19]), we must have
I 0 (u, v) ≥ lim sup I 0 (xk , v) ≥ lim suphzk , vi = h0, vi,
k→∞

∀v ∈ X,

k→∞

showing that 0 ∈ ∂I(u), which is absurd. This proves (3.10).
Applying the Deformation Lemma for c = I∞ , δ = α4 , ǫ0 = I2∞ and S = B α2 (u),
we get a homeomorphism η : X → X satisfying
• (i) η(u) = u, if u ∈
/ I −1 ([c − ǫ0 , c + ǫ0 ]) ∩ S2δ ;
c+ǫ
• (ii) η(I
∩ S) ⊂ I c−ǫ ;
• (iii) I(η(u)) ≤ I(u) for all u ∈ X.
Fix
β(t) := η(γ(t))
where γ(t) = ut . By (X5 ), the function β is continuous. Moreover, from (X4 ) and
I(0) < c − ǫ0 , we obtain
β(0) = η(γ(0)) = η(0) = 0.
Now, by Lemma 3.1 and (iii),
(3.11)

lim I(β(t)) = lim I(η(γ(t))) ≤ lim I(γ(t)) = −∞.

t→+∞

t→+∞

t→+∞

The above analysis permit us to apply Lemma 3.2 to find t∗ > 0 such that β(t∗ ) ∈ P.
Hence,
(3.12)

c ≤ I(β(t∗ )) ≤ max I(β(t)).
t>0

On the hand, as I(u) = c < c + ǫ, γ(1) = u, I and γ are continuous, we can choose
τ > 0 of such way that
γ(t) ∈ I c+ǫ ∩ S,

∀t ∈ [1 − τ, 1 + τ ].

Thereby, if t ∈ [1 − τ, 1 + τ ], the Deformation Lemma yields
I(β(t)) = I(η(γ(t))) ≤ c − ǫ.
Now, we will analyze the case t ∈
/ [1 − τ, 1 + τ ]. In this case, by Lemma 2.1 and
(iii),
I(β(t)) = I(η(γ(t))) ≤ I(γ(t)) < max I(γ(t)) = I(γ(1)) = c
t>0

In any case, we deduce that
max I(β(t)) < c,
t>0

contradicting (3.12). Therefore,
0 ∈ ∂I(u),
finishing the proof.

The Corollary below is a version of Theorem 1.1 when the functional I is
C 1 (X, R).

Corollary 3.4. Let X, ψ1 ,..., ψn and Φ satisfying (X1 ) − (X8 ) and (F1 ) − (F6 ).
Assuming that Φ, ψ1 ,..., ψn ∈ C 1 (X, R) and
inf I(w) = inf I(w).

w∈P

w∈P +

Then there exists u ∈ P such that
I(u) = inf I(w).
w∈P

Moreover, u is a critical point of I in X, that is, I ′ (u) = 0.
Proof. Since I ∈ C 1 (X, R), we have that
∂I(u) = {I ′ (u)} ,

∀u ∈ X.

Therefore, o corollary is an immediate consequence of the Theorem 1.1.

of nonnegative solution for a problem like

in RN ,

(P1 )

where 0 < s1 ≤ s2 ≤ .... ≤ sn < 1, N > 2sn and (−∆)si denotes the si -fractional
laplacian and
g(s) = f (s) − s, ∀s ∈ R,
with f : R → R being a continuous function satisfying:
f (s)
= 0.
s→0 s

The reader is invited to observe that X + and X r are weak closed in H sn (RN ).
Moreover, we would like point out that X r is compactly embedding Lq (RN ) for all
q ∈ (2, 2∗sn ), that is, if (uk ) ⊂ X r is a bounded sequence in H sn (RN ), then there
are a subsequence of (uk ), still denoted by itself, and u ∈ X r such that

∀q ∈ (2, 2∗sn ).

The proof this fact follows of [15, Radial Lemma A.IV ].

The main result this section has the following statement
Theorem 4.1. Assume the conditions (f1 ) − (f4 ). Then, (P1 ) has a nontrivial
solution.
Proof. In the sequel, we will show that all conditions of Theorem 1.1 hold, which
ensures that functional I1 has a nontrivial critical point, and hence (P1 ) has a
nontrivial solution. First of all, note that
I1 (u) = J(u) − Φ(u),

∀u ∈ X = H sn (RN ).

In what follows, we set ∗(t, u) := ut : RN → R by


u xt , for t > 0,
ut (x) =
0, for t = 0.
It is easy to check that
ψ1 , ψ2 , ..., ψn , Φ ∈ C 1 (H sn (RN ), R),
u ∈ X r ⇒ ut ∈ X r ,

∀t ≥ 0,

∀t ≥ 0 and ∀u ∈ H sn (RN )

Φ(ut ) = tN Φ(u),
and
ψi (ut ) = tN −2si ψi (u),

∀t ≥ 0,

∀i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n} and ∀u ∈ H sn (RN ).

Thus, the conditions (X1 ) − (X4 ) and (F2 ) occur. Moreover, a simple computation shows that for each u ∈ H sn (RN ), the application t 7−→ ut is continuous, and
so, (X5 ) is also proved.
The conditions (X6 ) − (X8 ) are verified by considering
Q : H sn (RN )

where (u+ )∗ is the Schwartz’s symmetrization of u+ = max{u, 0}.
Now, we are going to prove the conditions (F1 ) and (F3 ) − (F6 ).
Claim 4.2. ( Proof of (F1 ) ):
and Φ(0) = 0.

There exists u ∈ H sn (RN ) such that Φ(u) > 0

Proof. By definition of Φ, we have Φ(0) = 0. For each k ∈ N, take φk ∈ C0∞ (B1+ k1 (0))

for all k ∈ N. If (J(uk )) is bounded, we have that (uk ) is also bounded. Moreover,
if J(uk ) → 0, then ||uk || → 0.

I1 (u) ≥ I1 (u+ ),

where u+ = max{u, 0}. For each u ∈ P, we know that u+ 6= 0, thus there is t+ > 0
such that (u+ )t+ ∈ P. Then,

The above claims permit us to conclude that I1 verifies the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, more precisely Corollary 3.4. Hence, I1 has a nontrivial critical point,
and so, problem (P1 ) possesses a nontrivial solution.

In this section we consider the existence of solution for the problem

where N ≥ 1, G is the primitive of a function g : R → R given

where
g(s) = lim ess inf {g(t); |s − t| < r}

and g(s) = lim ess sup {g(t); |s − t| < r} .
r↓0

When g is a continuous function, which is equivalent to say that f is continuous,
we know that G ∈ C 1 (R, R) and in this case
∂G(s) = {g(s)},

∀s ∈ R.

C. O. ALVES, R.C. DUARTE AND M.A.S. SOUTO

In this section, we assume that f can have a finite number of discontinuity points
a1 , a2 , ...., ap ∈ R \ {0}. Moreover, f verifies (f1 ), (f3 ) and the condition
(f7 ) There are A, B > 0 such that
|f (s)| ≤ A|s| + B|s|q ,

∀s ∈ R,

∗
for some q ∈ (1, 2∗ − 1) where 2∗ = N2N

Since we intend to find a nonnegative solution, in what follows we assume that

f (s) = 0,

∀s < 0.

Hereafter, by a solution we understand as being a function u ∈ Wloc

(RN ) ∩

For the case where f is a continuous function, the above solution must verify the
equation
−∆u(x) + u(x) = f (u(x)), a.e. in RN .
A rich literature is available by now on problems with discontinuous nonlinearities, and we refer the reader to Alves, Bertone and Gonçalves [1], Alves and Bertone
[2], Alves, Gonçalves and Santos [3], Ambrosetti and Turner [9], Ambrosetti, Calahorrano and Dobarro [10], Badiale and Tarantelo [11], Carl, Le and Motreanu [21],

[25], Hu, Kourogenis and Papageorgiou [40], Montreanu and Vargas [44], Radulescu
[47] and their references. Several techniques have been developed or applied in their
study, such as variational methods for nondifferentiable functionals, lower and upper solutions, global branching, fixed point theorem, and the theory of multivalued
mappings.

Since I3 is locally Lipschitz, a function u ∈ H 1 (RN ) is a critical point of I3 , if

generalized gradient of I3 at u is the set
∂I3 (u) = {µ ∈ (H 1 (RN ))∗ : I30 (u, v) ≥ hµ, vi, ∀v ∈ H 1 (RN )}
where I30 (u, v) denotes the directional derivative of I3 on u in the direction of
v ∈ H 1 (RN ) defined by
I3 (u + h + λv) − I3 (u + h)
.

I30 (u, v) = lim sup

The reader can find more details about this subject in Chang [19] and Clarke [26].
The main result this section is the following
Theorem 6.1. Assume the conditions (f1 ) − (f3 ) and (f7 ). Then, (6.15) has a
nontrivial solution.

19

As in the previous section, we will show that functional I3 verifies the conditions
of Theorem 1.1. In what follows,
X = H 1 (RN ),

and

By using these notations,

I3 (u) = J(u) − Φ(u),

∀u ∈ X = H 1 (RN ).

A well known argument shows that Φ is locally Lipschitz, J ∈ C 1 (H 1 (RN ), R) and
I3 is locally Lipschitz.
Moreover, as in the previous sections, we set ∗(t, u) := ut : RN → R by


u xt , for t 6= 0,
ut (x) =
0, for t = 0.
By definition of ψ and Φ, it follows that

Φ(ut ) = tN Φ(u) and ψ(ut ) = tN −2 ψ(u),

∀t ≥ 0

and ∀u ∈ H 1 (RN ).

From the above commentaries, we have proved (X1 ) − (X4 ) and (F2 ) of Theorem
1.1. Moreover, as in the previous sections, for each u ∈ H sn (RN ), the application
t 7−→ ut is continuous, and so, (X5 ) is also proved.
Next, as in Section 4, we will prove the other conditions of Theorem 1.1 also
occur. Setting
Q : H 1 (RN ) −→ X r
u
7−→ (u+ )∗ ,
where (u+ )∗ is the Schwartz’s symmetrization of u+ , standard arguments show that
(X6 ) − (X8 ) also hold.
Claim 6.2. ( Proof of (F1 )) There is u ∈ H 1 (RN ) such that Φ(u) > 0 and
Φ(0) = 0.
Proof. The claim follows with the same arguments explored in Claim 4.2.



Claim 6.3. ( Proof of (F3 )) There exists r > 0 such that
(N − 2)ψ(u) > N Φ(u),

for

0 < ||u|| < r.

Proof. See proof of Claim 4.3



Claim 6.4. ( Proof of (F4 )) Let (uk ) be a sequence in H 1 (RN ) with Φ(uk ) ≥ 0
for all k ∈ N. If (J(uk )) is bounded, we have that (uk ) is also bounded. Moreover,
if J(uk ) → 0, then ||uk || → 0.
Proof. An immediate consequence of J.

Claim 6.5. ( Proof of (F5 )) If (uk ) is weakly convergent to u in Hrad
(RN ), then

lim sup Φ(uk ) ≤ Φ(u).
k→∞

Proof. See proof of Claim 4.5.

Claim 6.6. ( Proof of (F6 )) Se (uk ) is weakly convergent to u in H 1 (RN ), then
ψ(u) ≤ lim inf ψ(uk ).
k→+∞

Proof. See proof of Claim 4.6.

Claim 6.7. The functional I3 verifies the equality below
inf I3 (w) = inf I3 (w).

w∈P

w∈P +

Proof. See proof of Claim 4.7



From the above analysis, we can deduce that the functional I3 verifies the conditions of Theorem 1.1. From this, there is u0 ∈ H 1 (RN ) such that
0 ∈ ∂I3 (u0 ) and I3 (u0 ) = inf I3 (w) > 0.
w∈P

As J is C 1 (H 1 (RN ), R), we have
J ′ (u0 ) ∈ ∂Φ(u0 ).
On the other hand, as
∀u ∈ H 1 (RN )

Φ(u) = Φ1 (u) + Φ2 (u),
with
Φ1 (u) =

Z

F (u) dx

and Φ2 (u) =

RN

1
2

Z

|u|2 dx,

RN

it follows that
J ′ (u0 ) + Φ′2 (u0 ) ∈ ∂Φ1 (u0 ).

(6.17)

Here, we have used that Φ2 ∈ C 1 (H 1 (RN ), R).
By using well known result found in [6], we know that
∂Φ1 (u0 ) ⊂ [f (u0 ), f (u0 )].
This combined with (6.17) guarantee the existence of a mensurable function ρ :
RN → R verifying
(6.18)

ρ(x) ∈ [f (u0 (x)), f (u0 (x))],

a.e. in RN ,

such that u0 is a weak solution of the problem
−∆u0 + u0 = ρ,
p+1

in RN .
2, q+1
q

By (6.18), ρ ∈ Llocp (RN ), then the elliptic regularity gives u0 ∈ Wloc
H 1 (RN ), showing the u0 is a nontrivial solution of (6.16).
