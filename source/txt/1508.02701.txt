NEGATIVE ENERGY BLOWUP RESULTS FOR THE FOCUSING
HARTREE HIERARCHY VIA IDENTITIES OF VIRIAL AND
LOCALIZED VIRIAL TYPE
AYNUR BULUT
Abstract. We establish virial and localized virial identities for solutions to
the Hartree hierarchy, an infinite system of partial differential equations which
arises in mathematical modeling of many body quantum systems. As an application, we use arguments originally developed in the study of the nonlinear
Schrödinger equation (see work of Zakharov, Glassey, and Ogawa–Tsutsumi)
to show that certain classes of negative energy solutions must blow up in finite
time.
The most delicate case of this analysis is the proof of negative energy blowup
without the assumption of finite variance; in this case, we make use of the
localized virial estimates, combined with the quantum de Finetti theorem of
Hudson and Moody and several algebraic identities adapted to our particular
setting. Application of a carefully chosen truncation lemma then allows for
the additional terms produced in the localization argument to be controlled.

1. Introduction
d

Fix d ≥ 2, and let V ∈ S(R ; R) be a smooth bounded potential in the Schwartz
space with even symmetry. In this paper, we study an infinite system of coupled
PDEs, often referred to as the Hartree hierarchy, which arises in the study of manybody quantum mechanics. This hierarchy describes the evolution of a sequence
(γ (k) )k≥1 with each γ (k) mapping Rdk × Rdk into C satisfying symmetry properties
matching those of the factorized profiles
γ (k) (x1 , x2 , · · · , xk , x′1 , x′2 , · · · , x′k ) = φ(x1 ) · · · φ(xk )φ(x′1 ) · · · φ(x′k )

for x1 , · · · , xk , x′1 , · · · , x′k ∈ Rd . We begin by specifying our conventions for differentiation and the Fourier transform, which are motivated by the form (1.1). In
particular, for k ≥ 1 and γ (k) ∈ L2 (Rdk × Rdk ), we take the Fourier transform in
xi and x′i , i = 1, · · · , k to be defined by, respectively
Fxi [γ (k) ](x1 , · · · , xi−1 , ξi , xi+1 , · · · , xk , x′1 , · · · , x′k )

and x′i are vectors in Rd for 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
This hierarchy arises in the study of the mean field limit of quantum mechanical
systems, where the pairwise interactions between quantum particles are governed
by the potential V (see for instance [18]). When V is formally taken to be the
Dirac measure δ(x), (1.2) becomes the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) hierarchy (in fact,
derivations along these lines can be made precise by considering a sequence of
approximating potentials VN , scaled appropriately as N → ∞; see, e.g. [9, 10, 16]
as well as [5, 7, 2, 3, 4, 15, 18] and the references cited therein).
The equation (1.2) enjoys a special relationship with the classical Hartree equation (that is, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with nonlocal convolution-type

equation
i∂t φ + ∆φ = µ(V ∗ |φ|2 )φ

(1.4)

with φ(0) = φ0 . In accordance with the usual nomenclature for (1.4) (and, more
generally, nonlinear Schrödinger equations), we will say that the hierarchy (1.2)
has defocusing nonlinearity when µ = 1, and focusing nonlinearity when µ = −1.
Similarly, the GP hierarchy has an analogous relationship with the cubic nonlinear
Schrödinger equation.
The present work is motivated by work of Chen, Pavlovic, and Tzirakis [5],
in which the authors establish mass conservation, energy conservation, and virial
identities for the GP hierarchy, and use these along to establish negative energy
blowup for finite variance initial data in that setting. Our analysis also relies on a
class of ideas surrounding the quantum de Finetti theorem of Hudson and Moody
[13], which has recently become a key tool in the analysis of hierarchies of the form
(1.2) – for an overview of such arguments, we refer to work of Lewin, Nam and
Rougerie [14] in the setting of the Hartree hierarchy, and works of Chen, Hainzl,
Pavlovic and Seringer [3, 4] for the GP hierarchy (where the quantum de Finetti
result played a key role in the proof of unconditional uniqueness for the hierarchy),
as well as the references cited in these works.
In this paper, we continue this line of study to establish a class of identities for
solutions to (1.2) which hold in analogy to the usual virial identities for nonlinear
Schrödinger equations. As an application of these ideas, we invoke the classical
argument of Glassey [11] to show that certain classes of negative energy solutions
must blow up in finite time, under the assumption of initially finite variance (see
Theorem 1.1 below). Moreover, under certain hypotheses on the potential V , we
establish negative energy blowup in the absence of the finite variance assumption.
This result is in the spirit of a result due to Ogawa and Tsutsumi [17] for the
nonlinear Schrödinger equation; see also work of Hirata [12] for a related result for
the Hartree equation. The main tool (and the main novelty of the present work) is
the derivation of a class of localized virial identities, the derivation of which in the
hierarchy setting produces a number of additional terms which must be dealt with
carefully.

We now prepare some notation to state our main results. Throughout the paper,
we will make frequent use of the trace operator, given for f : Rdk × Rdk → C by
Z
Tr (f ) := f (x, x)dx.

with x = (x1 , · · · , xk ) ∈ Rdk as before, as well as the partial trace in the last
variable,
Z
Tr k (f )(x1 , · · · , xk−1 , x′1 , · · · , x′k−1 ) := f (x, x)dxk
for k ≥ 1, and use the notational convention

γ (k) (t, x, x′ ) = γ (k) (x, x′ ),

t ∈ I,

omitting explicit specification of the time variable when there is no potential for
confusion.
We say that a solution (γ (k) )k≥1 to (1.2) (in the sense of the integral Duhamel
formulation) is “(A)–(D)-admissible” if it satisfies the following properties for all
k ∈ N:
(A) γ (k) ∈ C(I; H 2 (Rdk × Rdk )), Tr γ (k) = 1, and γ (k)  0, in the sense that

 Z
γ (k) (x, ·)ψ(x)dx
ψ,
≥ 0 for every ψ ∈ L2 ,
Rd

L2x′ (Rdk )

(B) γ (k) is symmetric with respect to permutations of the variables x and permutations of the variables x′ : for every σ ∈ Sk let Pσ denote the map
(x1 , x2 , · · · , xk ) 7→ (xσ(1) , xσ(2) , · · · , xσ(k) ). Then for every σ, τ ∈ Sk , one
has
γ (k) (t, x, x′ ) = γ (k) (t, Pσ (x), Pτ (x′ )).
(C) γ (k) is Hermitian:
γ (k) (t, x, x′ ) = γ (k) (t, x′ , x),
and,
(D) γ (k) is admissible:
γ (k) (t) = Tr k+1 (γ (k+1) (t)), that is,
Z
γ (k) (t, x, x′ ) = γ (k+1) (t, x, xk+1 , x′ , xk+1 )dxk+1 .

As we note in Section 2 below, the properties (A)–(D) are preserved under the
(k)
evolution—that is, if the sequence of initial data (γ0 )k≥1 satisfies (A)–(D) as
′
functions of x and x , then the corresponding solution is (A)–(D)-admissible. For
treatment of this invariance in the case of the Gross–Pitaevskii hierarchy, see Section
5 and Appendix B in [8]; we remark that the arguments for (1.2) are similar.
As we will see below, (A)–(D)-admissible solutions to (1.2) obey conservation of
(1)
two relevant quantities: the mass Tr (γ0 (t)), and the energy

These conserved quantities play a fundamental role in the analysis of long-time
and global properties of the evolution (see also [5, 7] for related results concerning
the GP hierarchy). Indeed, when the sign µ of the nonlinearity is positive, the conserved energy E(t) gives uniform-in-time control over each of its component terms;
in a variety of settings, this information is sufficient to conclude that solutions exist globally in time. On the other hand, no such control is guaranteed when µ is
negative, and, as shown in the work of Zakharov [19] and Glassey [11], an initial
negative value for the energy leads to finite-time blowup results for the nonlinear
Schrödinger equation under an assumption of initially finite variance (see also [1]
for a comprehensive treatment of these and related results).
Our first theorem is a variant of Glassey’s argument, adapted to the hierarchy
(1.2). To state this result, we will make use of the quantity
V1 (t) = Tr (|x|2 γ (1) (t)).
for solutions (γ (k) )k≥1 defined on a time interval I ⊂ R, and t ∈ I.
Theorem 1.1. Fix d ≥ 2, µ = −1 and suppose that V ∈ S(Rd ; R) is a bounded
even function such that
1
V + x · ∇V ≤ 0.
2
Let (γ (k) )k≥1 be an (A)–(D)-admissible solution to (1.2) defined on an interval
I ⊂ R with
V1 (0) < ∞

and

E(0) < 0.

Then I is bounded.
As we remarked above, a similar result was established for the GP hierarchy in
[5]; see also another instance of a related argument in [4]. In view of Theorem 1.1,
it is natural to consider whether the finite variance condition V1 (0) < ∞ can be
relaxed. For the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, a partial result in this direction
has been given by Ogawa and Tsutsumi [17] (see also work of Hirata [12] for a
related result concerning certain instances of the Hartree equation). In our setting,
we prove the following theorem:
Theorem 1.2. Fix µ = −1 and suppose that V ∈ S(Rd ; R) is a bounded even
function with V ≥ 0,
1
V + x · ∇V ≤ 0,

as R → ∞, and

as R → ∞.
Then, if (γ (k) )k≥1 is any (A)–(D)-admissible solution to (1.2) defined on an in(1)
(1)
terval I ⊂ R with γ0 (x, x′ ) radial in x and x′ (in the sense that γ0 (x, x′ ) =

γ0 (|x|, |x′ |)) and γ0 (x, y, x′ , y ′ ) radial in each of x, x′ , y and y ′ , then the condition
E(0) < 0
implies I is bounded, where E(t) is as defined in (1.5).
As we briefly described above, the proof of Theorem 1.2 is based on a localized
form of the virial identities used to prove Theorem 1.1. We establish these identities
in Proposition 5.2, with some additional algebraic tools useful in our arguments in
the subsequent Lemma 5.3 and Lemma 6.1.
The analysis leading to the proof of this result consists in the application of
essentially three main ingredients:
(1) the formulation of an appropriate form of a radial truncation lemma, Lemma
6.2; this truncation lemma allows for the additional terms appearing in the
localized identities to be controlled by the conserved energy,
(2) the quantum de Finetti theorem of [13] (see [14], [3, 4], and the references cited therein, for earlier applications of this theorem in the hierarchy
context); this provides the algebraic structure necessary to estimate the
“decoupled” nonlinearity via standard convolution estimates, and
(3) decay properties of the functions γ (k) arising from the Strauss lemma, ensured by our radiality assumption.
We conclude this introduction with a brief outline of the rest of the paper.
In Sections 2 and 3, we establish some further notational conventions, establish
conservation of mass and energy for (1.2) (note that similar conservation laws were
obtained by Chen, Pavlovic and Tzirakis in [5] for the related Gross-Pitaevskii
hierarchy). Section 4 is then devoted to the derivation of the relevant virial and
localized virial identities which form the basis of our subsequent analysis. The
proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 are then given in Section 5. Some auxiliary
technical results are established in the appendices.

2. Preliminaries
In the rest of this paper, we let V ∈ S(Rd ; R) be a smooth bounded Schwartzclass potential with even symmetry. We begin by collecting some preliminary results
concerning (1.2). The first of these is a result expressing local well-posedness of
the evolution in an appropriate function space. Following [6, 7] (see also the references cited in these works for related background), the relevant function spaces
are parametrized both by a regularity parameter (often denoted α, which we will
take at the level α = 1 in the discussion below) and a scaling parameter ξ. The
interplay between these parameters plays a key role in the analysis.
For (γ (k) )k≥1 such that γ (k) : Rdk × Rdk → C for k ≥ 1, and ξ ∈ (0, ∞), define

Proposition 2.1. Suppose that (γ0 )k≥1 is a sequence of functions with γ0 :
(k)
Rdk × Rdk → C for k ≥ 1 which satisfies conditions (A)–(D). If (γ0 ) ∈ Hξ1 for
some ξ > 0, then for every ξ ′ sufficiently small there exists T > 0 so that (1.2)
(k)

with initial data (γ0 ) has a unique solution in L∞
t ([0, T ]; Hξ ′ ) ∩ Lt ([0, T ]; Hξ ′ ).
Moreover, the solution satisfies conditions (A)–(D) as well.
The proof of Proposition 2.1 is analogous to the argument given in [6] (see also
[7]), and is based on a fixed point argument proceeding from the integral form
of the equation. The preservation of the conditions (A)–(D) also follows from this
argument and carries over identically; note that in the case of the positivity property
(A) this is a delicate matter, and relies on the quantum de Finetti and uniqueness
results for the relevant hierarchy (as we noted earlier, see [8] for the case of the GP
hierarchy).
We next recall several implications of the admissibility conditions (A)–(D), which
express symmetry properties of the initial data (and, in view of the uniqueness claim
above, of solutions). We begin with an identity from [5] (see, e.g. (4.10)–(4.11) in
[5]): fix d ≥ 1 and let A : (x1 , x′1 ) 7→ A(x1 , x′1 ) ∈ S(Rd × Rd ) be given; then
Tr (∆x1 A) = Tr (∆x′1 A) = Tr (−∇x1 · ∇x′1 A).

(2.1)

We also recall, as a basic consequence of the Hermitian property of (A)–(D)admissible solutions, for 1 ≤ i ≤ d we have the identities
(∂xi γ (1) )(x, x) = (∂x′i γ (1) )(x, x),

(2.2)

(∂xi ∂xj γ (1) )(x, x) = (∂x′i ∂x′j γ (1) )(x, x),

(2.3)

(∂xi ∂x′j γ (1) )(x, x) = (∂x′i ∂xj γ (1) )(x, x),

(2.4)

and

for x ∈ Rd . As a consequence, the identities
(∇x1 γ (1) )(x, x) = ∇x1 [γ (1) (x′1 , x1 )]x1 =x′1 =x = (∇x′1 γ (1) )(x, x)

(2.5)

(∆x1 γ (1) )(x, x) = ∆x1 [γ (1) (x′1 , x1 )]|x1 =x′1 =x = (∆x′1 γ (1) )(x, x)

(2.6)

and

also hold.
In this context, we several times shall use the observation that (γ (k) )  0 and
(k)
(γ ) Hermitian together imply
γ (1) (x, x) ≥ 0

and γ (2) (x, y, x, y) ≥ 0

(2.7)

for all x, y ∈ Rd .
Associated to these observations, in the proof of Theorem 1.3, we will make
essential use of the quantum de Finetti theorem of Hudson and Moody [13], as
formulated in [14] and [3]. This result was used by Chen, Hainzl, Pavlović, and
Seiringer in [3] and [4] as an essential tool for studying uniqueness of solutions to
the GP hierarchy. Applying the theorem (e.g. as stated in [3, Theorem 2.1]) with
the base Hilbert space taken as H = L2rad ⊂ L2 (Rd ), the subspace of L2 consisting

8

of radial functions, this gives the existence of a Borel measure µ on L2rad , supported
on {f ∈ L2rad : kf kL2 = 1}, with µ(L2rad ) = 1, and such that both

3. A momentum identity and mass conservation
In this section, we collect two preliminary conservation properties of (1.2). The
first is the identification of a quantity analogous to the momentum in a nonlinear
Schrödinger equation and which obeys a pointwise conservation law, at least when
the solution is smooth. A similar expression was identified for the GP hierarchy in
[5].
Lemma 3.1. Let (γ (k) )k≥1 be a smooth (A)–(D)-admissible solution to (1.2) and
define P : R × Rd → Cd by
Z
′
(1) (ξ, ξ ′ )dξdξ ′
P (t, x) := eix·(ξ−ξ ) (ξ + ξ ′ )γd
(3.1)
for t ∈ R and x ∈ Rd . We then have

∂t γ (1) (t, x, x) + divx P (t, x) = 0

for all (t, x) ∈ R × Rd .
Proof. Proceeding by direct computation, note that after taking the Fourier transform and its inverse (and using that (γ (k) ) solves (1.2)) we obtain
Z

(1) (ξ, ξ ′ )dξdξ ′
∂t γ (1) (x, x) = eix·(ξ−ξ ) ∂t γd

Now, writing ∂xi eix·(ξ−ξ ) = i(ξi − ξi′ )eix·(ξ−ξ ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ d, we get

as desired.



Using this result, we next establish conservation of mass for the hierarchy, that
is, we show that the quantity Tr (γ (1) ) remains invariant under the evolution.
Proposition 3.2 (Conservation of mass for (1.2)). Suppose that (γ (k) )k≥1 is an
(A)–(D)-admissible solution to the Hartree hierarchy (1.2). Then we have
∂t Tr (γ (1) (t)) = 0.

Proof. As a consequence of the local theory stated above and standard approximation arguments, it suffices to show the result under the assumption that γ (k) ∈
Ct (I; S(Rdk × Rdk )) for all k ≥ 1. By (1.2), we get

4. Conservation of Energy
We now establish a conservation law for the energy functional E(t).
Proposition 4.1 (Conservation of energy for (1.2)). Suppose that (γ (k) )k≥1 is an
(A)–(D)-admissible solution to the Hartree hierarchy (1.2). Then
∂t E(t) = 0,
where E(t) denotes the quantity defined in (1.5).
Proof. As in the proof of Proposition 2.3, by standard approximation arguments it
suffices to show the result when each γ (k) belongs to the class Ct (I; S(Rdk × Rdk )).
Recalling the definition of E(t), and using that the sequence (γ (k) ) is a solution to
the hierarchy (1.2), we have

the Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy.
5. Virial and localized virial identities
We next establish suitable forms of virial identities (and their localizations) for
the hierarchy (1.2). These will ultimately be a key tool used to prove the finite-time
blow-up results expressed in Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2. The general procedure
for the derivations follows a classical approach in analogy to similar results for the
nonlinear Schrödinger equation; we note that a particularly relevant case of the
analysis was performed in [5] for the related GP hierarchy.
We begin with the relevant virial identity.
Proposition 5.1 (Virial identity for (1.2)). Let (γ (k) )k≥1 be an (A)–(D)-admissible
solution to (1.2). Then we have the identity
Z
∂tt Tr (|x|2 γ (1) ) = 8 Tr (−∆x1 γ (1) ) − 4µ γ (2) (x, y, x, y)x · (∇V )(x − y)dxdy.
Proof. As we remarked in our arguments in the previous section, it suffices to show
the result under the assumption that γ (k) is in Ct ([0, T ]; S(Rdk × Rdk )) for all
k ≥ 1, as a consequence of the local well-posedness theory. Invoking Lemma 3.1
and integrating by parts, we write
Z
∂tt Tr (|x|2 γ (1) ) = |x|2 ∂tt γ(x, x)dx
Z
= − |x|2 divx ∂t P dx
Z
= 2 x · ∂t P dx.
Next, expanding the definition of P (t, x) and using that (γ (k) )k≥1 solve (1.2), this
last expression becomes

Φ(Λ) := (x − z) · ξ − (x − z ′ ) · ξ ′ + (z − y − w) · q − (z − y ′ − w) · q ′ .
By the Fubini theorem, an approximation and limiting argument as before (first
integrating in the variables ξ and z, resulting in restriction to the set where z = x,
and then integrating in the variables ξ ′ and z ′ , resulting in restriction to the set
where z ′ = x) shows that this is equal to

To conclude this section, we include a brief lemma showing how the first term
on the right side of the identity in Proposition 5.2 can be evaluated further, using
the Hermitian property of (A)–(D)-admissible solutions.
Lemma 5.3. Fix φ ∈ Cc∞ , and let (γ (k) )k≥1 be an (A)–(D)-admissible solution to

Proof. We may again assume that γ (k) is smooth for all k. Since (γ (k) ) is Hermitian
and γ (k)  0, we may find sequences (λℓ ) and (gℓ ) such that

6. Proofs of the main theorems: negative energy blow-up solutions
In this section, we give the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2, our results on
negative energy finite-time blowup for (1.2). We begin with the proof of Theorem
1.1, for which our arguments are in the spirit of the classical Glassey argument (see
also [5] for a similar application of this argument to negative-energy blowup for the
Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy).

16

AYNUR BULUT

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Define V1 (t) = Tr (|x|2 γ (1) (t)). Since (γ (k) ) is Hermitian
with γ (k)  0, we may find λj ≥ 0 and ψj : Rd → C such that
∞ Z
X
V1 (t) =
|x|2 λj |ψ(x)|2 dx ≥ 0.
j=1

Suppose for contradiction that the claim fails. Then (γ (k) )k≥1 is a global solution,
and thus V1 (t) is defined for all t ∈ R with V (t) ≥ 0 everywhere. Recall that
Proposition 5.1 implies the bound
Z
∂tt V1 (t) = 8 Tr (−∆x1 γ (1) ) + 4 γ (2) (x, y, x, y)x · (∇V )(x − y)dxdy
Z
= 16E(t) + 4 γ (2) (x, y, x, y)V (x − y)dydx
Z
+ 4 γ (2) (x, y, x, y)x · (∇V )(x − y)dydx
Z
= 16E(t) + 4 γ (2) (x, y, x, y)V (x − y)dydx
Z
+ 2 γ (2) (x, y, x, y)(x − y) · (∇V )(x − y)dydx
1
= 16E(t) + 4[(V + x · (∇V )) ∗ γ (2) (x, ·, x, ·)](x)
2
≤ 16E(t)

where we have used the identity
Z
γ (2) (x, y, x, y)x · (∇V )(x − y)dydx
Z
= − γ (2) (x, y, x, y)y · (∇V )(x − y)dydx,

(6.1)

which is a consequence of the symmetry property of (γ (k) ) and the assumption that
V is even.
However, t 7→ E(t) is constant by Proposition 4.1, the conservation of energy.
In particular, we obtain V1 (t) < 0 for |t| is sufficiently large, which contradicts the
positivity of V1 . Thus, we conclude that (γ (k) ) cannot be globally defined.

We now turn to the proof of Theorem 1.2. For these arguments, we make use
of the truncated virial identity established in Proposition 5.2. We begin with a
variant of this proposition which is adapted to an assumption of radial symmetry
and to the particular rescaled cutoff we wish to use.
Fix ρ R∈ Cc2 (R) such that ρ(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ R, supp (ρ) ⊂ (1, 3) with ρ > 0 on
ρ(x)dx = 1, ρ′ ≥ 0 on (1, 23 ), and ρ(x) = ρ(4 − x) for all x ∈ R. Define
( 54 , 11
4 ),
ψ : [0, ∞) → R by
Z x
(x − y)ρ(y)dy
ψ(x) = x −

for x ≥ 0, and for each R > 0 let ψR be given by

We now continue with the proof of Theorem 1.2. The general pattern of argument

earlier application of the method to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with Hartree
nonlinearity, as well as a textbook treatment in [1, Theorem 6.5.10].

2
2.2, and define ψR by ψR (x) = Rψ( |x|
R ) as in Lemma 6.1. Applying Lemma 6.1
and using (1.6) and (2.7) to see that the third term of the resulting bound is nonpositive, we bound ∂tt Tr (ψR γ (1) ) by

In this brief appendix we give the proofs of Lemma 5.1 and Lemma 5.2. These
lemmas are used in the proof of Theorem 1.2. For convenience,
we recall that

and

We begin with the proof of Lemma 6.1.
ψR (x) = Rψ(

for x ∈ Rd .

Proof of Lemma 6.1. Let R > 0 be given. As in our earlier results, there is no
loss of generality (in view of the local theory described in Section 2) in assuming
γ (k) ∈ Ct (I; S(Rdk × Rdk )) for all k ≥ 1. Applying Proposition 5.2 and Lemma 5.3,
we obtain (since we have taken µ = −1)
∂tt Tr (ψR γ (1) )

which, in a similar manner to the related identity (6.1) used in the proof of Theorem
1.1, follows from the symmetry properties of (A)–(D)-admissible solutions.

We now turn to the proof of Lemma 6.2, which is an estimate for the quantity
a(x, y) defined in (6.3).
Rt
Proof of Lemma 6.2. Since ψ ′ (t) = 1 − 0 ρ(s)ds for t ≥ 0, we may define
f (t) := (x + t(y − x))FR (|x + t(y − x)|)

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, and observe that with this notation the left side of (6.5) becomes
|f (1) − f (0)|. To estimate this quantity, we write
Z 1

(A.4)

Now, since |x + s(y − x)| ≤ max{|x|, |y|} holds for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1, it follows from the
observation that FR is increasing on [0, ∞) that
FR (|x + s(y − x)|) ≤ max{FR (|x|), FR (|y|)} ≤ FR (|x|) + FR (|y|).

(A.5)

On the other hand, explicit computation gives

To estimate the supremum, We now consider three cases depending on the sizes

Case 1: Suppose first that |x|2 /R < 23 and |y|2 /R < 23 . Invoking once again
|x + s(y − x)| ≤ max{|x|, |y|} for s ∈ [0, 1], we then have

Case 2: We now consider the case when either (i) |x|2 /R < 23 and |y|2 /R ≥ 23 ; or
(ii) |x|2 /R ≥ 32 and |y|2 /R < 32 . Since the estimate obtained is symmetric in x and
y, we may assume that we are in case (i) without any loss of generality. In this
setting, |x + s(y − x)| ≤ max{|x|, |y|} = |y| for s ∈ [0, 1] gives

which again leads to the desired inequality.

Case 3: Suppose now that |x|2 /R ≥ 23 and |y|2 /R ≥ 23 . In this case we note
that, in view of the assumption |x − y| ≤ R1/2 , the condition |x|2 /R ≥ 10 implies
ρ(|x + s(y − x)|2 /R) = 0 for all 0 ≤ s ≤ 1. Indeed, if |x|2 /R ≥ 10, we have

|x + s(y − x)| ≥ |x| − |y − x| ≥ ( 10 − 1)R1/2

and the desired conclusion follows from the hypothesis supp ρ ⊂ (1, 3).
It follows that whenever

This again leads to the desired estimate.

Since these three cases cover all possible values of |x| and |y|, this completes the
