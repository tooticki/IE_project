Abstract. The 2-Fano varieties, defined by De Jong and Starr, satisfy some higher
dimensional analogous properties of Fano varieties. We propose a definition of (weak)
k-Fano variety and conjecture the polyhedrality of the cone of pseudoeffective k -cycles
for those varieties in analogy with the case k = 1. Then, we calculate some Betti
numbers of a large class of k-Fano varieties to prove some special case of the conjecture.
In particular, the conjecture is true for all 2-Fano varieties of index â‰¥ n âˆ’ 2, and also
we complete the classification of weak 2-Fano varieties answering Questions 39 and 41
in [AC13].

1. Introduction
The study of cones of curves or divisors on smooth complex projective varieties X is
a classical subject in Algebraic Geometry and is still an active research topic. However,
little is known when we pass to higher dimensions. For example it is a classical result
that the cone of nef divisors is contained in the cone of pseudoeffective divisors, but in
general Nef k (X) âŠ† Eff k (X) is not true. These phenomena can appear only if dim X â‰¥ 4
and very few examples are known. In particular [DELV11] gives two examples of such
varieties. Furthermore [Ott15] proves that if X is the variety of lines of a very general
cubic fourfold in P5 , then the cone of pseudoeffective 2-cycles on X is strictly contained
in the cone of nef 2-cycles.
The central subject of this paper will be the k-Fano varieties.
Definition 1.1. A smooth Fano variety X is k-Fano if the sth Chern character chs (X) is
positive (see Definition 2.3) for 1 â‰¤ s â‰¤ k, and weak k-Fano for k > 1 if X is (k âˆ’ 1)-Fano
and chk (X) is nef.
There is a large interest in studying varieties with positive Chern characters. For
example varieties with positive ch1 (X) are Fano, hence uniruled, that is there is a rational
curve through a general point. Fano varieties with positive second Chern character
were introduced by J. de Jong and J. Starr in [dJS06, dJS07]. They proved a (higher
dimensional) analogue of this result: weak 2-Fano varieties of pseudo-index at least 3
have a rational surface through a general point. Furthermore if X is weak 3-Fano then
there is a rational threefold through a general point of X (under some hypothesis on
the polarized minimal family of rational curves through a general point of X, [AC12,
Theorem 1.5(3)]).

Another problem concerns how the geometry of the cones of pseudoeffective k-cycles
depends on the positivity of the Chern characters chs (X). Moriâ€™s Cone Theorem resolves
this problem for k = 1: the positivity of ch1 (X) implies the polyhedrality of the cone of
pseudoeffective 1-cycles and the extremal rays are spanned by classes of rational curves.
By Kleimanâ€™s Theorem, a variety with positive ch1 (X) is just a Fano variety, that is
with c1 (X) ample, but this is not enough, in general, for the polyhedrality of cones of
pseudoeffective k-cycles for k > 1: Tschinkel showed a Fano variety where Eff 2 (X) has
infinitely many extremal rays. Therefore more positivity is needed in order to obtain
polyhedrality of cones of pseudoeffective k-cycles for k > 1.
In this paper we investigate a possible way of generalizing Moriâ€™s result:
Conjecture 1.2. If X is k-Fano, then Eff k (X) is a polyhedral cone.
The computing of the fourth Betti number is enough to show the polyhedrality of some
of the cones of 2-cycles for a large class of varieties: complete intersections in weighted
projective spaces, rational homogeneous varieties and most complete intersections in
them, etc. This allows us to test the conjecture for many 2-Fano varieties, and in particular we prove that it holds for del Pezzo and Mukai varieties. Using the classification
of Araujo-Castravet, we also prove the following.
Theorem 1.3. Let X be a n-dimensional 2-Fano variety with iX â‰¥ n âˆ’ 2. Then Eff 2 (X)
is polyhedral. Also, Eff 3 (X) is polyhedral with the possible exception of the complete
intersection of type (2, 2) in P8 .
In particular, Conjecture 1.2 is true for any n-dimensional k-Fano variety with iX â‰¥
n âˆ’ 2 and k = 2, 3.
Let X be a complete intersection in G(2, 5) or G(2, 6) with two hyperplanes under the
PlÃ¼cker embedding. Araujo and Castravet proved that X is not 2-Fano, but questioned
if it is weak 2-Fano [AC13, Proposition 32 and Questions 39,41]. In [dA15, Corollary 5.1]
it is proved that a general such X is not 2-Fano by showing that there exists an effective
âˆ¨ , where i is the inclusion. In this circumstance we can
surface S such that [i(S)] = Ïƒ1,1
prove that all the smooth complete intersections of this type are not weak 2-Fano, and
this completes the classification given in [AC13, Theorem 3 and 4].
Theorem 1.4. Let Y = G(2, 5) or G(2, 6), let X be a smooth complete intersection of
type (1, 1) in Y under the PlÃ¼cker embedding. Then X is not weak 2-Fano.
These ideas can be improved in three very promising directions: to generalize
Tschinkelâ€™s example to higher dimensions, to prove the conjecture for some Fano 4-folds
of index 1, and to use minimal families of rational curves to prove the conjecture for
other 2-Fanoâ€™s.
I thank Angelo Lopez for all the support he has shown me since the beginning of this
work, and Gianluca Pacienza for his help. I also thank Carolina Araujo, Izzet Coskun
and Enrico Fatighenti for answering many of my questions.

Notation.
â€“ X is a variety of dimension n â‰¥ 4.
â€“ k is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ n âˆ’ 1.
â€“ Hi (X, G) and H i (X, G) are the singular homology and cohomology groups of X for
1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ 2n and coefficients in a group G.
â€“ bi (X) is the ith Betti number of X for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ 2n, that is the rank of Hi (X, Z) or of
H i (X, Z).
â€“ Zk (X) is the group of k-cycles with integer coefficients.
â€“ Ratk (X) is the group of k-cycles rationally equivalent to zero.
â€“ Ak (X) is L
the Chow group of k-cycles on X, that is Ak (X) = Zk (X)/Ratk (X).
â€“ Aâˆ— (X) = nk=0 Ak (X) is the Chow ring of X.
â€“ Algk (X) is the group of k-cycles algebraically equivalent to zero.
â€“ Homk (X) is the group of k-cycles homologically equivalent to zero, that is the kernel
of the cycle map cl : Zk (X) â†’ H2k (X, Z).
â€“ Numk (X) is the group of cycles numerically equivalent to zero, that is the group of
cycles Î± âˆˆ Zk (X) such that P Â· cl(Î±) = 0 for all polynomials P in Chern classes of
vector bundles on X.
â€“ Nk (X) is the quotient group Zk (X)/Numk (X), and Nk (X)R := Nk (X) âŠ— R.
â€“ Eff k (X) âŠ† Nk (X)R is the cone generated by numerical classes of effective k-cycles.
â€“ Let s â‰¥ 1 be an integer. The sth Chern character of X, chs (X), is the homogeneous
part of degree s of the total Chern character of X. For example, if ci (X) are the
Chern classes of X, then ch1 (X) = c1 (X), ch2 (X) = 12 (c21 (X) âˆ’ 2c2 (X)), ch3 (X) =
1 3
6 (c1 (X) âˆ’ 4c1 (X)c2 (X) + 3c3 (X))
We will often use the following well-known facts:
Remark 2.1. There is a chain of inclusions [Ful84, p.374]
Ratk (X) âŠ† Algk (X) âŠ† Homk (X) âŠ† Numk (X) âŠ† Zk (X)
that gives rise to a diagram

We set
(2.2)

Ï€k,R : Zk (X)/Homk (X) âŠ— R Ö‰ Nk (X)R

the tensor product of Ï€k and idR .
Remark 2.2. By linearity of the intersection product, Nk (X) is torsion free. When X is
smooth, the intersection product gives a perfect pairing [Ful84, Definition 19.1]
Nk (X)R âŠ— Nnâˆ’k (X)R â†’ R.
Definition 2.3. Let X be a smooth variety. A class Î± âˆˆ Nk (X)R is positive if Î± Â· Î² > 0
for every Î² âˆˆ Eff nâˆ’k (X)\{0}, and it is nef if Î± Â· Î² â‰¥ 0 for every Î² âˆˆ Eff nâˆ’k (X). The
cone generated by nef classes of k-cycles is Nef k (X).

Kleimanâ€™s criterion for amplitude [Laz04a, Theorem 1.4.29] states that the cone of
positive (n âˆ’ 1)-cycles is exactly the cone of numerical classes of ample divisors.
Lemma 2.4. Let X be a projective variety. Then
(1) If either rkAk (X) = 1 or b2k (X) = 1, then Eff k (X) is a half-line.
(2) If either rkAk (X) = 2 or b2k (X) = 2, then Eff k (X) is either a half-line or it is
spanned by two extremal rays.
Proof. In the first case, by diagram (2.1), we have a surjection Z Ö‰ Nk (X) and, as
Nk (X) is torsion-free, it must be Nk (X) âˆ¼
= Z. In the second case, again by diagram
(2.1), there is a surjection Z2 Ö‰ Nk (X) and then either Nk (X) âˆ¼
= Z or Nk (X) âˆ¼
= Z2 .
Since Eff k (X) generates Nk (X)R , it is either a half-line or it is spanned by two extremal
rays, depending on the rank of Nk (X)R .

Remark 2.5. In a general, a variety X with chk (X) positive may not be k-Fano. For
example, in [Mum79] Mumford found a smooth surface S of general type with ch2 (S) = 23 .
3. Cycles on Fano Varieties
We study here the pseudoeffective cones of k-cycles on some well-known classes of
Fano varieties.
3.1. Weighted projective spaces. Let P(w) be the weighted projective space where
w = (w0 , ..., wn ) âˆˆ Nn0 .
Proposition 3.1. Let X be a n-dimensional smooth complete intersection in a weighted
projective space. If k 6= n2 then b2k (X) = 1. In particular Eff k (X) is polyhedral.
Proof. Recall [Dim92, B13] that dim H 2i (P(w), Q) = 1 for every 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ dim P(w). By
Lefschetzâ€™s Hyperplane Theorem [Dim92, B22] we have that H 2k (X, Q) âˆ¼
= H 2k (P(w), Q)
n
for 2k < n, then b2k (X) = 1 for k < 2 . But b2nâˆ’2k (X) = b2k (X), then it follows that,
for k 6= n2 , b2k (X) = 1 and by Lemma 2.4 that Eff k (X) is a half-line.

Furthermore, if X is a k-Fano complete intersection in a projective space, then we can
solve Conjecture 1.2, even for weak Fano.
Theorem 3.2. Let X be a n-dimensional weak k-Fano complete intersection in a projective space. If 1 â‰¤ s â‰¤ k, then b2s (X) â‰¤ 2. In particular Eff s (X) is polyhedral.
Proof. Let X be of type (d1 , ..., dc ) in Pn+c , with di â‰¥ 2 for 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ c. By Proposition
3.1, we can suppose n even and s = n2 . We know from [AC13, 3.3.1] that ch n2 (X) is nef
n

n

if and only if d12 + ... + dc2 â‰¤ n + c + 1. Since n â‰¥ 4, it follows easily that c = 1. On the
n

other hand d12 â‰¤ n + 2 is possible only for d1 = 2, that is X is an n-dimensional quadric.

But bn (X) = 2 [Rei72, p.20] and the theorem follows by Lemma 2.4.
3.2. Rational homogeneous varieties. Let G be a reductive linear algebraic group
defined over C, B a Borel subgroup of G. We consider the set of simple B-positive
roots and denote by S the corresponding set of reflections in the Weyl group W . Then
the pair (W, S) is a Coxeter system in the sense of [Bou68, Chapitre IV, DÃ©finition 3].
Let l : W â†’ N0 be the length function relative to the system S of generators of W .

Furthermore we fix a subset Î˜ of S and denote by WÎ˜ the subgroup of W generated by
Î˜ and by P a subgroup of G associated to Î˜. Then the quotient G/P is a projective
variety, which is called a rational homogeneous variety. Any rational homogeneous variety
is a Fano variety [BH58], and the action of G on G/P by left multiplication is transitive.
Let w0 (respectively, wÎ¸ ) be the unique element of maximal length of W (respectively,
WÎ˜ ). A simple calculation shows that dim G/P = l(w0 ) âˆ’ l(wÎ¸ ). The element w0 and
wÎ¸ are characterized by the property [Bou68, Chapitre IV, Exercise 22]
(3.1)
(3.2)

l(ww0 ) = l(w0 ) âˆ’ l(w), âˆ€w âˆˆ W
l(wwÎ¸ ) = l(wÎ¸ ) âˆ’ l(w), âˆ€w âˆˆ WÎ˜

that imply immediately w02 = 1 and wÎ¸2 = 1. It follows that, for every w âˆˆ W
l(w0 w) = l((w0 w)âˆ’1 ) = l(wâˆ’1 w0âˆ’1 ) = l(wâˆ’1 w0 ) = l(w0 ) âˆ’ l(wâˆ’1 ) = l(w0 ) âˆ’ l(w).
Furthermore, set W Î˜ = {w âˆˆ W/l(ws) = l(w) + 1 âˆ€s âˆˆ Î˜}. We have, for every (w, wÌ„) âˆˆ
W Î˜ Ã— WÎ˜ ,
(3.3)

l(wwÌ„) = l(w) + l(wÌ„).

Proposition 3.3. Let X be a smooth n-dimensional variety and let G be an affine group
which acts transitively on X. Suppose that, for every k = 1, ..., n âˆ’ 1, there exists a finite
family of subvarieties {â„¦a }aâˆˆIk of dimension k such that
(1) h{[â„¦a ] /a âˆˆ Ik }i = H2k (X, Z) or Ak (X), and
(2) âˆ€a âˆˆ Ik , âˆƒb âˆˆ Inâˆ’k such that â„¦c Â· â„¦b = Î´a,c âˆ€c âˆˆ Ik .
Then Nef k (X) = Eff k (X) = Eff k (X) is polyhedral and simplicial.
Proof. We will suppose that the classes of the subvarieties {â„¦a }aâˆˆIk generate H2k (X, Z),
the case Ak (X) being similar. Let Ï‰a be the class of â„¦a in Nk (X). Let Î³ âˆˆ Nef k (X). By
Z (X)
(2.2) there is a class
P Î² âˆˆ k /Homk (X) âŠ— R âŠ†PH2k (X, R) suchPthat Ï€k,R (Î²) = Î³. By (1)
we have that Î² = aâˆˆIk Î³a [â„¦a ] and then Î³ = Î³a Ï€k ([â„¦a ]) = Î³a Ï‰a . Let a âˆˆ Ik and let
b âˆˆ Inâˆ’k be as in (2). Then Î³ Â· Ï‰b = Î³a â‰¥ 0 because Î³ is nef and Ï‰b is effective. Therefore
Î³ âˆˆ Eff k (X), then Nef k (X) âŠ† Eff k (X). Furthermore, from Ï‰c Â· Ï‰a = Î´a,c it follows that
the system {Ï‰a }aâˆˆIk is linearly independent. Let A a subvariety of X of dimension k,
and let B be a subvariety of X of codimension k. By Kleimanâ€™s Theorem [Kle74] there
is an element g âˆˆ G such that gA is rationally equivalent to A and generically transverse
to B. Then A Â· B = (gA) Â· B = #((gA) âˆ© B) â‰¥ 0, so Eff k (X) âŠ† Nef k (X). It is clear
that Nef k (X) is generated by {Ï‰a /a âˆˆ Ik }. Since Nef k (X) is closed and, as seen above,

generated by the Ï‰a , we get that Nef k (X) = Eff k (X) is polyhedral.
Proposition 3.4. Let X be a rational homogeneous variety. Then Nef k (X) = Eff k (X) =
Eff k (X) is polyhedral.
Proof. The description of the Chow ring of any rational homogeneous variety given in
[KÃ¶c91, Corollary(1.5)] is
M
Aâˆ— (X) =
Z[Xw ]
wâˆˆW Î˜

where Xw is the closure of the set BwP/P , with dimension l(w) [KÃ¶c91, Proposition(1.3)]. Let Ik = {w âˆˆ W Î˜ /l(w) = k}. Given w âˆˆ W Î˜ we claim that

w0 wwÎ¸ âˆˆ Idim Xâˆ’k . Indeed for all s âˆˆ Î˜, using (3.1) and (3.3), we have
l(w0 wwÎ¸ s) = l(w0 ) âˆ’ l(wwÎ¸ s) = l(w0 ) âˆ’ l(w) âˆ’ l(wÎ¸ s)
= l(w0 ) âˆ’ l(w) âˆ’ l(wÎ¸ ) + l(s) = l(w0 ) âˆ’ l(wwÎ¸ ) + 1 = l(w0 wwÎ¸ ) + 1
Similarly we can prove that l(w0 wwÎ¸ ) = l(w0 ) âˆ’ l(wÎ¸ ) âˆ’ l(w). Now given w âˆˆ Ik we have,
by [KÃ¶c91, Proposition(1.4)], that (2) of Proposition 3.3 is satisfied.

The pseudoeffective cone is also polyhedral in the case when the action of G on X has
finitely many orbits, see [FMSS95, Corollary p.2].
Among the rational homogeneous varieties, the following are particularly interesting.
Definition 3.5. Let r, s be two integers such that 2 â‰¤ r â‰¤ 2s . The Grassmann variety
of r-planes G(r, s) is the scheme of r-dimensional subspaces of Cs . Let Ï‰ be a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on Cs . The orthogonal Grassmannian of isotropic
r-planes OG(r, s) is the scheme of r-dimensional subspaces of Cs isotropic with respect
to Ï‰. The scheme OG(r, 2m) has two isomorphic connected components if r = m or
m âˆ’ 1. In these two cases, we will denote by OG+ (r, 2m) a connected component of
OG(r, 2m). Let Ïƒ be a non-degenerate symplectic bilinear form on Cs . The symplectic
Grassmannian of isotropic r-planes SG(r, s) is the scheme of r-dimensional subspaces of
Cs isotropic with respect to Ïƒ.
Remark 3.6. Let S be the universal subbundle of G(r, s). The PlÃ¼cker embedding is
the embedding given by the very ample line bundle âˆ§r Sâˆ¨ . The varieties OG(r, s) and
SG(r, s) can be embedded in G(r, s) as zero sections of, respectively, Sym2 Sâˆ¨ and âˆ§2 Sâˆ¨ .
3.2.1. Complete intersection of rational homogeneous varieties.
Remark 3.7. In [AC13, Proposition 34], it is stated that the smooth complete intersection
of OG+ (k, 2k) of type (2, 2) under the PlÃ¼cker embedding is a weak 2-Fano variety. This
should be read as (2).
Remark 3.8. We introduce the following notation: the group H 4 (G(r, s), Z) is generated by {Ïƒ2 , Ïƒ1,1 }, while H r(sâˆ’r)âˆ’4 (G(r, s), Z) is generated by a basis {Ïƒâˆ¨2 , Ïƒâˆ¨1,1 } dual to
{Ïƒ2 , Ïƒ1,1 }.
Remark 3.9. Let X be a smooth complete intersection of G(2, 5) of type (1, 1) under the
PlÃ¼cker embedding, let Z be the variety of lines through a general point of X. [AC13,
Example 30] says that Z has homology class equal to Ïƒâˆ¨2 + Ïƒâˆ¨1,1 . This should be read as
2Ïƒâˆ¨1,1 + Ïƒâˆ¨2 .

Remark 3.10. By Serre duality Ï‡(â„¦pG(2,5) (âˆ’m)) = Ï‡(â„¦G(2,5)

have Ï‡(â„¦G(2,5) (âˆ’m)) = Ï‡(â„¦G(2,5) (m)) = 0 because all the groups H p (G(2, 5), â„¦5G(2,5) (m))
are zero by [Sno86, Theorem p. 171(3)]. If m = 1, 2 we have Ï‡(â„¦2G(2,5) (âˆ’m)) =
Ï‡(â„¦4G(2,5) (m)) = 0, because âˆ€p â‰¥ 0 H p (G(2, 5), â„¦4G(2,5) (m)) = 0 by [Sno86, Theorem
p.p. 165,169]. It can easily be seen that Ï‡(â„¦G(2,5) ) = âˆ’1 and Ï‡(â„¦2G(2,5) ) = 2.

Lemma 3.11. Let X be a smooth complete intersection of type (1, 1) in a Grassmann
variety G(2, 5) under the PlÃ¼cker embedding. Then b4 (X) = 2.

Proof. By [Laz04b, Example 7.1.5], all rows of the Hodge Diamond of X, except the
middle row, are equal to those of the Hodge Diamond of G = G(2, 5). Since X is Fano,
h0,4 (X) = 0 then
(3.4)

Ï‡(â„¦X ) = âˆ’1 âˆ’ h1,3 (X)

(3.5)

Ï‡(â„¦2X ) = h2,2 (X)
b4 (X) = h2,2 (X) + 2h1,3 (X)

(3.6)

Note that by Serre duality and adjunction formula, for any integer m
h4 (OX (âˆ’m)) = h0 (OX (m) âŠ— OG (2 âˆ’ 5)|X ) = h0 (OX (m âˆ’ 3))
then by Kodaira Vanishing Theorem, Ï‡(OX (âˆ’1)) = Ï‡(OX (âˆ’2)) = 0. Take the Koszul
resolution of the sheaf OX
0 â†’ OG (âˆ’2) â†’ OG (âˆ’1)âŠ•2 â†’ OG â†’ OX â†’ 0

(3.7)
and tensor it by â„¦G
(3.8)

0 â†’ â„¦G (âˆ’2) â†’ â„¦G (âˆ’1)âŠ•2 â†’ â„¦G â†’ â„¦G|X â†’ 0

then, by Remark 3.10,
Ï‡(â„¦G|X ) = Ï‡(â„¦G (âˆ’2)) âˆ’ 2Ï‡(â„¦G (âˆ’1)) + Ï‡(â„¦G ) = âˆ’1
If we tensor (3.8) by OG (âˆ’1) we have
Ï‡(â„¦G|X (âˆ’1)) = Ï‡(â„¦G (âˆ’3)) âˆ’ 2Ï‡(â„¦G (âˆ’2)) + Ï‡(â„¦G (âˆ’1)) = 0
From the canonical sequence
0 â†’ OX (âˆ’1)âŠ•2 â†’ â„¦G|X â†’ â„¦X â†’ 0

(3.9)

we get Ï‡(â„¦X ) = Ï‡(â„¦G|X ) âˆ’ 2Ï‡(OX (âˆ’1)) = âˆ’1, then h1,3 (X) = 0 by (3.4). If, instead,
we tensor (3.7) by â„¦2G , that is
0 â†’ â„¦2G (âˆ’2) â†’ â„¦2G (âˆ’1)âŠ•2 â†’ â„¦2G â†’ â„¦2G|X â†’ 0
we get, by Remark 3.10,
Ï‡(â„¦2G|X ) = Ï‡(â„¦2G (âˆ’2)) âˆ’ 2Ï‡(â„¦2G (âˆ’1)) + Ï‡(â„¦2G ) = 2
By [Har77, Exercise II.5.16d] and (3.9) we get
Ï‡(â„¦2X ) = Ï‡(â„¦2G|X ) âˆ’ 2Ï‡(â„¦G|X (âˆ’1)) âˆ’ 3Ï‡(OX (âˆ’2)) = 2
Then by (3.5) and (3.6) we get h2,2 (X) = 2 and b4 (X) = 2.



Proposition 3.12. Let X be a n-dimensional weak 2-Fano complete intersection in a
Grassmann variety G(r, s) under the PlÃ¼cker embedding. Then, b4 (X) â‰¤ 2. In particular
Eff 2 (X) is polyhedral.

Proof. Assume that X is of type (d1 , ..., dc ). If n > 4, by [Laz04b, Theorem 7.1.1], we
4, using [AC13,
have b4 (X) = b4 (G(r, s)) â‰¤ 2 and we can apply Lemma 2.4. If n = P
Proposition 31], we have the following conditions: c = r(s âˆ’ r) âˆ’ 4 and ci=1 di â‰¤ s âˆ’ 1.
It is easy to see that this leads to the following cases
G(r, s)
Type

G(3, 6) (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

G(r, s) Type

(1, 3)
(2, 2)

None of them is weak 2-Fano by [AC13, Proposition 31 and 32(iv)], and Theorem
1.4.

Now we can prove Theorem 1.4.
Proof. Let OY (1) be the PlÃ¼cker line bundle and let
U âŠ† P(H 0 (Y, OY (1))) Ã— P(H 0 (Y, OY (1)))
be the open set parametrizing the smooth complete intersections in Y of bidegree (1, 1).
For t âˆˆ U , we denote by Xt the corresponding variety. Let X := {(x, t) âˆˆ Y Ã—U : x âˆˆ Xt }

H 4 (Xt , Z) is injective with torsion free cokernel by [Laz04b, Theorem 7.1.1 and Example
7.1.2], since b4 (Y ) = b4 (Xt ) = 2 by Lemma 3.11, we have that iâˆ— : H 4 (Y, Z) â†’ H 4 (Xt , Z)
is an isomorphism. By [dA15, Corollary 5.1], for a general t there exists a surface St such
that [i(St )] = Ïƒâˆ¨1,1 . Then there exist at , bt âˆˆ Z such that St = at Ïƒ2|Xt + bt Ïƒ1,1|Xt . Since
(Ïƒ2|Xt )2 = (Ïƒ22 ) Â· Ïƒ12 = (Ïƒ3,1 + Ïƒ2,2 ) Â· Ïƒ12 = 2
2
(Ïƒ1,1|Xt )2 = (Ïƒ1,1
) Â· Ïƒ12 = Ïƒ2,2 Â· Ïƒ12 = 1

Ïƒ2|Xt Â· Ïƒ1,1|Xt

= (Ïƒ2 Â· Ïƒ1,1 ) Â· Ïƒ12 = Ïƒ3,1 Â· Ïƒ12 = 1

Using the condition [i(St )] = Ïƒâˆ¨1,1 = Ïƒ2,2 , we have
0 = Ïƒ2,2 Â· Ïƒ2 = St Â· Ïƒ2|Xt = 2at + bt
1 = Ïƒ2,2 Â· Ïƒ1,1 = St Â· Ïƒ1,1|Xt = at + bt
then at = âˆ’1 and bt = 2. Let S := pr1âˆ— (âˆ’Ïƒ2 + 2Ïƒ1,1 ), then the surface S|Xt is such that
[St ] = [S|Xt ], and since we see that it is effective for a general t, hence it is effective for
all1 t. Let t âˆˆ U , then Xt is not weak 2-Fano since using [AC13, Proposition 32]
1This is a well-known fact for experts. A good reference is [Ott15, Proposition 3].

then b8 (Xt ) = b4 (Xt ) = 2. Now consider i : H (Y, Z) â†’ H (Xt , Z), where i : Xt â†’ Y

= (Ïƒ2,2 Â· Ïƒ1,1 ) Â· Ïƒ12 = (Ïƒ2,2 Â· (Ïƒ12 âˆ’ Ïƒ2 )) Â· Ïƒ12
= (Ïƒ2,2 Â· Ïƒ12 âˆ’ Ïƒ2,2 Â· Ïƒ2 ) Â· Ïƒ12 = (Ïƒ3,2 Â· Ïƒ1 âˆ’ Ïƒ4,2 ) Â· Ïƒ12
= (Ïƒ4,2 + Ïƒ3,3 âˆ’ Ïƒ4,2 ) Â· Ïƒ12 = (Ïƒ3,3 ) Â· Ïƒ12 = Ïƒ4,3 Â· Ïƒ1 = 1

Hence Ïƒ4|Xt and Ïƒ2,2|Xt are a basis of H 8 (Xt , Z), since that group is torsion free (see
Remark 3.13). Then [St ] = at Ïƒ4|Xt + bt Ïƒ2,2|Xt , where as before St is the surface described
in [dA15, Corollary 5.1] for general t âˆˆ U . Using the condition [i(St )] = Ïƒâˆ¨1,1 = Ïƒ3,3 , we
have
0 = Ïƒ3,3 Â· Ïƒ2 = St Â· Ïƒ2|Xt = at + bt
1 = Ïƒ3,3 Â· Ïƒ1,1 = St Â· Ïƒ1,1|Xt = bt
then at = âˆ’1 and bt = 1. Let S := pr1âˆ— (âˆ’Ïƒ4 + Ïƒ2,2 ), then [St ] = [S|Xt ], that is S|Xt is
effective for all t. Let t âˆˆ U , then Xt is not weak 2-Fano since using [AC13, Proposition
32]
ch2 (Xt ) Â· S|Xt = (Ïƒ2|Xt âˆ’ Ïƒ1,1|Xt ) Â· (âˆ’Ïƒ4|Xt + Ïƒ2,2|Xt ) = âˆ’1.

Remark 3.13. By [Laz04b, Theorem 7.1.1] we have H 5 (Xt , Z) = 0. By [Hat02, Corollary
3.3] H4 (Xt , Z) is torsion free, then also H 8 (Xt , Z) is torsion free by PoincarÃ© duality.
We now deal with complete intersections in orthogonal Grassmannians, so let us recall
the useful notation in [Cos11]. Given a connected component X âŠ† OG(r, s), we will
write s = 2m + 1 âˆ’ Ç« with Ç« âˆˆ {0, 1} and 2 â‰¤ r â‰¤ m. Let t be an integer such that
0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ r, and t â‰¡ m (mod 2) if 2r = s. Given a sequence of integers Î» = (Î»1 , ..., Î»t ) of
length t such that
m âˆ’ Ç« â‰¥ Î»1 > ... > Î»t > âˆ’Ç«.
Let Î»Ìƒ = (Î»Ìƒt+1 , ..., Î»Ìƒm ) be the unique sequence of length m âˆ’ t such that
â€¢ m âˆ’ 1 â‰¥ Î»Ìƒt+1 > ... > Î»Ìƒm â‰¥ 0,
â€¢ Î»Ìƒj + Î»i 6= m âˆ’ Ç« for every i = 1, .., t and j = t + 1, ..., m.
The Schubert varieties in X are parametrized by pairs (Î», Âµ), where Âµ is any subsequence
of Î»Ìƒ of length r âˆ’ t. Given an isotropic flag of subvector spaces Fâ€¢

Let us define another sequence Î»â€² of length tâ€² in this way:
â€¢ Î»â€² = Î» if either Ç« = 0 or Ç« = 1 and t â‰¡ m (mod 2); otherwise
â€¢ Î»â€² = Î» âˆª {b} where b = min{a âˆˆ N/0 â‰¤ a â‰¤ m âˆ’ 1, a âˆˆ

Let Î»Ìƒâ€² be the unique sequence associated to Î»â€² as above. Then the pair (Î», Âµ) is a subsequence of (Î»â€² , Î»Ìƒâ€² ). Suppose (Î», Âµ) = (Î»â€²i1 , ..., Î»â€² it , Î»Ìƒâ€² it+1 , ..., Î»Ìƒâ€² ir ) and let the discrepancy

Case (1) t must be 0. If m âˆ’ r â‰¥ 1 then c1 = c2 = 1, and, if m âˆ’ r > 1,

This case corresponds to (Î», Âµ) = ((1), (r âˆ’ 2, r âˆ’ 3, ..., )). No other possibilities
if m âˆ’ r 6= 1.
Case (3) It must be Î» = (2), then i1 = 1 and since cj = 0 âˆ€j â‰¥ 1, c1 = m âˆ’ r + 1 âˆ’ 1 = 0
implies m = r. This is the case (Î», Âµ) = ((2), (m âˆ’ 1, m âˆ’ 3, ...)).
Let s be even. If s = 2r, then the discrepancy is 0 because cj â‰¤ m âˆ’ r âˆ€j â‰¥ 1, then it

(Î», Âµ) =

b = 1 in order to have Î»â€² = Î»âˆª {1} which implies Î»Ìƒâ€² = (m âˆ’ 3, m âˆ’ 4, ...). This can
happen only if m âˆ’ 2 âˆˆ

(mâˆ’3, mâˆ’4, ...). This case implies that i1 = 2, then c1 = mâˆ’r+1âˆ’2 = mâˆ’râˆ’1,
then it must be m âˆ’ r = 2. Since cj = 0 âˆ€j â‰¥ 2, that corresponds to the case

Suppose Î» = (1), Î»Ìƒ = (m âˆ’ 1, m âˆ’ 3, ...), and we have to choose a Âµ such that
b = 0 in order to have Î»â€² = Î»âˆª {0} which implies Î»Ìƒâ€² = (m âˆ’ 3, m âˆ’ 4, ...). This can
happen only if m âˆ’ 1 âˆˆ

(m âˆ’ 3, m âˆ’ 4, ...). This case implies that i1 = 1, then c1 = m âˆ’ r + 1 âˆ’ 1 = m âˆ’ r,
then it must be m âˆ’ r = 1. Since cj = 0 âˆ€j â‰¥ 2, that corresponds to the case
(Î», Âµ) = ((1), (m âˆ’ 3, m âˆ’ 4, m âˆ’ 5, ..., )).
Case (3) It must be Î»â€² = (2, 0), then we can have Î» = (0) or Î» = (2).
If Î» = (2), then c1 = m âˆ’ r, then the discrepancy is not 0.
So Î» = (0), Î»Ìƒ = (m âˆ’ 2, m âˆ’ 3, ...), cj = 0 âˆ€j â‰¥ 1, and we have to choose a Âµ
such that b = 2 in order to have Î»â€² = Î»âˆª{2} which implies Î»Ìƒâ€² = (mâˆ’2, mâˆ’4, ...).

Proposition 3.17. Let s, r be positive integers such that 2 â‰¤ r â‰¤ 2s , and 2s âˆ’ r 6= 1, 2
if s is even. Let s 6= 2r (respectively, s = 2r), let X be a n-dimensional weak 2-Fano
complete intersection in a connected component of the orthogonal Grassmann variety
OG(r, s) under the PlÃ¼cker (respectively, half-spinor) embedding, with X very general if
X âŠ† OG(2, 7). Then Eff 2 (X) is polyhedral.
Proof. Assume that X is of type (d1 , ..., dc ). If n > 4, by [Laz04b, Theorem 7.1.1] and
Lemma 3.14, we have b4 (X) â‰¤ 2 and we can apply Lemma 2.4. Then we have n = 4
âˆ’ 4. If 2r = s, by [AC13, Proposition 34] and Remark 3.7, we
and c = r(2sâˆ’3râˆ’1)
2
see that X is weak 2-Fano if and only if either di = 1 and c â‰¤ 4, or X of type (2).
Therefore we get r = 4 and X of type (1, 1). By [AC13, Proposition 34] we have that
KX = âˆ’c1 (X) = âˆ’4H, where H is the half-spinor embedding. But then, by [KO73,
Corollary p.37], X is a smooth quadric in P5 and then b4 (X) = 2 by [Rei72, p.20], so we
apply by Lemma 2.4.
P
If 2r 6= s, since c1 (OG(r, s)) = (s âˆ’ r âˆ’ 1)Ïƒ1 we get that ci=1 di â‰¤ s âˆ’ r âˆ’ 2. It is
easy to see that this leads to the following cases
Type
(1, 1)
(1, 1, 1)
(2)
OG+ (2, 6)
(1)
OG(r, s)
OG(3, 7)
OG(2, 7)

But OG(3, 7) âˆ¼
= OG+ (4, 8), then the first case is a quadric. Let X111 be the variety
(1, 1, 1) in OG(2, 7). This is the variety (b8) in the classification given in [K9Ìˆ5]. Indeed,
for the readerâ€™s convenience, we point out that X111 is the zero-locus of a global section

where Sâˆ¨ is (1, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) in KÃ¼chleâ€™s notation (see [K9Ìˆ5, Section 2.5]). So h1,3 (X111 ) >
0 by [K9Ìˆ5, Theorem 4.8]. Now apply [Spa96, Theorem 2] to conclude that the space of
algebraic cycles of X111 is induced by the space of algebraic cycles of OG(2, 7). Then

s
last two varieties do not satisfy the condition 2 âˆ’ r 6= 1, 2, anyway, they are not weak
2-Fano by [AC13, Example 21]. Indeed, OG+ (2, 6) is the zero section of the bundle
OP3 (1) âŠ• OP3 (1) in P3 Ã— P3 [Kuz15, Proposition 2.1], and it can easily be seen that the
PlÃ¼cker embedding is given by the divisor (1, 1), then the two varieties are isomorphic
to, respectively, a complete intersection of type (1, 1) and (1, 2) in P3 Ã— P3 under the
embedding given by OP3 (1) âŠ• OP3 (1).

Proposition 3.18. Let X be a smooth n-dimensional weak 2-Fano complete intersection
in a symplectic Grassmann variety SG(r, s) under the PlÃ¼cker embedding. Then, b4 (X) â‰¤
2. In particular Eff 2 (X) is polyhedral.
Proof. Assume that X is of type (d1 , ..., dc ). If n > 4, by [Laz04b, Theorem 7.1.1] and
Lemma 3.16, we have b4 (X) = b4 (SG(r, s)) â‰¤ 2 and we can apply Lemma 2.4. If n = 4,
âˆ’4
sinceP
c1 (SG(r, s)) = (s âˆ’ r + 1)Ïƒ1 we have the following conditions: c = r(2sâˆ’3r+1)

and ci=1 di â‰¤ s âˆ’ r. It is easy to see that this leads to the following cases:
Type
(1, 1)
SG(3, 6)
(1, 2)
(1, 1, 1)
SG(2, 6)
(1, 1, 2)
SG(r, s)

The variety SG(2, 6) is a section of âˆ§2 (Sâˆ¨ ) = OG(2,6) (1), as we said in Remark 3.6.
Thus the last two case are, respectively, (1, 1, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 1, 2) in G(2, 6). The first two
cases are not weak 2-Fano by [AC13, Proposition 36], the last two by [AC13, Proposition
32(i)].

4. Fano manifolds of dimension n and index iX > n âˆ’ 3
A very important invariant of a Fano variety X is its index: this is the maximal integer
iX such that âˆ’KX is divisible by iX in P ic(X).
Fano varieties of high index have been classified: [KO73] proved that iX â‰¤ n + 1,
iX = n + 1 if and only if X = Pn , and iX = n if and only if X âŠ‚ Pn+1 is a smooth
hyperquadric. Furthermore the case iX = n âˆ’ 1 (the so called Del Pezzo varieties) has
been classified by Fujita in [Fuj82a, Fuj82b], and the case iX = n âˆ’ 2 (the so called Mukai
varieties) by Mukai (see [Muk89] and [IP99]).
Araujo and Castravet [AC13, Theorem 3] succeeded to classify 2-Fano Del Pezzo and
Mukai varieties. They proved:

Theorem 4.1. Let X be a 2-Fano variety of dimension n â‰¥ 3 and index iX â‰¥ n âˆ’ 2.
Then X is isomorphic to one of the following.
â€¢ Pn .
â€¢ Complete intersection in projective spaces:
- Quadric hypersurfaces X âŠ† Pn+1 with n > 2;
- Complete intersections of type (2, 2) in Pn+2 with n > 5;
- Cubic hypersurfaces X âŠ† Pn+1 with n > 7;
- Quartic hypersurfaces X âŠ† Pn+1 with n > 15;
- Complete intersections of type (2, 3) in Pn+2 with n > 11;
- Complete intersections of type (2, 2, 2) in Pn+3 with n > 9.
â€¢ Complete intersection in weighted projective spaces:
- Degree 4 hypersurfaces in P(2, 1, ..., 1) with n > 11;
- Degree 6 hypersurfaces in P(3, 2, 1, ..., 1) with n > 23;
- Degree 6 hypersurfaces in P(3, 1, ..., 1) with n > 26;
- Complete intersections of type (2, 2) in P(2, 1, ..., 1) with n > 14.
â€¢ G(2, 5).
â€¢ OG+ (5, 10) and its linear sections of codimension c < 4.
â€¢ SG(3, 6).
â€¢ G2 /P2 .
Here G2 /P2 is a 5-dimensional homogeneous variety for a group of type G2 . Using the
results in the previous sections we can prove Theorem 1.3.
Proof. For Eff 2 (X): In the case Pn and its complete intersections, we can invoke Theorem 3.2. Since none of the complete intersections in P(w) of the list has dimension 4,
we can use Proposition 3.1. Also G(2, 5), OG+ (5, 10), SG(3, 6) and G2 /P2 are rational homogeneous varieties, then their cone of pseudoeffective 2-cycles is polyhedral by
Proposition 3.4. Whereas the complete intersections of OG+ (5, 10) have polyhedral cone
of pseudoeffective 2-cycles by Proposition 3.17.
For Eff 3 (X): In Theorem 4.1, the only complete intersections of dimension 6 in a
weighted projective space are the one of type (2, 2) in P8 and the smooth quadric Q âŠ† P7 .
The first one is not weak 3-Fano since by [AC13, Equation (3.1)], ch3 (X) = âˆ’ 76 h3|X where
h is the class of an hyperplane in P8 . Then h3|X is effective, and ch3 (X)Â·h3|X = âˆ’ 67 h6|X < 0.
For the quadric, by [Rei72, p.20] b6 (Q) = 2, then Eff 3 (X) is polyhedral by Lemma 2.4.
For the other complete intersections we can use Proposition 3.1, whilst for the rational
homogeneous varieties we can use Proposition 3.4. Also for the complete intersections in
OG+ (5, 10) we have b6 (X) = 2, because b6 (OG+ (5, 10)) = 2 by Lemma 3.15 and we can

use [Laz04b, Theorem 7.1.1].
