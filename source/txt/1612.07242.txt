Abstract. A conjecture of Bombieri [2] states that the coefficients of a normalized univalent function f should satisfy
lim inf
f →K

n sin t − sin(nt)
n − Re an
= min
,
t∈R m sin t − sin(mt)
m − Re am

z
when f approaches the Koebe function K(z) = (1−z)
2 . Recently, Leung [10]
disproved this conjecture for n = 2 and for all m ≥ 3 and, also, for n = 3 and
for all odd m ≥ 5. Complementing his work we disprove it for all m > n ≥ 2
which are simultaneously odd or even and, also, for the case when m is odd, n
is even and n ≤ m+1
. We mostly make use of trigonometry, but also employ
2
Dieudonné’s criterion for the univalence of polynomials.

1. Introduction
Let S denote the class of analytic functions
f (z) = z + a2 z 2 + a3 z 3 + . . . + an z n + . . .
which are univalent in the unit disk D = {z ∈ C : |z| < 1}. Throughout the
long history of this class one of the motivating forces has been the Bieberbach
conjecture, now de Branges’ Theorem [3], which states that |an | ≤ n and that
the only extremal function is the Koebe function
∞

K(z) =
(1 − z)2
n=1

and its rotations.
Long before the final solution by de Branges, efforts of many mathematicians culminated in the proof of the local Bieberbach conjecture in an article
of Bombieri [2]. This weaker conjecture states that |an | ≤ n for functions in S in
a neighborhood of the Koebe function. In the same article, Bombieri conjectured
that the numbers
n − Re an
σmn = lim inf
,
(1)
f →K m − Re am
usually referred to as the Bombieri numbers, should coincide with the trigonometric numbers
n sin t − sin(nt)

for all m, n ≥ 2. We note that the lower limit in (1) refers to functions f in the
class S approaching the Koebe function uniformly on compacta.
In [12], Prokhorov and Roth showed that σmn ≤ Bmn . Also, the local maximum
property of the Koebe function yields that σmn ≥ 0. Setting

sin(nt)
, t ∈ R, n ∈ N,
(2)
sin t
it is relatively simple to see that Bmn = 0 when m is even and n is odd, since in
that case An (π) = 0 < Am (π). Hence σmn = Bmn = 0 and Bombieri’s conjecture
is correct when m is even and n is odd. Also, Bshouty and Hengartner [5] showed
that the conjecture is true for analytic variations of the Koebe function and for
functions with real coefficients (a simpler proof of the latter appeared in [12]).
Some related results are given in the recent article [1].
The Bombieri conjecture was first disproved by Greiner and Roth [9] in the
case (m, n) = (3, 2). They explicitly computed
An (t) = n −

Proofs (disproving the conjecture) for the points (2, 4), (3, 4) and (4, 2) were then
furnished by Prokhorov and Vasil’ev [13], who computed (approximately) the
corresponding Bombieri numbers.
Recently, Leung [10] developed a variational method which allowed him to
show that σm2 < Bm2 for all m ≥ 3 and that σm3 < Bm3 for all odd m ≥ 5. He
used the linear version of Loewner’s differential equation
σ32 =

∂f 1 + κ(t)z
∂f
=z
,
∂t
∂z 1 − κ(t)z

(3)

f (z) = K(z) + εv(z) + ε2 q(z) + O(ε3 ),

(4)

whose solutions are chains of univalent functions f (z, t) = et (z + a2 (t)z 2 + . . .),
t ≥ 0. Any one-slit function in S can be seen as the initial value f (z) = f (z, 0) of
such a solution (see [11]). The drive function κ has the form κ(t) = eiϑ(t) , with
ϑ being real-valued and piecewise continuous on [0, ∞). In the special case when
κ ≡ −1 we get the chain f (z, t) = et K(z). Setting κ(t) = −eiεϑ(t) , for ε > 0
and some admissible ϑ and letting t = 0, Leung obtained from (3) a variation of
Koebe’s function, given by

for some analytic functions v and q which depend only on the choice of ϑ. This
way Leung re-derived in a simpler fashion the exact same second variation q
as Bombieri, who used the non-linear version of Loewner’s equation. Thus
Bombieri’s formula (4.1) in [2] was obtained by Leung as formula (2.17) in [10].
In terms of the coefficients, formula (4) yields
an = n + εvn + ε2 qn + O(ε3 ).
It is an innate property of the method that the coefficients vn are purely imaginary
and qn are real. Therefore,
n − Re an = −ε2 qn + O(ε3 ).

Leung’s choice of ϑ yields

(For the convenience of the reader we have included at the end of the article an
appendix where it is shown how, beginning from Bombieri’s second variational
formula, one can arrive at this number qn .) Hence,
σmn ≤ lim

Therefore, to disprove Bombieri’s conjecture for some m > n ≥ 2, it suffices to

Leung showed that formula (6) holds true for n = 2 and for all m ≥ 3 and, also,
for n = 3 and for all odd m ≥ 5. Here, it is our purpose to prove (6) in some
other cases, including the ones just mentioned. In particular, we will prove the
following theorem.
Theorem 1. Let m > n ≥ 2 be integers such that either
(a) both m and n are odd, or
(b) both m and n are even, or
(c) m is odd, n is even and n ≤ m+1
2 .
Then (6) is true.
We have already observed that one can deduce the following corollary.
Corollary. Let m > n ≥ 2 be integers such that either (a), (b) or (c) in
Theorem 1 holds. Then Bombieri’s conjecture for this pair of integers is false.
Theorem 1 will be proved mainly with the use of trigonometry, but also, in
the case when the hypothesis (c) holds, we will employ Dieudonné’s criterion for
univalent polynomials.
After carefully examining the relevant graphs for 2 ≤ n ≤ 80 using the
www.desmos.com/calculator software, one is lead to believe that the hypothesis (c) in Theorem 1 can be notably weakened in that the point (m, n) has to
be below the straight line that joins the points (7, 6) and (17, 14). Thus, the
following proposition should be true.

Conjecture. If m > n ≥ 2 are integers such that m is odd, n is even and
n < 4m+2
then (6) is true.

2. Auxiliary lemmas
We first mention a criterion for the univalence of polynomials found by Dieudonné
[6] (see also [7, p.75]).
Lemma 2 (Dieudonné’s criterion). The polynomial p(z) = z + a2 z 2 + . . . + an z n
is univalent in D if and only if its associated polynomials
sin(nt) n−1
sin(2t)
z + . . . + an
z
q(z; t) = 1 + a2
sin t
sin t
have no zeros in D for any choice of the parameter t ∈ [0, π].
We now prove a simple lemma for An (t) = n − sin(nt)
sin t , which we defined in (2).
Lemma 3. For all t ∈ R and n ≥ 2, we have
An (t) ≥ 0

and

An (2π − t) = An (t).

Also, An vanishes only for t = 2ℓπ, ℓ ∈ Z, when n is even and only for t = ℓπ,
ℓ ∈ Z, when n is odd.
Proof. The symmetry is fairly obvious. Due to it we may restrict our attention
to the interval [0, π]. Using L’Hospital’s rule we find that
A2k (0) = A2k+1 (0) = A2k+1 (π) = 0,

A2k (π) = 4k,

for any k ≥ 1. Now, for t ∈ (0, π), An (t) > 0 is equivalent to
whose derivative is

ϕ(t) := n sin t − sin(nt) > 0,

ϕ′ (t) = n(cos t − cos(nt)).
If t0 is a critical point of ϕ then sin t0 = ± sin(nt0 ). Hence
and the proof is complete.

ϕ(t0 ) = (n ∓ 1) sin t0 > 0



We wish to remark that there are at least two more ways to prove this lemma.
First, we could apply Dieudonné’s criterion to the univalent polynomial z − z n /n
(which is, moreover, starlike [4, Thm. 2.3]) and let z → 1 along the real axis.
Alternatively, for odd n we could use the connection with the Dirichlet kernel
n
X
sin(n + 1/2)x
cos(jx),
=1+2
Dn (x) =
sin x/2
j=1

which is A2k+1 (t) = 2k + 1 − Dk (2t) (see [8, §8.4], for example). For even n we
would simply have to adjust the proof of the above expansion in cosines, where
the trick with telescoping sums works equally well. However, we note that only
the latter of these two proofs yields naturally the strict inequality in the open
interval (0, π).

Proof. We set N = n + 1 ≥ 3 and see that (7) is equivalent to
N (N + 1)(N + 2)AN −1 (t) ≥ N (N − 1)(N − 2)AN +1 (t),
which, in turn, is equivalent to
sin(N − 1)t

Multiplying by 21 sin t, expanding the sines of the sums and setting

Φ(t) = 2(N 2 − 1) sin t − 3N sin(N t) cos t + (N 2 + 2) cos(N t) sin t,

(8)

we see that the above is equivalent to Φ(t) ≥ 0. We note that

Hence, one set of the roots of Φ′ comes from sin N2t = 0. Solutions of this
equation satisfy N tk = 2kπ, k ∈ Z, and it is easy to check that
Φ(tk ) = 3N 2 sin tk > 0.

which was our goal. Therefore, it is only left to consider the case when cos N2t =

substitution in (9) yields
Φ′ (t)

which vanishes only at t = π2 , a point we have previously considered.

3. Proof of Theorem 1
We now proceed with the proof of our main theorem.
Proof of Theorem 1. We set
ϕmn (t) :=

An (t)
n sin t − sin(nt)
=
,
m sin t − sin(mt)
Am (t)

t ∈ [0, 2π],

whose minimum is the number Bmn . In view of the symmetry of An (stated in
Lemma 3) we may restrict our attention to t in [0, π].
Suppose first that either the hypothesis (a) or (b) holds, that is, m and n are
simultaneously odd or even. Note that
ϕmn (0) = ϕmn (π) =
and that

n3 − n
m3 − m

n
n3 − n

Hence, our goal is to show that
ϕmn (0) =

An (t)
n3 − n
≥ 3
Am (t)
m −m

for odd m, n

for even m, n.

for t ∈ (0, π).

But this follows directly from Lemma 4 after a finite number of iterations

Suppose now that the hypothesis (c) holds, that is, m is odd, n is even and
n ≤ m+1
2 . Note that
ϕmn (0) =

n3 − n
< +∞ = ϕmn (π).
m3 − m

Once again, in view of Lemma 4 it suffices to prove that
An (t)
n3 − n
≥ 3
Am0 (t)
m0 − m0

for t ∈ (0, π),

where m0 = 2n − 1. This is equivalent to
4(2n − 1)An (t) ≥ (n + 1)A2n−1 (t),
which, in turn, is the same as

for all z ∈ D, since this would imply that for z = x ∈ [0, 1) the function in (12)
is positive and (11) would follow after letting x → 1− . In view of Dieudonné’s
criterion (Lemma 2), (12) is equivalent to the statement that the function
f (z) = z −

belongs to the class S. We will actually prove more: we will show that f is
starlike, which means that f is univalent and that for every w ∈ f (D) the line
segment [0, w] lies entirely in f (D).
First, we see that the roots of

(n + 1)2

This shows that the function
p(z) =

zf ′ (z)
f (z)

is analytic in D and so in order to apply the well-known criterion for starlikeness
[7, §2.5] it suffices to show that
Re p(z) ≥ 0,

for |z| = 1.

(14)

We compute
p(z)
(n + 1)z 2n−2 − 4nz n−1 + 3n − 1
=
2n − 1
(n + 1)z 2n−2 − 4(2n − 1)z n−1 + (2n − 1)(3n − 1)
and let z n−1 = eiθ , θ ∈ R. We then have
(n + 1)eiθ − 4n + (3n − 1)e−iθ
p(z)
=
2n − 1
(n + 1)eiθ − 4(2n − 1) + (2n − 1)(3n − 1)e−iθ
2n(cos θ − 1) − (n − 1)i sin θ
=
.
2
(3n − 2n + 1) cos θ − 2(2n − 1) − 3n(n − 1)i sin θ
Multiplying by the complex conjugate of the denominator we see that (14) is
equivalent to


0 ≤ 2n(cos θ − 1) (3n2 − 2n + 1) cos θ − 2(2n − 1) + 3n(n − 1)2 sin2 θ
= n(n + 1)(3n − 1)(cos θ − 1)2 ,

which is true. The proof is complete.

Note that the polynomial (13) resembles the polynomials considered in a theorem of Brannan [4, Thm. 3.1], which gave necessary and sufficient conditions for
a polynomial of the form
z + a zn +

z 2n−1
,
2n − 1

a ∈ C,

to be univalent. Even though this theorem can not be applied here, the main
ingredient in its proof, which is the Cohn rule (see [4, Lem. 1.2]), could be
directly applied to prove (12) and thus give an alternative ending of the proof of
Theorem 1.
4. Appendix: Calculation of qn
Here our starting point will be Bombieri’s formula (4.1) in [2]. According to
it, if φ is a function in L2 [0, 1] then a second variation of the Koebe function is
given by q(z) = Q K(z) , where

U = 1 + 4uw and V = 1 + 4vw. Note the following homogeneity property: if we
replace φ by c φ (c ∈ R) then instead of Q we obtain c2 Q. In fact, our aim here
is to show how a specific choice of φ yields
1
qn = − (n − 1)(2n2 − 4n + 3),
9
which is a scalar multiple of (5). We will provide a slightly more direct approach
than Leung who, for additional purposes, considers (15) with variable z ∈ D
and integration over the interval [−1, 1] in order to use properties of classical
orthogonal polynomials.
We rewrite (15) as

Q(w) = −w2 (I1 + 6wI2 + 2wI3 ).
We observe that the integrand in I2 is symmetric in u and v and therefore its
integral over the lower triangle of [0, 1]2 (which is I2 ) is equal to the integral over
the upper triangle. Hence
