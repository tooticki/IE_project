ON MITCHELL’S EMBEDDING THEOREM FOR A
QUASI-SCHEMOID
KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI AND YASUHIRO MOMOSE

Abstract. A quasi-schemoid is a small category whose morphisms are colored with appropriate combinatorial data. In this paper, Mitchell’s embedding
theorem for a tame schemoid is established. The result allows us to give a cofibrantly generated model category structure to the category of chain complexes
over a functor category with a schemoid as the domain. Moreover, a notion
of Morita equivalence for schemoids is introduced and discussed. In particular, we show that every Hamming scheme of binary codes is Morita equivalent
to the association scheme arising from the cyclic group of order two. In an
appendix, we construct a new schemoid from an abstract simplicial complex,
whose Bose-Mesner algebra is closely related to the Stanley-Reisner ring of the
given complex.

1. Introduction
There are two crucial categories for representation theory of small categories
including groups and quivers. One is a module category and another one is a
functor category. Mitchell’s embedding theorem [13, Theorem 7.1] states that these
categories are equivalent provided the small category, which we deal with, has finite
many objects.
Association schemes, ASs for short, are significant subjects in algebraic combinatorics; see [1, 5, 19]. These subjects give rise to the so-called Bose-Mesner
algebras (adjacency algebras) and the study of the algebras creates applications in
the theory of codes and designs; see for example [18]. An important point is that
the category of finite groups is embedded in the category of ASs in the sense of
Hanaki; see [20, 7, 6]. If an association scheme is thin (in the sense of [20]), then
its Bose-Mesner algebra is just the group ring of the corresponding group. Thus,
representation theory of ASs is developed in the module categories of their BoseMesner algebras. However, until today there is few study on ASs dealing with their
categorical and homological structures such as group cohomology.
Very recently, Matsuo and the first author [11] have introduced the notion of
quasi-schemoids generalizing that of ASs from a small categorical point of view.
Roughly speaking, a quasi-schemoid is a small category whose morphisms are colored with appropriate combinatorial data. In [15], Momose has considered representation theory for quasi-schemoids with module categories of their Bose-Mesner
algebras. In this manuscript, we develop another representation theory, namely
that based on an appropriate functor category with a quasi-schemoid as the domain. It is worthwhile to remark that the two categories for representation theory

of schemoids are not equivalent in general even the set of objects in the underlying
category of a given quasi-schemoid is finite. That is, Mitchell’s embedding theorem
does not necessarily hold in our context; see Proposition 4.3 and Remark 4.5.
One of the aims of this manuscript is to give a class of schemoids in which
Mitchell’s embedding theorem holds; see Theorem 2.4. Such schemoids are called
tame. Our functor category for a schemoid is a subcategory, but not full, of the usual
one for the underlying category. Therefore, the existence of left and right adjoints
to a restriction functor is not immediate. We will also discuss this problem; see
Theorem 2.6.
An outline for the article is as follows. In Section 2, we describe our main theorems concerning Mitchell’s embedding and adjoint functors on functor categories of
schemoids. By employing the adjoint pair, we define a cofibrantly generated model
category structure on the category of chain complexes over a functor category with
a schemoid as the domain; see Theorem 2.8. Moreover, schemoid cohomology of
a morphism between schemoids and a notion of Morita equivalence of schemoids
are introduced. In Section 3, after defining a tame schemoid explicitly, we prove
our main theorems. Section 4 concerns examples of schemoid cohomology and a
Morita equivalence. In particular, we shall show that every Hamming scheme of
binary codes is Morita equivalent to the association scheme arising from the cyclic
group of order two; see Proposition 4.3. Section 5 explores an invariant for Morita
equivalence which is induced by a functor between underlying categories.
In Appendix 1, we construct a new schemoid from an abstract simplicial complex, whose schemoid cohomology is investigated in Section 4. This subject is very
interesting in its own right. In fact, we show that its Bose-Mesner algebra is closely
related to the Stanley-Reisner ring of the given complex. In consequence, such algebras give a complete invariant for isomorphism classes of finite simplicial complexes;
see Assertion 6.6. Moreover, the category of open sets of a topological space, whose
morphisms are inclusions, admits a schemoid structure. In consequence, we will see
that a functor category of the schemoid is an abelian subcategory of the category
of presheaves over the given space.
2. Main theorems
In what follows, a quasi-schemoid [11] is referred to as a schemoid. We begin by
recalling the definition of a schemoid. Let C be a small category
and S a partition
`
of the set mor(C) of all morphisms in C; that is, mor(C) = σ∈S σ. The pair (C, S)
is called a schemoid if the set S satisfies the condition that for a triple σ, τ, µ ∈ S
and for any morphisms f , g in µ, as a set
µ −1
µ −1
(πστ
) (f ) ∼

where πστ
: πστ
(µ) → µ denotes the restriction of the concatenation map

πστ : σ ×ob(C) τ := {(f, g) ∈ σ × τ | s(f ) = t(g)} → mor(C).
µ −1
We call the cardinality pµστ of the set (πστ
) (f ) a structure constant. Thus it
seems that a schemoid is a category all whose morphisms are colored according to
the condition above on a partition of the set of morphisms. As is seen below, such
a condition plays an important role in constructing an algebra with a schemoid.
Let C be a category with mor(C) finite and R a commutative ring with unit.
The underlying category defines an R-free module RC generated by all morphisms

of C. For generators f and g, define the product of f and g by
(
g ◦ f if g and f are composable
gf =
0
otherwise.
Then we have a R-algebra RC which is called the category algebra of C. Let (C, S)
be a schemoid with mor(C) finite. For any σ and τ in S, an equality

holds in the category algebra
P RC of C. Thus one has a subalgebra R(C, S) of RC
generated by the elements ( s∈σ s) for all σ ∈ S. The subalgebra is referred to as
the Bose-Mesner algebra of the schemoid (C, S).
Example 2.1. For a small category C, we define a partition S by S = {{f }}f ∈mor(C);
that is, all morphisms have pairwise different colors. Then we see that K(C) :=
(C, S) is a schemoid. It is called a discrete schemoid. Observe that the Bose-Mesner
algebra is the category algebra of the underlying category C.
We recall the definition of an association scheme. Let X be a finite set and S
a partition of X × X, namely a subset of the power set 2X×X . Assume that the
subset 1X := {(x, x) | x ∈ X} and g ∗ := {(y, x) | (x, y) ∈ g} for each g ∈ S are in
S. Then the pair (X, S) is called an association scheme if for all e, f, g ∈ S, there
exists an integer pgef such that for any (x, z) ∈ g
pgef = ♯{y ∈ X | (x, y) ∈ e and (y, z) ∈ f }.
Observe that pgef is independent of the choice of (x, z) ∈ g.
Example 2.2. For an association scheme (X, S), we define a quasi-schemoid (X, S)
by the pair (C, V ) for which ob(C) = X, HomC (y, x) = {(x, y)} ⊂ X ×X and V = S,
where the composite of morphisms (z, x) and (x, y) is defined by (z, x) ◦ (x, y) =
(z, y). It follows that the Bose-Mesner algebra is nothing but the original adjacency
algebra of the association scheme; see [11, Example 2.6 (i)].
We refer the reader to [11, Section 2] for more examples of schemoids.
Let (C, S) and (D, S ′ ) be schemoids. Then a functor u : C → D between underlying categories is called a morphism of schemoids, denoted u : (C, S) → (D, S ′ ), if
for σ ∈ S, there exists an element τ ∈ S ′ such that u(σ) ⊂ τ . Observe that such an
element τ is determined uniquely because S ′ is a partition of mor(D). We denote
by qASmd the category of schemoids.
Let R-Mod be the category of modules over a commutative ring R with unit.
Though the module category is not small, we regard it as a discrete schemoid,
denoted T , whose morphisms have distinct colors. For morphisms f and g in a
schemoid (C, S), we say that f is equivalent to g, denoted f ∼S g, if f and g are
contained in a common set σ ∈ S. For morphisms u, v : (C, S) → T of schemoids,
a natural transformation η : u ⇒ v is called locally constant if ηx = ηy whenever
idx ∼S idy .
We define T (C,S) to be a category whose objects are morphisms of schemoids
from (C, S) to T and whose morphisms are locally constant natural transformations.
Observe that T (C,S) is an abelian subcategory of the functor category T C , but not
full in general.

In the category Cat of small categories, natural transformations give a notion of
homotopy between functors. By employing the notion, a homotopy relation in the
category qASmd is defined in [10]. We here recall it. Let I be the discrete schemoid
with objects 0 and 1 whose only non-trivial morphism is an arrow u : 0 → 1.
Definition 2.3. Let F, G : (C, S) → (D, S ′ ) be morphisms between the schemoids
(C, S) and (D, S ′ ) in qASmd. We write H : F ⇒ G if H is a morphism from (C, S)×I
to (D, S ′ ) in qASmd with H ◦ ε0 = F and H ◦ ε1 = G. Here (C, S) × I denotes
the product of the quasi-schemoids and εi : (C, S) → (C, S) × I is the morphism of
quasi-schemoids defined by εi (a) = (a, i) for an object a in C and εi (f ) = (f, 1i ) for
a morphism f in C. We call the morphism H above a homotopy from F to G. A
morphism F is equivalent to G, denoted F ∼ G, if there exists a homotopy from F
to G or that from G to F .
If there exists a homotopy H : (C, S) × I → T from functors F to G, then we
have a commutative diagram

in the underlying category T for a morphism ϕ : x → y. Suppose that idx ∼S idy ,
then H(idx , u) = H(idy , u) because the homotopy H preserves the partition S.
Thus the definition of the morphism in the functor category T (C,S) is natural in
our context.
We will introduce a class of schemoids which are called tame in the next section.
A discrete schemoid and a schemoid associated with a groupoid are tame; see
Proposition 3.6. Mitchell’s embedding theorem for tame schemoids is established.
Theorem 2.4. (See Theorem 3.5 for a more precise version.) Let (C, S) be a tame
schemoid. Then the functor category T (C,S) is equivalent to the module category
R(C, S)-Mod if the set {idx }x∈obC / ∼S is finite and every structure constant is less
than or equal to 1.
In general, the functor category T (C,S) is not equivalent to the module category
R(C, S)-Mod; see Remark 4.5 (i). In this manuscript, we mainly focus our attention
on the functor categories of schemoids. Here a notion of Morita equivalence for
schemoids is proposed.
Definition 2.5. Schemoids (C, SC ) and (C ′ , SC ′ ) are Morita equivalent if the functor
′
categories T (C,SC ) and T (C ,SC′ ) are equivalent as abelian categories.
This gives a new equivalence relation in the category qASmd. Surprisingly, there
exist a Hamming scheme and a group-case association scheme which are Morita
equivalent while their Bose-Mesner algebras are not Morita equivalent; see Proposition 4.3 and Remark 4.5.
Theorem 2.4 enables us to investigate tame schemoids with tools in the study
of the module categories, for example derived functors. Thus in considering more
general schemoids, one might expect a morphism between the given schemoid and
a tame one. Furthermore, a restriction functor and its adjoint between functor
categories of schemoids will be of great use in the study of schemoids.

Theorem 2.6. Let (D, S ′ ) be a tame schemoid and u : (C, S) → (D, S ′ ) a morphism
′
of schemoids. Then the functor u∗ : T (D,S ) → T (C,S) induced by u has a left adjoint
′
(C,S)
(D,S ′ )
Lanu : T
→T
and a right adjoint Ranu : T (C,S) → T (D,S ) .
Theorem 2.6 allows us to define an appropriate cohomology group of a schemoid
over a tame one. In fact, if we have a morphism u : (C, S) → (D, S ′ ) to a tame
schemoid, then we can send a module in T (C,S) to the enough projective abelian
′
category T (D,S ) with the adjoint functor mentioned above. Thus homological
′
algebra on T (D,S ) can be applicable to the study of the functor category T (C,S) .
Definition 2.7. Let (D, S ′ ) be a tame schemoid with the set {idx }x∈obD / ∼S ′
finite. For a morphism u : (C, S) → (D, S ′ ) of schemoids and a functor M ∈ T (C,S) ,
(relative) schemoid cohomology of u with coefficients in M is defined by
u

H ∗ ((C, S) → (D, S ′ ); M ) = H ∗ (u; M ) := Ext∗T (D,S) (R, Ranu M ).
We remark that if (C, S) is a schemoid which comes from a group G, then
schemoid cohomology of the identity morphism on the schemoid is just the group
cohomology of G; see Corollary 2.11 for more details.
Let u : (C, S) → (D, S ′ ) be a morphism of schemoids whose target is tame.
The adjoint pairs in Theorem 2.6 induces adjoints between the category of chain
complexes over the functor categories:
Lanu

w

′

Ch(T (D,S ) )
f

⊥
u∗

/ Ch(T (C,S) )

⊥
Ranu

Indeed, the objectwise assignment of the functors u∗ , Ranu and Lanu gives rise to
the adjoint functors on the categories of chain complexes.
We recall the cofibrantly generated model category structure of a module category described in [9, Theorem 2.3.11] for example. The result [8, Theorem 11.9.2]
due to Kan enables us to give a model category structure to Ch(T (C,S) ) by using
that of Ch(R[D]-Mod) and adjoints mentioned above.
Theorem 2.8. With the above notation, suppose further that ob([D]) is finite.
Then there is a cofibrantly generated model category structure on Ch(T (C,S) ) in
which the weak equivalences are the maps that Ranu takes into weak equivalences
′
in Ch(T (D,S ) ) ∼
= Ch(T [D] ) ≃ Ch(R[D]-Mod). Moreover, (u∗ , Ranu ) is a Quillen
pair with respect to this model category structure.
Thus we obtain a Hochschild cohomology type invariant for Morita equivalence;
see Theorem 5.3.
It seems that our proof of Theorem 2.6 is not applicable to showing the existence
of the left/right adjoint to the restriction functor of a morphism of schemoids from
tame one; see Remark 3.12. Then the choice of a morphism of schemoids from (C, S)
to a tame schemoid is relevant to the consideration of a model category structure
on T (C,S) .
Let X and Y be objects in an abelian category A. Suppose that the category
Ch(A) of chain complexes over A has a model category structure. Then we recall
the Ext group of X by Y which is defined by ExtnA (X, Y ) := HomD(A) (X, Y [n]),
where D(A) denotes the derived category of A, namely the homotopy category
Ho(Ch(A)) of Ch(A).

6

KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI AND YASUHIRO MOMOSE

Remark 2.9. Let A be the category of (unbounded) chain complexes of left Rmodules, where R is a ring. When we consider the projective model structure on
Ch(A); see [9, Section 2.3], the Ext group Ext∗A (X, Y ) for R-modules X and Y is
the usual one.
Corollary 2.10. With the model category structure on Ch(T (C,S) ) defined in Theorem 2.8, one has a natural isomorphism
u
H ∗ ((C, S) → (D, S ′ ); M ) := Ext∗T (D,S′ ) (R, Ranu M ) ∼
= Ext∗T (C,S) ((Lu∗ )R, M )

for every object M in T (C,S) , where Lu∗ denotes the total derived functor of the
restriction u∗ .
Corollary 2.11. (i) For a group G and a RG-module M , the schemoid cohomology
id

H ∗ (S(G) → S(G); M ) is isomorphic to the group cohomology H ∗ (G, M ).
(ii) Let C be a small category with the set of morphism mor(C) finite. Then one has
id
an isomorphism H ∗ (K(C) → K(C); M ) ∼
= H ∗ (C, M ) for any RC-module M , where
∗
H (C, M ) denotes the cohomology of C with coefficients in M ; see [2] for example.
As is seen below, even if a small category is equivalent to trivial one, the functor
category in our context is not equivalent to T the trivial module category in general
provided the small category admits a schemoid structure; see Example 4.2 and
Remark 4.5 again. Thus the functor categories of schemoids, which we deal with in
this manuscript, are likely to provide new insights into categorical representation
theory.
3. Tame schemoids

detail. Moreover, K is a functor given by sending a small category to the discrete
schemoid. Observe that the functor K is the left adjoint to the forgetful functor U ;
see Example 2.1.

In order to define a tame schemoid, for a schemoid (C, S), we consider the following conditions T(i), T(ii) and T(iii).
T(i): The schemoid (C, S) is unital, namely, for J0 := {idx }x∈obC ,
[
{idx }x∈obC =
α.
α∈S,α∩J0 6=∅

T(ii): For any σ ∈ S and f, g ∈ σ, there exist τ1 and τ2 in S such that ids(f ) , ids(g) ∈
τ1 and idt(f ) , idt(g) ∈ τ2 .
Remark 3.1. It follows from the proof of [11, Lemma 4.2] that the condition T(ii)
necessarily holds for a unital schemoid. We recall the argument for the reader.
Suppose that f, g ∈ σ, s(f ) ∈ τ1 and s(g) ∈ τ1′ . Then pστ1 σ ≥ 1 because f is indeed
in πτ−1
(f ). Then there exists u ∈ τ1 and h ∈ σ such that u ◦ h = g. If (C, S) is
1σ
unital, we see that u = ids(g) and hence τ1′ = τ1 . The same argument as in above
yields that there is an element τ2 such that idt(f ) , idt(g) ∈ τ2 .
The third one is required to introduce a category [C] associated with a schmeoid
(C, S), whose set of objects is defined by
ob[C] = {idx }x∈obC / ∼S = {[x]},
where we write [x] for [idx ]. Under the condition T(ii), for an element σ ∈ S, there
exists a unique element [x] in ob[C] such that ids(f ) ∈ [x] for any f ∈ σ. In this
case, we write s(σ) ⊂ [x]. Similarly, we write t(σ) ⊂ [y] if idt(f ) ∈ [y] for any f ∈ σ.
Define a set of morphisms from [x] to [y] in the diagram [C] by
mor[C] ([x], [y]) = {σ ∈ S | s(σ) ⊂ [x], t(σ) ⊂ [y]}.
σ

τ

T(iii): For morphisms [x] −→ [y] −→ [z], there exist f ∈ σ and g ∈ τ such that
s(g) = t(f ). Moreover, there is a unique element µ = µ(τ, σ) in S such that pµτσ ≥ 1.
A schemoid (C, S) is called tame if the conditions T(i) and T(iii) hold.
Remark 3.2. Let (C, S) and (C ′ , S ′ ) be tame schemoids. It is readily seen that the
product schemoid (C × C ′ , S × S) is tame.
We observe that a schemoid whose underlying category is the face poset of a
simplicial complex is not tame in general; see Remark 6.3 for such schemoids.
Lemma 3.3. Let (C, S) be a tame schemoid. Then the diagram [C] is a category
with the composite of morphisms defined by τ ◦ σ = µ(τ, σ).
Proof. It suffices to show the associativity of the composite of morphisms. Consider
σ3
σ2
σ1
[w]. Suppose that µ = σ2 ◦ σ1 . Then
[z] −→
[y] −→
composable morphisms [x] −→
the condition T(iii) implies that there exist composable morphisms f ∈ σ1 and
g ∈ σ2 such that gf is in µ. By T(iii), we see that there exist h ∈ µ and k ∈ σ3
such that s(k) = t(h). Since (C, S) is a schemoid, it follows that
(π µ )−1 (gf ) ∼
= (π µ )−1 (h).
σ2 σ1

Thus we have a diagram • −→ • −→ • −→ • for some f ′ ∈ σ1 and g ′ ∈ σ2 with
h = g ′ f ′ . Let τ be an element in S which contains kg ′ f ′ . The uniqueness in the
condition T(iii) yields that σ3 ◦ (σ2 ◦ σ1 ) = τ = (σ3 ◦ σ2 ) ◦ σ1 . This complets the
proof.

Lemma 3.4. Let (C, S) be a tame schemoid. Then the category T (C,S) is isomorphic to the functor category T [C] .
Proof. Let f be an element of σ ∈ S. Then we write [f ] for σ. We define functors
Φ
/ T [C] by Φ(G)([x]) = G(x), Φ(G)([f ]) = G(f ), Ψ(F )(x) = F ([x])
T (C,S) o
Ψ

and Ψ(F )(f ) = F ([f ]) for objects G and F . Moreover, for morphisms η : G → G′ in
T (C,S) and ν : F → F ′ in T [C] , define Ψ(ν)x = ν[x] and Φ(η)[x] = η[x], respectively.
We see that Φ is a well-defined isomorphism with inverse Ψ.

It is known that the functor category T D is enough projective for any small
category D; see [14, page 25] for example. Thus so is T (C,S) if (C, S) is tame.
We have Mitchell’s embedding theorem for a tame schemoid.
Theorem 3.5. Let (C, S) be a tame schemoid. The category T (C,S) is embedded
into the module category R[C]-Mod. Moreover, T (C,S) is equivalent to the module
category R(C, S)-Mod if ob[C] is finite and the structure constant pµτσ is less than
or equal to 1 for any τ, σ, µ ∈ S.
Proof. By Lemma 3.4 and Mitchell’s embedding theorem for a usual functor category, we have an embedding T (C,S) ∼
= T [C] → R[C]-Mod. As for the latter half
of the assertion, the embedding gives an equivalence of categories. Moreover, the
assumption yields that the algebra R[C] is isomorphic to the Bose-Mesner algebra
R(C, S). We have the result.

e
Proposition 3.6. Let G be a groupoid. Then the associated schemoid S(G)
is tame
and the structure constants are less than or equal to 1. In particular S(G) is tame
for any group G.
Remark 3.7. The result [11, Lemma 4.4] implies that a semi-thin schemoid is tame;
see [11, Definition 4.1] for the definition of a semi-thin schemoid. Moreover, for a
e S) constructed in [11, Section 4] coinsemi-thin schemoid (C, S), the groupoid R(C,
cides with the category [C] mentioned above. By virtue of the result [11, Theorem
∼
e
4.11], we see that [S(G)]
= G as a category for a groupoid G.
e
The schemoid S(G)
associated with a groupoid G is thin and hence semi-thin;
see [11, Definition 4.8, Theorem 4.11] again. Thus we have Proposition 3.6. Here a
more direct proof of the result is given.

e
Proof of Proposition 3.6. The condition T(i) holds on S(G).
In fact, the schemoidd
is unital; see [11, Theorem 4.11].

choose a morphism (g ′ g ′′ h′ , g ′ ). Then it follows that (g ′ g ′′ h′ )−1 g ′ = l and
e
hence the morphism is in Gl . In the schemoid S(G),
structure constants are less
σ
than or equal to 1. Indeed, if pGl Gm 6= 0, then σ = Glm . This also implies that the

condition T(iii) holds on S(G).

Let u, v : (C, SC ) → (C ′ , SC ′ ) be morphisms of schemoids and η : u ⇒ v be
a natural transformation between functors u and v. We say that η preserves the
partition of identities if idx ∼S idy , then η(x) and η(y) are contained in the same
element τ in SC ′ . If (C ′ , SC ′ ) is the discrete schemoid T mentioned above, then this
notion coincides with that of locally constant natural transformations.

u∗ : T (C ,SC′ ) → T (C,SC ) .
(ii) Suppose that u is an equivalence; that is, there exist a morphism w : (C ′ , SC ′ ) →
(C, SC ) and natural isomorphisms uw ⇒ 1 and wu ⇒ 1 which preserve the partition of identities and so do the inverses. Then (C, SC ) and (C ′ , SC ′ ) are Morita
equivalent.
Proof. (i) For any object M in T (C

′

,SC′ )

and for f, g ∈ σ, we see that

u∗ M (f ) = M u(f ) = M u(g) = u∗ M (g).
Observe that M is a morphism of schemoids. For a morphism α ∈ T (C
namely a locally constant natural transformation, it follows that

,SC′ )

(M, N ),

(u∗ α)(x) = αu(x) = αu(y) = (u∗ α)(y)
whenever idx ∼S idy . In fact, idu(x) = u(idx ) ∼S ′ u(idy ) = idu(y) .
(ii) Let η : uw ⇒ 1 be the natural isomorphism. We will show that η induces a
natural isomorphism ηe : w∗ u∗ ⇒ 1 defined by ηe(M )(x) := M η(x). Suppose that
idx ∼S idy . By assumption, there exists τ ∈ S such that η(x) and η(y) are in τ .
Since M is a morphism of schemoids, it follows that M η(x) = M η(y) and hence
′
ηe(M ) is in T (C ,SC′ ) . It is immediate that ηe gives an equivalence between T (C,SC )
′
and T (C ,SC′ ) .


Remark 3.9. Let (C, S) be a schemoid with mor(C) finite. Suppose that the
schemoid (C, S) satisfies the condition T(i) and hence T(ii). For example, a schemoid
arising from an association schemes is such one. We define a small R-linear category
R-[C] by ob(R-[C]) = ob([C]) and
HomR-[C] ([x], [y]) := RhHom[C] ([x], [y])i,

namely the free R-module generated by the set Hom[C] ([x], [y]). For morphisms
σ ∈ Hom[C] ([y], [z]) and τ ∈ Hom[C] ([x], [y]), the composite σ ◦ τ of the morphisms
P
is defined to be µ pµστ µ. Let T R-[C] be the functor category of additive functors
from R-[C] to T . We define a pair (θ, η) of functors
θ : T R-[C] o

/ R(C, S)-Mod : η ,

L
which is so-called Mitchell’s correspondence, by θ(F ) =
[x]∈ob([C]) F ([x]) and
η(M )([x]) = [idx ]M . It is readily seen that θ is an embedding with left inverse
η. Moreover, we see that θ is an equivalence with inverse η if ob([C]) is finite. Observe that T R-[C] is not functorial with respect to morphisms in qASmd in general;
see [11, Section 6] and [6, Section 6].
Proposition 3.10. Let (D, S ′ ) be a tame schemoid and u′ : (C ′ , SC ′ ) → (D, S ′ ) a
morphism of schemoids. Let K : (C, SC ) → (C ′ , SC ′ ) be a morphism of schemoids
whose underlying functor K : C → C ′ gives an equivalence of categories. Suppose
that the inverse to the functor K is a morphism of schemoids. Then for any module

The second isomorphism follows from Lemma 3.11 below. We have the result.



In Section 4, we will obtain a Morita equivalence which is induced by a nonequivalent morphism between schemoids; see Remark 4.4.
Lemma 3.11. Let (D, S ′ ) be a tame schemoid and u : (C, S) → (D, S ′ ) a morphism
of schemoids. Suppose that one of modules N and M in T (C,S) is in the image of
′
the functor u∗ : T (D,S ) → T (C,S) . Then the Hom-set T (C,S) (M, N ) coincides with
C
T (M, N ).
Proof. We consider two adjoints
Γ : T [D] (ΦN, Ran(π◦u) M ) ∼
= T C ((π ◦ u)∗ ΦN, M ) = T C (u∗ N, M ) and
Ω : T [D] (Lan(π◦u) M, ΦN ) ∼
= T C (M, (π ◦ u)∗ ΦN ) = T C (M, u∗ N ).
With explicit forms of left and right Kan extensions, it follows that the image of the
adjoints consist of locally constant natural transformations. To see this, we recall
the right Kan extension given by
Z
Ran(π◦u) M ([d]) =
M (c)[D]([d],[u(c)])
c∈C

for an object [d] ∈ [D]; see [12, X]. The bijection Γ is defined by the composite
Γ(f ) : (π ◦ u)∗ ΦN

(π◦u)∗ (f )

/ (π ◦ u)∗ Ranπ◦u M

counit

/M

for any f : ΦN → Ranπ◦u M . In view of the definition of π, we see that (π ◦ u)∗ (f )
is locally constant. Moreover, it follows that the counit (π ◦ u)∗ Ran(π◦u) M → M is
locally constant. In fact, for any c ∈ obC, the map counitc is given by the projection
Ran(π◦u) M ([u(c)]) ⊂

Y

id

M (c)[u(c)]→[u(e)] → M (c)[u(c)]→[u(c)] = M (c).

e∈C

If idc ∼S idc′ , then idu(c) ∼S idu(c′ ) and hence [u(c)] = [u(c′ )]. This implies
that counit is locally constant. Observe that M (c) = M (c′ ) because M is in
T (C,S) . By definition, we see that T (C,S) (M, N ) is a submodule of T C (M, N ).
Then T (C,S) (M, N ) = T C (M, N ) if M is in the image of the restriction functor.
We leave the rest of this proof to the reader.

Thus it follows that Ranu := ΨRanπ◦u : T (C,S) → T (D,S ) is the right adjoint to u∗ .
By the same argument as above, we have the left adjoint to the restriction functor
u∗ . This completes the proof.

Remark 3.12. Let v : (D, S ′ ) → (C, S) be a morphism of schemoids. The same
argument as in the proof of Theorem 2.6 does not work well in showing the existence
′
of the left/right adjoint of the restriction functor v ∗ : T (C,S) → T (D,S ) in general
even if (D, S ′ ) is tame. Indeed, suppose that idc ∼S id′c . We claim that Lanv N (c) =
′
Lanv N (c′ ) for any N in T (D,S ) . Recall the left adjoint Lanv : T D → T C is defined
by
Z d∈D
Lanv N (c) =
C(v(d), c) · N (d)
for N in T D and c ∈ C; see [12, X]. There is no relation between the hom-sets
C(v(d), c) and C(v(d), c′ ) in general.

Proof of Theorem 2.8. We first recall the cofibrantly generated model category
structure of a module category described in [9, Theorem 2.3.11] for example.
Let I and J be the generating set of cofibrations and the generating set of trivial
cofibrations of Ch(R[D]-Mod). That is, I and J consist of maps S n−1 → Dn ,
which are inclusions, and 0 → Dn for n ∈ Z, respectively. Here Dn denotes the
chain complex defined by (Dn )k = R[D] if k = n or k = n − 1 and 0 otherwise
with the only non trivial differential dn = id. Moreover, S n−1 is the chain complex
defined by (S n−1 )n−1 = R[D] and (S n−1 )k = 0 if k 6= n − 1. Then we have to
verify that (1) u∗ I and u∗ J permit the small object argument and that (2) Ranu
takes relative u∗ J-cell complexes to weak equivalences. The first one follows from
the same argument as in [9, Exmaple 2.1.6].
By making use of the description of the right adjoint Ranu in Theorem 5.2, we
see that the condition (2) holds. In fact, the domains of elements
in u∗ J are trivial.
M
Then every relative u∗ J-cell complex has the form j : A → A ⊕
Gβ for some
β<λ

ordinal λ, where A is an appropriate chain complex and Gβ = u∗ Dn(β) . Since the
nontrivial differential in each Gβ is the identity map, it follows that
MRanu (⊕β<λ Gβ )
is contractible. This yields that Ranu (j) : Ranu A → Ranu (A ⊕
Gβ ) is weak
β<λ

equivalence. Observe that Ranu is additive. We have the result.



Proof of Corollary 2.10. Since (u∗ , Ranu ) is a Quillen pair, it follows from [8, Theorem 8.5.18] that there exists a natural isomorphism
e

Extn (C,S) (Lu∗ R, M ) = HomD(T (C,S) ) (u∗ (CR),

e → R denotes a fibrant cofibrant approximation; see [8, Definition 8.1.2,

Proposition 8.1.3]. Each object M in T (C,S) is fibrant. In fact, M → 0 has the right
lifting property with respect to every element of u∗ J. Then for the total derived
functor RRanu , we see that RRanu M = Ranu M . This completes the proof.

KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI AND YASUHIRO MOMOSE

Proof of Corollary 2.11. This follows from Theorem 3.5. Observe that schemoids
of the forms S(G) and K(C) are tame.

4. Examples
Example 4.1. Let G be a group and H a subgroup. Let G/H denote the groupcase association scheme whose underlying set is the homogeneous one G/H. By
considering a normal subgroup N containing H, we have a natural map u : G/H →
G/N . Then G/N is a group and hence a tame schemoid. Therefore, for a functor
u
M ∈ T (G/H) , schemoid cohomology H ∗ (G/H → G/N ; M ) is isomorphic to group
cohomology of the form H ∗ (G/N ; Ranu M ).
Example 4.2. Let L be a simplicial complex and N is a category whose objects
are non-negative integers and which has the one arrow i → j if and only if i ≤ j.
The length of the arrow i → j is defined to be the difference j − i. In the category
N , lengths of arrows give a partition len of the set of morphisms (arrows). Then
we see that (N , len) is a tame schemoid whose structure constants are less than or
equal to 1. Moreover, the Bose-Mesner algebra of this schemoid is isomorphic to
the polynomial algebra R[σ1 ].
We have a morphism u : (P (L), S) → (N , len) of schemoids by ”collapsing” the
Hasse diagram of the face poset of L, where (P (L), S) is the schemoid associated
with L; see Remark 6.2. Thus the schemoid cohomolgoly of the morphism u is
considered by using the Koszul resolution of the constant functor R as a R[σ1 ]module. In fact, we have
u
H ∗ (P (L) → (N , len); M ) ∼
(R, Ranu M )
= Ext∗
R[σ1 ]

∼
=

H(Hom(∧(s−1 σ1 ), ΨRanπ◦u M ); δ)

for any M ∈ T (P (L),S) ; see Remark 2.9. It follows that the differential δ is defined
by δ(f )(s−1 σ1 ) = σ1 f (1).
Let n be the number of vertices of a simplicial complex L. Then we define
a morphism v : (P (L), S) → (N , len)×n of schemoids by v(φ) = (0, ...., 0) and
v(xi ) = (0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0), where 1 appears in the ith entry. Then the morphism v
also defines schemoid cohomology H ∗ (v; M ).
Proposition 4.3. Let H(n, 2) be the Hamming scheme of binary codes with length
n. More precisely, H(n, 2) = ({0, 1}×n, {T0 , T1 , ..., Tn }), where Ti denotes the set
e
of the pair of words with the Hamming metric i. Then schemoids S(Z/2)
and
e ).
(H(n, 2)) are Morita equivalent; see Section 3 for the functor S(

We first consider the case of H(2, 2). The Hamming scheme gives a schemoid

Here white arrows from a vertex to itself, the black arrows and dots arrows are in
T0 , T1 and T2 , respectively. Observe that S = {T0 , T1 , T2 }. It is readily seen that
pTTi0 Ti = 1 = pTTii T0 for any i and that pTT01 T1 = 2,
pTT01 T2 = 0 = pTT02 T1 , pTT11 T1 = 0, pTT11 T2 = 1 = pTT12 T1 , pTT21 T1 = 1, pTT21 T2 = 0 = pTT22 T1 .

In particular, we have T12 = 2T0 + T2 in the Bose-Mesner algebra of H(2.2). On

where the partition of the morphism is given by {{id0 , id1 }, {α, α−1 }}. For an
object M in T (H(2,2)) , we see that
M ((01 ← 00))2 = M ((00 ← 01) ◦ (01 ← 00)) = M (id00 ) = idM(00) and
M ((01 ← 00))2 = M ((11 ← 01) ◦ (01 ← 00)) = M (11 ← 00).
This yields that M (T2 ) = {idM(00) } = M (T0 ).
e
Proof of Proposition 4.3. Let u : S(Z/2)
→ (H(n, 2)) =: (C, S) be a morphism
of schemoids defined by u(0) = 0 · · · 00 and u(1) = 0 · · · 01. Then the morphism
e
induces the functor u∗ : T (H(2,n)) → T S(Z/2) . Let Teven and Todd denote Ti
for some i even and Tj for some j odd, respectively. The same argument as in
the case of H(2, 2) enables us to deduce that for any object M in T (H(2,n)) ,
M (f ) = M (0 · · · 00 → 0 · · · 01) = M (0 · · · 01 → 0 · · · 00) if f is in Todd and
M (g) = M (id0···00 ) if g is in Teven .
We identify the set of objects in C with Z/2×n . Let sgn : Z/2×n → Z/2 be a
homomorphism defined by sgn(i1 , ..., in ) = i1 + · · · + in . With the homomorphism,
e
we define a functor v : (H(n, 2)) → S(Z/2)
by
(
0 if sgn(p) = 0,
v(p) =
1 if sgn(p) = 1
for an object p in (H(n, 2)). Thus

it follows that

sgn(p) = 0 = sgn(q),
sgn(p) = 0 and sgn(q) = 1,
sgn(p) = 1 and sgn(q) = 0,

We claim that v preserves a partition. Suppose that p → q is in Ti . Then we have
sgn(q) − sgn(p) = sgn(q − p) = i in Z/2. This yields that v(Todd ) ⊂ {α, α−1 } and
v(Teven ) ⊂ {id0 , id1 }. We see that v is a morphism of schmeoids.
It is immediate by definition that v◦u = 1 and hence u∗ ◦v ∗ is the identity functor
e
on T S(Z/2) ; see Proposition 3.8(i). Define a natural isomorphism θ : v ∗ ◦ u∗ ⇒ 1
by θ(M )(a) = idM(a) . We have to verify that θ(M ) is a morphism in T (H(n,2)) for
any object M ∈ T (H(n,2)) . Observe that θ(M ) is locally constant by definition.

a morphism in T (H(2,2)) . We claim that θ gives rise to a natural transformation
from v ∗ ◦ u∗ to the identity functor on T (H(n,2)) ; that is, we show that a diagram

α(uv(a)) = α(a) and then (v ∗ ◦ u∗ )(α)(a) = (uv)∗ (α)(a) = α(uv(a)). Thus the
e
diagram is commutative. It turns out that S(Z/2)
and (H(n, 2)) are Morita equivalent.


Remark 4.4. In the observation above, we see that the morphism v of schemoids is
an equivalence on the underlying categories with u its inverse. In fact, for example,
a natural isomorphism η : uv ⇒ 1 on (H(n, 2)) is determined uniquely with the
condition that η11 : 00 = uv(11) → 11 and η00 : 00 = uv(00) → 00 because
an association scheme is regarded as a complete graph. However, since η00 ∈ T0 ,
η11 ∈ T2 and id00 ∼S id11 , it follows that η does not preserve the partition. Thus
Proposition 3.8 is not applicable to this case.
Observe that an association scheme has an initial object if we consider it a
category with the functor  : AS → qASmd and the forgetful functor U : qASmd →
Cat described in Section 3. Therefore, each association scheme is equivalent to the
trivial category as a category.
Remark 4.5. (i) The category T (H(2,2)) is not equivalent to the module category
R((H(2, 2)))-Mod. Suppose that the categories are equivalent. Then the Bosee
Mesner algebras R((H(2, 2))) and RS(Z/2)
= R(Z/2) are Morita equivalent. In
e
(H(2,2))
fact, we see that R((H(2, 2)))-Mod ≃ T
≃ T S(Z/2) ≃ R(Z/2)-Mod. The
third equivalence follows from Theorem 3.5. The algebra R((H(2, 2))) is commutative and a free R-module of rank 3. On the other hand, the group ring R(Z/2) is
of rank 2 and commutative. Then the 0th Hochschild homology groups of the two
algebras are different from each other, which is a contradiction.
e
(ii) The underlying categories of the schemoids S(Z/4)
and KU ((H(2, 2))) are the
same as that of (H(2, 2)). However, Theorem 3.5 enables us to deduce that the
e
category T S(Z/4) is equivalent to the module category R(Z/4)-Mod. The category
KU((H(2,2)))
T
is equivalent to T . In fact, T KU((H(2,2))) is isomorphic to the functor
U((H(2,2)))
category T
because KU ((H(2, 2))) is tame. Moreover, the small catee
gory U ((H(2, 2))) is a groupoid with initial object. Then S(Z/4),
(H(2, 2)) and
KU ((H(2, 2))) are not Morita equivalent one another.
A directed complete graph Kn is regarded as a groupoid with initial object.
As mentioned in Remark 4.5 (ii), the functor category T K(Kn ) is equivalent to

ON MITCHELL’S EMBEDDING THEOREM FOR A QUASI-SCHEMOID

15

M (n; R)-Mod and hence to T = R-Mod. Thus Kn is Morita equivalent to R. In
this context, Proposition 4.3 asserts that the Hamming schemes give a class of
schemoids Morita equivalent to the group ring R(Z/2), which is most small of all
R-algebras bigger than R itself.
5. An invariant for Morita equivalence
In this section, we explore an invariant for Morita equivalence of schemoids
such as the Hochschild cohomology of algebras. We use terminology in [17] while
notations may be replaced with ours.

abelian categories A2 and A1 . More precisely, the objects are adjoint pairs (u1 , u2 ) :

where G and F are objects of A and B, respectively. Let U : C1op × C2 → T be a
bifunctor. Then we define functors
- ⊗C1 U : T C1 → T C2 and (U, -)C2 : T C2 → T C1
by (F ⊗C1 U )(a) = F ⊗C1 U (-, a) and (U, G)C2 (b) = HomT (C2 ,S2 ) (U (b, -), G), respectively. Indeed, we can verify the well-definedness for the functors directly.
Lemma 5.1. Let (C1 , S1 ) and (C2 , S2 ) be schemoids and U an object in the functor
op
category T (C1 ×C2 ,S1 ×S2 ) . Then the restrictions of the functors - ⊗C1 U and (U, -)C2
mentioned above to functor categories of schemoids give rise to functors
- ⊗C1 U : T (C1 ,S1 ) → T (C2 ,S2 ) and (U, -)C2 : T (C2 ,S2 ) → T (C1 ,S1 ) .
Proof. We verify that - ⊗C1 U : T (C1 ,S1 ) → T (C2 ,S2 ) is well defined. Let f : a → b
op
and g : a′ → b′ be morphisms in C2 with f ∼S2 g. Since U is in T (C1 ×C2 ,S1 ×S2 ) ,
it follows that f∗ : U (d, a) → U (d, b) coincides with g∗ : U (d, a′ ) → U (d, b′ ) for any
d ∈ ob(C1 ). In particular, U (d, a) = U (d, a′ ) and U (d, b) = U (d, b′ ). Observe that
by definition, for F in T (C1 ,S1 ) and an object a in C2 ,
(F ⊗C1 U )(a) = F ⊗C1 U (-, a) = coeq(

because η is locally constant. Let f : a → b and g : a′ → b′ be morphisms in C1
with f ∼S1 g. Since f ∗ = g ∗ : U (a, -) = U (a′ , -) → U (b, -) = U (b′ , -), it follows that
((f ∗ )∗ η)x = ((g ∗ )∗ η)x for η in HomT (C2 ,S2 ) (U (a, -), G) and x ∈ ob(C2 ). In order
to show (U, -)C2 : T (C2 ,S2 ) → T (C1 ,S1 ) is a functor, we have to prove that (U, η)C2
is locally constant for a morphism η : G ⇒ F . Assume that ida ∼S1 idb . Then
U (a, -) = U (b, -). Therefore, one has a commutative diagram
HomT (C2 ,S2 ) (U (a, -), G)

Proof. For an object A in (C1 , S1 ), we can define a projective object hA in T (C1 ,S1 )

functor corresponding to the bimodule R[D], then the Ext group in Theorem 5.3 is
isomorphic to the Hochschild cohomology HH ∗ (R[D]).
Let w : (C1 , S1 ) → (D, S ′ ) be a morphism of schemoids, which induces a Morita
equivalence between the schemoids. We define a functor e

defines. The first author would like to thank Dai Tamaki for pointing out that

6. Appendix 1
In this section, we construct a quasi-schemoid from a poset. It is mentioned
that the construction of schemoids described here is generalized to that for a small
acyclic category in [16].
Let X be a set and Θ a subset of the power set 2X . We regard Θ as a category
whose objects are elements of itself and whose morphisms are inclusions.
Lemma 6.1. (cf. [16, Lemma 1.1]) Let D be the set consisting of the differences
V \U for all morphisms (inclusions) U → V in Θ. Define a partition S of the set of
morphisms in Θ by S = {e
σ }σ∈D , where σ
e = {i : U → V | V \U = σ}. Then (Θ, S)
is schemoid.
Proof. Let i : U → V be in σ
e. Suppose that i = k ◦ l for l : U → W and k : W → V .
If l ∈ τe and k ∈ µ
e, then W = U ⊔ τ and V = W ⊔ µ and hence σ = τ ⊔ µ. Assume
further that i = k ′ ◦ l′ , where l′ : U → W ′ ∈ τe and k ′ : W ′ → V ∈ µ
e. Then
W = U ⊔ τ = W ′ . Thus l = l′ and k = k ′ . This implies that
(

0 otherwise.
We have the result.



Remark 6.2. Let (Θ, S) be the schmemoid mentioned above obtained by a set X.
Suppose that X is finite. Then we define a functor u : Θ → N by u(U ) = ♯U . It
is readily seen that u gives rise to a morphism u : (Θ, S) → (N , len) of schemoids.
Thus Theorem 2.8 allows us to give a model category structure to the category
of chain complexes Ch(T (Θ,S) ). Thus we have a derived category of the form
D(T (Θ,S) ).

Let K be an abstract simplical complex and P (K) its face poset. We consider
the face poset a small category with an initial object ∅ as usual. Let SK be a
partition of the set of morphisms defined by
SK = {e
σ }σ∈K∪{∅} ,
where σ
e = {α : µ → τ | τ \µ = σ}. Lemma 6.1 yields that (P (K), SK ) is a
schemoid. It is called the quasi-schemoid associated with K.
Remark 6.3. Consider the simplicial complex K with two vertices 1, 2 and no
g

1-simplex. With the notation in Section 3, we have a sequence [∅] −→ [{1}] =
g

{2}
g and
[∅] −→ [{2}] in the diagram [P (K)]. Since t(α) = ∅ 6= s(β) for any α ∈ {1}
g
β ∈ {2}, it follows that P (K) is not tame.

We call a simplicial map f : K → L non-degenerate if f (i) 6= f (j) whenever
{i, j} in K; see [4, Definition 2.7].
Lemma 6.4. Let f : K → L be a simplicial map. Then the poset map P (f ) :
P (K) → P (L) induces a well-defined morphism P (f ) : (P (K), SK ) → (P (L), SL )
of schemoids if and only if f is componentwise non-degenerate or constant.

Proof. Assume that f is componentwise non-degenerate or constant. Let σ
e be an
element in SK with σ 6= ∅. We show that there exists an element σe′ in SL such
that P (f )(e
σ ) is included in σe′ . Observe that there is a unique connected component
K0 such that σ ∈ K0 . Then the assertion we claim is immediate for the case f
is constant on K0 . Consider the case where f is non-degenerate on K0 . For an
element α : µ → τ in σ
e, we see that τ = µ ⊔ σ. If f (µ) ∩ f (σ) 6= ∅, then there exist
elements i ∈ µ and j ∈ σ such that f (i) = x = f (j) for some x in f (µ)∩f (σ), which
is a contradiction. This implies that f (τ ) = f (µ ⊔ σ) = f (µ) ⊔ f (σ). Therefore, we
have P (f )(σ) ⊂ fg
(σ).
Assume that f is not non-degenerate. If f is not constant on a connected component K0 , then |K0 | ≥ 2. Since f is not non-degenerate on K0 , there exists an
element {i, j} ∈ K such that f (i) = f (j). The morphisms α1 : ∅ → {i} and
f It follows that P (f )(α1 ) belongs
α2 : {j} → {i, j} in P (K) are in the partition {i}.

The following result describes a strong connection between the Stanley-Reisner

Proposition 6.5 allows us to deduce the following result.
Assertion 6.6. Let K and L be finite simplicial complexes. Then the following
conditions are equivalent.
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

K is isomorphic to L as a simplicial complex.
(P (K), SK ) is isomorphic to (P (L), SL ) as a quasi-schemoid.
(P (K), SK ) is homotopy equivalent to (P (L), SL ).
The Bose-Mesner algebra of (P (K), SK ) is isomorphic to that of (P (L), SL )
as an algebra.
(v) The Stanley-Reisner ring of K is isomorphic to that of L as an algebra.

Proof. The Bose-Mesner algebra R(P (K), SK ) is isomorphic to R[K]/(x2i ) as an
algebra. Thus it follows from the results Proposition 6.5 and [3, Example 5.28,
page 178] that the conditions (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) are equivalent.
We consider the implication from (iii) to (ii). In order to prove the claim, it
suffices to show that if F ∼ 1, then F = 1 for a morphism F : (P (K), SK ) →
(P (K), SK ); see Definition 2.3. Let H : (P (K), SK ) × I → (P (K), SK ) be a
homotopy from F to 1. Then we have a commutative diagram

the small category I with objects 0 and 1. Since 1s(ϕ) and 1t(ϕ) are in ∅,
that H(1s(ϕ) , u) ∼SK H(1t(ϕ) , u). Let ϕ : ∅ → {i} be a morphism in P (K). The

Since ∅ is an initial object, we have F (∅) = ∅. Then H(1s(ϕ) , u) = id and hence
H(1t(ϕ) , u) = id. This yields that F (ϕ) = ϕ. By induction on the cardinality of a
simplex, we see that F (ψ) = ψ for a morphism ψ : {i1 , ..., is } → {i1 , ..., is , is+1 } in
P (K). Since F is a functor, it follows that F (ϕ) = ϕ for any morphism ϕ in P (K).
Assume that there exists a homotopy H : (P (K), SK ) × I → (P (K), SK ) from 1
to F . Let ϕ : ∅ → {j} be a map in K(P ). We have a commutative diagram

Suppose that F (∅) 6= ∅. Then H(1s(ϕ) , u) is not identity. Let τ be a maximal

Since 1s(ϕ) ∼SK 1s(ψ) ∼SK 1t(ψ) , we see that H(1t(ψ) , u) is not identity. Therefore,
τ  F (τ ), which is a contradiction. Thus it follows that F (∅) = ∅. By the same
argument as in the case F ∼ 1, namely by induction on the cardinality of a simplex,
we have 1 = F .

For a simplicial map ϕ : K → L, we define a map ϕ∗ : R[L] → R[K] between
the Stanley-Reisner rings by
ϕ∗ (yj ) =

X

xi

i∈ϕ−1 (j)

where xi and yj are generaters of R[K] and R[L], respectively. We see that ϕ∗ is a
well-defined algebra map; see [4, Proposition 3.4] for example. Moreover, it follows
that ϕ∗ induces a well-defined algebra map
ϕ∗ : R[L]/(yj2 ) → R[K]/(x2i )
P
if ϕ is non-degenerate. In fact, we see that ϕ∗ (yj2 ) = k,l∈ϕ−1 (j) xk xl . Suppose
that {k, l} ∈ L for some k, l ∈ ϕ−1 (j). Then ϕ(k) = ϕ(l), which is a contradiction
because ϕ is a non-degenerate simplicial map. Thus {k, l} is not in K for any
i, j ∈ ϕ−1 (j) and then ϕ∗ (yj2 ) = 0 in R[K]/(x2i ).
Let ϕ : K → L be a non-degenerate simplicial map. Lemma 6.4 implies that
P (ϕ) : (P (K), SK ) → (P (L), SL ) is a morphism of quasi-schemoids. We define a
map P (ϕ)∗ : R(P (L), SL ) → R(P (K), SK ) of R-modules by

Since ϕ is a non-degenerate simplicial map, it follows that in the equations above,
s = n and that ϕ({j1 , ..., jn }) = {i1 , ..., in } if and only if (ϕ(l1 ), ..., ϕ(ln )) =
(i1 , ..., in ) with {l1 , ..., ln } = {j1 , ..., jn }. Then the diagram is commutative and
hence P (ϕ)∗ is a morphism of algebras.

Remark 6.8. Let SimpCompnon-deg be the wide category of simplicial complexes
with non-degenerate simplicial maps as morphisms. Then we have a functor
P : SimpCompnon-deg → qASmd
which is faithful but not full. In fact, let K be the simplicial set with a single
vertex 1 and L the standard simplex with two points 1 and 2. Then the map
F : (P (K), SK ) → (P (L), SL ) defined by F (f : φ → {1})) = (φ → {1, 2}) is a
morphism of quasi-schemoids but not in the image of the functor P .
Remark 6.9. Let (X, O) be a topological space and OpenX the category of whose
objects are open sets of X and whose morphisms are inclusions. Then Lemma
6.1 enables us to construct a schemoid (OpenX , SX ). Moreover, we have a model
category structure of Ch(T (OpenX ,SX ) ) and obtain a derived category of the form
D(T (OpenX ,SX ) ) if X is finite; see Remark 6.2.
A finite poset X is considered a finite T0 -space. Then one might expect that the
model category structure of Ch(T (OpenX ,SX ) ) mentioned above is of great use in
the study of finite posets. The topic will be addressed in forthcoming work.
Let f : X → Y be a continuous map. Then we have a functor f ∗ : OpenY →
OpenX defined by f ∗ (U ) = f −1 (U ).
Lemma 6.10. The functor f ∗ mentioned above gives rise to a morphism f ∗ :
(OpenY , SY ) → (OpenX , SX ) of schemoids.
Proof. Let i : U → V be in σ
e, where σ
e ∈ SY . We have V = U ⊔ σ and hence

f (V ) = f (U ) ⊔ f (σ). This implies that f ∗ (i) ∈ f^


Remark 6.11. The functor category T (OpenX ,SX ) is an abelian subcategory of the
category T OpenX of presheaves of R-modules over X. We see that there is no
essential intersection between T (OpenX ,SX ) and sheaves. In fact, suppose that F

22

KATSUHIKO KURIBAYASHI AND YASUHIRO MOMOSE

is a sheaf in T (OpenX ,SX ) . Then F (∅) = 0. For any open set U , idU : U → U
and ∅ → ∅ are contained in a common σ ∈ SX . This enables us to conclude that
F (id∅ ) = F (idU ) : F (U ) = F (∅) → F (∅) = F (U ). We have F (U ) = 0. Therefore,
F is nothing but the constant sheaf 0.
