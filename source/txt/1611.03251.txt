Abstract
We prove that if any ⌊3d/2⌋ or fewer elements of a finite family of linear operators
Kd → Kd (K is an arbitrary field) have a common eigenvector then all operators
in the family have a common eigenvector. Moreover, ⌊3d/2⌋ cannot be replaced by
a smaller number. Also, we study the following problem, achieving partial results:
prove that if any l = O(d) or fewer elements of a finite family of linear operators
Kd → Kd have a common non-trivial invariant subspace then all operators in the
family have a common non-trivial invariant subspace.

Introduction

We denote the set of numbers {a, a + 1, . . . , b} by [a, b], where a < b are positive
integer numbers. Also, we use the following notation [b] := [1, b].
The well-known Helly’s theorem [5] claims.
Theorem 1. Let F be a finite family of convex sets in Rd . If every d + 1 or fewer
elements of F intersects, then all the sets in the family F intersect.
There is an abundance of literature on Helly-type theorems, see for example
[1, 3, 4, 6, 8]. The aim of this work is to answer the following Helly-type question.
Problem 1. Let A be a finite family of linear operators Kd → Kd , where K is an
arbitrary field and d > 2. Find minimal k = HE(Kd ) such that if any k or fewer
elements of A have a common eigenvector then there is a common eigenvector for
all operators in the family A.
The authors of [2] considered Problem 1 and gave the wrong proof of the fact
that HE(Kd ) = d + 1 (see Theorem 5.1 in [2]). Our main result is the following
theorem.
Theorem 2. HE(Kd ) = ⌊3d/2⌋ for an arbitrary field K.
We prove Theorem 2 in Section 2.
Also, we discuss the following Helly-type question posed by Andrey Voynov [7].
Problem 2. Let A be a finite family of linear operators Kd → Kd , where K is an
arbitrary field and d > 2. Find minimal l = HI(Kd ) such that if any l or fewer
elements of A have a common non-trivial invariant subspace then there is a common
non-trivial invariant subspace for all operators in the family A.

It is easy to see that HI(Kd ) ≤ d2 . Indeed, suppose that we know that any d2
or fewer operators in a finite family have a common non-trivial invariant subspace.
Note that the space of linear operators is in fact the space of matrices of size d × d
therefore among operators in the family we can find at most d2 operators such that
any operator in the family is equal to a linear combination of these operators (with
coefficients in K. Therefore, because of our assumption all elements of the family
have a common non-trivial subspace.
It is not difficult to slightly improve the above estimate HI(Kd ) ≤ d2 − d + 1.
We leave this improvement to reader as an exercise. Moreover, we believe that the
following conjecture holds.
Conjecture 1. HI(Kd ) = O(d).
The following theorem is a partial result confirming Conjecture 1.
Theorem 3. Suppose that A is a finite family of linear operators such that A0 ∈ A
have d eigenvectors in Kd with different eigenvalues and any 2d−1 or fewer elements
of A have a common non-trivial invariant subspace then there is a common nontrivial invariant subspace for all elements of A.
We deduce Theorem 3 from the following combinatorial lemma, which seems to
be of independent interest.
Lemma 1. Let q > 0 and p ≥ 0 be integer numbers. Given a family M =
{M1 , . . . , Mp } of non-empty and proper subsets of [q]. Suppose that for every nonempty subset I ⊆ [p] we have either
[
[
[
Mi = [q] or
Mi 6=
Mi
i∈I

i∈I

i∈I\{j}

for some j ∈ I. Then p 6 2q − 2.
Theorem 3 and Lemma 1 are proved in Section 3.

Proof of Theorem 2

The following example shows that HE(Kd ) ≥ ⌊3d/2⌋.
Example. Let e1 , . . . , e3n be such vectors that
{ej : j ∈ [3n], 3 ∤ j}
is the standard basis vectors of K2n and e3i = e3i−2 + e3i−1 for any i ∈ [n]. Let us
introduce the following notations:
Hj = span(ei : i ∈ [3n] \ {j, j + f (j)}), Lj = span(ej ),
here j ∈ [3n] and
f (j) =

(

1, if j ≡ 1, 2
−2, if j ≡ 0

(mod 3);
(mod 3).

Let us define a family A = {A1 , . . . , A3n } of 3n operators. The operator Aj , j ∈ [3n],
is such that Hj is the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue 1 and Lj is the

eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue 0. Obviously, Aj are well defined and
all operators but Aj have a common eigenvector ej+f (j) , but all operators do not
have a common eigenvector. Analogously, if d is odd we can construct an example
of a family of ⌊3d/2⌋ operators Kd → Kd such that all operators does not have a
common eigenvector and all operators but any operator have.
The proof is based on induction on n. Suppose that Theorem 2 is shown for
families of linear operators containing less then n operators, where n > ⌊3d/2⌋ + 1.
Let us prove Theorem 2 for a family A = {A1 , . . . , An } of n operators. By the
induction hypothesis, we can find a vector vi that is a common eigenvector of all
elements of A but Ai .
Suppose that vk+1 , . . . , vn is the maximal set of linearly independent vectors
among v1 , . . . , vn , then n − k 6 d and
vi =

µi,j vj =

X

µi,j vj

(1)

j∈Xi

j=k+1

for any i ∈ [k]. Here Xi is the set of j ∈ [k + 1, n] such that µi,j 6= 0.
Fact 1. Hi := span({vj : j ∈ Xi }) is a common eigenspace for operators Am ,
m ∈ [n] \ (Xi ∪ {i}).
Proof of Fact 1. Let us apply the operator Am for fixed m ∈ [n] \ (Xi ∪ {i}) to (1).
Because vectors vj , j ∈ Xi ∪ {i}, are eigenvectors of Am thus we get
X
λi,m vi =
λj,m µi,j vj ,
j∈Xi

where λj,m , j ∈ {i} ∪ Xi , is the eigenvalue corresponding to the operator Am and
the eigenvector vj . Because vectors vj , j ∈ Xj ⊂ [k + 1, n], are linearly independent
therefore λj,m = λ for all j ∈ {i} ∪ Xi . Thus the operator Am is a scalar operator
on Hi .
Fact 2. Suppose that l ∈ Xi for i ∈ [k]. Then vectors vj , j ∈ {i} ∪ [k + 1, n] \ {l},
are linearly independent.
Proof of Fact 2. A simple exercise.
If Xi = ∅ for some i ∈ [k] then vi = 0, i.e. we get the contradiction because
eigenvectors are non-trivial vectors. If Xi = {m} for some i ∈ [k], m ∈ [k + 1, n]
then vi = µi,m vm , i.e. vi is a common eigenvector for all elements of A. Therefore,
|Xi | > 2, thus without loss of generality we have X1,2 = X1 ∩ X2 6= ∅. Indeed,
otherwise

the last inequality contradicts our assumption n > ⌊3d/2⌋ + 1.
Fix l ∈ X1,2 = X1 ∩ X2 6= 0. Summing (1) for i = 1 and i = 2 with proper
coefficients, we get the following equality

Denote by X0 the set of such j ∈ X1,2 that µ2,l µ1,j = µ1,l µ2,j , i.e. the set of such
j ∈ X1,2 that coefficients corresponding vj in (2) are equal to 0. Note that l ∈ X0 .
Let us write (2) in the following way
X
βj vj ,
(3)
v1 =
j∈({2}∪X1 ∪X2 )\X0

where βj 6= 0 for all j ∈ ({2} ∪ X1 ∪ X2 ) \ X0 . Applying Al to (3) and using that
vj , j ∈ ({1, 2} ∪ X1 ∪ X2 ) \ X0 , are eigenvectors of Al we get
X
λj,l βj vj ,
λ1,l v1 =
j∈({2}∪X1 ∪X2 )\X0

where λj,l , j ∈ ({1, 2} ∪ X1 ∪ X2 ) \ X0 , is the eigenvalue corresponding the operator
Al and vj . By Fact 2 vectors vj , j ∈ ({2}∪ X1 ∪ X2 )\X0 ⊂ ({2}∪ [k + 1, n])\{l} are
linearly independent therefore we have that Al is a scalar operator on span({vj :
j ∈ ({1, 2} ∪ X1 ∪ X2 ) \ X0 }) associated with the eigenvalue λ = λ1,l , i.e.
w = µ2,l v1 −

is also an eigenvector of Al associated with the eigenvalue λ. Analogously, w is an
eigenvector of Al′ for every l′ ∈ X0 . Because of w ∈ H1 ∩ H2 thus by Fact 1 w is
an eigenvector of Aj for any j ∈ [n] \ X1,2 .
Lastly, let us show that w is an eigenvector of any Am , m ∈ X1,2 \ X0 . Again
summing (1) for i = 1 and i = 2 with proper coefficients, we have
µ2,m v1 − µ1,m v2 =

(µ2,m µ1,j − µ1,m µ2,j )vj . (4)

j∈X1,2

Denote by X0′ the set of such j ∈ X1,2 that µ2,m µ1,j = µ1,m µ2,j , i.e. the set of
such j ∈ X1,2 that coefficients corresponding vj in (4) are equal to 0. Note that
X0 ∩ X0′ = ∅, because otherwise we get µ2,m µ1,l′ = µ1,m µ2,l′ and µ2,l µ1,l′ = µ1,l µ2,l′ ,
where l′ ∈ X0 ∩ X0′ , thus µ2,m µ1,l = µ1,m µ2,l , i.e. m ∈ X0 . We now apply the
argument used for (2) again, with l replaced by m, to obtain that Am is a scalar
operator on span({vj : j ∈ ({1, 2} ∪ X1 ∪ X2 ) \ X0′ }), i.e. Am is a scalar operator
on span({vj : j ∈ X0 }). Thus w ∈ span({vj : j ∈ X0 }) is an eigenvector of Am .
Therefore, w is a common eigenvector of all operators Aj , j ∈ [n]. Theorem 2
is proved.

Proof of Theorem 3

Proof of Theorem 3 using Lemma 1. Suppose that we proved Theorem 3 for any
family A containing A0 of size less then n, where n > 2d. Let us prove Theorem 3
for a family A = {A0 , A1 . . . , An−1 }. By induction hypothesis, for any j ∈ [n − 1]
there exists an invariant non-trivial subspace Hj such that it is an invariant for all
operators but Aj .

Denote eigenvectors of A0 by v1 , . . . , vd . Since these vectors are associated
with different eigenvalues, they forms a basis of Kd . Therefore, for any non-trivial
invariant subspace H of A0 there exists I ⊆ [d] such that H = span(vi : i ∈ I).
Indeed, assume the contrary, i.e. H 6= span(vi , i ∈ I) for any I ⊆ [d], i.e. there
are vectors in H such that they could be represented as sums of eigenvectors of A0
that do not belong to H. Choose such a vector v that it has the minimal number
of terms in its representation, i.e.
v=

k
X

αi vli ,

(5)

i=1

where vli 6∈ H, αi ∈ K, αi 6= 0, i ∈ [k], and k > 1 is minimal. Applying A0 to (5)
we get that
k
X
αi λli vli ∈ H,
(6)
v′ =
i=1

where λli ∈ K, i ∈ [k], is the eigenvalue of A0 corresponding to the eigenvector vli .
Therefore, we have that the vector
′

v − λlk v =

k−1
X

αi (λli − λlk )vli ∈ H

i=1

can be represented as the sum of k − 1 eigenvectors of A0 that do not belong to
H. This contradiction shows that for each i, i ∈ [n − 1], we can assign a nonempty subset Mi ⊂ [d] such that Hi = span(vi : i ∈ Mi ) because Hi are invariant
subspaces of A0 . By Lemma 1 there exists a non-empty set I ⊂ [d] such that
[
[
M=
Mi =
Mi 6= [d]
i∈I

i∈I\{j}

for any j ∈ I, i.e. span(vj : j ∈ M ) 6= Kd is a common non-trivial invariant
subspace of all operators in the family A.
Proof of Lemma 1. The proof is by induction on q. For q = 1, there is nothing to
prove. Assume that the inequality p ≤ 2q − 2 is proved for S
q < n, let us prove it
for q = n. ASnon-empty subset I ⊆ [p] is called interesting if i∈I Mi 6= Mj for any
j ∈ [p] and i∈I Mi 6= [q]. Assume that there is at least one interesting subset and
choose an interesting subset J that has the maximal cardinality. Note that there
is k ∈ J such that Mk contains an unique element, i.e. there is x ∈ Mk such that
x 6∈ Mj for any
S j ∈ I \ {k}. Let us consider the following family N = {N1 , . . . , Np },
where Nk = i∈J Mi and Ni = Mi for i 6= k. Note that for any l ∈ [p] \ J we have
Nk ⊂ Nl or Nk ∪ Nl = [q]. In the converse case, we get the interesting subset J ∪ {l}
that should have the larger cardinality then J. Let us check that the condition of
the lemma holds for the new family. Trivially, it holds for any I ⊆ [q] \ {k} and
I ⊆ J (because x ∈ Nk and x 6∈ Ni , i ∈ J). Let us check that the condition holds
for I such that k, l ∈ I, where
that the condition holds for the
S l 6∈ J. We know S
′
′
family M and I ′ = I ∪ J. If i∈I ′ Mi = [q] then i∈I Ni = [q].
S If there is k ∈ I
such that Mk′ contains an unique element y then, since Nk = i∈I Mi ⊂ Nl = Ml ,
we get k′ 6∈ J. It is easy to check that the condition holds for the family N and I
because Nk′ = Mk′ has the unique element y.
We make such replacements of the family till it is possible. Obviously, we can not
do them infinitely many times because after each replacement the total cardinality

of sets increases. Finally, we get a family M′ that for every two subsets in M′ one
contains another or their union is [q]. Without loss of generality assume that a subset
A = {1, . . . , t} ∈ M′ such that it does not contain another subset in M. Denote by
K1 , . . . , Kl ∈ M subsets that do not contain A, i.e. [q] \ A ⊆ Ki . We can certainly
assume that Kl ∩ A = ∅ (if for every Ki we have Ki ∩ A 6= ∅ then we can add the
subset [q] \ A to the family M′ ). Note that the family {Ki ∩ A : i ∈ [l − 1]} (where
the role of q is played by k) satisfies condition of the lemma. By the induction
hypothesis, we get l − 1 6 2k − 2, i.e. l 6 2k − 1. If we delete A and Ki from
the family M′ (i.e. at most 2k subsets) and delete elements 1, . . . , k from other
subsets in M′ then the new family satisfies the condition of the lemma, i.e. it
has at most 2(q − k) − 2 subsets. Thus the original family M contains at most
2k + 2(q − k) − 2 = 2q − 2 subsets.
Example. Obviously, the following example shows that the inequality in Lemma 1
is sharp:
M = {{1}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, . . . , {1, . . . , q − 1}}∪
∪{{q}, {q, q − 1}, {q, q − 1, q − 2}, . . . , {q, . . . , 2}}.
