DIMENSION, PARACOMPACTNESS, AND SPLITTINGS

SAM SANDERS
Abstract. Reverse Mathematics (RM hereafter) is a program in the foundations of mathematics founded by Friedman and developed extensively by Simpson and others. The aim of RM is to find the minimal axioms needed to prove a
theorem of ordinary, i.e. non-set-theoretic, mathematics. As suggested by the
title, this paper deals with the study of the topological notions of dimension
and paracompactness, inside Kohlenbach’s higher-order RM. As to splittings,
there are some examples in RM of theorems A, B, C such that A ↔ (B ∧ C),
i.e. A can be split into two independent (fairly natural) parts B and C, and the
aforementioned topological notions give rise to a number of splittings involving highly natural A, B, C. Nonetheless, the higher-order picture is markedly
different from the second-one: in terms of comprehension axioms, the proof in
higher-order RM of e.g. the paracompactness of the unit interval requires full
second-order arithmetic, while the second-order/countable version of paracompactness of the unit interval is provable in the base theory RCA0 . We obtain
similarly ‘exceptional’ results for the Urysohn identity, the Lindelöf lemma,
and partitions of unity.

1. Introduction
Reverse Mathematics (RM hereafter) is a program in the foundations of mathematics initiated around 1975 by Friedman ([15, 16]) and developed extensively by
Simpson ([43]) and others. We refer to [44] for a basic introduction to RM and
to [41, 43] for an (updated) overview of RM. We will assume basic familiarity with
RM, the associated ‘Big Five’ systems and the ‘RM zoo’ ([12]). We do introduce
Kohlenbach’s higher-order RM in some detail Section 2.1.
Topology studies those properties of space that are invariant under continuous
deformations. The modern subject was started by Poincaré’s Analysis Situs at the
end of 19th century, and rapid breakthroughs were established by Brouwer in a twoyear period starting 1910, as discussed in [8, p. 168]. We generally base ourselves
on the standard monograph by Munkres ([31]).
Now, the RM of topology has been studied inside the framework of second-order
arithmetic in e.g. [32–34]. This approach makes heavy use of coding to represent
uncountable objects via countable approximations. Hunter develops the higherorder RM of topology in [19], and points out some potential problems with the
aforementioned coding practice. Hunter’s observations constitute our starting point
and motivation: working in higher-order RM, we study the RM of notions like
dimension and paracompactness motivated as follows: the former is among the most

basic/fundamental notions of topology, while the latter has already been studied in
second-order RM, e.g. in the context of metrisation theorems ([34, 43]).
As it turns out, the picture we obtain in higher-order RM is completely different
from the well-known picture in second-order RM. For instance, in terms of comprehension axioms, the proof in higher-order RM of the paracompactness of the unit
interval requires full second-order arithmetic by Theorem 3.11, while the secondorder/countable version of paracompactness of the unit interval is provable in the
base theory RCA0 of second-order RM by [43, II.7.2]. Furthermore, the Urysohn
identity connects various notions of dimension, and a proof of this identity for [0, 1]
similarly requires (comprehension axioms as strong as) full second-order arithmetic.
We also study the Lindelöf lemma and partitions of unity.
The aforementioned major difference between second-order and higher-order RM
begs the question as to how robust the results in this paper are. For instance,
do our theorems depend on the exact definition of cover? What happens if we
adopt a more general definition? We show in Sections 3.1 and 3.4 that our results
indeed boast a lot of robustness, and in particular that they do not depend on the
definition of cover, even in the absence of the axiom of (countable) choice. The
latter feature is important in view of the topological ‘disasters’ (See e.g. [20]) that
manifest themselves in the absence of the axiom of (countable) choice.
We also obtain a number of highly natural spittings, where the latter is defined as
follows. As discussed in e.g. [18, §6.4], there are (some) theorems A, B, C in the RM
zoo such that A ↔ (B ∧ C), i.e. A can be split into two independent (fairly natural)
parts B and C (over RCA0 ). It is fair to say that there are only few natural examples
of splittings in second-order RM, though such claims are invariably subjective in
nature. A large number of splittings in higher-order RM may be found in [40].
Finally, like in [36, 37], statements of the form ‘a proof of this theorem requires
full second-order arithmetic’ should be interpreted in reference to the usual scale of
comprehension axioms that is part of the Gödel hierarchy (See Appendix A for the
latter). The previous statement thus (merely) expresses that there is no proof of this
theorem using comprehension axioms restricted to a sub-class, like e.g. Π1k -formulas
(with only first and second-order parameters). An intuitive visual clarification may
be found in Figure 1, where the statement the unit interval is paracompact is shown
to be independent of the medium range of the Gödel hierarchy. Similarly, when
we say ‘provable without the axiom of choice’, we ignore the use of the very weak
instances of the latter included in the base theory of higher-order RM.
In conclusion, it goes without saying that our results highlight a major difference
between second- and higher-order arithmetic, and the associated development of
RM. We leave it the reader to draw conclusions from this observation.
2. Preliminaries
2.1. Higher-order Reverse Mathematics. We sketch Kohlenbach’s higher-order
Reverse Mathematics as introduced in [23]. In contrast to ‘classical’ RM, higherorder RM makes use of the much richer language of higher-order arithmetic.
As suggested by its name, higher-order arithmetic extends second-order arithmetic. Indeed, while the latter is restricted to numbers and sets of numbers, higherorder arithmetic also has sets of sets of numbers, sets of sets of sets of numbers,

et cetera. To formalise this idea, we introduce the collection of all finite types T,
defined by the two clauses:
(i) 0 ∈ T and (ii) If σ, τ ∈ T then (σ → τ ) ∈ T,
where 0 is the type of natural numbers, and σ → τ is the type of mappings from
objects of type σ to objects of type τ . In this way, 1 ≡ 0 → 0 is the type of functions
from numbers to numbers, and where n + 1 ≡ n → 0. Viewing sets as given by
characteristic functions, we note that Z2 only includes objects of type 0 and 1.
The language Lω includes variables xρ , y ρ , z ρ , . . . of any finite type ρ ∈ T. Types
may be omitted when they can be inferred from context. The constants of Lω
includes the type 0 objects 0, 1 and <0 , +0 , ×0 , =0 which are intended to have their
usual meaning as operations on N. Equality at higher types is defined in terms of
‘=0 ’ as follows: for any objects xτ , y τ , we have
[x =τ y] ≡ (∀z1τ1 . . . zkτk )[xz1 . . . zk =0 yz1 . . . zk ],

(2.1)

if the type τ is composed as τ ≡ (τ1 → . . . → τk → 0). Furthermore, Lω also
includes the recursor constant Rσ for any σ ∈ T, which allows for iteration on type
σ-objects as in the special case (2.2). Formulas and terms are defined as usual.
Definition 2.1. The base theory RCAω
0 consists of the following axioms:
(1) Basic axioms expressing that 0, 1, <0 , +0 , ×0 form an ordered semi-ring with
equality =0 .
(2) Basic axioms defining the well-known Π and Σ combinators (aka K and S
in [2]), which allow for the definition of λ-abstraction.
(3) The defining axiom of the recursor constant R0 : For m0 and f 1 :
R0 (f, m, 0) := m and R0 (f, m, n + 1) := f (R0 (f, m, n)).

(2.2)

(4) The axiom of extensionality: for all ρ, τ ∈ T, we have:


(∀xρ , y ρ , ϕρ→τ ) x =ρ y → ϕ(x) =τ ϕ(y) .

(Eρ,τ )

1

(5) The induction axiom for quantifier-free formulas of Lω .
(6) QF-AC1,0 : The quantifier-free axiom of choice as in Definition 2.2.

Definition 2.2. The axiom QF-AC consists of the following for all σ, τ ∈ T:
(∀xσ )(∃y τ )A(x, y) → (∃Y σ→τ )(∀xσ )A(x, Y (x)),

(QF-ACσ,τ )

for any quantifier-free formula A in the language of Lω .
As discussed in [23, §2], RCAω
0 and RCA0 prove the same sentences ‘up to language’ as the latter is set-based and the former function-based. Recursion as in (2.2)
is called primitive recursion; the class of functionals obtained from Rρ for all ρ ∈ T
is called Gödel’s system T of all (higher-order) primitive recursive functionals.
We use the usual notations for natural, rational, and real numbers, and the
associated functions, as introduced in [23, p. 288-289].
Definition 2.3 (Real numbers and related notions in RCAω
0 ).
(1) Natural numbers correspond to type zero objects, and we use ‘n0 ’ and
‘n ∈ N’ interchangeably. Rational numbers are defined as signed quotients
of natural numbers, and ‘q ∈ Q’ and ‘<Q ’ have their usual meaning.
1To be absolutely clear, variables (of any finite type) are allowed in quantifier-free formulas of
the language Lω : only quantifiers are banned.

REVERSE MATHEMATICS OF TOPOLOGY

(2) Real numbers are coded by fast-converging Cauchy sequences q(·) : N → Q,
i.e. such that (∀n0 , i0 )(|qn − qn+i )| <Q 21n ). We use Kohlenbach’s ‘hat
function’ from [23, p. 289] to guarantee that every f 1 defines a real number.
1
(3) We write ‘x ∈ R’ to express that x1 := (q(·)
) represents a real as in the
previous item and write [x](k) := qk for the k-th approximation of x.
(4) Two reals x, y represented by q(·) and r(·) are equal, denoted x =R y, if
1
). Inequality ‘<R ’ is defined similarly. We sometimes
(∀n0 )(|qn − rn | ≤ 2n−1
omit the subscript ‘R’ if it is clear from context.
(5) Functions F : R → R are represented by Φ1→1 mapping equal reals to equal
reals, i.e. (∀x, y ∈ R)(x =R y → Φ(x) =R Φ(y)).
(6) The relation ‘x ≤τ y’ is defined as in (2.1) but with ‘≤0 ’ instead of ‘=0 ’.
Binary sequences are denoted ‘f 1 , g 1 ≤1 1’, but also ‘f, g ∈ C’ or ‘f, g ∈ 2N ’.
Finally, we mention the ECF-interpretation, of which the technical definition may
be found in [47, p. 138, 2.6]. Intuitively speaking, the ECF-interpretation [A]ECF
of a formula A ∈ Lω is just A with all variables of type two and higher replaced
by countable representations of continuous functionals. The ECF-interpretation
ω
connects RCAω
0 and RCA0 (See [23, Prop. 3.1]) in that if RCA0 proves A, then
RCA0 proves [A]ECF , again ‘up to language’, as RCA0 is formulated using sets, and
[A]ECF is formulated using types, namely only using type zero and one objects.
2.2. Some axioms of higher-order arithmetic. We introduce some functionals
which constitute the counterparts of Z2 , and some of the Big Five systems, in
higher-order RM. We use the formulation of these functionals as in [23].
First of all, ACA0 is readily derived from the following ‘Turing jump’ functional:


(∃ϕ2 ≤2 1)(∀f 1 ) (∃n)(f (n) = 0) ↔ ϕ(f ) = 0 .
(∃2 )

ω
2
1
and ACAω
0 ≡ RCA0 + (∃ ) proves the same Π2 -sentences as ACA0 by [39, Theorem 2.2]. This functional is discontinuous at f =1 11 . . . , and (∃2 ) is equivalent to
the existence of F : R → R such that F (x) = 1 if x >R 0, and 0 otherwise ([23, §3]).
Secondly, full second-order arithmetic Z2 is readily derived from the sentence:


(∃E 3 ≤3 1)(∀Y 2 ) (∃f 1 )Y (f ) = 0 ↔ E(Y ) = 0 ,
(∃3 )

ω
3
3
and we define Zω
2 ≡ RCA0 + (∃ ). The (unique) functional from (∃ ) is also called
3
‘∃ ’, and we will use a similar convention for other functionals.
Thirdly, the comprehension for Cantor space functional, introduced in [37], yields
a conservative extension of WKL0 by [23, Prop. 3.15]:


(∃κ30 ≤3 1)(∀Y 2 ) κ0 (Y ) = 0 ↔ (∃f ∈ C)(Y (f ) > 0) .
(κ30 )

Fourth, recall that the Heine-Borel theorem (aka Cousin’s lemma) states the existence of a finite sub-cover for an open cover of a compact space. Now, a functional
Ψ : R → R+ gives rise to the canonical cover ∪x∈I IxΨ for I ≡ [0, 1], where IxΨ is
the open interval (x − Ψ(x), x + Ψ(x)). Hence, the uncountable cover ∪x∈I IxΨ has
a finite sub-cover by the Heine-Borel theorem; in symbols:
(∀Ψ : R → R+ )(∃hy1 , . . . , yk i)(∀x ∈ I)(∃i ≤ k)(x ∈ IyΨi ).

(HBU)

There is also the highly similar Lindelöf lemma stating the existence of a countable
sub-cover of possibly non-compact spaces. We restrict ourselves to R as follows.
Ψ
(∀Ψ : R → R+ )(∃Φ0→1 )(∀x ∈ R)(∃n0 )(x ∈ IΦ(n)
),

(LIN)

REVERSE MATHEMATICS OF TOPOLOGY

ω
1
By the results in [36,37], Zω
2 proves HBU, but Πk -CA0 cannot (for k ≥ 1). The same
0,1
holds for LIN, if we add QF-AC , while the latter implies HBU ↔ [WKL + LIN].
The importance/naturalness of HBU and LIN is discussed in Section 3.1.
Furthermore, since Cantor space (denoted C or 2N ) is homeomorphic to a closed
subset of [0, 1], the former inherits the same property. In particular, for any G2 ,
∗
the corresponding ‘canonical cover’ of 2N is ∪f ∈2N [f G(f )] where [σ 0 ] is the set of
all binary extensions of σ. By compactness, there is a finite sequence hf0 , . . . , fn i
such that the set of ∪i≤n [f¯i F (fi )] still covers 2N . By [36, Theorem 3.3], HBU is
equivalent to the same compactness property for C, as follows:

(∀G2 )(∃hf1 , . . . , fk i)(∀f 1 ≤1 1)(∃i ≤ k)(f ∈ [fi G(fi )]).

(HBUc )

2→1∗

We now introduce the specification SCF(Θ) for a functional Θ
which computes
such a finite sub-cover. We refer to such a functional Θ as a realiser for the
compactness of Cantor space, and simplify its type to ‘3’ to improve readability.
(∀G2 )(∀f 1 ≤1 1)(∃g ∈ Θ(G))(f ∈ [gG(g)]).

(SCF(Θ))

Clearly, there is no unique Θ as in SCF(Θ) (just add more binary sequences to
Θ(G)); nonetheless, we have in the past referred to any Θ satisfying SCF(Θ) as
‘the’ special fan functional Θ, and we will continue this abuse of language.
3. Reverse Mathematics of Topology
We study the RM of theorems of topology pertaining to the following notions:
(topological) dimension and the Urysohn identity (Section 3.2) and paracompactness (Section 3.3). We introduce a suitable notion of cover (Section 3.1) and show
(Section 3.4) that our aforementioned results are independent of the definition of
cover, without making use of the axiom of choice. We discuss similar results for the
Lindelöf lemma and partitions of unity (Section 3.4).
3.1. Introduction: topology in higher-order arithmetic. We discuss how
higher-order arithmetic can accommodate the central topological notion of cover.
In particular, we introduce a generalisation of the notion of cover used in [36, 37]
and shall show in Section 3.4 that the new notion yields covering lemmas equivalent
to the original, without a need for the axiom of countable choice.
First of all, early covering lemmas, like the Cousin and Lindelöf lemmas, did not
make use of the (general) notion of cover. Indeed, Cousin and Lindelöf talk about
(uncountable) covers of R2 and Rn as follows (resp. in 1895 and 1903):
we suppose that to each point of S corresponds a circle of non-zero
finite radius and with this point as centre ([6, p. 22] )
for every point P, let us construct a sphere SP with P as the centre
and a variable radius ρP ([25, p. 698]))
To stay close to the original formulation by Cousin and Lindelöf, we introduced
in [36, 37] the notion of ‘canonical’ open covers ∪x∈I IxΨ of I ≡ [0, 1] generated by
Ψ : I → R+ and where IxΨ ≡ (x − Ψ(x), x + Ψ(x)). Unfortunately, such covers
always involve points that are covered by arbitrarily many intervals; this property
makes such covers unsuitable for e.g. the study of topological dimension, in which
the (minimal) number of intervals covering a point is central.
Secondly, the previous observation shows that we have to generalise our notion of
canonical cover, and we shall do this by considering ψ : I → R. i.e. we allow empty

6

REVERSE MATHEMATICS OF TOPOLOGY

Ixψ . In this way, we say that ‘∪x∈I Ixψ covers [0, 1]’ if (∀x ∈ I)(∃y ∈ I)(x ∈ Iyψ ).
This notion of cover gives rise to the following version of the Heine-Borel theorem.


(HBT)
(∀ψ : I → R) I ⊂ ∪x∈I Ixψ → (∃y1 , . . . , yk ∈ I)(I ⊂ ∪i≤k Iyψi ) .
We establish in Section 3.4 that our ‘new’ notion of cover is quite robust by showing
1,1
that (i) HBU ↔ HBT over RCAω
, i.e. the new notion of cover is not
0 + QF-AC
a real departure from the old one, and (ii) the previous equivalence can also be
proved without the axiom of choice. Item (ii) should be viewed in the light of the
topological ‘disasters’ (See e.g. [20]) that apparently happen in the absence of the
axiom of (countable) choice. We also show that any notion of cover definable in
Zω
2 inherits the aforementioned ‘nice’ properties. Thus, we may conclude that our
results boast a lot of robustness, and in particular that they do not depend on the
definition of cover, even in the absence of the axiom of (countable) choice.
Finally, we discuss the mathematical naturalness of HBU and (∃2 ).
Remark 3.1. Dirichlet already discusses the characteristic function of the rationals, which is essentially ∃2 , around 1829 in [11], while Riemann defines a function with countably many discontinuities via a series in his Habilitationsschrift
([22, p. 115]). Furthermore, the Cousin lemma from [6, p. 22], which is essentially
HBU, dates back2 about 135 years. As shown in [36], (∃2 ) and HBU are essential
for the development of the gauge integral ([3]). This integral was introduced by
Denjoy ([7]), in a different, more complicated form, around the same time as the
Lebesgue integral; the reformulation of Denjoy’s integral by Henstock and Kurzweil
in Riemann-esque terms (See [3, p. 15]), provides a direct and elegant formalisation
of the Feynman path integral ([5, 28, 30]) and financial mathematics ([29, 30]).
3.2. The notion of dimension. The notion of dimension of basic spaces like [0, 1]
or Rn is intuitively clear to most mathematicians, but finding a formal definition
of dimension that does not depend on the topology is a non-trivial problem.
We introduce three notions of dimension: the topological dimension dim X and
the small and large inductive dimensions ind X and Ind X. We study the RM
properties of the Uryoshn identity ([1, p. 272]) which expresses that these dimension
are equal for a large class of spaces, including separable metric spaces.
First of all, the covering dimension, later generalised to the topological dimension,
goes back to Lebesgue. Indeed, Munkres writes the following:
We shall define, for an arbitrary topological space X, a notion of
topological dimension. It is the “covering dimension” originally
defined by Lebesgue. ([31, p. 305])
The following definition of topological dimension may be found in Munkres’ seminal
monograph [31, p. 161], and in [1, p. 274], [13, Ex. 1.7.E and Prop. 3.2.2].
Definition 3.2. [Order] A collection A of subsets of the space X is said to have
order m + 1 if some point of A lies in m + 1 elements of A, and no point of X lies
in more than m + 1 elements of A.
2The collected works of Pincherle contain a footnote by the editors (See [38, p. 67]) which
states that the associated Teorema (published in 1882) corresponds to the Heine-Borel theorem.
Moreover, Weierstrass proves the Heine-Borel theorem (without explicitly formulating it) in 1880
in [50, p. 204]. A detailed motivation for these claims may be found in [26, p. 96-97].

Definition 3.3. [Refinement] Given a collection A of subsets of X, a collection B
is said to refine A, or to be a refinement of A if for each element B ∈ B there is an
element A ∈ A such that A ⊂ B.
Definition 3.4. [Topological dimension] A space X is said to be finite-dimensional
if there is m ∈ N such that for every open covering A of X, there is an open covering
B of X that refines A and has order at most m + 1. The topological dimension of
X is the smallest value of m for which this statement holds; we denote it by dim X.
In the context of RCAω
0 , we say that ‘φ : I → R is a refinement of ψ : I → R’
if (∀x ∈ I)(∃y ∈ I)(Ixφ ⊆ Iyψ ). With this definition in place, statements like ‘the
topological dimension of [0, 1] is at most 1’, denoted ‘dim([0, 1]) ≤ 1’, makes perfect
sense in RCAω
0 . Such a statement turns out to be quite hard to prove, as full
second-order arithmetic is needed to prove HBT by Theorem 3.15.
1,1
Theorem 3.5. The system ACAω
+ [dim([0, 1]) ≤ 1] proves HBT.
0 + QF-AC

Proof. Let ψ : I → R be such that ∪x∈I Ixψ covers [0, 1], and let φ : I → R be the
associated refinement of order at most 1. Since the innermost formula is Σ01 (with
parameters), we may apply QF-AC1,1 to (∀x ∈ I)(∃y ∈ I)(x ∈ Iyφ ) to obtain Ξ1→1
such that Ξ(x) provides such y. Define ζ 0→1 as follows: ζ(0) := Ξ(0) + φ(Ξ(0)) and
ζ(n + 1) := Ξ(ζ(n)) + φ(Ξ(ζ(n))). Now consider the following formula:
(∃x ∈ I)(∀n ∈ N)(ζ(n) <R x).

If (3.1) is false, take x = 1 and note that if ζ(n0 ) ≥R 1, the finite sequence

case, we apply QF-AC1,1 (using also (∃2 )) to (∀x ∈ I)(∃y ∈ I)(Ixφ ⊆ Iyψ ) to go from
a finite sub-cover of ∪x∈I Ixφ to a finite sub-cover of ∪x∈I Ixψ , and HBT follows.
If (3.1) is true, let x0 ∈ I be the least x ∈ I such that ϕ(x) ≡ (∀n ∈ N)(ζ(n) <R
x). Since ϕ(x) is Π01 , we can use ∃2 and the usual interval-halving technique to find
x0 ; alternatively, use the monotone convergence theorem ([43, III.2.2]), provable in
φ
covers x0 , and thus for n1 large enough, ζ(n) for n ≥ n1 will
ACA0 . However, IΞ(x

dim([0, 1]) ≤ 1, and hence (3.1) must be false, and we are done.

The previous theorem has a number of corollaries. First of all, we obtain an
equivalence over a weak base theory; we believe the components of the left-hand
side to be independent3, i.e. that a proper ‘splitting’ of HBT is achieved.

by the results in [35, §6]. Secondly, dim(I) = 1 seems to be consistent with recursive mathematics

Cantor space by WKL (See [23, Prop. 3.7 and 3.12] and [24, Prop. 4.10]). Now
consider the following statement, which (only) holds since ψ : I → R is continuous:
(3.2)
(∀f ∈ C)(∃q ∈ I ∩ Q)(∃n ∈ N)(r(f ) ∈ Iqψ ∧ ψ(q) ≥ 21n ),
P∞ f (n)
where r(f ) is n=0 2n for binary f , and where the underlined formula is Σ01 .
Applying QF-AC1,0 to (3.2), there is Ξ2 such that n ≤ Ξ(f ) in (3.2). Since Ξ is
bounded on C, there is N0 ∈ N such that
(∀f ∈ C)(∃q ∈ I ∩ Q)(r(f ) ∈ Iqψ ∧ ψ(q) ≥

),

(3.3)

∪x∈I Ixψ

which immediately implies that
has a finite sub-cover (generated by rationals), and the latter may be found by applying QF-AC1,0 to (3.3) and iterating the
choice function at most 2N0 +1 times. Since 2in has an obvious binary representation, we do not need to convert arbitrary x ∈ I to binary. We obtain HBT in each
case, and (∃2 ) ∨ ¬(∃2 ) finishes the proof.
For the reverse direction, note that HBT → HBU → WKL. To prove dim(I) = 1,
the finite sub-cover provided by HBT is readily converted to a refinement of order 1
using ∃2 , as the latter functional can decide equality between real numbers. Now,
in case ¬(∃2 ), obtain (3.3) in the same way as above, and let Ξ be a choice function
that provides Ξ(f ) = q. Define ζ as follows: ζ(0) := Ξ(00 . . . ) + 2N1 0 and ζ(n + 1) :=
Ξ(ζ(n)) + 2N1 0 . For n > 2N0 +1 , this function readily yields a finite open cover of I
that is also a refinement of the cover generated by ψ. Since all points are rationals,
we can refine this cover to have order 1, and (∃2 ) ∨ ¬(∃2 ) finishes the proof.

 For future reference, we note
 that the proof actually establishes RCA0 + ¬(∃ ) ⊢
[WKL + dim(I) = 1] ↔ HBT , i.e. the axiom of choice is not used.
It is a natural question (posed before by Hirschfeldt; see [27, §6.1]) whether the
axiom of choice is really necessary in the previous (and below) theorems. We answer
this question in the negative in Section 3.4.
Next, in order to prove the next corollary concerning Urysohn’s identity, we
introduce the notion of inductive definition as in [13, §1.1.1].

Definition 3.7. [Inductive dimension] We inductively define the emphsmall inductive dimensionind X for a topological space X as follows.
(d1) For the empty set ∅, we define ind ∅ = Ind ∅ = −1;
(d2) ind X ≤ n, where n = 0, 1, . . . , if for every point x ∈ X and each neighbourhood V ⊂ X of the point x there exists an open set U ⊂ X such that
x ∈ U ⊂ V and ind (∂U ) < n − 1;
(d3) ind X = n if ind X ≤ n and ind X > n−1, i.e., the inequality ind X < n−1
does not hold;
(d4) ind X = ∞ if ind X > n for n = −1, 0, 1, ....
The large inductive dimension Ind X is obtained by replacing (d2) by:
(d2∗ ) Ind X < n, where n = 0, 1, ..., if for every closed set A ⊂ X and each open
set V ⊂ X which contains the set A there exists an open set U ⊂ X such
that A ⊂ U ⊂ V and Ind (∂U ) < n − 1.
If X is Euclidean space, V is generally chosen to be a ball centred at x.
In light of Definition 3.7, the (small and large) inductive dimension of real numbers, or the unit interval, makes sense in RCAω
0 , and is respectively 0 and 1. Moreover, the Urysohn identity is the statement that dim X = indX = IndX, and holds

for a large class of spaces X; this identity constitutes one of the main problems in
dimension theory, according to [1, p. 274], while it is called the the fundamental
theorem of dimension theory in [13].
1,1
Corollary 3.8. The system RCAω
proves that HBT is equivalent to:
0 + QF-AC
the conjunction of WKL and Urysohn’s identity for the unit interval.

Proof. Immediate from Corollary 3.6.

3.3. Paracompactness. The notion of paracompactness was introduced in 1944
by Dieudonné in [9] and plays an important role in the characterisation of metrisable
spaces via e.g. Smirnov’s metrisation theorem ([31, p. 261]). The fact that every
metric space is paracompact is Stone’s theorem (See [17, 45] and [31, p. 252]).
Our interest in paracompactness stems in part from its occurrence in classical
RM (See e.g. [33, 34, 43]), as detailed in Remark 3.13. The aim of this section
is to show that there is a huge difference in logical and computational hardness
between the ‘second-order/countable’ version of paracompactness, and the ‘actual’
definition. Indeed, the fact that the unit interval is paracompact implies HBT;
moreover, the latter can be ‘split’ into the former plus WKL by Corollary 3.12.
Munkres states the following definition of paracompactness in [31, p. 253].
Definition 3.9. [Locally finite] A collection A of subsets of a space X is locally
finite if any x ∈ X has a neighbourhood that intersects only finitely many A ∈ A.
Definition 3.10. [Paracompact] A space X is paracompact if every open covering
A of X has a locally finite open refinement B that covers X.
With these definitions, the statement that the unit interval is paracompact,
makes sense in RCAω
0 . By Stone’s theorem, a metric space is paracompact, but this
fact is not provable in ZF alone (See [17]). Similarly, Stone’s theorem for the unit
interval is not provable in any system Π1k -CAω
0 by the following theorem.
1,1
Theorem 3.11. The system ACAω
+‘[0, 1] is paracompact’ proves HBT.
0 +QF-AC

Proof. We use the proof of Theorem 3.5 with minor modification. Let ψ : I → R be
such that ∪x∈I Ixψ covers [0, 1], and let φ : I → R be a locally finite refinement. Assume (3.1), where let x0 ∈ I, ζ 0→1 , Ξ1,1 are as in the aforementioned proof. Clearly,
φ
any neighbourhood of x0 will contain all intervals IΞ(ζ(n))
for n large enough. This
observation contradicts the assumption that [0, 1] is paracompact, and hence (3.1)
must be false, implying HBT as in the proof of Theorem 3.5.

The following corollary is proved in the same way as Corollary 3.6; the lefthand side constitutes a proper ‘splitting’ of HBT, as the ECF-translation of ‘[0, 1] is
paracompact’ is essentially the statement that [0, 1] is countably paracompact, and
the latter is provable in RCA0 by [43, II.7.2].
1,1
Corollary 3.12. RCAω
proves [WKL + ‘[0, 1] is paracompact’] ↔ HBT.
0 + QF-AC

Another interpretation of the previous corollary is as follows: by the results in
[49], the notion of compactness is equivalent to ‘paracompact plus pseudo-compact’
for a large class of spaces, and pseudo-compactness essentially expresses that continuous functions are bounded on the space at hand, i.e. the pseudo-compactness
of [0, 1] is equivalent to WKL by [43, IV.2.3] and [24, Prop. 4.10].

REVERSE MATHEMATICS OF TOPOLOGY

The following remark highlights the difference between ‘actual’ and ‘secondorder/countable’ paracompactness. It also suggests formulating Corollary 3.14.
Remark 3.13 (Paracompactness in second-order RM). Simpson proves in [43,
II.7.2] that over RCA0 , complete separable metric spaces are countably paracompact4, and Mummert in [34, Lemma 4.11] defines a realiser for paracompactness as
in [43, II.7.2] inside ACA0 . This realiser plays a crucial role in the proof of Mummert’s metrisation theorem, called ‘MFMT’, inside Π12 -CA0 (See [34, §4]). Note
that Π12 -CA0 occurs elsewhere in the RM of topology ([32, 33]). By Theorem 3.11,
the (higher-order) statement the unit interval is paracompact is equivalent to HBT,
and hence not provable in ∪k Π1k -CAω
0 , i.e. there is a huge difference in strength between ‘second-order/countable’ and ‘actual’ paracompactness. In fact, the logical
hardness of the aforementioned statement dwarfs Π12 -CA0 from the RM of topology.
Let us call Ω1→1 a ‘realiser for the paracompactness of [0, 1]’ if Ω(ψ)(1) : I → R
yields a locally finite open refinement of the cover associated to ψ : I → R, and if
ψ
),
(∀x ∈ I)(IxΩ(ψ)(1) ⊆ IΩ(ψ)(2)(x)

(3.4)

i.e. the refining cover is ‘effectively’ included in the original one, just like in [34, 43].
Corollary 3.14. A realiser Ω1→1 for the paracompactness of [0, 1], together with
Feferman’s µ, computes Θ such that SCF(Θ) via a term of Gödel’s T .
Proof. Immediate from the proof of Theorems 3.5 and 3.11. Note that Ξ is the
identity function in case we consider covers generated by Ψ : I → R+ as in HBU.
Furthermore, a realiser for HBU computes a realiser for HBUc , i.e. the special fan
functional, via a term in Gödel’s T , as discussed in [36, §3.1]

As it turns out, the condition (3.4) for a realiser for paracompactness has already
been considered, namely as follows.
all proofs of Stone’s Theorem (known to the authors) actually prove
a stronger conclusion which implies AC. It is based on an idea from
[. . . ]. Let us call a refinement V of U effective if there is a function
a : V → U such that V ⊂ a(V ) for all V ∈ V. ([17, p. 1217])
As it turns out, the notion of ‘effectively paracompact’ is intimately connected to
the Lindelöf lemma, as discussed in Section 3.4.3.
3.4. Covers in higher-order arithmetic. In Section 3.1, we introduced a generalisation of the notion of cover used in [36,37]. In this section, we show that the new
notion yields covering lemmas equivalent to the original, even in the absence of the
axiom of choice. We also show that any notion of cover definable in second-order
arithmetic inherits these ‘nice’ properties. We treat the Heine-Borel theorem, the
Lindelöf lemma, as well as theorems pertaining to partitions of unity.
3.4.1. The Heine-Borel theorem. We prove HBT ↔ HBU with and without the
axiom of choice in the base theory. In this way, our new notion of cover does not
really change the Heine-Borel theorem.
1,1
Theorem 3.15. The system RCAω
proves HBU ↔ HBT.
0 + QF-AC
4The notion of ‘countably paracompact’ is well-known from Dowker’s theorem (See e.g. [21, p.
172]), but Simpson and Mummert do not use the qualifier ‘countable’ in [34, 43].

Proof. The reverse direction is immediate. For the forward direction, in case ¬(∃2 ),
we obtain HBU → WKL and proceed as in the proof of Corollary 3.6. In case of (∃2 ),
let ψ be as in HBT and consider (∀x ∈ I)(∃y ∈ I)(x ∈ Iyψ ). Since the innermost
ψ
formula is Σ01 , we may apply QF-AC1,1 to obtain Ξ such that (∀x ∈ I)(x ∈ IΞ(x)
).
Since ∃2 provides a functional that converts real numbers in I to a unique binary
representation, we may assume that Ξ is extensional on the reals. Now define
Ψ : I → R+ by Ψ(x) := min |x − (Ξ(x) − ψ(Ξ(x)))|, |x − (Ξ(x) + ψ(Ξ(x)))| , and

Recall that HBU is provable in Zω

While the use of QF-AC1,1 in HBU → HBT seems essential, it is in fact not, by the
following theorem. Note that IND is the induction axiom for all formulas in the
language of RCAω
0 ; the base theory is not stronger than Peano arithmetic.

Theorem 3.16. The system RCAω

Proof. The reverse direction is immediate. For the forward direction, in case ¬(∃2 ),
we obtain HBU → WKL and proceed as in the proof of Corollary 3.6. In case of
(∃2 ), let ψ be as in HBT and note that (∀x ∈ I)(∃y ∈ I)(x ∈ Iyψ ) implies:

where the underlined formula is decidable thanks to (∃3 ) ≡ [(∃2 ) + (κ30 )]. Hence,
applying QF-AC1,0 to (3.5), we obtain Ψ : I → R+ such that ∪x∈I IxΨ is a canonical
cover of I. Applying HBU, we obtain a finite sub-cover of ∪x∈I IxΨ , say generated
by x1 , . . . , xk ∈ I. By definition, we have (∀x ∈ I)(∃y ∈ I)(IxΨ ⊆ Iyψ ), and

a finite sub-cover for ∪x∈I Ixψ . The law of excluded middle finishes the proof.

As to open questions, we do not know if the base theory proves HBT outright or
3
not. Similarly, we do not know if RCAω
0 + (κ0 ) proves WKL or not.
In conclusion, we mention two important observations that stem from the above.
First of all, it is easy to see that the first two proofs go through for the HeineBorel theorem for [0, 1] based on any ‘reasonable’ notion of cover. Indeed, as long as
the formulas ‘x ∈ Uy ’ and ‘[a, b] ⊆ Ux ’ for the new notion of cover ∪x∈I Ux of I are
ω
3
decidable in Zω
2 , the above proofs go through (assuming (κ0 )). Since Z2 can decide
if Y : R → {0, 1} represents an open subset of R (using the textbook definition of
open set), this notion of ‘reasonable’ seems quite reasonable.
Secondly, emulating the proof of Theorem 3.16, we observe that the above results
go through in the base theory with (κ30 ) + IND instead of QF-AC1,1 . These include
Theorem 3.5, Corollary 3.6, Corollary 3.8, Theorem 3.11, and Corollary 3.12. Thus,
these results do not require the axiom of choice.
3.4.2. The Lindelöf lemma. We show that the Lindelöf lemma does not depend on
the definition of cover, similar to the case of the Heine-Borel theorem. On one
hand, since [LIN + WKL] ↔ HBU, one expects such results. On the other hand, as

12

REVERSE MATHEMATICS OF TOPOLOGY

shown in [37, §5], the strength of the Lindelöf lemma is highly dependent on the
exact5 formulation, but this dependence is not problematic for our context.
We introduce the notion of cover used in [37, §5], as follows. We consider ψ : I →
R2 and covers ∪x∈I Jxψ in which the interval Jxψ := (ψ(x)(1), ψ(x)(2)) is potentially
empty but (∀x ∈ I)(∃y ∈ I)(x ∈ Jyψ ). This notion of cover yields a ‘strong’ version
of the Lindelöf lemma, as follows.


(∀ψ : R → R2 ) R ⊆ ∪x∈R Jxψ → (∃f : N → R)(R ⊂ ∪n∈N Jfψ(n) ) .
(LIL)
Similar to the proof of [36, Theorem 3.13], one proves that HBT ↔ [WKL + LIL]
1,1
over RCAω
. We first prove that the Lindelöf lemma LIL is equivalent to
0 + QF-AC
LIN from [36, §3]. We believe that LIN does not imply countable choice QF-AC0,1 .
1,1
Theorem 3.17. The system RCAω
proves LIN ↔ LIL.
0 + QF-AC

Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 3.15: the reverse direction is immediate,
while in case of ¬(∃2 ) each principle is provable in RCAω
0 using the sub-cover consisting of all rationals. In case of (∃2 ), let ψ be as in LIL and consider (∀x ∈ R)(∃y ∈
R)(x ∈ Jyψ ). Since the innermost formula is Σ01 , we may apply QF-AC1,1 to obtain
ψ
Ξ such that (∀x ∈ R)(x ∈ JΞ(x)
). Since ∃2 provides a functional that converts real
numbers to a binary representation, we may assume that Ξ is extensional on the
 reals. Now define Ψ : I → R+ by Ψ(x) := min |x−ψ(Ξ(x))(1)|, |x−ψ(Ξ(x))(2)| , and
ψ
. Applying LIN, we obtain a countable sub-cover of ∪x∈I IxΨ ,
note that IxΨ ⊆ JΞ(x)
ψ
say generated by Φ0→1 , and ∪i∈N IΞ(Φ(i))
is a countable sub-cover of ∪x∈I Ixψ .



For completeness, we also mention the following corollary.
1,1
Corollary 3.18. RCAω
proves LIL ↔ dim(R) ≤ 1 ↔ R is paracompact.
0 + QF-AC

Proof. We only prove the equivalence between LIL and the paracompactness of R.
By Theorem 3.17, it suffices to prove LIN. In case ¬(∃2 ), the latter is provable outright, as all R → R-functions are continuous, and then the rationals provide a countable sub-cover for any open cover as in LIN. Similarly, paracompactness reduces to
countable paracompactness, and the latter is provable in RCAω
0 by [43, II.7.2]. In
case of (∃2 ), the paracompactness of R (and hence I with minor modification) implies HBT by Theorem 3.11, and the aforementioned result HBT ↔ [WKL+LIL] over
1,1
RCAω
finishes the forward direction. The reverse direction is straight0 + QF-AC
forward as ∃2 decides inequalities between reals, and hence can easily refine the
countable sub-cover provided by LIL.

As it turns out, we can avoid the use of QF-AC1,1 as follows
0,1
3
Theorem 3.19. The system RCAω
] ↔ LIL.
0 + (κ0 ) + IND proves [LIN + QF-AC

Proof. For the forward implication, in case ¬(∃2 ), the rationals provides a countable
sub-cover, as all functions on the reals are continuous by [23, Prop. 3.7]. In case of
(∃2 ), fix ψ : R → R2 as in LIL and formulate a version of (3.5) as follows:

(3.7)
(∀x ∈ R)(∃n ∈ N)(∃y ∈ R) (x − 21n , x + 21n ) ⊆ Jyψ ,
5The countable sub-cover in the Lindelöf lemma can be given by a sequence of reals generating
the intervals (strong version), or just a sequence of intervals (weak version). The strong version
implies QF-AC0,1 and hence is unprovable in ZF, while the weak version is provable in Zω
2.

The underlined formula is again decidable thanks to ∃3 , and QF-AC1,0 yields a functional Ψ : R → R+ such that the canonical cover also ∪x∈R IxΨ covers R. Applying

For the reverse implication, note that LIL → QF-AC0,1 follows from [37, Theo3

0 + (κ0 ) allows us to generalise the class of
covers, as discussed in [37, Remark 5.9]. With that, we are done.

(3.9)

In conclusion, it is easy to see that the proofs of this section go through for the
Lindelöf lemma for R based on any ‘reasonable’ notion of cover. Indeed, as long as
the formulas ‘x ∈ Uy ’ and ‘[a, b] ⊆ Ux ’ for the new notion of cover ∪x∈R Ux of R are
ω
3
decidable in Zω
2 , the above proofs go through (assuming (κ0 )). Since Z2 can decide
if Y : R → {0, 1} represents an open subset of R (using the textbook definition of
open set), this notion of ‘reasonable’ again seems quite reasonable.
3.4.3. Partitions of unity. The notion of partition of unity was introduced in 1937
by Dieudonné in [10] and this notion is equivalent to paracompactness in a rather
general setting by [14, Theorem 5.1.9]. We study partitions of unity in this section
motivated as follows: on one hand, Simpson proves the existence of partitions of
unity for complete separable spaces in the proof of [43, II.7.2], i.e. this notion
has been studied in RM. On the other hand, despite the equivalence, partitions
of unity have nicer RM properties than paracompactness: we obtain versions of
Theorems 3.16 and 3.19 where the base theory is conservative over RCAω
0 , while
there is also a nice connection to the Lindelöf lemma.
The definition of partition of unity is as follows in Munkres [31, p. 258]
Definition 3.21. Let {Uα }α∈J be an indexed open covering of X. An indexed
family of continuous functions φα : X → [0, 1] is said to be a partition of unity on
X, dominated7 by {Uα }, if:
(1) support(φα ) ⊂ Uα for each α ∈ J.
(2) The
P indexed family {support(φα )}α∈J is locally finite.
(3)
α∈J φα (x) = 1 for each x ∈ X.

where support(f ) is the closure of the open set {x ∈ X : f (x) 6= 0}.
6In LIN, any x ∈ R is covered by I Ψ , while in LIL any x ∈ R is covered by J ψ for some y ∈ R. In
y
x
the former case, we ‘know’ which interval covers the point, while in the latter case, we only know
that it exists. We believe this (seemingly minor) difference determines whether one can obtain
QF-AC0,1 (like in the case of LIL) or not (in the case of LIN, we conjecture). Indeed, applying
QF-AC1,0 to the conclusion of LIL, we obtain a functional that provides for any x ∈ R, an interval
Jyψ covering x, i.e. LIL clearly exhibits ‘axiom of choice’ behaviour, while LIN does not.
7Munkres uses ‘dominated by’ in [31] instead of Engelking’s ‘subordinate to’ in [14].

14

Note that the second item implies that the sum in the third one makes sense.
With these definitions in place, PUNI(I) is the statement that for any cover
generated by ψ : I → R, there is a partition of unity of I dominated by ∪x∈I Ixψ .
3
Theorem 3.22. The system RCAω
0 + (κ0 ) proves [WKL + PUNI(I)] ↔ HBT.

Proof. In case of ¬(∃2 ), the equivalence is easy: all R → R-functions are continuous
and PUNI(I) is provable as in the proof of [43, II.7.2], while HBT follows from WKL
as in the proof of Corollary 3.6. In case of (∃2 ), the reverse implication is also
straightforward: the finite sub-cover provided by HBT is readily refined, and the
existence of a partition of unity for a finite cover follows from [43, II.7.1].
Finally, for the forward direction assuming (∃2 ), let ψ : I → R be as in HBT
and obtain φ : I 2 → R as in PUNI(I), i.e. for Ux := support(φ(x, ·)), the open cover
∪x∈I Ux of I is locally finite and satisfies Ux ⊂ Ixψ . Now consider:

(3.10)
(∀x ∈ I)(∃n ∈ N)(∃y ∈ I) (x − 21n , x + 21n ) ⊆ Uy ,
Applying QF-AC1,0 to (3.10), since ∃3 is given, we obtain Ψ : I → R+ such that
IxΨ ⊂ Ux for all x ∈ I. Now repeat the proof of Theorem 3.11 for Ψ in place of φ,
which yields y1 , . . . yk ∈ I such ∪i≤k IxΨ is a finite sub-cover of I. Note that in the
previous ‘repeated proof’, we do not need the choice function Ξ (from the proof of
Theorem 3.5), as IxΨ covers x for any x ∈ I. Since IxΨ ⊂ Ux , ∪i≤k Uyi is a finite
sub-cover of ∪x∈I Ux , and since Ux ⊂ Ixψ , ∪i≤k Iyψi is a finite sub-cover as required
by HBT, and we are done.

3
Corollary 3.23. The system RCAω
0 + (κ0 ) + PUNI(I) proves HBU ↔ HBT.

Note that previous base theory in the corollary (and hence the theorem) is conservative over RCAω
0 by [23, Prop. 3.12] and the proof of [43, II.7.2].
Finally, we obtain a theorem that brings together a number of different strands
from this paper, including effective paracompactness, first discussed at the end of
Section 3.3. In the context of RCAω
0 , we say that ‘φ : R → R is an effective refinement
ψ
of ψ : R → R’ if (∃ξ : R → R)(∀x ∈ R)(Ixφ ⊆ Iξ(x)
). Effective paracompactness
expresses the existence of an effective refinement for any open cover. Moreover,
PUNI(R) is the statement that for any cover generated by ψ : R → R2 , there is a
partition of unity φ : R2 → R2 dominated by ∪x∈I Jxψ .
3
Theorem 3.24. The system RCAω
0 + (κ0 ) proves the following

PUNI(R) ↔ LIL ↔ R is effectively paracompact.
Proof. We first prove the first equivalence. In case of ¬(∃2 ), the equivalence is easy:
all R → R-functions are continuous and PUNI(R) is provable as in the proof of [43,
II.7.2], while LIL follows by taking the countable sub-cover given by the rationals.
In case of (∃2 ), the reverse implication is also straightforward: the countable subcover provided by LIL is readily refined, and the existence of a partition of unity
for a countable cover follows from [43, II.7.1].
Finally, for the forward direction assuming (∃2 ), let ψ : R → R2 be as in LIL and
obtain φ : R2 → R2 as in PUNI(R), i.e. for Ux := support(φ(x, ·)), the open cover
∪x∈R Ux of R is locally finite and satisfies Ux ⊂ Ixψ . Now consider:

(3.11)
(∀x ∈ R)(∃n ∈ N)(∃y ∈ R) (x − 21n , x + 21n ) ⊆ Uy ,

REVERSE MATHEMATICS OF TOPOLOGY

15

Applying QF-AC1,0 to (3.11), since ∃3 is given, we obtain Ψ : R → R+ such that
IxΨ ⊂ Ux for all x ∈ R. Now repeat the proof of Theorem 3.11 for Ψ in place of φ
and R instead of I. Then instead of (3.1), we obtain
(∀x ∈ R)(∃n ∈ N)(ζ(n) ≥R |x|).

(3.12)

Note that in the aforementioned ‘repeated proof’, we do not need the choice function
Ξ (from the proof of Theorem 3.5), as IxΨ covers x for any x ∈ I. Applying QF-AC1,0
Ψ
to (3.12), we obtain Φ0→1 such that ∪n∈N IΦ(n)
is a countable sub-cover of the
Ψ
canonical cover generated by Ψ. Since IxΨ ⊂ Ux , ∪n∈N IΦ(n)
is a countable sub-cover
ψ
of ∪x∈R Ux , and since Ux ⊂ Ixψ , ∪n∈N IΦ(n)
is a countable sub-cover as required by
LIL. For the second equivalence, we note that the previous proof only makes use
of the fact that φ : R2 → R2 is effectively paracompact (via the identity function).
Thus, the second equivalence follows in the same way, and we are done.

4. Conclusion
We have studied the higher-order RM of topology, the notions of dimension and
paracompactness in particular. Basic theorems regarding the latter turn out to be
equivalent to the Heine-Borel theorem for uncountable covers, i.e. the former are
extremely hard to prove (in terms of comprehension axioms). A number of nice
splittings was obtained, and we have shown that these results do not depend on the
exact definition of cover, even in the absence of the axiom of choice. Finally, we
obtained similar results for the Lindelöf lemma. We refer to Figure 1 for a visual
depiction of our results vis-à-vis the Gödel hierarchy.
Regarding future work, the following two topics come to mind. Firstly, there
are a number of notions weaker than paracompactness, and it is an interesting
question if there are natural such notions that yield equivalences with HBT or
weaker theorems. Secondly, in light of Remark 3.13, it seems interesting to study
metrisation theorems in higher-order RM. We expect that such theorems go far
beyond Π12 -CA0 , which features in the second-order RM of topology.

Appendix A. The Gödel Hierarchy
The Gödel hierarchy is a collection of logical systems ordered via consistency
strength, or essentially equivalent: ordered via inclusion8. This hierarchy is claimed
to capture most systems that are ‘natural’ or have ‘foundational import’, as follows.
It is striking that a great many foundational theories are linearly
ordered by <. Of course it is possible to construct pairs of artificial
theories which are incomparable under <. However, this is not the
case for the “natural” or non-artificial theories which are usually
regarded as significant in the foundations of mathematics. ([42])
8Simpson states in [42, p. 112] that inclusion and consistency strength yield the same hierarchy
as depicted in [42, Table 1], i.e. one gets the ‘same’ Gödel hierarchy.

16

REVERSE MATHEMATICS OF TOPOLOGY

Arguably, the Gödel hierarchy is a central object of study in mathematical logic, as
also stated by Simpson in [42, p. 112]. However, the above results imply that e.g.
HBT and basic topological theorems dealing with dimension and paracompactness,
do not fit the Gödel hierarchy. The same holds for basic properties of the gauge
integral, including many covering lemmas (See [36]), as well as for so-called uniform
theorems (See [37]) in which the objects claimed to exist depend on few of the
parameters of the theorem. In particular, the aforementioned theorems yield a
branch that is completely independent of the medium range of the Gödel hierarchy
(with the latter based on inclusion8 ), as depicted in the following figure (where we
assume the ordering based on inclusion):

Figure 1. The Gödel hierarchy with a side-branch for the medium range
Some remarks on the technical details concerning Figure 1 are as follows.
(1) Note that we use a non-essential modification of the Gödel hierarchy,
namely involving systems of higher-order arithmetic, like e.g. ACAω
0 instead
of ACA0 ; these systems are (at least) Π12 -conservative over the associated
second-order system (See e.g. [39, Theorem 2.2]).
(2) The system Zω
2 is placed between the medium and strong range, as the
combination of the recursor R2 from Gödel’s T and ∃3 yields a system
ω
1
stronger than Zω
2 . The system Πk -CA0 does not change in the same way.

(3) While HBT clearly implies WKL, the paracompactness of the unit interval
does not (by the ECF-translation); this is symbolised by the dashed line.
(4) While HBT and similar statements are hard to prove (in terms of comprehension axioms), these theorems (must) have weak first-order strength in
light of their derivability in intuitionistic topology (See e.g. [46, 48]).
Finally, in light of the equivalences involving the gauge integral, uniform theorems,
and the Cousin lemma (and hence HBT) from [36,37], we observe a serious challenge
to the ‘Big Five’ classification from RM, the linear nature of the Gödel hierarchy,
as well as Feferman’s claim that the mathematics necessary for the development of
physics can be formalised in relatively weak logical systems (See [36, p. 24]).
