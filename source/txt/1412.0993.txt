Abstract
In the theories of Lebesgue integration and of ordinary differential equations,
the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem provides one of the most widely
used tools. Available analogy in the Riemann or Riemann-Stieltjes integration is
the Bounded Convergence Theorem, sometimes called also the Arzelà or ArzelàOsgood or Osgood Theorem. In the setting of the Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral
for real valued functions its proof can be obtained by a slight modification of
the proof given for the σ-Young-Stieltjes integral by T.H. Hildebrandt in his
monograph from 1963. However, it is clear that the Hildebrandt’s proof cannot be
extended to the case of Banach space-valued functions. Moreover, it essentially
utilizes the Arzelà Lemma which does not fit too much into elementary textbooks. In this paper, we present the proof of the Bounded Convergence Theorem
for the abstract Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral in a setting elementary as much as
possible.

Introduction

In the theories of Lebesgue integration and of ordinary differential equations, the
Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem provides one of the most widely used tools.
Available analogy in the Riemann or Riemann-Stieltjes integration is the Bounded
Convergence Theorem, sometimes called also the Arzelà or Arzelà-Osgood or Osgood
Theorem. In the setting of the Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral for real valued functions this
result reads as follows:
If F : [a, b ] → R has a bounded variation on [a, b ], g :[a, b ] → R is regulated on [a, b ]
and the sequence {gn } of functions regulated on [a, b ] is such that
lim gn (t) = g(t) for t ∈ [a, b ]

n→∞

and
kgn k∞ ≤ K < ∞
then

The proof can be easily obtained by a slight modification of the proof given for the
σ-Young integral by Hildebrandt in [7, Theorem II.19.3.14], cf. [21, Theorem I.4.24].
However, it is clear that the proof by Hildebrandt cannot be extended to the case
of Banach space-valued functions. Moreover, it essentially utilizes the Arzelà Lemma
which does not fit too much into elementary text-books. Even in the case of the
Riemann integral the elementary proof of the corresponding Bounded Convergence
Theorem has been for a long time considered to be rather impossible as stated by
Lewin in [10]:
“The bounded convergence theorem follows trivially from the Lebesgue
dominated convergence theorem, but at the level of an introductory course
in analysis, when the Riemann integral is being studied, how hard is the
bounded convergence theorem? For an answer, we might look at Bartle
and Sherbert [2], page 203: “The proof of this result is quite delicate and
will be omitted”. Or we might look at Apostol [1], page 228: “The proof of
Arzela’s theorem is considerably more difficult than ... and will not be given
here”. Walter Rudin in [14] ignores the theorem altogether in his chapter
on Riemann integration, presenting it only as a corollary to the Lebesgue
dominated convergence theorem several chapters later, and in [15], in an
interesting problem in Chapter Two, Rudin refers his readers to [5]. In [5],
Eberlein does present a proof which from some points of view is elementary.
Certainly, his proof does not require any notions of measurability, but it is
hardly elementary from the point of view of a student who is first learning
the Riemann integral.”

3
Despite that, in earlier times, many other authors have dedicated themselves to obtaining a proof independent of the theory of Lebesgue measure for such convergence result.
See for instance [11] and the references therein. Of course, in [10], Lewin succeeded in
his search for an elementary proof that, as he claimed, “could be included for the first
time in an introductory course”.
In this paper, we utilize some of the Lewin’s ideas and present the proof of the
Bounded Convergence Theorem for the abstract Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral in a setting
elementary as much as possible.

Preliminaries

Throughout this paper X is a Banach space and L(X) is the Banach space of all
bounded linear operators on X. By k · kX we denote the norm in X, while k · kL(X)
denotes the usual operator norm in L(X).
For −∞ < a < b < ∞, [a, b ] and (a, b) denote the corresponding closed and open
intervals, respectively. Furthermore, [a, b) and (a, b] are the corresponding half-open
intervals while [c] denotes the degenerate interval consisting of a single real number
c ∈ [a, b ].
A set D = {α0 , α1 , . . . , αν(D) } ⊂ [a, b ] with ν(D) ∈ N is said to be a division of
[a, b ] if
a = α0 < α1 < . . . < αν(D) = b .
The set of all divisions of [a, b ] is denoted by D[a, b ]. The symbol ν(D) will be kept
for the number of subintervals [αj−1 , αj ] generated by the division D.
A function f : [a, b ] → X is called a finite step function on [a, b ] if there exists a
division D = {α0 , α1 , . . . , αm } of [a, b ] such that f is constant on every open interval
(αj−1 , αj ), j = 1, 2, . . . , m.
For an arbitrary function f : [a, b ] → X we set
kf k∞ = sup kf (t)kX
t∈[a,b ]

and the variation of f on [a, b ] is given by
ν(D)

varba

f=

sup

X

kf (αj ) − f (αj−1)kX .

D∈D[a,b ] j=1

Sometimes, varba f is also called the Jordan variation of f on [a, b ]. If varba f < ∞ we say
that f is of bounded variation on [a, b ]. BV ([a, b ], X) denotes the set of all functions
f : [a, b ] → X of bounded variation on [a, b ].

4
C([a, b ], X) is the set of all X-valued functions which are continuous on [a, b ],
while G([a, b ], X) denotes the set of all regulated functions f : [a, b ] → X. Recall that
f : [a, b ] → X is regulated on [a, b ] if for each t ∈ [a, b) there is f (t+) ∈ X such that
lim kf (s) − f (t+)kX = 0

s→t+

and for each t ∈ (a, b ] there is f (t−) ∈ X such that
lim kf (s) − f (t−)kX = 0 .

s→t−

Furthermore, for t ∈ [a, b ] we put ∆+ f (t) = f (t+) − f (t), ∆− f (t) = f (t) − f (t−) and
∆f (t) = f (t+) − f (t−) (where by convention ∆− f (a) = ∆+ f (b) = 0).
Given F : [a, b ] → L(X), we say F is simply-regulated on [a, b ] if, for each x ∈ X, the
function t ∈ [a, b ] → F (t) x ∈ X is regulated. In this case, we write F ∈ (B)G([a, b ], L(X)).
Clearly,
C([a, b ], L(X)) ⊂ G([a, b ], L(X)) ⊂ (B)G([a, b ], L(X)).
Moreover, it is known that BV ([a, b ], L(X)) ⊂ G([a, b ], L(X)), as well.
Now, let us recall the definition of the abstract Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral as introduced by Š. Schwabik in [18].
Systems P = {(τj , [αj−1 , αj ]) : j = 1, . . . , m}, where {α0 , α1 , . . . , αm } ∈ D[a, b ] and
τj ∈ [αj−1 , αj ] for j = 1, . . . , m, are called tagged divisions of [a, b ].
Furthermore, functions δ : [a, b ] → (0, ∞) are said to be gauges on [a, b ]. Given
a gauge δ on [a, b ], the tagged division P = {(τj , [αj−1, αj ]): j = 1, . . . , m} of [a, b ]
is said to be δ-fine if
[αj−1 , αj ] ⊂ (τj − δ(τj ), τj + δ(τj )) for j = 1, . . . , m .
We remark that for an arbitrary gauge δ on [a, b ] there always exists a δ-fine tagged
division of [a, b ]. This is stated by the Cousin lemma (see [17, Lemma 1.4]).
For given functions F : [a, b ] → L(X) and g : [a, b ] → X and a tagged division
P = {(τj , [αj−1 , αj ]) : j = 1, . . . , m} of [a, b ], we define
S(F, dg, P ) =

m
X

F (τj ) [g(αj ) − g(αj−1)]

j=1

and
S(dF, g, P ) =

m
X
j=1

[F (αj ) − F (αj−1)] g(τj ) .

5
We say that I ∈ X is the Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral (or shortly KS-integral) of F with
respect to g from a to b and write
Z b
I=
F d [g]
a

if for every ε > 0 there exists a gauge δ on [a, b ] such that




S(F, dg, P ) − I  < ε for all δ-fine tagged divisions P of [a, b ] .
X

Similarly, J ∈ X is the KS-integral of g with respect to F from a to b if for every ε > 0
there exists a gauge δ on [a, b ] such that




S(dF, g, P ) − J  < ε for all δ-fine tagged divisions P of [a, b ] .
X

In this case we write J =

Z

b

d [F ] g.

For the basic properties of the abstract KS-integral, we refer to [18]–[20] and [12]–
[13].

Jordan decomposition

In this section we will show that, as in the case of real valued functions, any function
of bounded variation on [a, b ] can be written as the sum of a continuous function and
a break function.
Recall that a function f : [a, b ] → X is said to be a break function if there exist
sequences
{sk } ⊂ [a, b ], {ck } ⊂ X, {dk } ⊂ X,
such that
sk 6= sℓ

if k 6= ℓ,

∞
X
k=1

and
f (t) =


kck kX + kdk kX < ∞,

∞ 

X
ck χ(sk ,b] (t) + dk χ[sk ,b] (t)

for t ∈ [a, b ].

(3.1)

(3.2)

k=1

Since for any t ∈ [a, b ], the series on the right-hand side of (3.2) converges absolutely,
it converges also unconditionally (see [4, Chapter VI]). Hence we can write also
X
X
f (t) =
ck +
dk for t ∈ [a, b ].
(3.3)
a≤sk <t

a<sk ≤t

6
It is not difficult to see that, if f is given by (3.3) (or (3.2)), then
∆+ f (sk ) = ck

and ∆− f (sk ) = dk

for k ∈ N.

In particular, the one-sided limits are given by the expressions
X
X
f (t+) =
ck +
dk
for t ∈ [a, b),
a≤sk ≤t

f (t−) =

X

a<sk ≤t

ck +

a≤sk <t

for t ∈ (a, b].

a<sk <t

Moreover, f ∈ BV ([a, b ], X) and
X
X
varba f =
k∆+ f (t)kX +
k∆− f (t)kX .
t∈[a,b)

t∈(a,b]

3.1 . Theorem. If f ∈ BV ([a, b ], X) then there exists a break function f B : [a, b ] → X
such that f − f B is continuous on [a, b ]. Moreover, the function f B is determined
uniquely up to an additive constant.
Proof. Recall that a regulated function can have at most a countable number of points
of discontinuity (see [9, Corollary I.3.2]). Let {sk } be the set of points of discontinuity
of f in [a, b ] and consider the function f B : [a, b ] → X given by
X
X
f B (t) =
∆+ f (sk ) +
∆− f (sk ) for t ∈ [a, b ].
(3.4)
a<sk ≤t

a≤sk <t

By [13, Lemma 4.1], both series on the right-hand side of (3.4) are absolutely convergent, thus f B is a break function. Moreover, for t ∈ [a, b ] we have
∆+ f B (t) = ∆+ f (t) and ∆− f B (t) = ∆− f (t).
This implies that the function f C = f − f B is continuous on [a, b ].
To prove uniqueness, assume that f = feC + feB , where feC is continuous and feB is
a break function. Let
X
X
feB (t) =
ck +
dk for t ∈ [a, b ],
a≤tk <t

a<tk ≤t

for some sequences {tk } ⊂ [a, b ], {ck }, {dk } ⊂ X fulfilling (3.1). For each k ∈ N, one
can easily verify that
ck = ∆+ feB (tk ) = ∆+ f (tk ) = ∆+ f B (tk ).

(3.5)

7
However, this has a sense only if tk = sℓk for some ℓk ∈ N. Analogously, we can see
that
dk = ∆− feB (tk ) = ∆− f B (snk )
(3.6)
for some nk ∈ N. In view of this and since the series above are unconditionally convergent (see [4, Chapter VI]), we have f B (t) − feB (t) = f B (a) − feB (a) for t ∈ [a, b ]. This
completes the proof.

3.2 . Remark. Let f ∈ BV ([a, b ], X) and let f B be given as in Theorem 3.1. Let us
denote f C := f − f B . Then f = f C + f B and we say that f is decomposed into the
sum of its continuous part f C and its break part f B . Such a decomposition is in the
classical case of real valued functions called the Jordan decomposition of f.
Furthermore, note that, in view of (3.5) and (3.6), we have also
f B (t) =

∞
X
 +

∆ f (sk ) χ(sk ,b] (t) + ∆− f (sk ) χ[sk ,b] (t) for t ∈ [a, b ].

Let us put

X


∆+ f (sk ) χ(sk ,b] (t) + ∆− f (sk ) χ[sk ,b] (t)



for t ∈ [a, b ] and n ∈ N.

Then it is not difficult to prove that lim varba (fnB − f B ) = 0 (cf. [21, Lemma I.4.23] for
n→∞

the proof of an analogous assertion for real valued functions).

Variation on elementary sets

First, motivated by [6, Definition 6.1], we will introduce the definition of a variation
over arbitrary intervals.
4.1 . Definition. Let J be a bounded interval in R. We say that a finite set
D = {α0 , α1 , . . . , αν(D) } ⊂ J
is a generalized division of J if
α0 < α1 < · · · < αν(D) .
The set of all generalized divisions of the interval J is denoted by D ∗ (J).
Let f : [a, b ] → X and let J be an arbitrary subinterval of [a, b ]. Then we define the
variation of f on J by


 ν(D)

X
varJ f = sup
kf (αj ) − f (αj−1 )kX .

D∈D ∗ (J) 
j=1

8
We say that f is of bounded variation on J if varJ f < ∞. In such a case, we write
f ∈ BV (J, X). For convention we set also
var∅ f = 0 and var[c] f = 0 for c ∈ [a, b ].
4.2 . Remark. It is easy to see that Definition 4.1 coincides with the definition of the
variation in the sense of Jordan if J is a compact interval, that is, for f : [a, b ] → X and
J = [c, d] ⊆ [a, b ] we have
var[c,d] f = varcd f.
For this reason, in the case of a compact interval, we may always restrict ourselves to
the divisions containing their end points (as defined in Section 2).
Moreover, it is easy to see that if J is a bounded interval and f ∈ BV (J, X), then
f is bounded on J.
4.3 . Proposition. Let f : [a, b ] → X and let J1 and J2 be subintervals of [a, b ] such
that J2 ⊆ J1 . Then
varJ2 f ≤ varJ1 f.
In particular, if J is a subinterval of [a, b ] and f ∈ BV (J, X), then f ∈ BV (I, X) for
every interval I ⊆ J.
The next theorem presents an equivalent formulation of the variation on arbitrary
intervals commonly found in literature.
4.4 . Theorem. Let f : [a, b ] → X and c, d ∈ [a, b ], with c < d.
(i) If f ∈ BV ([c, d), X), then

var[c,d) f = limδ→0+ vard−δ
f = supt∈[c,d) vartc f.
c

(ii) If f ∈ BV ((c, d], X), then

d
f = supt∈(c,d] vartd f.
var(c,d] f = limδ→0+ varc+δ

(iii) If f ∈ BV ((c, d), X), then

var(c,d) f = limδ→0+ vard−δ
c+δ f.

Proof. We will prove the assertion (i), the remaining ones follow in a similar way.
For a fixed δ > 0, consider a division D = {α0 , α1 , . . . , αν(D) } of [c, d−δ]. Of course,
D is also a generalized division of [c, d) and hence
ν(D)

X

kf (αj ) − f (αj−1)kX ≤ var[c,d) f .

j=1

Thus, taking the supremum over all divisions of [c, d − δ], we get varcd−δ f ≤ var[c,d) f.
Since this inequality holds for every δ > 0, it follows that
f ≤ var[c,d) f .
M := sup vartc f = lim vard−δ
c
t∈[c,d)

δ→0+

9
Now, assume that M < var[c,d) f. Then, for ε = var[c,d) f − M, there exists a division
D = {α0 , α1 , . . . , αν(D) } of [c, d) such that
ν(D)

M = var[c,d) f − ε <

X

α

kf (αj ) − f (αj−1 )kX ≤ varc ν(D) f ≤ M,

j=1

a contradiction. This completes the proof of (i).
Dealing with functions with values in a metric space, Chistyakov presents in [3] an
extensive study of the properties of the variation over subsets of the real line. Here, we
call the reader’s attention to a particular result (see [3, Corollary 4.7]) connecting the
variation over arbitrary intervals and the Jordan variation over a compact interval. This
will be the content of Theorem 4.6 whose proof is included for sake of completeness.
To this aim, the next lemma will be usefull.
4.5 . Lemma. Let f : [a, b ] → X, a ≤ c < d ≤ b and f ∈ BV ((c, d), X). Then both
limits f (c+) and f (d−) exist.
Proof. Let ε > 0 and an increasing sequence {tn } ⊂ (c, d) tending to d be given. By
Theorem 4.4 (i) there is δ > 0 such that
0 < var[c,d) f − vard−δ
f < ε.
c
Choose n0 ∈ N in such a way that tn > d − δ for every n ≥ n0 . Therefore, for
n > m ≥ n0 , we have
kf (tn ) − f (tm )kX ≤ varttnm f = vartcn f − vartcm f
≤ var[c,d) f − vard−δ
f <ε
c
wherefrom the existence of the limit f (d−) immediately follows.
The existence of the limit f (c+) can be proved analogously.
4.6 . Theorem. Let f : [a, b ] → X and a ≤ c < d ≤ b.
(i) If f ∈ BV ([c, d), X), then f (d−) exists and
varcd f = var[c,d) f + k∆− f (d)kX .
(ii) If f ∈ BV ((c, d], X), then f (c+) exists and
varcd f = var(c,d] f + k∆+ f (c)kX .

10
(iii) If f ∈ BV ((c, d), X), then both limits f (c+) and f (d−) exist and
varcd f = var(c,d) f + k∆+ f (c)kX + k∆− f (d)kX .
Proof. The existence of all the needed limits follows by Lemma 4.5.
Assume that f ∈ BV ([c, d), X) and let ε > 0 and D = {α0 , α1 , . . . , αm+1 } ∈ D[c, d]
be given. We can choose ξ ∈ [c, d] in such a way that
αm < ξ < d and kf (d−) − f (ξ)kX < ε.
Consequently,
m+1
X

kf (αj ) − f (αj−1)kX

X

kf (αj ) − f (αj−1 )kX + kf (ξ) − f (αm )kX + kf (d−) − f (ξ)kX + k∆− f (d)kX

j=1

< varcξ f + ε + k∆− f (d)kX ≤ var[c,d) f + ε + k∆− f (d)kX .
As D ∈ D[c, d] and ε > 0 were arbitrarily chosen, we conclude that
varcd f ≤ var[c,d) f + k∆− f (d)kX .

(4.1)

On the other hand, for any δ > 0 we have
d
kf (d) − f (d − δ)kX ≤ vard−δ
f = varcd f − vard−δ
f.
c

Hence, letting δ → 0+ we get
k∆− f (d)kX ≤ varcd f − lim vard−δ
f = varcd f − var[c,d) f
c
δ→0+

wherefrom, due to (4.1), we conclude that varcd f = var[c,d) f + k∆− f (d)kX . This completes the proof of (i).
Similarly, we can prove the assertions (ii) and (iii).
4.7 . Corollary. Let f : [a, b ] → X and c, d ∈ [a, b ], with c < d. Then the following
assertions are equivalent:
(i) f ∈ BV ([c, d], X),
(ii) f ∈ BV ((c, d], X),
(iii) f ∈ BV ([c, d), X),

11
(iv) f ∈ BV ((c, d), X).
4.8 . Remark. In view Theorem 4.6, we can also observe that for f : [a, b ] → X and
c ∈ [a, b ], we have
−
+
lim var c+δ
c−δ f = k∆ f (c)kX + k∆ f (c)kX

δ→0+

provided the one-sided limits exist at the point c (see [8, Proposition I.2.8]). Furthermore, by Theorem 4.6, if f ∈ BV ([a, b ], X) ∩ C([a, b ], X), then
var[c,d) f = var(c,d) f = var(c,d] f = varcd f

for c, d ∈ [a, b ] such that c < d.

We need to extend the notion of a variation on intervals to elementary sets.
4.9 . Definition. Let E ⊂ R be bounded. We say that E is an elementary set if it is
a finite union of intervals.
A collection of intervals {Jk : k = 1, . . . , m} is called a minimal decomposition of E
m
[
Jk and the union Jk ∪ Jℓ is not an interval whenever k 6= ℓ.
if E =
k=1

If S ⊆ R, then E(S) stands for the set of all elementary subsets of S.

Note that the minimal decomposition of an elementary set is uniquely determined.
Moreover, the intervals of such decomposition are pairwise disjoint.
Having this in mind, we extend the notion of a variation over elementary sets as
follows.
4.10. Definition. Given a function f : [a, b ] → X and an elementary subset E of [a, b ],
the variation of f over E is
var(f, E) =

m
X

varJk f,

k=1

where {Jk : k = 1, . . . , m} is the minimal decomposition of E.
It is worth highlighting that if f ∈ BV ([a, b ], X) ∩ C([a, b ], X), then var(f, · )
defines a finitely additive measure on E([a, b ]). More precisely, we have
var(f, E) ≤ varba f

for any E ∈ E([a, b ])

and
var(f, E1 ∪ E2 ) = var(f, E1 ) + var(f, E2 )
whenever E1 , E2 ∈ E([a, b ]) and E1 ∩ E2 = ∅.

12
4.11. Remark. Let us note that in [6] Definition 4.1 is applied also to arbitrary subsets
E of [a, b ]. Unfortunately, such a definition is not convenient for our purposes, as the
variation would lose the additivity property even for continuous functions. Indeed, let
a < c < d < b and E = [a, c] ∪ [d, b]. Then, according to such a definition we would
have
varE f ≥ varca f + varbd f + kf (d) − f (c)k > var[a,c] f + var[d,b] f
whenever f (d) 6= f (c). This is why for elementary subsets of [a, b ] we will define the
variation in a different way than that used by Gordon in [6].
The following lemma will give us the crucial tool for proving our main result. It
is analogous to Lemma from [10]. However, instead of the Lebesgue measure it works
with the variation of the given function over elementary sets. We say that a sequence
{An } of subsets of [a, b ] is contracting if An+1 ⊆ An holds for n ∈ N.
4.12 . Lemma. Let f ∈ BV ([a, b ], X)
\∩ C([a, b ], X) and let {An } be a contracting
sequence of subsets of [a, b ] such that
An = ∅. For n ∈ N put
n

vn = sup{ var(f, E): E ∈ E(An ) }.
Then

(4.2)

limn→∞ vn = 0.

Proof. First, notice that, by Definition 4.1, vn = 0 whenever An = ∅.
Let us assume that vn does not tend to zero. Since {vn } is decreasing, this means
that there is ε > 0 such that
vn > ε for all n ∈ N.

(4.3)

Consequently, for each n ∈ N, there is an En ∈ E(An ) such that
var(f, En ) > vn −

ε
.
2n

(4.4)

Since f is continuous, we can assume that En is closed (cf. Remark 4.8). Now, let
n
\
Hn =
Ej for n ∈ N. Clearly, Hn is closed and Hn ⊆ An holds for any n ∈ N. We
j=1

shall show that

Hn 6= ∅ for any n ∈ N.
Indeed, let n ∈ N and M ∈ E(An \En ) be given. Then M ∪ En ∈ E(An ) and, due to
the additivity of the variation, we can see that
var(f, M) + var(f, En ) = var(f, M ∪ En ) ≤ vn

for all n ∈ N.

Integration over elementary sets

To our knowledge, unlike the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral, up to now the KS-integral over
sets that need not be just the compact intervals has not been discussed in literature. In
the case of elementary subsets of [a, b ] the following definition turned out to be useful
for our purposes.
5.1 . Definition. Let F : [a, b ] → L(X), g: [a, b ] → X and an elementary subset E of
[a, b ] be given. The Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral (or shortly KS-integral) of g with respect
to F over E is given by
Z
Z
b

d[F ]g =

E

d[F ] (g χE )

a

provided the integral on the right-hand side exists.
Symmetrically, we define the KS-integral of F with respect to g over E by
Z
Z b
F d[g] =
(F χE ) d[g]
E

a

provided the integral on the right-hand side exists.

14
According to Definition 5.1 the existence of the integral

Z

d[F ] g means (see Sec-

E

tion 1) that there is an I ∈ X such that for every ε > 0 we can find a gauge δ on [a, b ]
such that




S(dF, g χE , P ) − I  < ε for all δ-fine tagged divisions P of [a, b ].
X

Due to Definition 5.1 the basic properties of the KS-integral mentioned below are
immediate consequences of what is known for the abstract Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral.

5.2. Proposition. Let E be an elementary subset of [a, b ]. Assume that F :[a, b ]→L(X)
and gj : [a, b ] →X, j = 1, 2, are such that the integrals
Z
Z
d[F ] g1 and
d[F ] g2

Symmetrically, if Fj : [a, b ] → L(X), j = 1, 2, and g : [a, b ] → X are such that the
integrals
Z
Z
d[F1 ] g and
d[F2 ] g

exist, then the integral

5.3 . Remark. Note that, if E is an elementary subset of [a, b ] and g : [a, b ] → X is a
function such that g = 0 on E, then
Z
d[F ] g = 0
E

for every F : [a, b ] → L(X).
Consequently,
due to Proposition 5.2, if F : [a, b ] → L(X) and g : [a, b ] → X are such
Z

d[F ] g exists, then for any function h : [a, b ] → X which coincides with g on E,

that

we have

5.4. Theorem. Let E1 and E2 be elementary subsets of [a, b ] such that E1 ∩EZ2 = ∅. As-

sume that F : [a, b ] → L(X) and g : [a, b ] → X are such that both the integrals
Z
d[F ] g exists and
j = 1, 2, exist. Then the integral

which proves the result.
The following existence result is a consequence of [18, Proposition 15].
5.5 . Proposition. Let F ∈ BV ([a, b ],R L(X)) and g ∈ G([a, b ], X). If E is an elementary subset of [a, b ], then the integral E d[F ] g exists.
Proof. It is enough to observe that g χE : [a, b ] → X is a regulated function whenever
g ∈ G([a, b ], X) and E is an elementary subset of [a, b ].

The estimates presented in the sequel are, in a sense, the analogues of [18, Proposition 10].
5.6 . Theorem. Let J be a subinterval of [a, b ] and let c = inf J and d = sup J, with
c < d. Assume that FZ : [a, b ] → L(X), with F ∈ BV (J, L(X)), and g : [a, b ] → X are
such that the integral
d[F ] g exists.

for every δ-fine tagged division P of [a, b ].
Let δ ∗ be a gauge on [a, b ] such that δ ∗ ≤ δ on [a, b ] and

δ ∗ (t) < min{|t − c|, |t − d|} for t ∈ [a, b ]\ {c, d}.

(5.2)

Considering a δ ∗ -fine tagged division P of [a, b ], put PJ = {(τ, I) ∈ P : I ∩ [c, d] 6= ∅}.
Let a < c < d < b. Denoting PJ = {(ξj , [βj−1 , βj ]): j = 1, . . . , ν(PJ )}, without loss of generality we may assume
β0 < c = β1 < β2 < · · · < βν(PJ )−1 = d < βν(PJ ) .

(5.3)

It is easy to see that ξ1 = ξ2 = c and ξν(PJ ) = ξν(PJ )−1 = d must hold.
(i) For J = (c, d), we have
S(dF, g χ(c,d) , P ) = S(dF, g χ(c,d) , PJ )

d[F ] g  ≤ var(c,d) F sup kg(t)kX + ε.

(c,d)

X

t∈(c,d)

Since ε > 0 can be arbitrary, the desired inequality is true.

17
(ii) Let J = [c, d) and let g(c) 6= 0. Since F (c−) exists, we can choose η > 0 such that
kF (c−) − F (s)kL(X) <

ε
kg(c)kX

for c − η < s < c.

Moreover, we can assume that the gauge δ ∗ as in (5.2) is such that δ ∗ (c) < η.
Given a δ ∗ -fine tagged division P of [a, b ] and considering PJ as in (5.3), we have
ν(PJ )−2

S(dF, g χ[c,d) , P ) =

X

[F (βj ) − F (βj−1 )] g(ξj ) + [F (c) − F (β0 )] g(c).

Hence
kS(dF, g χ[c,d), P )kX ≤ var[c,d) F

In view of this and applying (5.1), for J = [c, d) we obtain
Z



[c,d)



F d[g] ≤ var[c,d) F sup kg(t)kX + k∆− F (c)kL(X) kg(c)kX + 2 ε,

t∈[c,d)

which proves (ii).

(iii) In order to prove the desired inequality for J = (c, d], assume g(d) 6= 0 and
choose γ > 0 such that
kF (s) − F (d+)kL(X) <

ε
kg(d)kX

for d < s < d + γ.

Without loss of generality we can assume that the gauge δ ∗ in (5.2) is such that
δ ∗ (d) < γ. For a δ ∗ -fine tagged division P of [a, b ], considering PJ as in (5.3), we
have
ν(PJ )−1

S(dF, g χ(c,d] , P ) =

X
j=3

[F (βj ) − F (βj−1 )] g(ξj ) + [F (βν(PJ ) ) − F (d)] g(d),

Therefore, by (5.1) we obtain

d[F ] g  ≤ var(c,d] F sup kg(t)kX + k∆+ F (d)kL(X) kg(d)kX + 2 ε
X

t∈(c,d]

and (iii) follows.

(iv) Similarly to the above, let us consider a δ ∗ -fine tagged division P of [a, b ], where
the gauge δ ∗ satisfies (5.2), δ ∗ (c) < η and δ ∗ (d) < γ. We can see that
ν(PJ )−1

S(dF, g χ[c,d] , P ) =

X

[F (βj ) − F (βj−1 )] g(ξj )

j=2

+ [F (c) − F (β0 )] g(c) + [F (βν(PJ ) ) − F (d)] g(d),

where PJ is defined as in (5.3). Thus
kS(dF, g χ[c,d] , P )kX


≤ var[c,d] F sup kg(t)kX + k∆− F (c)kL(X) kg(c)kX + k∆+ F (d)kL(X) kg(d)kX + 2 ε,
t∈[c,d]

which, together with (5.1), leads to the desired inequality.
The case when c = a and/or d = b can be proved in a similar way, recalling that,
by convention, ∆− F (a) = ∆+ F (b) = 0.

In order to better characterize the integral over elementary sets, first we investigate
the integral over arbitrary intervals. The case when E is just one point corresponds to
the following result borrowed from [18, Lemma 12].
5.7. Proposition. Let F ∈ (B)G([a, b], L(X)) and g : [a, b ] → X be given. If τ ∈ [a, b ],

An important question which arises regarding Definition 5.1 is whether the integral
over compact intervals coincides with the abstract Kurzweil-Stieltjes integral introduced in Section 1. As we will see, the equality need not be true in general. However,
given functions F : [a, b ] → L(X) and g: [a, b ] → X, the equality

5.9 . Remark. Recalling that BV ([a, b], X) ⊂ G([a, b], X), formula (5.5) is valid when
F ∈ BV ([a, b], L(X)). In the particular case X = R this fact corresponds to the result
given by Saks in [16, Theorem VI.(8.1) (p. 208)] which states the following:

20

Having in mind that the intervals of minimal decomposition are pairwise disjoint,
(5.9) follows from Theorem 5.4.
As a consequence of Definition 4.10, Theorem 5.6 and Theorem 5.13 we have the
following.
5.14 . Corollary. Let E be an elementary subset of [a, b ]. RIf F ∈ BV ([a, b ], L(X)) ∩

Theorem 5.13 also means that once the integral over an elementary set exists so does
the integral over subintervals of the minimal decomposition. This implies immediately
that the following assertions hold.

Bounded convergence theorem

Now we can prove our main result, which is Theorem 6.3. To this aim, we will first treat
the case when the integrator is a function of bounded variation which is also continuous.
This is the content of the following theorem whose proof uses the integration over
elementary sets discussed in the previous section.
6.1 . Theorem. Let F ∈ BV ([a, b ], L(X)) ∩ C([a, b ], L(X)) and assume that the sequence {gn } ⊂ G([a, b ], X) is such that

Clearly, An+1 ⊆ An for n ∈ N and n An = ∅. Let vn be given as in (4.2) with F in
the place of f. Recall that vn = 0 if An = ∅. By Lemma 4.12 we have lim vn = 0. In

particular, there exists nε ∈ N such that
vn <

As a consequence, we have

Now, fix n ≥ nε . Since gn is regulated, by [9, Theorem I.3.1] there exists a step

The following assertion will be useful in the proof of Theorem 6.3 and, to our
knowledge, is not available in literature.

Jordan decomposition of F. Then, for every g ∈ G([a, b ], X), we have

Proof. Since F is regulated,
we know that W is a countable set (cf. [9, Corollary I.3.2]).

Moreover, the sum
∆F (t) g(t) is well-defined due to [12, Lemma 4.1].

where W = {sk } ⊂ [a, b ] is the set of discontinuities of F in [a, b ].
