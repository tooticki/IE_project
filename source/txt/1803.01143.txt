Abstract
We consider homoclinic solutions for Hamiltonian systems in symplectic Hilbert spaces and
generalise spectral flow formulas that were proved by Pejsachowicz and the author in finite
dimensions some years ago. Roughly speaking, our main theorem relates the spectra of
infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems under homoclinic boundary conditions to intersections of their stable and unstable spaces. Our proof has some interest in its own. Firstly,
we extend a celebrated theorem by Cappell, Lee and Miller about the classical Maslov index
in R2n to symplectic Hilbert spaces. Secondly, we generalise the classical index bundle for
families of Fredholm operators of Atiyah and Jänich to unbounded operators for applying it
to Hamiltonian systems under varying boundary conditions. Finally, we substantially make
use of striking results by Abbondandolo and Majer to study Fredholm properties of infinite
dimensional Hamiltonian systems.

Introduction

Let E be a real separable Hilbert space, let I := [0, 1] denote the unit interval and let
S : I × R → S(E) be a family of bounded selfadjoint operators on E which is continuous
with respect to the norm topology. We assume that J : E → E is a bounded operator such that
J 2 = −IE , J T = −J, and consider differential equations of the form
( ′
Ju (t) + Sλ (t)u(t) = 0, t ∈ R
(1)
lim u(t) = 0.
t→±∞

Let us denote for λ ∈ I and t0 ∈ R by
Eλu (t0 ) = {u(t0 ) ∈ E : Ju′ (t) + Sλ (t)u(t) = 0,

t→−∞

Eλs (t0 ) = {u(t0 ) ∈ E : Ju′ (t) + Sλ (t)u(t) = 0,

t→+∞

lim u(t) = 0} ⊂ E,
lim u(t) = 0} ⊂ E

(2)

the unstable and stable subspaces of (1). Note that (1) has a non-trivial solution if and only if
Eλu (t0 ) ∩ Eλs (t0 ) 6= {0} for some (and hence any) t0 ∈ R.
If we denote by L2 (R, E) and H 1 (R, E) the usual spaces of maps having values in E, then we
obtain differential operators
Aλ : H 1 (R, E) ⊂ L2 (R, E) → L2 (R, E),

which have a non-trivial kernel if and only if (1) has a non-trivial solution (see [5]).
In [5] Abbondandolo and Majer studied Fredholm properties of the operators Aλ in relation to
the stable and unstable subspaces (2). Their motivation came from a Morse homology in Hilbert
spaces that they constructed in [4] (see also [8]) and where differential equations of the form
(1) naturally appear. In these works, the linear theory was developed that is necessary for the
set-up of Morse homology on Hilbert manifolds (see [6], [7]). Applications of their theory can
be found, e.g., in the study of periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems, periodic solutions of wave
equations and solutions of classes of elliptic systems as in [1], [2], [10], [23], [26], [29], [33] and
[48]. One of the long term aims of this paper is to open up recent methods from variational
bifurcation theory to such classes of nonlinear equations by following the author’s work [53],
where the case E = R2n was considered. Moreover, we intend to make our findings applicable to
such Hamiltonian PDEs by using new comparison methods for the spectral flow from our paper
[54].
In what follows, we assume that the family S : I × R → S(E) is of the form
Sλ (t) = Bλ + Kλ (t),

(4)

where
(A1) Kλ (t) is compact for all (λ, t) ∈ I × R, and the limits
Kλ (±∞) = lim Kλ (t)
t→±∞

exist uniformly in λ,
(A2) the operators JBλ and
JSλ (±∞) := J(Bλ + Kλ (±∞))
are hyperbolic, i.e., there are no purely imaginary points in their spectra.
We will show below that it follows from [4] that the operators Aλ are selfadjoint Fredholm
operators under the assumptions (A1) and (A2). Consequently, the spectral flow sf(A) is defined,
which is a homotopy invariant for paths of selfadjoint Fredholm operators (see Section 2.2.2
below).
The operator J : E → E induces a symplectic form on E by ω(u, v) = hJu, vi, which makes
it a symplectic Hilbert space (see [15] and [35]). The Maslov index for paths of Lagrangian
subspaces was first generalised to infinite dimensional symplectic Hilbert spaces by Swanson in
[47]. Here we follow the survey [22] of Booß-Bavnbek and Furutani’s approach [14]. Henceforth,
let F L2 (E, ω) denote the Fredholm Lagrangian Grassmannian of pairs of spaces (see Section 2.1).
We will explain below that it follows from [5] that {(Eλu (t0 ), Eλs (t0 ))}λ∈I is a path in F L2 (E, ω),
and so its Maslov index µMas (E·u (t0 ), E·s (t0 )) is defined for every fixed t0 ∈ R. Actually, it is
readily seen that this integer does not depend on the choice of t0 . The main theorem of this
paper reads as follows.
Theorem A. If the assumptions (A1) and (A2) hold, then
sf(A) = µMas (E·u (0), E·s (0)).

2

Let us point out that, in the special case E = R2n , this is a generalisation of the author’s previous
work [53] as well as of the recent paper [25] by Hu and Portaluri.
Let us now consider for the operators Sλ (±∞) from (A2) the families of subspaces
Eλs (±∞) = {x ∈ E : exp(tJSλ (±∞))x → 0 as t → ∞},
Eλu (±∞) = {x ∈ E : exp(tJSλ (±∞))x → 0 as t → −∞}.
Note that these are the stable and unstable subspaces (2) for the autonomous equations
( ′
Ju (t) + Sλ (±∞)u(t) = 0, t ∈ R
lim u(t) = 0.

(5)

t→±∞

Moreover, it can be seen from [5] that {(Eλu (+∞), Eλs (−∞))}λ∈I is a path in F L2 (E, ω). We obtain below the following corollary of Theorem A, which was proved for E = R2n by Pejsachowicz
in [36].
Corollary. If (A1), (A2) hold and S0 (t) = S1 (t) for all t ∈ R in (1), then
sf(A) = µMas (E·u (+∞), E·s (−∞)).
Consequently, if the path of operators A in (3) is periodic, then its spectral flow can be computed
from the stable and unstable spaces of the autonomous equations (5). Obviously, the latter
spaces are much easier to obtain than those in (2) for the original problem (1). Finally, it is
worth mentioning that, by proving the above corollary, we further show that, for E = R2n ,
Pejsachowicz’ theorem [36] can be obtained from our work [53]. To the best of our knowledge,
this has not been noted before.
The argument for proving Theorem A partially follows an approach to the author’s work [53]
that was recently proposed by Hu and Portaluri in [25]. They pointed out that Theorem A
can be obtained for E = R2n from Cappell, Lee and Miller’s seminal investigations about the
Maslov index [18] in finite dimensions. As we want to use [18] as well, we in particular need
to generalise one of the main theorems of that paper to infinite dimensions. This result is of
independent interest, and we now want to introduce it briefly. For every path {(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ))}λ∈I
in F L2 (E, ω), we obtain differential operators
Qλ : D(Qλ ) ⊂ L2 ([a, b], E) → L2 ([a, b], E),

(Qλ u)(t) = Ju′ (t),

(6)

on the domains
D(Qλ ) = {u ∈ H 1 ([a, b], E) : u(a) ∈ Λ0 (λ), u(b) ∈ Λ1 (λ)}.
We show below that each Qλ is selfadjoint and Fredholm. Moreover, we investigate whether the
path Q = {Qλ }λ∈I is continuous with respect to the so called gap-metric (see Section 2.2.1), in
which case its spectral flow sf(Q) is defined. In what follows, we call a path {(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ))}λ∈I
in F L2 (E, ω) admissible if Λ0 (0) ∩ Λ1 (0) = Λ0 (1) ∩ Λ1 (1) = {0}.
Theorem B. If {(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ))}λ∈I is an admissible path in F L2 (E, ω), then the corresponding
path of differential operators Q is a continuous path of selfadjoint Fredholm operators, and
sf(Q) = µMas (Λ0 (·), Λ1 (·)).
3

For obtaining Theorem A from Theorem B, we need to deal with the spectral flow for paths of
operators having varying domains. This is usually a delicate problem, as apart from non-obvious
continuity issues like in Theorem B, we also essentially loose the opportunity to apply crossing
forms, which is probably the most powerful method for computing spectral flows (see, e.g., [42],
[20], [21], [53]). However, when Atiyah, Patodi and Singer introduced the spectral flow for closed
paths of selfadjoint Fredholm operators in [13], they showed that it can be computed as first
Chern number of a family index. The latter index is an element of the odd K-theory group
K −1 (S 1 ) ∼
= Z, and a further aim of this paper is to show that an adapted construction can
be used for non-closed paths that are continuous in the gap-topology, where we mainly review
material from our PhD thesis [49] that has not been published yet. Let us assume that H
is a complex Hilbert space and let us denote by Ω(CF sa (H), GC sa (H)) the set of all paths of
selfadjoint Fredholm operators on H that are continuous with respect to the gap-topology and
have invertible endpoints. In what follows, we denote by K −1 (X, Y ) the odd K-theory group of a
compact pair of spaces (X, Y ), which we recall in Appendix B, and by ∂I the boundary of the unit
interval I. Moreover, we use that the Chern number (69) is an isomorphism c1 : K −1 (I, ∂I) → Z.
Theorem C. There exists a map
s-ind : Ω(CF sa (H), GC sa (H)) → K −1 (I, ∂I)
such that
c1 (s-ind(A)) = sf(A) ∈ Z
for every A ∈ Ω(CF (H), GC (H)).

Previous versions of Theorem C for paths of selfdjoint Fredholm operators having a fixed domain
have been applied in [51] and [52]. However, to the best of our knowledge, Theorem C is the first
approach to compute the spectral flow for general gap-continuous paths by using K-theory. This
shall be of independent interest as it provides a new method for computing spectral flows for paths
of operators having non-constant domains. The capability of Theorem C will be demonstrated
in the third step of the proof of Theorem A in Section 5.2.
Actually, we show below that for every gap-continuous family A : (X, Y ) → (CF sa (H), GC sa (H))
of selfadjoint Fredholm operators there is an element s-ind(A) ∈ K −1 (X, Y ) which coincides with
Atiyah, Patodi and Singer’s family index for families of bounded selfadjoint Fredholm operators
when Y = ∅. In the construction of s-ind(A), we also generalise the classical index bundle for
families of bounded and not necessarily selfadjoint Fredholm operators, which was introduced
independently by Atiyah and Jänich in the sixties, to gap-continuous families.
Let us outline the structure of the paper. The content is rather technical and requires a couple
of preliminaries, and so we begin in the next section with a recap of the spectral flow and the
Maslov index. In the section on the spectral flow, we will recall several facts about the gap-metric
on the space of selfadjoint Fredholm operators. Afterwards, we introduce Theorem A,B and C
in detail and prove them in the order B, C, A. However, we want to point out that B and C are
independent of each other and so the reader might also read C before B.
Finally, we want to make a few remarks on our notation. In general, H is a real or complex
Hilbert space unless otherwise stated. However, if we require the Hilbert space to be real, we
denote it by E instead of H. The symbols L(H) and GL(H) stand for the bounded and invertible
operators on H, respectively. Moreover, BF(H) denotes the subspace of L(H) of all bounded
Fredholm operators. In this paper, we mostly deal with unbounded operators, and we denote by
C(H) ⊃ L(H) the closed operators on H. As usual, σ(S) stands for the spectrum of S ∈ C(H),
and S ∗ denotes its adjoint. However, also here we use a different notation for real Hilbert spaces
4

E, where the adjoint will be denoted by S T as for the transpose of a real matrix. This is in
accordance with the notation in [53], where we considered the equations (1) in finite dimensions.
Finally, the identity on E is denoted by IE , which we abbreviate by I2n in the case that E = R2n .
Acknowledgement
There was a further assumption in Theorem A in a previous version of this work, which required
that the relative dimension (46) vanishes. We want to thank Hermann Schulz-Baldes (Erlangen)
who explained to us that this actually follows from (A1) and (A2).

Preliminaries: Maslov Index and Spectral Flow
Fredholm Lagrangian Grassmannian and the Maslov Index

The aim of this section is to recall some basic facts about the Maslov index for paths of Fredholm
pairs of Lagrangian subspaces in a symplectic Hilbert space. There are different notions of
symplectic Hilbert spaces (see e.g. [16]), but here such spaces are Hilbert spaces (E, h·, ·i) with
an invertible bounded operator J : E → E such that J T = −J and J 2 = −IE , where J T denotes
the adjoint of J. The corresponding symplectic form on E is given by ω(x, y) = hJx, yi. Our
main reference in this section is Furutani’s work [22], who defines a symplectic Hilbert space as a
pair (E, ω
e ) where ω
e is a non-degenerate skew-symmetric bounded bilinear form. Of course, our
form ω has all these properties. Moreover, it is shown in [22] that every ω
e is of the form of our
ω for some operator J which has the above properties if we just modify the scalar product of E
to an equivalent one.
An important observation, here and below, is that the set of all closed subspace G(E) in a Hilbert
space E is canonically a metric space with respect to the gap-metric
dG (U, V ) = kPU − PV k,

U, V ∈ G(E),

(7)

where PU and PV denote the orthogonal projections onto U and V , respectively. Actually, G(E)
is an analytic Banach manifold (see [9]), which however, will not be needed in this paper. Instead,
we now suppose that E is a symplectic Hilbert space and consider a submanifold of G(E). Let
us first recall that a closed subspace L ⊂ E is called Lagrangian if
L = L◦ := {x ∈ E : ω(x, y) = 0 for all y ∈ E}.
Henceforth, we will hardly make use of this definition, but use the elementary fact that L ∈ G(E)
is Lagrangian if and only if
L⊥ = J(L),

(8)

where L⊥ denotes the orthogonal complement with respect to the scalar product h·, ·i of E
([22, Prop. 1.7]). Note that the set of all Lagrangian subspaces Λ(E, ω) of E inherits a metric
from G(E), but let us mention in passing that the topology of Λ(E, ω) depends substantially
on the dimension of E. Indeed, if E is of finite dimension, then Λ(E, ω) has an infinitely cyclic
fundamental group and an isomorphism to the integers is given by the Maslov index [11]. In
contrast, if E is of infinite dimension, as we usually assume in this paper, then Λ(E, ω) is
contractible as a consequence of Kuiper’s Theorem (see [22, Thm. 1.14]). However, Λ(E, ω)
contains an interesting subset which is topologically non-trivial and has shown a lot of times to
5

be the right setting for generalising the Maslov index to infinite dimensions.
Let us recall that two subspaces L, M ∈ G(E) are a Fredholm pair if
dim(L ∩ M ) < ∞ and codim(L + M ) < ∞,
and the index of a Fredholm pair is defined by
ind(L, M ) = dim(L ∩ M ) − codim(L + M ).
It is often required in the definition of a Fredholm pair that L + M is closed. That this is
redundant was explained, e.g., in [14].
For a fixed W ∈ Λ(E, ω), we denote by F LW (E, ω) the set of all L ∈ Λ(E, ω) such that (L, W )
is a Fredholm pair, and we note that
ind(L, W ) = 0,

L ∈ F LW (E, ω),

(9)

by (8) (see [34, (1.3)]). It can be shown that F LW (E, ω) is an open subset of Λ(E, ω), and
moreover, it has an infinitely cyclic fundamental group by [22, Thm. 1.54]. The Maslov index
extends to this infinite dimensional setting as integer valued invariant µMas (Λ, W ) for paths Λ in
F LW (E, ω). Its heuristic interpretation is as in the finite dimensional case, namely, it is the net
number of intersections of Λ(λ) and W whilst λ travels along the unit interval. The construction
of the Maslov index consists of two parts. Firstly, there is a map from F LW (E, ω) to a set UJ
of unitary operators on a complex Hilbert space. Secondly, there is a winding number for paths
of operators in UJ . The composition of these maps is the Maslov index and indeed reduces to
the classical one if E is of finite dimension. We recap this construction from [22] in Appendix A,
where we need it to prove Lemma A.1 which is crucial in the final step of the proof of Theorem
A. Apart from this, we will not use any particular details about the construction, but just need
the following three basic properties which can all be found in [22]:
(i) If Λ(λ) ∩ W = {0} for all λ ∈ I, then µMas (Λ, W ) = 0.
(ii) The Maslov index is additive under the concatenation of paths, i.e.
µMas (Λ1 ∗ Λ2 , W ) = µMas (Λ1 , W ) + µMas (Λ2 , W )
if Λ1 , Λ2 : I → F LW (E, ω) are two paths such that Λ1 (1) = Λ2 (0).
(iii) If Λ : I × I → F LW (E, ω) is a homotopy such that Λ(s, 0) and Λ(s, 1) are constant for all
s ∈ I, then
µMas (Λ(0, ·), W ) = µMas (Λ(1, ·), W ).
Finally, given the fact that the fundamental group of F LW (E, ω) is infinitely cyclic, it is not
difficult to see that µMas actually provides an explicit isomorphism between F LW (E, ω) and the
integers (see [22, §3]).
As in the finite dimensional case, the Maslov index can be generalised to pairs of subspaces. Note
that the diagonal ∆ in E × E is a Lagrangian subspace, when E × E is considered as symplectic
Hilbert space with respect to the symplectic form ωE×E = ωE × (−ωE ). It is readily seen that
Λ1 (λ) × Λ2 (λ) ∈ F L∆ (E × E, ωE×E ) if (Λ1 (λ), Λ2 (λ)) ∈ F L2 (E, ω), where the latter set denotes
the set of all Fredholm pairs of Lagrangian subspaces of E. The Maslov index of a path of pairs
(Λ1 , Λ2 ) in F L2 (E, ω) is defined as the Maslov index of Λ1 × Λ2 as a path in F L∆ (E × E, ωE×E ).
It is shown in [22, Prop. 2.32] that µMas (Λ1 , Λ2 ) = µMas (Λ1 , W ) if Λ2 ≡ W is a constant path,
so that this is indeed an extension of the Maslov index for paths in F LW (E, ω). Of course, we
obtain as immediate results from the above properties (i)-(iii)
6

(i’) If Λ1 (λ) ∩ Λ2 (λ) = {0} for all λ ∈ I, then µMas (Λ1 , Λ2 ) = 0.
(ii’) The Maslov index is additive under the concatenation of paths, i.e.
µMas ((Λ1 , Λ2 ) ∗ (Λ̃1 , Λ̃2 )) = µMas (Λ1 , Λ2 ) + µMas (Λ̃1 , Λ̃2 )
if (Λ1 , Λ2 ), (Λ̃1 , Λ̃2 ) : I → F L2 (E, ω) are two pairs of paths such that (Λ1 (1), Λ2 (1)) =
(Λ̃1 (0), Λ̃2 (0)).
(iii’) If (Λ1 , Λ2 ) : I × I → F L2 (E, ω) is a homotopy such that Λ1 (s, 0), Λ2 (s, 0), Λ1 (s, 1) and
Λ2 (s, 1) are constant for all s ∈ I, then
µMas ((Λ1 (0, ·), Λ2 (0, ·))) = µMas ((Λ1 (1, ·), Λ2 (1, ·))).
As π1 (F L2 (E, ω)) ∼
= Z by [34, Cor. 1.6] if E is of infinite dimension, the following assertion
is an immediate consequence of the definition of µMas on F L2 (E, ω) and the fact that it is an
isomorphism π1 (F LW (E, ω)) → Z for fixed Lagrangian subspaces W .
Theorem 2.1. The Maslov index
µMas : π1 (F L2 (E, ω)) → Z
is an isomorphism if E is of infinite dimension.
Note that Theorem 2.1 is wrong for finite dimensional spaces E. Indeed, if E = R2n , then
F L2 (R2n , ω) = Λ(R2n ) × Λ(R2n ) and consequently
π1 (F L2 (R2n , ω)) = π1 (Λ(R2n )) × π1 (Λ(R2n )) = Z ⊕ Z.

The Spectral Flow in the Gap Metric
Fredholm Operators and the Gap Metric

In this section, we consider (possibly) unbounded operators T : D(T ) ⊂ H → H, which are
defined on a dense subspace D(T ) of the Hilbert space H which can be either real or complex.
Let us recall that T is closed if its graph, which we henceforth denote by graph(T ), is a closed
subspace of H × H. Note that the set C(H) of all closed operators on H can be canonically
embedded into the Grassmannian G(H × H) and so inherits a metric. In other words,
dG (S, T ) = kPgraph(S) − Pgraph(T ) k,

S, T ∈ C(H),

(10)

defines a metric on C(H), which is called the gap-metric. The topologies induced by the operator
norm and the gap-metric on the subset of bounded operators L(H) ⊂ C(H) are equivalent (see
[28, Rem. IV.2.16]). In particular, every norm-continuous family of operators in L(H) is also
continuous in C(H). In what follows, we will use this fact without further reference. Finally, note
that even though G(H × H) is complete, (C(H), dG ) is not, which is readily seen by considering
a sequence of graphs that converges in G(H × H) to a space which has a non-trivial intersection
with {0} × H.
There are two subsets of C(H) that will be of particular interest for us. Firstly, let us recall that
a densely defined operator T is called selfadjoint if it is symmetric and D(T ) = D(T ∗ ), where
T ∗ denotes the adjoint of T . Clearly, every selfadjoint operator is closed, and in what follows we
denote by C sa (H) ⊂ C(H) the subset of all selfadjoint operators. Secondly, an operator T ∈ C(H)
7

is Fredholm if its kernel and its cokernel are of finite dimension. The difference of these numbers
is the index of T . Let us point out that every Fredholm operator has a closed range im(T ) ⊂ H
(see [24]). Henceforth, we denote by CF(H) ⊂ C(H) the subset of all Fredholm operators, and
by CF k (H) the elements in CF(H) of index k ∈ Z. Note that there is an important difference
between the previous definitions: a selfadjoint operator is automatically closed, whereas we
require a Fredholm operator to be closed in its definition. In what follows, we will be in particular
interested in the intersection of C sa (H) and CF(H), i.e. the set of selfadjoint Fredholm operators,
which we denote by CF sa (H). Note that every element of CF sa (H) has Fredholm index 0, i.e.
CF sa (H) ⊂ CF 0 (H). The next lemma, that we will use several times below, gives a complete
characterisation of which elements of CF 0 (H) actually belong to CF sa (H).
Lemma 2.2. If T ∈ CF 0 (H) is symmetric, then T ∈ CF sa (H). In other words, a symmetric
Fredholm operator of index 0 is selfadjoint.
Proof. As T is symmetric, we see that ker(T ) ⊂ (im T )⊥ , and since both spaces are of the same
dimension for Fredholm operators of index 0, this shows that
(im T )⊥ = ker(T ).

(11)

We now claim that every symmetric Fredholm operator which satisfies (11) is selfadjoint, where
we follow an argument that we have learnt from the proof of Proposition 3.1 in [43]. We let
u ∈ D(T ∗ ) and note at first that hu, T vi = hw, vi for w = T ∗ u ∈ H and all v ∈ D(T ). As im(T )
is closed, we see from (11) that there are w1 ∈ ker(T ) and u1 ∈ D(T ) such that w = w1 + T u1.
Therefore,
hu − u1 , T vi = hT ∗ u, vi − hT u1 , vi = hw − T u1, vi = hw1 , vi,

(12)

and the latter term vanishes for all v ∈ im(T ) ∩ D(T ) by (11).
By (11), every v ∈ D(T ) can be written as v = v1 + v2 where v1 ∈ ker(T ) and v2 ∈ im(T ). As
ker(T ) ⊂ D(T ), we see that actually v2 ∈ im(T ) ∩ D(T ). Hence, by (12),
hu − u1 , T vi = hu − u1 , T v2 i = 0,

v ∈ D(T ),

⊥

and so u−u1 ∈ (im T ) = ker(T ) ⊂ D(T ), where we have used once again (11). Since u1 ∈ D(T ),
we finally obtain u ∈ D(T ) and so T is selfadjoint.
As usual, if T : D(T ) ⊂ H → H and S : D(S) ⊂ H → H are densely defined, their composition
T S is an operator on D(T S) = S −1 (D(T )). We note the following simple corollary of Lemma
2.2 for later reference.
Corollary 2.3. If T ∈ CF sa (H) and M ∈ GL(H), then M ∗ T M ∈ CF sa (H).
Proof. We just need to note that M ∗ T M is obviously symmetric. Moreover, it is Fredholm of
index 0, as the product of densely defined Fredholm operators is Fredholm and
ind(M ∗ T M ) = ind(M ∗ ) + ind(T ) + ind(M ) = ind(T ) = 0
by [24, Thm. XVIII 3.1].

8

If W ⊂ H is a dense subset that is a Hilbert space in its own right, then we can consider
BF sa (W, H) := {T ∈ L(W, H) : T Fredholm, T ∗ = T },

(13)

where the adjoint is meant as adjoint of an unbounded operator on H with dense domain W .
Note that BF sa (W, H) inherits a topology from the space of bounded operators L(W, H). On
the other hand, BF sa (W, H) is a subset of CF sa (H) and so one might ask about the relation of
the different topologies. This was answered by Lesch in [32, Prop. 2.2] as follows.
Theorem 2.4. The canonical inclusion
BF sa (W, H) ⊂ CF sa (H)
is continuous.
In particular, any path in BF sa (W, H) is also continuous with respect to the gap-topology, which
we will use below in the proof of Theorem A.
2.2.2

The Spectral Flow

The reader who is well acquainted with the spectral flow as introduced in [17] will just need to
skim through the rest of this section to become familiar with our notations. Let us point out
that we denote, as in previous sections, parameters by λ. We are aware that it is common in the
literature to use t instead, but this would clash with the variable t in (1). In particular, let us
emphasize that in what follows, λ is never an element of the spectrum of an operator.
We recall at first that for every selfadjoint Fredholm operator T there is ε > 0 and a neighbourhood NT,ε ⊂ CF sa (H) such that ±ε ∈
/ σ(S) and the spectral projection χ[−ε,ε] (S) is of finite rank
for all S ∈ NT,ε . If now A : I → CF sa (H) is a path, then there are 0 = λ0 < λ1 < . . . < λN = 1
such that the restriction of A to [λi−1 , λi ] is contained in a neighbourhood NTi ,εi for some
Ti ∈ CF sa (H) and εi > 0. We set

sf(A) =

N
X
i=1


dim(im(χ[0,εi ] (Aλi )) − dim(im(χ[0,εi ] (Aλi−1 )) .

(14)

Note that the dimensions of the images of the spectral projections in (14) are just the number
of eigenvalues in [0, εi ] including their multiplicities.
It was first observed by Philips in [38] that this definition does not depend on the choices of
the numbers λi and εi . Note that, roughly speaking, the spectral flow is the net number of
eigenvalues of A0 that cross zero whilst the parameter λ travels along the interval I. The most
important properties of the spectral flow are
(i) If Aλ is invertible for all λ ∈ I, then sf(A) = 0.
(ii) If A1 and A2 are two paths in CF sa (H) such that A11 = A20 , then
sf(A1 ∗ A2 ) = sf(A1 ) + sf(A2 ).
(iii) Let h : I × I → CF sa (H) be a homotopy such that h(s, 0) and h(s, 1) are invertible for all
s ∈ I. Then
sf(h(0, ·)) = sf(h(1, ·)).
9

Let us point out that the first two properties are immediate consequences of the definition (14),
whereas the third one requires a little bit of work. Actually, it is easy to see that the homotopy
invariance even holds when the endpoints are not invertible as long as the dimension of the
kernels of h(s, 0) and h(s, 1) are constant. This is obvious from the interpretation of the spectral
flow, and also easy to see from the proof of (iii) in [38]. Let us finally note the following stability
property of the spectral flow for later reference (cf. [37, §7]).
Lemma 2.5. Let A : I → CF sa (H) be gap-continuous and Aδ = A + δIH for δ ∈ R. Then
sf(A) = sf(Aδ )
for any sufficiently small δ > 0.
Proof. We note at first that the operators Aδλ are in CF sa (H) for δ sufficiently small, and moreover
the path Aδ is gap-continuous by [28, Thm. IV.2.17]. Hence sf(Aδ ) is well defined.
Let now 0 = λ0 < . . . < λN = 1 be a partition of the unit interval and εi > 0, i = 1, . . . , N , for
the path A as in (14). Note that σ(Aδλ ) = σ(Aλ ) + δ, λ ∈ I. We now let δ > 0 be so small that
±εi ∈
/ σ(Asδ
λ ), s ∈ I, λ ∈ [λi−1 , λi ], for i = 1, . . . , N , and σ(Aλi ) ∩ [−δ, 0) = {0} for i = 0, . . . N .
Then
dim(im(χ[0,εi ] (Aλ ))) = dim(im(χ[0,εi ] (Aδλ ))),

λ = λi−1 , λi ,

for i = 1, . . . , N , and the assertion is an immediate consequence of the definition (14).
Let us point out that it is important that δ is positive in the previous lemma. For negative δ the
difference of the kernel dimensions of A0 and A1 appears as additional term, which is readily
seen by a similar argument.
We will need below a characterisation of the spectral flow that is due to Lesch [32]. Let us denote
by Ω(CF sa (H), GC sa (H)) the set of all paths in CF sa (H) having invertible endpoints. Note that
a selfadjoint Fredholm operator is invertible if and only if its kernel is trivial. Let P+ , P− and
P0 be three orthogonal projections in H such that P+ , P− have infinite dimensional kernel and
range, and dim(im P0 ) = 1. We also assume that these projections are complementary, which
means that the products of each two of them vanish and that P+ + P0 + P− is the identity IH .
Then
1
Aλ = P− + (λ − )P0 + P+
2

(15)

is a path of bounded selfadjoint operators which is invertible as long as λ 6= 12 . For λ = 12 the
image of P0 is the kernel and cokernel of A 12 and so this operator is Fredholm. As the canonical
inclusion of the bounded selfadjoint Fredholm operators BF sa (H) into CF sa (H) is continuous
by [32, Prop. 2.2], we see that Anor := {Aλ }λ∈I is a path in CF sa (H). The reader will have no
difficulty to see from (14) that sf(Anor ) = 1. The following theorem was proved by Lesch in [32].
Theorem 2.6. Assume that µ : Ω(CF sa (H), GC sa (H)) → Z is a map that has the same properties
(ii) and (iii) as the spectral flow. If µ(Anor ) = 1, then
µ = sf : Ω(CF sa (H), GC sa (H)) → Z.
The reader should not be puzzled that the property (i) is not mentioned in Theorem 2.6, as it
follows from (ii) and (iii). Indeed, it is readily seen from (ii) that the spectral flow of a constant
path vanishes. As every path of invertible operators can be contracted to a point by a homotopy
10

of invertible operators, (i) now follows from (iii).
Finally, let us consider the case of a path A in CF sa (E), where E is a real Hilbert space. In
this case there are two ways to define the spectral flow of A. Firstly, as we previously allowed
our Hilbert spaces to be real or complex, we can use (14) as introduced above. Secondly, we can
consider the complexification E C = E + iE of E which is canonically a complex Hilbert space.
sa
C
The complexified operators AC
λ are in CF (E ), and so the spectral flow of the complexified
C
C
path A = {Aλ }λ∈I is defined as well. As the complex dimensions of eigenspaces of AC
λ is equal
to the real dimension of the eigenspaces of Aλ , we see from (14) that
sf(A) = sf(AC ).

(16)

Even though the operators for studying the equations (1) are defined in real Hilbert spaces,
one of our topological constructions below requires operators in complex Hilbert spaces. The
obtained equation (16) will become important in that step.

Theorem B

We now have recalled all necessary preliminaries for discussing Theorem B in detail. Let us
point out once again that Theorem C, which we prove in the following section, is independent of
Theorem B.

3.1

Setting and Statement of the Theorem

Let (E, ω) be a symplectic Hilbert space and {(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ))}λ∈I a path in F L2 (E, ω). As
before, we let J : E → E be the almost complex structure induced by ω and assume that J is
compatible with the scalar product of E, i.e. J 2 = −IE and J T = −J. Now we consider for
a, b ∈ R, a < b, the differential operators
Qλ : D(Qλ ) ⊂ L2 ([a, b], E) → L2 ([a, b], E),

Qλ u = Ju′ ,

(17)

where
D(Qλ ) = {u ∈ H 1 ([a, b], E) : u(a) ∈ Λ0 (λ), u(b) ∈ Λ1 (λ)}.
Our first aim is to show that the Fredholm and Lagrangian properties of (Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ)) are
strictly related to the Fredholmness and selfadjointness of Qλ .
Lemma 3.1. The operator Qλ belongs to CF sa (L2 ([a, b], E)) if and only if
(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ)) ∈ F L2 (E, ω).
Proof. We begin by examining the kernel and cokernel of Qλ . Obviously, the kernel of Qλ is
isomorphic to Λ0 (λ) ∩ Λ1 (λ). For studying the cokernel, we note at first that for w ∈ L2 ([a, b], E)
the functions
Z t
u(t) = −J
w(s) ds + c, t ∈ [a, b], c ∈ E,
a

1

′

are in H ([a, b], E) and satisfy Ju (t) = w(t), t ∈ [a, b]. Now u belongs to D(Qλ ) if and only if
11

u(a) = c ∈ Λ0 (λ),
Z b
w(s) ds + c ∈ Λ1 (λ).
u(b) = −J

(18)

a

By writing
w(t) =

Z

b

w(s) ds + (w(t) −

w(s) ds),

it is clear that we have a decomposition

L2 ([a, b], E) = U ⊕ V
into closed subspaces, where U ∼
= E denotes the space of constant functions and
)
(
Z b
2
w(s) ds = 0 .
V = w ∈ L ([a, b], E) :
a

We first note that (18) holds for any w ∈ V just by setting c = 0. If, however, w ∈ U , then
(18) holds if and only if there exists c ∈ Λ0 (λ) such that v + c ∈ Λ1 (λ), where v := −J(b − a)w.
Now the latter assertion is true if and only if v ∈ Λ0 (λ) + Λ1 (λ), and so the range of Qλ is
J(Λ0 (λ) + Λ1 (λ)) ⊕ V . In summary, the kernel and cokernel of Qλ are of finite dimension if and
only if (Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ)) is a Fredholm pair.
Next, we note that for u, v ∈ D(Qλ )

hQλ u, viL2 ([a,b],E) =

Z

b
′

hJu (t), v(t)idt = hJu(b), v(b)i − hJu(a), v(a)i +

Z

b

hu(t), Jv ′ (t)idt.

a

a

The right hand side of this equation is equal to hu, Qλ viL2 ([a,b],E) for all u, v ∈ D(Qλ ) if and only
if
hJx, yi = hJ x̃, ỹi = 0, for all x, y ∈ Λ0 (λ), x̃, ỹ ∈ Λ1 (λ),
which means that JΛ1 (λ) = Λ1 (λ)⊥ and JΛ0 (λ) = Λ0 (λ)⊥ . Hence, by (8), Qλ is symmetric if
and only if Λ0 (λ) and Λ1 (λ) are Lagrangian.
Let us point out that we now have already shown that (Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ)) ∈ F L2 (E, ω) if Qλ ∈
CF sa (L2 ([a, b], E)).
As next step, let us briefly explain why Qλ is closed if Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ) ∈ G(E). We assume that
{un }n∈N ⊂ D(Qλ ) is a sequence and u, v ∈ L2 ([a, b], E) are such that un → u and Qλ un → v.
We need to show that u ∈ D(Qλ ) and Qλ u = v. Using that

un (t) = un (a) +

Z

a

t

u′n (s) ds,

t ∈ [a, b], n ∈ N,

it is easily seen that
kun (a) − um (a)k ≤ kun − um kL2 ([a,b],E) + ku′n − u′m kL2 ([a,b],E) ,
12

(19)

and so {un (a)}n∈N is a Cauchy sequence in E converging to some x ∈ E. We set

w(t) = x −

Z

t

Jv(s) ds,

t ∈ [a, b],

(20)

a

and see from (19) that
kun (t) − w(t)k ≤ kun (a) − xk + ku′n − vkL2 ([a,b],E) , t ∈ [a, b],

(21)

which clearly shows that {un }n∈N converges to w in L2 ([a, b], E), and so u is given by (20).
Now we note at first that, by (21), u(a) ∈ Λ0 (λ) and u(b) ∈ Λ1 (λ) as un (a) ∈ Λ0 (λ), un (b) ∈
Λ1 (λ), n ∈ N, and these spaces are closed. This shows that u ∈ D(Qλ ). Secondly, we see from
(20) that Qλ u = v. Hence the operator Qλ is closed, i.e. Qλ ∈ C(L2 ([a, b], E))).
Finally, we just need to recall that we computed the kernel and range of Qλ in the first step of
the proof, which now shows that Qλ is Fredholm if (Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ)) is a Fredholm pair. Moreover,
if (Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ)) ∈ F L2 (E, ω), then, by (9),
ind(Qλ ) = dim(Λ0 (λ) ∩ Λ1 (λ)) − codim(Λ0 (λ) + Λ1 (λ)) = 0.
Therefore, Qλ ∈ CF sa (L2 ([a, b], E)) by Lemma 2.2.
By the previous lemma, the operators Qλ are in CF sa (L2 ([a, b], E)). Our Theorem B now
shows that these operators actually define a path in CF sa (L2 ([a, b], E)) whose spectral flow
can be computed by the Maslov index. Let us recall from the introduction that we call a path
{(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ))}λ∈I in F L2 (E, ω) admissible if Λ0 (0) ∩ Λ1 (0) = Λ0 (1) ∩ Λ1 (1) = {0}.
Theorem B. Let {(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ))}λ∈I be an admissible path in F L2 (E, ω). Then the path Q in
(17) is continuous in CF sa (L2 ([a, b], E)) and
sf(Q) = µMas (Λ0 (·), Λ1 (·)).
Let us point out that the proof of the first assertion in the previous theorem does not make use
of the assumption that the path in F L2 (E, ω) is admissible. Finally, let us mention once again
that Theorem B generalises Theorem 0.4 of [18] for admissible paths from R2n to Hilbert spaces
E.

3.2

Proof of Theorem B

We divide the proof into two parts and show at first that the path Q = {Qλ }λ∈I is gap-continuous.
In the second step, we prove the equality of the spectral flow and the Maslov index. Throughout
the proof, we abbreviate L2 ([a, b], E) by L2 and H 1 ([a, b], E) by H 1 . Moreover, we simplify the
presentation of the proof by setting a = 0 and b = 1, which clearly is no loss of generality.
Step 1: Q is Gap-Continuous
We summarise at first some facts about the gap-metric dG from [28], which we introduced in (7).
An exhaustive treatment can also be found in [49, §2.4]. Let M, N ⊂ E be two closed subspaces
such that M, N 6= {0}. We set

13

δ(M, N ) = sup d(u, N ),
u∈SM

where SM denotes the unit sphere in M and d(u, N ) = inf v∈N ku − vk. By [28, p.198],
dG (M, N ) = kPM − PN k = max{δ(M, N ), δ(N, M )},

(22)

where PM and PN denote the orthogonal projections onto M and N , respectively.
Let us now consider dG (Qλ , Qλ0 ) for some λ, λ0 ∈ I (see (10)). Following (22), we focus on
δ(graph(Qλ ), graph(Qλ0 ))
and note at first that for u ∈ D(Qλ ) and v ∈ D(Qλ0 )
k(u, Qλ u) − (v, Qλ0 v)kL2 ⊕L2 = k(u − v, J(u′ − v ′ ))kL2 ⊕L2
≤ ku − vk2L2 + kJkku′ − v ′ k2L2
= ku − vkH 1 ,

 12

(23)

where we have used that kJk = 1. As we assume the continuity of the pair {(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ))}λ∈I
in F L2 (E, ω), there are two families of orthogonal projections P̂ , P̃ : I → L(E) such that
im(P̂λ ) = Λ0 (λ),

im(P̃λ ) = Λ1 (λ),

λ ∈ I.

We now set for w ∈ H 1
(Pλ w)(t) = w(t) − (1 − t)(IE − P̂λ )w(0) − t(IE − P̃λ )w(1),
and note that it is readily seen that Pλ2 w = Pλ w, and Pλ w ∈ D(Qλ ) for all w ∈ H 1 and λ ∈ I.
Hence
inf

v∈D(Qλ0 )

ku − vkH 1 ≤ ku − Pλ0 ukH 1 .

(24)

As
u(t) − (Pλ0 u)(t) = (1 − t)(IE − P̂λ0 )(u(0)) + t(IE − P̃λ0 )(u(1)),
we obtain for u ∈ D(Qλ )
ku − Pλ0 ukH 1 ≤ 2(k(IE − P̂λ0 )(u(0))k + k(IE − P̃λ0 )(u(1))k)
= 2(k(IE − P̂λ0 )P̂λ (u(0))k + k(IE − P̃λ0 )P̃λ (u(1))k)

(25)

≤ 2(k(IE − P̂λ0 )P̂λ kku(0)k + k(IE − P̃λ0 )P̃λ kku(1)k),
where we have used that P̂λ (u(0)) = u(0) and P̃λ (u(1)) = u(1) as u ∈ D(Qλ ). Since the point
evaluation is continuous in H 1 , there exists a constant c > 0 such that for t = 0 and t = 1
ku(t)k ≤ ckukH 1 = c kuk2L2 + ku′ k2L2
14

 12

= c kuk2L2 + kJu′ k2L2

 12

,

(26)

where we use that kJxk = kxk for every x ∈ E. Hence, by (23)–(26),
d((u, Qλ u), graph(Qλ0 )) =

1

≤ 2c(k(IE − P̂λ0 )P̂λ k + k(IE − P̃λ0 )P̃λ k)(kuk2L2 + kJu′ k2L2 ) 2 .
As the unit sphere in graph(Qλ ) is given by
{(u, Qλ u) : u ∈ D(Qλ ), kuk2L2 + kJu′ k2L2 = 1},
we finally get
δ(graph(Qλ ), graph(Qλ0 )) =

u∈D(Qλ )
kuk2 +kJu′ k2 =1

(27)

≤ 2c(k(IE − P̂λ0 )P̂λ k + k(IE − P̃λ0 )P̃λ k).
Note that if we swap λ and λ0 and repeat the above argument, we likewise have
δ(graph(Qλ0 ), graph(Qλ )) ≤ 2c(k(IE − P̂λ )P̂λ0 k + k(IE − P̃λ )P̃λ0 k).

(28)

By [28, I.6.34], given two orthogonal projections P, Q in E, if
k(IE − P )Qk < 1 and k(IE − Q)P k < 1,
then
k(IE − P )Qk = k(IE − Q)P k = kP − Qk.
Hence, as (IE − P̂λ )P̂λ0 = (IE − P̃λ )P̃λ0 = 0 for λ = λ0 , we have for all λ in a neighbourhood of
λ0
k(IE − P̂λ )P̂λ0 k = k(IE − P̂λ0 )P̂λ k = kP̂λ − P̂λ0 k
and
k(IE − P̃λ )P̃λ0 k = k(IE − P̃λ0 )P̃λ k = kP̃λ − P̃λ0 k.
Consequently, we obtain from (22), (27) and (28) for all λ sufficiently close to λ0
dG (Qλ , Qλ0 ) = max{δ(graph(Qλ ), graph(Qλ0 )), δ(graph(Qλ0 ), graph(Qλ ))}
≤ 2c(kP̂λ − P̂λ0 k + kP̃λ − P̃λ0 k),
which shows that Q = {Qλ }λ∈I is indeed continuous in CF (L2 ([a, b], E)).

15

Step 2: The Spectral Flow Formula
We assume in this step of our proof that E is of infinite dimension so that we can apply Theorem
2.1. As the finite dimensional case was shown by Cappell, Lee and Miller in [18], this is no
restriction of the generality. Actually, a simple modification of the below argument shows the
assertion in finite dimensions, and the reader is invited to work out the details.
In what follows, we let F L20 (E, ω) be the set of all pairs (Λ0 , Λ1 ) ∈ F L2 (E, ω) which are transversal, i.e. Λ0 ∩ Λ1 = {0}.
Lemma 3.2. The set F L20 (E, ω) of transversal pairs is path-connected in F L2 (E, ω).
Proof. We note at first that by [22, Rem. 1.33], for every W ∈ Λ(E, ω) the set
F L0W (E, ω) = {L ∈ F LW (E, ω) : dim(L ∩ W ) = 0} ⊂ F LW (E, ω)
is homeomorphic to the space of bounded selfadjoint operators on a Hilbert space. Hence
F L0W (E, ω) is contractible and so in particular path-connected.
Let (Λ1 , Λ2 ) and (Λ3 , Λ4 ) be two transversal pairs. By [39], there is Λ′1 ∈ Λ(E, ω) such that
Λ′1 ⊕ Λ2 = Λ′1 ⊕ Λ4 = E. In particular, we obtain a path connecting (Λ1 , Λ2 ) and (Λ′1 , Λ2 ) inside
F L0Λ2 (E, ω) ⊂ F L20 (E, ω). Also, as F L0Λ′1 (E, ω) is path-connected, there is a path connecting
(Λ′1 , Λ2 ) and (Λ′1 , Λ4 ) inside F L20 (E, ω). Finally, there is a path from (Λ′1 , Λ4 ) to (Λ3 , Λ4 ) inside
F L20 (E, ω) as F L0Λ4 (E, ω) is path-connected.
Our proof of the spectral flow formula in Theorem B is based on the following proposition.
In its statement and proof we simplify our notation by denoting paths {(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ))}λ∈I in
F L2 (E, ω) by γ.
Proposition 3.3. Let µ : Ω(F L2 (E, ω), F L20 (E, ω)) → Z be a map such that
(i) µ(γ) = 0 if γ(λ) ∈ F L20 (E, ω) for all λ ∈ I.
(ii) µ(γ1 ∗ γ2 ) = µ(γ1 ) + µ(γ2 ) whenever the concatenation γ1 ∗ γ2 is defined.
(iii) µ(γ1 ) = µ(γ2 ) if the paths γ1 and γ2 are homotopic with fixed endpoints.
(iv) There is a path γnor such that µ(γnor ) = µMas (γnor ) = 1.
Then

µ = µMas : Ω(F L2 (E, ω), F L20 (E, ω)) → Z.

Note that the Maslov index indeed has the properties (i) - (iii) in Proposition 3.3 as we have
recalled in Section 2.1, (i’) - (iii’).
Proof. Let p0 = (Λ0 , Λ′0 ) ∈ F L20 (E, ω) be any transversal pair. Note that, by (ii) and (iii), µ
induces a homomorphism π1 (F L2 (E, ω), p0 ) → Z. Moreover, let us recall from Theorem 2.1 that
µMas : π1 (F L2 (E, ω), p0 ) → Z is an isomorphism.
By Lemma 3.2, we can connect p0 to γnor (0) and γnor (1) to p0 by paths γ1 , γ2 in F L20 (E, ω).
Then the concatenation γ1 ∗ γnor ∗ γ2 is a closed path based at p0 and consequently defines an
element of the infinite cyclic group π1 (F L2 (E, ω), p0 ). We obtain by (i), (ii) and (iv)
µMas (γ1 ∗ γnor ∗ γ2 ) = µMas (γ1 ) + µMas (γnor ) + µMas (γ2 ) = µMas (γnor ) = 1

16

and see that γ1 ∗ γnor ∗ γ2 is a generator of π1 (F L2 (E, ω), p0 ). As, by the same argument,
µ(γ1 ∗ γnor ∗ γ2 ) = 1, we have shown that µ = µMas : π1 (F L2 (E, ω), p0 ) → Z.
We now consider the general case of an arbitrary element γ ∈ Ω(F L2 (E, ω), F L20 (E, ω)). As the
endpoints of γ are in F L20 (E, ω), we can again find two paths γ1 , γ2 such that γ1 connects p0 and
γ(0) inside F L20 (E, ω), and γ2 connects γ(1) and p0 inside F L20 (E, ω). Then γ1 ∗ γ ∗ γ2 defines
an element of π1 (F L2 (E, ω), p0 ) and we obtain from the previous paragraph, (i) and (ii)
µ(γ) = µ(γ1 ) + µ(γ) + µ(γ2 ) = µ(γ1 ∗ γ ∗ γ2 ) = µMas (γ1 ∗ γ ∗ γ2 )
= µMas (γ1 ) + µMas (γ) + µMas (γ2 ) = µMas (γ).

Remark 3.4. Let us point out that a similar argument as in the proof of Proposition 3.3 can be
used to characterise the Maslov index axiomatically by just three axioms. Indeed, it follows from
the construction in [22] that the Maslov index is invariant under homotopies having endpoints in
F L20 (E, ω). It is readily seen that (i) is redundant when using this homotopy invariance in (iii).
We now define a map
µ : Ω(F L2 (E, ω), F L20 (E, ω)) → Z,

µ({(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ))}λ∈I ) = sf(Q),

where Q is the path of differential operators in (17). By the properties of the spectral flow
from Section 2.2.2, we see at once that µ satisfies (ii) and (iii) in Proposition 3.3. Moreover, if
(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ)) ∈ F L20 (E, ω) for all λ ∈ I, then
dim ker(Qλ ) = dim(Λ0 (λ) ∩ Λ1 (λ)) = 0,

λ ∈ I.

Therefore, Qλ is invertible for all λ ∈ I, which shows that µ({(Λ0 (λ), Λ1 (λ))}λ∈I ) = sf(Q) = 0.
Hence in order to deduce Theorem B from Proposition 3.3 we only need to find a path γnor in
F L2 (E, ω) with transversal endpoints for which µMas (γnor ) = µ(γnor ) = 1. This will now keep
us busy for the remainder of this section.
At first, to obtain a path of Lagrangian subspaces having Maslov index 1, we argue similar as
in Example 2.31 in [22]. Let Λ be an arbitrary Lagrangian subspace of (E, ω), and V ⊂ Λ⊥ a
one-dimensional subspace. We consider the bounded linear operators Ψλ defined by

Ψλ u =

(

(cos(πλ)IE + sin(πλ)J)u,
u,

u∈V
u ∈ V ⊥ ∩ Λ⊥ ,

(29)


and set Λ(λ) = Ψλ Λ⊥ for λ ∈ I. It is readily seen that (Λ(λ), Λ) ∈ F LΛ (E, ω). Hence
γnor (λ) := (Λ(λ), Λ) ∈ F L2 (E, ω) for all λ ∈ I. Note that Λ(λ) ∩ Λ 6= {0} if and only if λ = 12 ,
where the intersection is the one-dimensional space J(V ) ⊂ Λ.
Furutani explained in [22, §3.4] how the Maslov index for paths (Λ(λ), Λ) ∈ F L2 (E, ω) can be
computed in cases when there is only one single parameter value λ0 for which Λ(λ0 ) ∩ Λ 6= {0}.
For all λ sufficiently close to λ0 , there is a bounded linear operator Aλ : Λ(λ0 ) → Λ(λ0 ) such
that
Λ(λ) = {u + JAλ u : u ∈ Λ(λ0 )}.
17

If Λ(·) is differentiable in Λ(E, ω), then A is a differentiable path in L(Λ(λ0 )). The Maslov index
of {(Λ(λ), Λ)}λ∈I is given by the signature of the quadratic form

Γ : Λ(λ0 ) ∩ Λ → R,

Γ[u] =

d
|λ=λ0 ω(u, JAλ u).
dλ

(30)

For our particular path Λ(·) defined by (29), we see that
Λ(λ0 ) = (V ⊥ ∩ Λ⊥ ) ⊕ J(V ),
where λ0 = 12 . Let us now consider for λ ∈ (0, 1) the operators Aλ on Λ(λ0 ) which are defined
by

Aλ u =

(

− cos(πλ)
sin(πλ) u, u ∈ J(V )
u ∈ V ⊥ ∩ Λ⊥ .

0,

We claim that
Λ(λ) = {u + JAλ u : u ∈ Λ(λ0 )}.

(31)

Indeed, we note at first that trivially V ⊥ ∩ Λ⊥ = {u + JAλ u : u ∈ V ⊥ ∩ Λ⊥ }. Moreover, as
λ ∈ (0, 1), we see that u ∈ J(V ) if and only if there is v ∈ V such that u = sin(πλ)Jv. Since
u + JAλ u = sin(πλ)Jv − J 2 cos(πλ)v = cos(πλ)v + sin(πλ)Jv,
this shows (31). The crossing form (30) is defined on Λ(λ0 ) ∩ Λ, which is the one-dimensional
space J(V ) on which Aλ acts by
Aλ u = −

cos(πλ)
u.
sin(πλ)

Hence
d

hu, ui,
ω(u, JAλ u) =

sin2 (πλ)
and so Γ[u] = πhu, ui, which has signature 1. Consequently, we have shown that
µMas (γnor ) = 1.
Let us now consider our other invariant µ, which is by definition the spectral flow of the path of
operators Q associated to γnor as in (17). Let us recall that the kernel of Qλ is the intersection
Λ(λ) ∩ Λ. As Qλ is Fredholm of index 0 for all λ ∈ I, this means that Qλ is not invertible if and
only if λ = λ0 = 12 , and Qλ0 has a one-dimensional kernel. Therefore, the spectral flow of Q can
only be −1, 0 or 1. The final step of our proof is the following lemma about the eigenvalues of
Qλ . Let us point out once again that we denote by λ our parameter in I and not elements of
spectra of operators.

Lemma 3.5. The eigenvalues of Qλ are given by

o nπ

π
σp (Qλ ) = πλ − + πk : k ∈ Z ∪
+ kπ : k ∈ Z .

2
Moreover, the elements of the first set on the right hand side are simple eigenvalues as long as
λ ∈ (0, 1).
Proof. We first note that, for µ ∈ R, all solutions of Ju′ = µu are given by
u(t) = exp(−µtJ)c, t ∈ [0, 1], c ∈ E.
Such a function belongs to D(Qλ ) if and only if
u(0) ∈ Λ(λ),

u(1) = exp(−µJ)u(0) ∈ Λ,

or, in other words,
exp(µJ)(Λ) ∩ Λ(λ) 6= {0}.
It is readily seen from J 2 = −IE that
exp(µJ) = cos(µ)IE + sin(µ)J.

(32)

If we compare (32) and (29), we see that µ is an eigenvalue of Qλ if and only if either
(i) (cos(µ)IE + sin(µ)J)Λ ∩ (Λ⊥ ∩ V ⊥ ) 6= {0}, or
(ii) (cos(µ)IE + sin(µ)J)Λ ∩ (cos(πλ)IE + sin(πλ)J)V 6= {0}.
From (8), we see that the first case happens if and only if cos(µ) = 0, i.e. λ = π2 + kπ for
k ∈ Z. Note that the intersections are of infinite dimension and so we have eigenvalues of infinite
multiplicity. This reflects the fact that Qλ does not have a compact resolvent.
In the second case, there are non-zero elements x ∈ V ⊂ Λ⊥ and y ∈ Λ such that
(
sin(πλ)Jx = cos(µ)y
cos(πλ)x = sin(µ)Jy.
These equations can hold if and only if there is α ∈ R such that Jy = αx, which yields
(
sin(πλ) = −α cos(µ)
cos(πλ) = α sin(µ)
π

or, in other words, e−i(πλ− 2 ) = −αe−iµ . This clearly implies that |α| = 1 and µ = πλ − π2 + kπ,
k ∈ Z. Note that these are eigenvalues of multiplicity one as V is one-dimensional.
It is now easy to obtain the spectral flow formula in Theorem B from the previous lemma. Indeed,
we know from the construction of the spectral flow that there is 0 < ε < π2 such that, for all
λ ∈ I, µ ∈ (−ε, ε) is either in the resolvent set of Qλ or it is an eigenvalue of finite multiplicity.
Therefore, by the properties (i) and (ii) of the spectral flow from Section 2.2.2 and Lemma 3.5,
we only need to consider the eigenvalue
π
2
for λ in a neighbourhood of λ0 = 12 . It is a straightforward consequence of the definition of the
spectral flow (14) that sf(Q) = 1. Hence µ(γnor ) = 1 and Theorem B is proved.
µ(λ) = πλ −

Theorem C

In this section, we let H be a complex Hilbert space unless otherwise stated. Let us point out
that, however, most of our results carry over to real Hilbert spaces when KO-theory is used
instead of K-theory.
The index bundle for families of bounded Fredholm operators in a Hilbert space was independently introduced by Atiyah and Jänich in the sixties (see [12] and [27]). It assigns to any family
L : X → BF(H) of bounded Fredholm operators on H a K-theory class
ind(L) ∈ K(X)

(33)

which has several properties that are similar to the Fredholm index of a single operator. One
of the main applications of this generalisations to families is that it shows that the space of
Fredholm operators on a separable Hilbert space is a classifying space for K-theory. The index
bundle was later generalised to families of Fredholm operators in Banach spaces (see [55]), and
to morphisms between Banach bundles in [50]. Let us briefly recall the latter construction, as
we will need it below in the definition of the index bundle for gap-continuous families.
Let E and F be Banach bundles over a compact and connected base space X and let L : E → F
be a bundle morphism which is Fredholm in every fibre. It was shown in [50] that there is a
finite dimensional subbundle V ⊂ F such that
im(Lλ ) + Vλ = Fλ ,

λ ∈ X.

(34)

As V is finite dimensional, there is a bundle morphism P : F → F such that P 2 = P and
im(Pλ ) = Vλ , λ ∈ X. Hence the composition
L

I −P

F
E−
→ F −−
−−→ V ′

is a surjective Banach bundle morphism onto V ′ = im(IF − P ). As the fibrewise kernels of
surjective Banach bundle morphisms are Banach bundles (see [30]), and ker((IFλ − Pλ ) ◦ Lλ ) =
L−1
λ (Vλ ), we obtain a subbundle
E(L, V) := L−1 (V) ⊂ E.
It is readily seen that
dim(E(L, V)) = ind(Lλ ) + dim(V),

λ ∈ X,

(35)

where ind(Lλ ) denotes the Fredholm index of the operator Lλ .
Let us now assume that Y ⊂ X is a closed subset of X such that Lλ is invertible for all λ ∈ Y .
Then L induces a morphism L : E(L, V) → V between finite dimensional vector bundles, which
is an isomorphism over Y . Hence we obtain a K-theory class (see Appendix B)
ind(L) = [E(L, V), V, L] ∈ K(X, Y ),
which we call the index bundle of L. This definition is sensible as it can be shown that ind(L)
does not depend on the choice of the bundle V in (34). Note that we do not exclude the case
that Y = ∅ in the definition of ind(L), however, if Y 6= ∅, then the operators Lλ are necessarily
of Fredholm index 0 by (35).
In the following list of properties of the index bundle, we assume throughout that L : E → F is
a Fredholm morphism such that Lλ is an isomorphism for every λ ∈ Y .
20

• If L is a bundle isomorphism, then ind(L) = 0 ∈ K(X, Y ).
• If M : Ẽ → F̃ is a further Fredholm morphisms such that Mλ is invertible for all λ ∈ Y ,
then
ind(L ⊕ M ) = ind(L) + ind(M ) ∈ K(X, Y ).
• Let E and F be Banach bundles over X × I and h : E → F a Fredholm morphism. If h(λ,s)
is invertible for all (λ, s) ∈ Y × I, then
ind(h |X×{0} ) = ind(h |X×{1} ) ∈ K(X, Y ).
• Let K : E → F be a morphism which is compact in every fibre, and let Lλ + sKλ be
invertible for all λ ∈ Y , s ∈ I. Then
ind(L + K) = ind(L) ∈ K(X, Y ).
We now assume that (X ′ , Y ′ ) is a further compact pair.
• If f : (X ′ , Y ′ ) → (X, Y ) is continuous, then
(f ∗ L)λ := Lf (λ) : Ef (λ) → Ff (λ)
defines a morphism f ∗ L : f ∗ E → f ∗ F which is Fredholm. Moreover,
ind(f ∗ L) = f ∗ ind(L) ∈ K(X ′ , Y ′ ).
Finally, let G be a further Banach bundle over X. The following rule is usually called the
logarithmic property of the index bundle.
• If M : F → G is a further Fredholm morphism which is invertible over Y , then
ind(M ◦ L) = ind(M ) + ind(L) ∈ K(X, Y ).

4.1

The Index Bundle for Gap-Continuous Families

Let us now consider a gap-continuous family A : X → CF(H) of Fredholm operators on H which
are parametrised by a compact space X. The aim of this section is to generalise the index bundle
(33) of Atiyah and Jänich to this setting of unbounded Fredholm operators, where we follow [49]
(see also [19]). Note that the domains D(Aλ ) are not constant and so the classical construction
cannot be adapted straight away just by using graph norms. The key step of our approach is the
construction of the domain bundle, for which we want to recall at first the following well known
theorem that can be found, e.g., in [46, Thm. 3.2].
Theorem 4.1. Let p : E → X be a surjective map from some set E to a topological space X,
and let J be an index set. Let {Uj }j∈J be an open cover of X, and suppose that we are given
for each Uj a Banach space Ej and a bijection
ϕj : p−1 (Uj ) → Uj × Ej

21

such that p = p1 ◦ ϕj on p−1 (Uj ), where p1 : Uj × Ej → Uj denotes the projection onto the first
component. Moreover, we assume that, for each pair Ui , Uj such that Ui ∩ Uj 6= ∅, the map
Ui ∩ Uj → GL(Ej , Ei ),

λ 7→ (ϕi ◦ ϕ−1
j )λ

is continuous with respect to the norm topology.
Then there exists a unique topology on E making it into the total space of a Banach bundle with
projection p and trivialising covering {Uj }j∈J .
If A : X → CF (H) is continuous with respect to the gap-topology on CF (H), then there is a
family of projections P : X → L(H × H) such that im(Pλ ) = graph(Aλ ). We fix some λ0 ∈ X
and consider the open set


1
Uλ0 := λ ∈ X : dG (Aλ , Aλ0 ) <
⊂ X.
3
It can be shown by the Neumann series that
Pgraph(Aλ0 ) |graph(Aλ ) : graph(Aλ ) → graph(Aλ0 )
is an isomorphism for all λ ∈ Uλ0 , and that the map
Uλ0 ∋ λ 7→ (Pgraph(Aλ0 ) |graph(Aλ ) )−1 ∈ L(graph(Aλ0 ), H × H)

(36)

is continuous with respect to the norm topology on the latter space (see [9] or [49, §6.1]). We
now consider the disjoint union
a
D(A) :=
D(Aλ )
λ∈X

and in what follows we denote by π : D(A) → X the canonical surjection. We define
τλ0 : π −1 (Uλ0 ) → Uλ0 × graph(Aλ0 ),

τλ0 (λ, u) = (λ, Pgraph(Aλ0 ) (u, Aλ u)),

and note that graph(Aλ0 ) ⊂ H × H is a Banach space as Aλ0 is a closed operator. It is readily
: Uλ0 × graph(Aλ0 ) → π −1 (Uλ0 ) given by
seen that this map has an inverse τλ−1
0
(λ, u) = P1 (Pgraph(Aλ0 ) |graph(Aλ ) )−1 ,
τλ−1
0
where P1 denotes the projection onto H × {0} in H × H. Moreover, if λ1 ∈ X is a point in our
parameter space such that Uλ0 ∩ Uλ1 6= ∅, then
)λ = Pgraph(Aλ1 ) (Pgraph(Aλ0 ) |graph(Aλ ) )−1 ∈ L(graph(Aλ0 ), graph(Aλ1 )),
(τλ1 ◦ τλ−1
0
and, by (36), this depends continuously on λ. As the maps
Pgraph(Aλ0 ) |graph(Aλ ) : graph(Aλ ) → graph(Aλ0 ),
Pgraph(Aλ1 ) |graph(Aλ ) : graph(Aλ ) → graph(Aλ1 )
are isomorphisms, we finally see that

22

)λ ∈ GL(graph(Aλ0 ), graph(Aλ1 )),
(τλ1 ◦ τλ−1
0

λ ∈ Uλ0 ∩ Uλ1 .

Hence, by Theorem 4.1, π : D(A) → X is a Hilbert bundle, which we we call the domain bundle
of the family A.
Note that, by the definition of our trivialisations, the map P1 |graph(Aλ ) : graph(Aλ ) → D(A)λ
is a topological isomorphism, where D(A)λ denotes the fibre of D(A) over λ ∈ X. Hence the
topology of D(A)λ is the same as the one induced by the graph norm of Aλ . In particular, Aλ
induces a bounded operator between D(A)λ and H. Actually, the family A is a bundle morphism
between D(A) and the product bundle X ×H, which can be seen as follows. If Uλ0 is a trivialising
neighbourhood about some λ0 and τλ0 : π −1 (Uλ0 ) → Uλ0 × graph(Aλ0 ) a trivialisation as above,
then
(λ, ·)) = P2 (Pgraph(Aλ0 ) |graph(Aλ ) )−1 ∈ L(graph(Aλ0 ), H),
Aλ (τλ−1
0
where P2 is the projection onto {0} × H in H × H. As these bounded operators depend continuously on λ ∈ Uλ0 by (36), we see that A is indeed a bundle morphisms.
Let us now assume that A : X → CF (H) is a family of Fredholm operators and Y ⊂ X a closed
subset such that Aλ is invertible for all λ ∈ Y . As D(A)λ has the topology induced by the graph
norm, we see that Aλ is a bounded Fredholm operator between this space and H. Hence we
obtain a Fredholm morphism A : D(A) → X × H, which is invertible for λ ∈ X if and only if
the unbounded operator Aλ is invertible.
We can now apply the index bundle construction for Fredholm morphisms between Banach bundles to obtain a K-theory class
ind(A) ∈ K(X, Y ),
which we henceforth call the index bundle of the family A : X → CF (H).
The following properties of the index bundle are straightforward consequences of the corresponding rules for Fredholm morphisms from the final part of the previous section.
• If Aλ ∈ CF(H) is invertible for every λ ∈ X, then
ind(A) = 0 ∈ K(X, Y ).
• Let A1 , A2 : X → CF(H) be such that A1,λ and A2,λ are invertible for all λ ∈ Y . Then
ind(A1 ⊕ A2 ) = ind(A1 ) ⊕ ind(A2 ) ∈ K(X, Y ).
• If h : I × X → CF(H) is continuous and h(s, λ) is invertible for all s ∈ I and λ ∈ Y , then
ind(h(0, ·)) = ind(h(1, ·)) ∈ K(X, Y ).
• If (X ′ , Y ′ ) is another compact pair and f : (X ′ , Y ′ ) → (X, Y ) continuous, then (f ∗ A)λ =
Af (λ) defines a gap-continuous family f ∗ A : X ′ → CF (H) such that (f ∗ A)λ is invertible
for all λ ∈ Y ′ . Moreover,
ind(f ∗ A) = f ∗ ind(A) ∈ K(X ′ , Y ′ ).

23

Note that the last property requires to show that D(f ∗ A) = f ∗ D(A) which, however, readily
follows from the definition of the domain bundle.
We will need in the proof of Theorem A the following important property of the index bundle,
which was not shown in [49] in this generality.
Lemma 4.2. Let A : X → CF (H) be gap-continuous and such that Aλ is invertible for all
λ ∈ Y ⊂ X. If M, N : X → GL(H) are continuous families of invertible operators on H, then
M AN is gap-continuous, and
ind(M AN ) = ind(A) ∈ K(X, Y ).
Proof. Note that
graph(Mλ Aλ Nλ ) = {(u, Mλ Aλ Nλ u) : u ∈ Nλ−1 (D(Aλ ))} = {(Nλ−1 v, Mλ Aλ v) : v ∈ D(Aλ )}
 −1

Nλ

graph(Aλ ) =: Uλ graph(Aλ ) ⊂ H × H,

Mλ
and so {Uλ Pgraph(Aλ ) Uλ−1 }λ∈X is a continuous family of oblique projections onto
{graph(Mλ Aλ Nλ )}λ∈X in L(H × H). By [28, Thm. I.6.35], the corresponding orthogonal projections Pgraph(Mλ Aλ Nλ ) onto graph(Mλ Aλ Nλ ) satisfy
kPgraph(Mµ Aµ Nµ ) − Pgraph(Mλ Aλ Nλ ) k ≤ kUµ Pgraph(Aµ ) Uµ−1 − Uλ Pgraph(Aλ ) Uλ−1 k,

µ, λ ∈ X,

and consequently {Pgraph(Mλ Aλ Nλ ) }λ∈X is continuous. This shows that M AN is gap-continuous.
For the second claim, we just need to note that, by Kuiper’s Theorem, M and N are homotopic
to the constant family Gλ = IH , λ ∈ X. Hence we obtain by the homotopy invariance
ind(M AN ) = ind(A) ∈ K(X, Y ),
where the continuity of the homotopy follows as in the first part of this proof.

4.2

Spectral Flow and the Index Bundle

We now consider families A : X → CF sa (H), and we assume again that Y ⊂ X is a closed
subset such that Aλ is invertible for λ ∈ Y . We note at first that ind(A) = 0 ∈ K(X, Y ) in this
case, which follows by deforming A to the family A + iIH . As the operators Aλ are selfadjoint,
Aλ + iIH is invertible for any λ and so this family has indeed a trivial index bundle.
We now define a family
Â : X × R → CF(H)
where D(Â(λ,s) ) = D(Aλ ) for (λ, s) ∈ X × R and
Â(λ,s) = Aλ + i s IH .
Note that Â(λ,s) is invertible if s 6= 0 as Aλ is selfadjoint. Hence, Â(λ,s) is in CF (H) for all
(λ, s) ∈ X × R.
Lemma 4.3. The family Â : X × R → CF(H) is gap-continuous.
24

Proof. We let λ0 ∈ X, s0 ∈ R, and obtain from the triangle inequality
dG (Aλ + is IH , Aλ0 + is0 IH ) ≤dG (Aλ + is IH , Aλ0 + is IH )
+dG (Aλ0 + is IH , Aλ0 + is0 IH ).

(37)

By [28, Thm. IV.2.17], we have
dG (Aλ + is IH , Aλ0 + is IH ) ≤ 2(1 + s2 ) dG (Aλ , Aλ0 ).

(38)

For the remaining term, we note that the family of isomorphisms
Us : H × H → H × H,

Us (u, v) = (u, v − i(s − s0 )u)

maps graph(Aλ0 + is IH ) to graph(Aλ0 + is0 IH ). Hence Us−1 Pgraph(Aλ0 +is0 IH ) Us is an oblique
projection onto graph(Aλ0 + is IH ). The rest of the proof is similar to Lemma 4.2. By [28, Thm.
I.6.35], the corresponding orthogonal projections Pgraph(Aλ0 +is IH ) onto graph(Aλ0 +is IH ) satisfy
kPgraph(Aλ0 +is IH ) − Pgraph(Aλ0 +is0 IH ) k ≤ kUs−1 Pgraph(Aλ0 +is0 IH ) Us − Pgraph(Aλ0 +is0 IH ) k,
where we use that Us0 = IH⊕H . This shows the continuity of {Pgraph(Aλ0 +is IH ) }s∈R at s0 , and
so we obtain the continuity of Â from (37).
Let us point out that our family Â is parametrised by the non-compact topological space X × R
and so we cannot apply the index bundle construction from the previous section. However, using
that Â(λ,s) is invertible for all (λ, s) that are outside of the compact space X × {0}, it is readily
seen that the previous construction carries over to this slightly more general setting. Actually,
we only need to use that there is a bundle as in (34) for the restricted family Â |X×{0} = A,
which is parametrised by a compact space. However, for later reference, we note the following
refined version of (34).
Lemma 4.4. Let A = {Aλ }λ∈X be a gap-continuous family in CF sa (H). Then there are
λ1 , . . . , λm ∈ X such that
V := ker(Aλ1 ) + · · · + ker(Aλm )

(39)

satisfies
im(Aλ ) + V = H,

λ ∈ X.

(40)

Proof. We note at first that the assertion is obviously true if Aλ is invertible for all λ ∈ X. Let
us now assume that there is λ0 ∈ X such that ker(Aλ0 ) 6= {0}. Let
ψ : D(A) |U → U × graph(Aλ0 )
be a trivialisation of the domain bundle D(A) in a neighbourhood U of λ0 , and let us consider
the bounded Fredholm operators Lλ := Aλ ◦ ψλ−1 : graph(Aλ0 ) → H for λ ∈ U . If P denotes the
orthogonal projection onto the closed subspace im(Aλ0 ) ⊂ H, then the composition

25

Lλ

P

0
H−
→ im(Aλ0 )
graph(Aλ0 ) −−→

is surjective. By [24, Thm. XI.6.1], there exists a bounded right inverse M , i.e. (P ◦ Lλ0 ) ◦ M =
Iim(Aλ0 ) . As GL(im(Aλ0 )) is open in L(im(Aλ0 )) in the norm topology, we see that there is a
neighbourhood Uλ0 ⊂ U such that (P ◦ Lλ ) ◦ M ∈ GL(im(Aλ0 )) for all λ ∈ Uλ0 . Consequently,
P ◦ Lλ is surjective or, equivalently,
im(Aλ ) + ker(Aλ0 ) = im(Lλ ) + ker(Aλ0 ) = H,

λ ∈ Uλ0 ,

where we have used that im(Aλ0 )⊥ = ker(Aλ0 ).
Let us now denote by Σ ⊂ X the set of all λ ∈ X such that ker(Aλ ) is non-invertible. As the
set of invertible elements in C(H) is open by [28, Thm. IV.5.2.21], we see that Σ is closed as
preimage of a closed set under the continuous map A : X → CF sa (H). Hence, as X is compact,
we can find λ1 , . . . , λm such that the corresponding neighbourhoods {Uλi }i=1,...,m from the first
step of the proof are a finite open cover of Σ. Finally, we set as in (39)
V := ker(Aλ1 ) + · · · + ker(Aλm )
and note that this space indeed satisfies (40).
Let us now continue with the construction of the index bundle for our family A : X → CF sa (H).
By the previous Lemma 4.4, there is V ⊂ H such that
im(Â(λ,s) ) + V = H,

(λ, s) ∈ X × R,

(41)

where we use that Â(λ,s) is invertible if s 6= 0. Hence the domain bundle E(Â, V ) is defined
and Â induces a Fredholm morphism E(Â, V ) → Θ(V ), where Θ(V ) now denotes the product
bundle with fibre V over X × R. Note that Â is invertible outside the compact set X × {0} and
for all (λ, 0) ∈ Y × R. Consequently, we obtain an odd K-theory class
s-ind(A) := [E(Â, V ), Θ(V ), Â] ∈ K(X × R, Y × R) = K −1 (X, Y ),
which we call the index bundle of the selfadjoint family A. As in the non-selfadjoint case, it is
not very difficult to see that s-ind(A) is well defined, i.e. it does not depend on the choice of the
space V in (41). Moreover, we note the following properties:
• If Aλ is invertible for all λ ∈ I, then s-ind(A) = 0 ∈ K −1 (X, Y ).
• Let A1 , A2 : X → CF sa (H) be two gap-continuous families such that A1,λ and A2,λ are
invertible for all λ ∈ Y , then
s-ind(A1 ⊕ A2 ) = s-ind(A1 ) + s-ind(A2 ) ∈ K −1 (X, Y ).
• If h : I × X → CF sa (H) is gap-continuous and h(s, λ) is invertible for all s ∈ I and λ ∈ Y ,
then
s-ind(h(0, ·)) = s-ind(h(1, ·)) ∈ K −1 (X, Y ).

26

We discussed in the previous section the index bundle for gap-continuous families under pullbacks.
For the corresponding result in the selfadjoint case, we need to introduce a further notation. If
(X ′ , Y ′ ) is another compact pair and f : (X ′ , Y ′ ) → (X, Y ) continuous, then we set
f : X ′ × R → X × R,

f (λ, s) = (f (λ), s),

and note that
∗

• s-ind(f ∗ A) = f s-ind(A) ∈ K −1 (X, Y ), where, as before, (f ∗ A)λ = Af (λ) .
Finally, we obtain from Corollary 2.3 and Lemma 4.2 the following result.
Lemma 4.5. Assume that A : X → CF sa (H) is such that Aλ is invertible for all λ ∈ Y . Let
M : X → GL(H) be a family of bounded invertible operators and let us denote by Mλ∗ the adjoint
of Mλ . Then
s-ind(M ∗ AM ) = s-ind(A) ∈ K −1 (X, Y ).
In order to discuss Theorem C, we now consider the case that (X, Y ) = (I, ∂I). Note that there
is an isomorphism c1 : K −1 (I, ∂I) → Z which we recall in Appendix B. Hence we can assign to
any path in CF sa (H) having invertible endpoints an integer as first Chern number of its index
bundle.
Theorem C. Let A = {Aλ }λ∈I be a path in CF sa (H) such that A0 and A1 are invertible. Then
sf(A) = c1 (s-ind(A)) ∈ Z.
Let us point out that it follows from (16) that if E is a real Hilbert space and A = {Aλ }λ∈I a
path in CF sa (E), then
sf(A) = c1 (s-ind(AC ))).

4.3

(42)

Proof of Theorem C

We recall from Section 2.2.2 that Ω(CF sa (H), GC sa (H)) denotes the set of all paths in CF sa (H)
having invertible endpoints. We set
µ : Ω(CF sa (H), GC sa (H)) → Z,

µ(A) = c1 (s-ind(A)) ∈ Z

and now show that µ satisfies all assumptions of Theorem 2.6 in three steps.
Step 1: Homotopy Invariance
It follows from the properties of the index bundle for families in CF sa (H) that
s-ind(A1 ) = s-ind(A2 ) ∈ K −1 (I, ∂I)
if A1 and A2 are homotopic by a homotopy inside Ω(CF sa (H), GC sa (H)). Hence the same is
true for µ showing the homotopy invariance in Theorem 2.6.

27

Step 2: Additivity under Concatenation
This step is based on the following rather technical lemma.
Lemma 4.6. Let A ∈ Ω(CF sa (H), GC sa (H)) and f1 , f2 : I → I continuous functions such that
f1 (0) = 0, f2 (1) = 1 and f1 (1) = f2 (0). If Af1 (1) ∈ GC sa (H), then
s-ind((f1 ∗ f2 )∗ A) = s-ind(f1∗ A) + s-ind(f2∗ A) ∈ K −1 (I, ∂I).
Proof. We note at first that the domain bundle D(Â) is trivial as it is a bundle over the contractible space I × R. Consequently, there is a global trivialisation ψ : (I × R) × H → D(Â)
and we obtain from the basic properties of the index bundle for Fredholm morphisms for any

for 12 ≤ λ ≤ 1. Note that h is continuous, as g1 ( 12 , s) = g2 ( 12 , s) and in this case the above
matrix product is (g1∗ Ã)(λ,s) ⊕ (g2∗ Ã)(λ,s) . Hence the definitions of hΘ coincide for all (Θ, λ, s) ∈
I × { 21 } × R.
The homotopy h connects the maps h0 = g1∗ Ã ⊕ g2∗ Ã and

h1 (λ, s) =

where we have used in the final step that g1 is homotopic to f 1 and g2 is homotopic to f 2 by
canonical homotopies. Now the assertion follows from (43).
The rest of the proof of the concatenation property is now easily obtained. Indeed, let
A1 , A2 ∈ Ω(CF sa (H), GC sa (H)) be such that the concatenation A1 ∗ A2 is defined. We define
two functions f1 , f2 : I → I by

t, f2 (t) = (t + 1),

and note that f1 ∗ f2 is the identity on I, as well as fi∗ (A1 ∗ A2 ) = Ai for i = 1, 2. The assertion
follows by applying the previous lemma to f1 , f2 and A := A1 ∗ A2 .
f1 (t) =

Step 3: Normalisation
We consider the path Anor = {Aλ }λ∈I in (15), and recall that Aλ is not invertible if and only if
λ = λ0 := 12 . The kernel and cokernel of Aλ0 is the one-dimensional space V := im(P0 ) and so
im(Â(λ,s) ) + V = H,

(λ, s) ∈ I × R.

As H = im(P+ ) ⊕ im(P0 ) ⊕ im(P− ) is a decomposition of H into invariant subspaces of Aλ , we
see that

(V ) = V,
(λ,s) (V ) = (Aλ + isIH )

(λ, s) ∈ I × R.

Moreover,
Â(λ,s) |V = (λ − λ0 ) P0 + isIV .
Hence we obtain
s-ind(A) = [Θ(V ), Θ(V ), Â |V ] = [Θ(C), Θ(C), κ] ∈ K −1 (I, ∂I),
where
κ : I × R → C,

κ(λ, s) = λ − λ0 + is.

By (69), this yields
µ(A) = c1 (s-ind(A)) =

Theorem A

5.1

Setting and Statement

Let E be a symplectic Hilbert space with symplectic form ω(x, y) = hJx, yiE , where J : E → E
is a bounded linear operator such that J 2 = −IE and J T = −J. We let S : I × R → S(E) be a
family of selfadjoint operators on E and consider the differential operators
Aλ : H 1 (R, E) ⊂ L2 (R, E) → L2 (R, E),

(Aλ u)(t) = Ju′ (t) + Sλ (t)u(t).

(44)

In what follows, we assume that
Sλ (t) = Bλ + Kλ (t),

(λ, t) ∈ I × R,

where
(A1) Kλ (t) is compact for all (λ, t) ∈ I × R, and the limits
Kλ (±∞) = lim Kλ (t)
t→±∞

exist uniformly in λ,
(A2) the operators JBλ and
JSλ (±∞) := J(Bλ + Kλ (±∞))
are hyperbolic, i.e., there are no purely imaginary points in their spectra.
The next two lemmas show that the spectral flow and the Maslov index in Theorem A are well
defined.
Lemma 5.1. The operators Aλ are selfadjoint Fredholm operators under the assumptions (A1)
and (A2).
Proof. Let us recall that two closed subspaces V, W ⊂ E are called commensurable if the difference of their orthogonal projections PV − PW is compact. Their relative dimension is defined
by
dim(V, W ) = dim(W ∩ V ⊥ ) − dim(W ⊥ ∩ V )
which is a finite number (see [3, §2]). By (A2), the operators JSλ (±∞) have no spectra on the
imaginary axis. Hence there are splittings
E = V − (JSλ (+∞)) ⊕ V + (JSλ (+∞)) = V − (JSλ (−∞)) ⊕ V + (JSλ (−∞)),

(45)

where V − (JSλ (±∞)) and V + (JSλ (±∞)) denote the invariant subspaces of JSλ (±∞) with respect to the negative and positive complex half-plane, respectively. Moreover, by (A1), the
operators JSλ (+∞) − JSλ (−∞) are compact, which implies that the same is true for the differences of their spectral projections onto V − (JSλ (+∞)) and V − (JSλ (−∞)) (see, e.g., [5, Lemma
3.2]). Hence these spaces are commensurable by [5, Lemma 3.3] and so their relative dimension
is defined.
30

It was proved in [5, Thm. B] that the operators Aλ are Fredholm under the assumptions (A1)(A2) and their Fredholm index is given by
ind(Aλ ) = dim(V − (JSλ (+∞)), V − (JSλ (−∞))).

(46)

We now claim that ind(Aλ ) = 0. Let us note at first that V − (−AT ) = V − (A)⊥ for any
hyperbolic operator A on E (see, e.g., [5, §1]). Hence, for A = JSλ (±∞), V − (JSλ (±∞))⊥ =
V − (Sλ (±∞)J). By (8), we see that the number (46) vanishes if
JV − (JSλ (±∞)) = V − (Sλ (±∞)J),

(47)

i.e. if V − (JSλ (±∞)) are Lagrangian subspaces of E. To show this equality, we only need to
note that
J −1 (µ − JSλ (±∞))−1 J = (µ − Sλ (±∞)J)−1
for any µ ∈
/ σ(JSλ (±∞)). Therefore, if P1 and P2 denote the spectral projections onto
V − (JSλ (±∞)) and V − (Sλ (±∞)J), respectively, we get that J −1 P1 J = P2 . Hence, as J −1 =
−J, P2 projects onto
J −1 im(P1 ) = J im(P1 ) = JV − (JSλ (±∞))
and (47) and so (46) is shown.
Finally, it is readily seen that Aλ is symmetric by integration by parts. Hence, it follows from
Lemma 2.2 that these operators are selfadjoint Fredholm operators.
Note that each Aλ has the same domain H 1 (R, E) which makes it easy to show A = {Aλ }λ∈I
is a continuous path in BF sa (H 1 (R, E), L2 (R, E)). Hence, by Theorem 2.4, we see that A is
continuous in CF sa (L2 (R, E)), and so the spectral flow sf(A) is defined.
Lemma 5.2. If (A1) and (A2) hold, then (Eλu (t0 ), Eλs (t0 )) ∈ F L2 (E, ω) for any λ ∈ I and
t0 ∈ R.
Proof. Abbondandolo and Majer showed in [5, Thm. D] that (Eλu (t0 ), Eλs (t0 )) is a Fredholm pair
if and only if Aλ is Fredholm. Hence, by Lemma 5.1, it remains to show that Eλu (t0 ), Eλs (t0 ) ∈
Λ(E, ω). We consider the differential equations u′ (t) − A(t)u(t) = 0, where A is a continuous
path of operators such that the limits limt→±∞ A(t) exist and are hyperbolic. It was shown in
[5, Thm. 2.1] that the stable and unstable spaces E s (A, t0 ) and E u (A, t0 ) of such an equation
satisfy
E s (−AT , t0 ) = E s (A, t0 )⊥ ,

E u (−AT , t0 ) = E u (A, t0 )⊥ .

We set A(t) := JSλ (t) and obtain
s/u

Eλ (t0 )⊥ = E s/u (JSλ , t0 )⊥ = E s/u (Sλ J, t0 ).
Clearly, u is a solution of u′ (t) − Sλ (t)Ju(t) = 0 if and only if v(t) := Ju(t) satisfies Jv ′ (t) +
Sλ (t)v(t) = 0. Hence
s/u

s/u

Eλ (t0 )⊥ = E s/u (Sλ J, t0 ) = JEλ (t0 ),
which shows that these spaces are Lagrangian by (8).
31

Finally, it follows from [5, Thm. 3.1] that (Eλu (t0 ), Eλs (t0 )) ∈ F L2 (E, ω) depends continuously
on Sλ : R → S(E) with respect to the L∞ -topology on C(R, S(E)). Hence {(Eλu (t0 ), Eλs (t0 ))}λ∈I
is a continuous family in F L2 (E, ω), and so the Maslov index is defined. The main theorem of
this paper, which we prove in the following section, now reads as follows:
Theorem A. Let S : I × R → S(E) be a continuous family of bounded selfadjoint operators
satisfying the assumptions (A1) and (A2). Then
sf(A) = µMas (E·u (0), E·s (0)).
Let us now consider the equations (1) under the additional periodicity assumption
(A3) S0 (t) = S1 (t) for all t ∈ R,
which implies that the path A of operators in (44) is periodic, i.e. A0 = A1 . The autonomous
systems
( ′
Ju (t) + Sλ (±∞)u(t) = 0, t ∈ R
(48)
lim u(t) = 0,
t→±∞

have the stable and unstable spaces
Eλs (±∞) = {x ∈ E : exp(tJSλ (±∞))x → 0 as t → ∞} = V − (JSλ (±∞))
Eλu (±∞) = {x ∈ E : exp(tJSλ (±∞))x → 0 as t → −∞} = V + (JSλ (±∞)),
where V + (JSλ (±∞)) and V − (JSλ (±∞)) are as in (45). The following corollary generalises the
main theorem of [36] from R2n to symplectic Hilbert spaces.
Corollary. If (A1)-(A3) hold, then
sf(A) = µMas (E·u (+∞), E·s (−∞)).
Proof. We take a similar approach as in [25, Prop. 3.3] and consider for t0 > 0 the concatenation
γ1 ∗ γ2 ∗ γ3 of the paths
γ1 = {(E0u (λ · t0 )), E0s (−λ · t0 )}λ∈I ,

γ2 = {(Eλu (t0 ), Eλs (−t0 ))}λ∈I ,

γ3 = {(E1u ((1 − λ)t0 ), E1s (−(1 − λ)t0 ))}λ∈I .
We need to verify that they are in F L2 (E, ω), and firstly note that we have seen in the proof of
Lemma 5.2 that all of these spaces are Lagrangian. Hence we only need to show that each pair
of unstable and stable spaces in γ1 , γ2 and γ3 is Fredholm.
Let us consider γ2 and leave γ1 and γ3 to the reader as the argument is similar and actually
simpler. We set Aλ (t) = Sλ (t − 2t0 ) for t ∈ R, as well as
E s (Aλ , t0 ) = {u(t0 ) ∈ E : Ju′ (t) + Aλ (t)u(t) = 0, u(t) → 0, t → +∞} ⊂ E,
and note that E s (Aλ , t0 ) = Eλs (−t0 ), where the latter space is the stable space in Theorem A. By
(A1), the operators Aλ (t) − Sλ (t) = Kλ (t − 2t0 ) − K(t) are compact, and so [5, Thm. 3.6] implies
that E s (Aλ , t0 ) and Eλs (t0 ) are commensurable. Moreover, (Eλu (t0 ), Eλs (t0 )) is a Fredholm pair
by Lemma 5.2. Now we just need to recall that if V, W, Z ⊂ E are subspaces such that V, W are
32

commensurable and (Z, V ) is a Fredholm pair, then (Z, W ) is a Fredholm pair as well (see [3,
Prop. 2.2.1]). Hence (Eλu (t0 ), Eλs (−t0 )) = (Eλu (t0 ), E s (Aλ , t0 )) ∈ F L2 (E, ω).
As {(Eλu (0), Eλs (0))}λ∈I is homotopic to γ1 ∗ γ2 ∗ γ3 , we obtain from the homotopy invariance
and the concatenation property of the Maslov index, as well as (65),
µMas (E·u (0), E·s (0)) = µMas (γ1 ) + µMas (γ2 ) + µMas (γ3 )
= µMas (γ2 ) = µMas (E·u (t0 ), E·s (−t0 )),
where we have used that S0 = S1 and so γ1 = −γ3 .
Finally, it was shown in [5, Thm. 2.1] that Eλu (±t) → Eλu (±∞) and Eλs (±t) → Eλs (±∞) in
G(E) for t → ∞. As the stable and unstable spaces depend continuously on the asymptotically
hyperbolic family Sλ by [5, Thm. 3.1], this shows that
µMas (E·u (0), E·s (0)) = µMas (E·u (+∞), E·s (−∞)).
Consequently, the corollary follows from Theorem A.
Let us point out that, in the special case where E is of finite dimension, this corollary also shows
that the main theorem of [36] follows from our previous work [53], which was not known before.

5.2

Proof of Theorem A

We split the proof into four steps. Our aim of the first three steps is to prove the following
weaker version of Theorem A.
Theorem 5.3. If the assumptions of Theorem A hold and the differential equations (1) only
have the trivial solution for λ = 0 and λ = 1, then
sf(A) = µMas (E·u (0), E·s (0)).
For proving Theorem 5.3, we begin by considering the Maslov index and apply in our first step an
idea of Hu and Portaluri from [25]. Then Theorem B will be used in the second step to join the
Maslov index with the spectral flow of a path of differential operators having varying domains.
The index bundle construction and Theorem C will show in the third step that this spectral flow
is actually sf(A), which shows Theorem 5.3. Finally, in the fourth step, we lift the additional
assumption in Theorem 5.3 and obtain Theorem A in its full generality.
Step 1: From µMas (E·u (0), E·s (0)) to Q
We have noted above that {(Eλu (0), Eλs (0))}λ∈I is a continuous path in F L2 (E, ω). Hence by
Theorem B we have for every fixed t0 > 0
µMas (E·u (0), E·s (0)) = sf(Q),
where Q = {Qλ }λ∈I is the path of operators
Qλ : D(Qλ ) ⊂ L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], E) → L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], E)
defined by Qλ u = Ju′ on the domains
D(Qλ ) = {u ∈ H 1 ([−t0 , t0 ], E) : u(−t0 ) ∈ Eλu (0), u(t0 ) ∈ Eλs (0)}.
33

(49)

Step 2: From Q to A0
We consider the differential operators
A0λ : D(A0λ ) ⊂ L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], E) → L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], E),

(A0λ u)(t) = Ju′ (t) + Sλ (t)u(t),

on the domains
D(A0λ ) = {u ∈ H 1 ([−t0 , t0 ], E) : u(−t0 ) ∈ Eλu (−t0 ), u(t0 ) ∈ Eλs (t0 )}.
Let Ψ : [−t0 , t0 ] → GL(E) be given by
(
JΨ′λ (t) + Sλ (t)Ψλ (t) = 0, t ∈ [−t0 , t0 ],
Ψλ (0) = IE

(50)

and define a family of isomorphisms M : I → GL(L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], E)) by
(Mλ u)(t) = Ψ−1
λ (t) u(t).
We note that by (50)
(ΨTλ (t)JΨλ (t))′ = (Ψ′λ (t))T JΨλ (t) + ΨTλ (t)JΨ′λ (t)
= (JSλ (t)Ψλ (t))T JΨλ (t) + ΨTλ (t)J 2 Sλ (t)Ψλ (t) = 0,
and see from the initial value in (50) that ΨTλ (t)JΨλ (t) = J for all t ∈ [−t0 , t0 ] and λ ∈ I. Hence
T
Ψ−1
λ (t) = −JΨλ (t)J,

T
(Ψ−1
λ (t)) = −JΨλ (t)J,

(λ, t) ∈ I × [−t0 , t0 ].

(51)

We now claim that
A0λ = MλT Qλ Mλ ,

λ ∈ I.

(52)

Indeed, we first see that
D(MλT Qλ Mλ ) = Mλ−1 D(Qλ )
= {u ∈ H 1 ([−t0 , t0 ], E) : u(−t0 ) ∈ Ψλ (−t0 )Eλu (0), u(t0 ) ∈ Ψλ (t0 )Eλs (0)}
= {u ∈ H 1 ([−t0 , t0 ], E) : u(−t0 ) ∈ Eλu (−t0 ), u(t0 ) ∈ Eλs (t0 )} = D(A0λ ),
s/u

s/u

where we have used that Ψλ (t)Eλ (0) = Eλ (t) for all t ∈ R. Furthermore, it follows from (51)
that for t ∈ [−t0 , t0 ]

−1

′
(MλT Qλ Mλ u)(t) = −JΨλ (t)J(J(Ψ−1
λ (t)) u(t) + JΨλ (t)u (t))

= Ju′ (t) − JΨλ (t)J(J(−J(Ψ′λ (t))T J)u(t))
= Ju′ (t) − JΨλ (t)J(−(JΨ′λ (t))T u(t))
= Ju′ (t) − JΨλ (t)J(Sλ (t)Ψλ (t))T u(t)
= Ju′ (t) − JΨλ (t)JΨλ (t)T Sλ (t)u(t)
= Ju′ (t) + J(Ψλ (t)T JΨλ (t))T Sλ (t)u(t)
= Ju′ (t) + JJ T Sλ (t)u(t)
= Ju′ (t) + Sλ (t)u(t) = (A0λ u)(t).
Hence (52) is shown, which implies by Corollary 2.3 that each A0λ is a selfadjoint Fredholm
operator. Moreover, A0 is a gap-continuous path in CF sa (L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], E)) by Lemma 4.2, and
so the spectral flow sf(A0 ) is defined.
The claimed equality sf(A0 ) = sf(Q) is also readily seen from (52). Indeed, we just need to
note that M is homotopic in GL(L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], E)) to the constant path IL2 ([−t0 ,t0 ],E) . Hence the
homotopy invariance of the spectral flow yields
sf(Q) = sf(M T QM ) = sf(A0 ),
where the continuity of the homotopy follows once again from Lemma 4.2. This equality was the
aim of this second step of our proof.
Step 3: From A0 to A
The aim of our third step is to show that
sf(A0 ) = sf(A),

(53)

which we will do by using (16), the index bundle for gap-continuous families and Theorem C.
Consequently, we need to work with the complexifications of A0 and A. In order to simplify
our notation, we denote in this step E C by H, but we do not introduce new symbols for the
complexifications of operators and their domains.
In what follows, we denote by p : L2 (R, H) → L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], H) the restriction to the interval
[−t0 , t0 ]. Let us recall that
D(A0λ ) = {u ∈ H 1 ([−t0 , t0 ], H) : u(−t0 ) ∈ Eλu (−t0 )C , u(t0 ) ∈ Eλs (t0 )C }
and D(Aλ ) = H 1 (R, H). We define for λ ∈ I a map
ιλ : D(A0λ ) → D(Aλ )
by extending u ∈ D(A0λ ) to the whole real line by its boundary values as follows. If u(−t0 ) ∈
Eλu (−t0 )C , we can extend u to the interval (−∞, −t0 ) as solution of the differential equation
Ju′ (t) + Sλ (t)u(t) = 0. Similarly, u can be extended to [t0 , +∞) as u(t0 ) ∈ Eλs (t0 )C . Note that
ιλ (u) is indeed in H 1 (R, H) = D(Aλ ) due to the exponential decay of solution curves starting
from Eλs (t0 )C in the positive direction, or from Eλu (−t0 )C in the negative direction (see [5, Thm.
2.1]). Moreover, ιλ is injective as obviously p ◦ ιλ = ID(A0λ ) , and the diagram

is commutative. Finally,
ιλ (ker(A0λ )) = ker(Aλ ),

λ ∈ I,

(55)

and so A0λ is invertible if and only if Aλ is invertible. In particular, as A has invertible endpoints
by assumption, the same is true for A0 . Hence s-ind(A) and s-ind(A0 ) are defined, and by
Theorem C we now need to show that these classes coincide in K −1 (I, ∂I) for proving (53).
We now consider as in Section 4.2 the corresponding families of operators
Â0 (λ,s) : D(Â0 (λ,s) ) ⊂ L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], H) → L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], H),
Â(λ,s) : D(Â(λ,s) ) ⊂ L2 (R, H) → L2 (R, H),

Â0 (λ,s) = A0λ + isIH

Â(λ,s) = Aλ + isIH

from the construction of the index bundle for selfadjoint operators, which are parametrised by
(λ, s) ∈ I×R. Let us recall that D(Â(λ,s) ) = D(Aλ ) and D(Â0 (λ,s) ) = D(A0λ ) for all (λ, s) ∈ I×R.
By Lemma 4.4, there are λ1 , . . . , λm ∈ I such that if we let V ⊂ L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], H) be the sum of
the ker(A0λi ) and W the sum of the ker(Aλi ) for i = 1, . . . , m, then
im(Â0 (λ,s) ) + V = L2 ([−t0 , t0 ], H),

im(Â(λ,s) ) + W = L2 (R, H),

(λ, s) ∈ I × R.

We set
W0 = {χ[−t0 ,t0 ] u : u ∈ W },

W1 = {χR\[−t0 ,t0 ] u : u ∈ W },

where χ[−t0 ,t0 ] and χR\[−t0 ,t0 ] are characteristic functions. Note that there is a canonical injective
linear map M : V → W0 ⊕ W1 onto W0 such that p ◦ M = IV . Moreover, since W ⊂ W0 ⊕ W1 ,
we see that the latter space is transversal to the image of Â as in (41) and so the bundle
E(Â, W0 ⊕ W1 ) is defined.
If now u ∈ E(Â0 , V )(λ,0) , then Â0 (λ,0) u ∈ V and so M (Â0 (λ,0) u) ∈ W0 ⊂ W0 ⊕ W1 . On the other
hand, Â(λ,0) (ιλ u) ∈ W0 which shows that ιλ (E(Â0 , V )(λ,0) ) ⊂ E(Â, W0 ⊕ W1 )(λ,0) . Moreover, as
(54) is commutative, p(Â(λ,0) (ιλ u)) = Â0 (λ,0) u and so Â(λ,0) (ιλ u) = M (Â0 (λ,0) u), where we use
that Â(λ,0) (ιλ u) ∈ W0 and M ◦ p |W0 = IW0 .
As Â(λ,s) and Â0 (λ,s) are invertible for s 6= 0, it is now readily seen that the maps ιλ , λ ∈ I,
extend to an injective bundle morphism ι : E(Â0 , V ) → E(Â, W0 ⊕ W1 ) such that we have a

As ι is injective, E0 := ι(E(Â0 , V )) is a subbundle of E(Â, W0 ⊕W1 ). Let E1 be a complementary
bundle, i.e. E0 ⊕ E1 = E(Â, W0 ⊕ W1 ). Since Â(E0 ) ⊂ W0 by the commutativity of (56),
Â : E0 ⊕ E1 → Θ(W0 ⊕ W1 )
is of the form

(57)

for bundle morphisms B : E1 → Θ(W1 ) and C : E1 → Θ(W0 ). Moreover, as ker(Â) = ker(Â |E0 )
by (55), the morphism B : E1 → Θ(W1 ) is injective. By (35),
dim(W0 ) = dim(V ) = dim(E(Â0 , V )) = dim(E0 ),

dim(W0 ⊕ W1 ) = dim(E0 ⊕ E1 ),

which implies that dim(E1 ) = dim(W1 ) and shows that B is an isomorphism.
We now deform C in (57) linearly to 0 and obtain from the homotopy invariance of K-theory in

= [E0 , Θ(W0 ), Â |E0 ].
Finally, we note that ι : E(Â0 , V ) → E0 and M : Θ(V ) → Θ(W0 ) are bundle isomorphisms.
Hence the commutativity of (56) implies that
[E0 , Θ(W0 ), Â |E0 ] = [E(Â0 , V ), Θ(V ), Â0 ] = s-ind(A0 ).
Now (53) follows from Theorem C. In summary, the first three steps of our proof have shown
Theorem 5.3.
Step 4: Non-admissible Paths
The aim of this step is to lift the assumption that A has invertible endpoints, i.e., we want to
obtain Theorem A from Theorem 5.3.
As the Fredholm property is stable under small perturbations by [24, Thm. XVII.4.2], there is
δ > 0 such that
h(λ, s) = Aλ + sδIL2 (R,E)
is Fredholm for all (λ, s) ∈ I × [−1, 1]. Moreover, since 0 is either in the resolvent set or an
isolated eigenvalue of finite multiplicity for selfadjoint Fredholm operators, we can assume that
h(0, s) and h(1, s) are invertible if s 6= 0. Finally, we assume that δ is sufficiently small for
Lemma 2.5 to hold.

Construction of the Maslov Index and a Simple Lemma
Construction of the Maslov Index

The aim of this section is to briefly recap the construction of the Maslov index from [22]. Let
us point out that an alternative construction of the Maslov index in this setting can be found in
[44].
Let E be a real separable Hilbert space with scalar product h·, ·i. Let ω : E × E → R be a
symplectic form on E such that ω(x, y) = hJx, yi for a bounded operator J : E → E such that
J 2 = −IE and J T = −J. We can regard E as complex Hilbert space through the almost complex
structure J, where the complex inner product is given by h·, ·iJ = h·, ·i − iω(·, ·). In what follows
we denote by U(EJ ) the unitary operators on E, and set
UF (EJ ) = {U ∈ U(EJ ) : U + IE Fredholm}.
The first important step in the construction is to show that there is a winding number w for
paths in UF (EJ ) which is defined as follows (see [22, §2.1]). If d : I → UF (EJ ) is a path, then
there is a partition 0 = λ0 < λ1 < · · · < λm−1 < λm = 1 of I and positive numbers 0 < εj < π,
j = 1, . . . , m, such that for λj−1 ≤ λ ≤ λj
ei(π±εj ) ∈
/ σ(d(λ))

(60)

and
X

dim ker(d(λ) − ei(π+θ) ) < ∞.

|θ|≤εj

39

(61)

Now the winding number of d is defined by

w(d) =

m
X

(k(λj , εj ) − k(λj−1 , εj )),

(62)

j=1

where
k(λ, εj ) =

X

dim ker(d(λ) − ei(π+θ) ),

λj−1 ≤ λ ≤ λj .

(63)

0≤θ≤εj

It is shown in [22, Prop. 2.3] that w(d) does only depend on the path d and neither on the
partition 0 = λ0 < λ1 < · · · < λm−1 < λm = 1 nor on the numbers εj in (60) and (61). Let
us point out that there are different limits for the sums in (61) and (63), and the latter is the
number of all eigenvalues of d(λ) between −1 and ei(π+εj ) . Hence, roughly speaking, w(d) is the
number of eigenvalues of d(0) crossing −1 whilst the parameter λ travels along the unit interval.
Let now W ∈ Λ(E, ω) be a fixed Lagrangian subspace. The Souriau map is defined by
SW (W̃ ) = −(IE − 2PW̃ )(IE − 2PW ),
where PW and PW̃ are the orthogonal projections onto W and W̃ , respectively. Of course, SW
is defined for any closed subspace W̃ of E, but it is shown in [22, §1.5] that SW maps Λ(E, ω)
into U(EJ ). Moreover, SW (F LW (E, ω)) ⊂ UF (EJ ) and, for any W̃ ∈ F LW (E, ω),
dimR (W̃ ∩ W ) = dimC ker(SW (W̃ ) + IE ).

(64)

In other words, the dimension of the intersection W̃ ∩W is the multiplicity of −1 as an eigenvalue
of SW (W̃ ) ∈ UF (EJ ).
Finally, the Maslov index of a path Λ : I → F LW (E, ω) is defined as the composition
µMas (Λ, W ) = w(SW (Λ(·))) ∈ Z.
Note that it follows from the definition of the winding number that the Maslov index has indeed
the heuristic interpretation that we mentioned in Section 2.1, i.e. it is the net number of nontrivial intersections of Λ(λ) with W whilst λ travels along the unit interval. Finally, let us note
that if −Λ : I → F LW (E, ω) denotes the reverse path −Λ(λ) = Λ(1 − λ), λ ∈ I, then
µMas (−Λ, W ) = −µMas (Λ, W ).

(65)

This is an immediate consequence of (62) and the injectivity of the Souriau map SW .

A.2

A Simple Lemma

For a path Λ : I → F LW (E, ω) and λ0 ∈ I, we denote by
(−,λ )

(+,λ )

µMas0 (Λ, W ) and µMas0 (Λ, W )
the Maslov index of the restriction of Λ to [λ0 , 1] and [0, λ0 ], respectively. Note that, by the
concatenation property, we have
40

(+,λ )

(−,λ )

µMas (Λ, W ) = µMas0 (Λ, W ) + µMas0 (Λ, W ),
and moreover, it is readily seen from (65) that
(+,λ )

(−,λ )

(−,λ )

(+,λ )

µMas0 (−Λ, W ) = −µMas0 (Λ, W ),
µMas0 (−Λ, W ) = −µMas0 (Λ, W ).

(66)

(±,λ )

It is an interesting question to determine the contributions of µMas0 (Λ, W ) to µMas (Λ, W ). We
will not deal with this question in its full generality, but note the following special case that we
need in the proof of Theorem A.
Lemma A.1. Let Λ : I → F LW (E, ω) be a path and let λ0 ∈ I be the only parameter value
where Λ and W intersect non-trivially.
• If
µMas (Λ, W ) = dim(Λ(λ0 ) ∩ W ),
then
(−,λ )

µMas0 (Λ, W ) = dim(Λ(λ0 ) ∩ W ),

(+,λ )

µMas0 (Λ, W ) = 0.

• If
µMas (Λ, W ) = − dim(Λ(λ0 ) ∩ W ),
then
(−,λ )

µMas0 (Λ, W ) = 0,

(+,λ )

µMas0 (Λ, W ) = − dim(Λ(λ0 ) ∩ W ).

Proof. We only need to prove the first assertion as this implies the second one by (65) and (66).
We set d(λ) = SW (Λ(λ)), λ ∈ I. By the concatenation property of the Maslov index, we can
assume without loss of generality that there is 0 < ε < π such that ei(π±ε) ∈
/ σ(d(λ)) and
dim ker(d(λ0 ) + IE ) =

X

dim ker(d(λ) − ei(π+θ) ) < ∞

(67)

|θ|≤ε

for all λ ∈ I. Therefore
dim(Λ(λ0 ) ∩ W ) = µMas (Λ, W ) = k(1, ε) − k(0, ε)
X
X
=
dim ker(d(1) − ei(π+θ) ) −
dim ker(d(0) − ei(π+θ) ).
0≤θ≤ε

(68)

0≤θ≤ε

As dim(Λ(λ0 ) ∩ W ) = dim ker(d(λ0 ) + IE ) by (64), we see from (67) that dim(Λ(λ0 ) ∩ W ) is an
upper bound for
X
X
dim ker(d(1) − ei(π+θ) ) and
dim ker(d(0) − ei(π+θ) ).
0≤θ≤ε

0≤θ≤ε

41

Hence (68) implies that
X

X

dim ker(d(1) − ei(π+θ) ) = dim(Λ(λ0 ) ∩ W ),

0≤θ≤ε

dim ker(d(0) − ei(π+θ) ) = 0.

0≤θ≤ε

As by (64) and (67),
X
dim ker(d(λ0 ) − ei(π+θ) ) = dim ker(d(λ0 ) + IE ) = dim(Λ(λ0 ) ∩ W ),
0≤θ≤ε

we obtain
µ(+,λ0 ) (Λ, W ) =

X

dim ker(d(1) − ei(π+θ) ) −

0≤θ≤ε

X

dim ker(d(λ0 ) − ei(π+θ) ) = 0

0≤θ≤ε

as well as
µ(−,λ0 ) (Λ, W ) =

X

dim ker(d(λ0 ) − ei(π+θ) ) −

0≤θ≤ε

X

dim ker(d(0) − ei(π+θ) )

0≤θ≤ε

= dim(Λ(λ0 ) ∩ W ).

Finally, let us note that a corresponding statement holds for the relative Maslov index as well,
which follows straight from its definition.

B

K-theory

In this appendix, we give a brief overview of topological K-theory for locally compact spaces,
where we follow [31] and [45].
Let X be a locally compact topological space, and {E0 , E1 , a} a triple consisting of two complex
vector bundles E0 and E1 over X and a bundle morphism a : E0 → E1 between them. The
support supp(ξ) of ξ = {E0 , E1 , a} is the subset of those points λ ∈ X for which aλ : E0,λ → E1,λ
is not an isomorphism. Note that supp(ξ) ⊂ X is closed. We call ξ trivial if supp(ξ) = ∅, i.e.,
if a is an isomorphism. Two triples {E00 , E10 , a0 } and {E01 , E11 , a1 } are said to be isomorphic if
there are bundle isomorphisms ϕ0 : E00 → E01 and ϕ1 : E10 → E11 such that
E01
O

a1

ϕ0

E00

/ E1

is a commutative diagram.
Now let us assume that Y ⊂ X is a closed subspace. We denote by L(X, Y ) the set of isomorphism
classes of triples ξ = {E0 , E1 , a} on X such that supp(ξ) is a compact subset of X \ Y . Note
that the direct sum of vector bundles makes L(X, Y ) a semi-group and

42

supp(ξ 0 ⊕ ξ 1 ) = supp(ξ 0 ) ∪ supp(ξ 1 ),

ξ 0 , ξ 1 ∈ L(X, Y ).

We say that ξ 0 = {E00 , E10 , a0 } and ξ 1 = {E01 , E11 , a1 } are homotopic, and write ξ 0 ≃ ξ 1 , if there
is an element of L(X × [0, 1], Y × [0, 1]) such that its restrictions to X × {0} and X × {1} are
isomorphic to ξ 0 and ξ 1 , respectively. Finally, we obtain an equivalence relation ∼ on L(X, Y )
by setting ξ 0 ∼ ξ 1 if there are η 0 , η 1 ∈ L(X, Y ) which are trivial and such that
ξ 0 ⊕ η0 ≃ ξ 1 ⊕ η1 .
Now the K-theory K(X, Y ) of the pair (X, Y ) is the set of equivalence classes of L(X, Y ). In
what follows, [E0 , E1 , a] denotes the class of {E0 , E1 , a} ∈ L(X, Y ) in K(X, Y ). It is readily seen
that
[E00 , E10 , a0 ] + [E01 , E11 , a1 ] := [E00 ⊕ E01 , E10 ⊕ E11 , a0 ⊕ a1 ] ∈ K(X, Y )
makes K(X, Y ) an abelian group, where the neutral element is given by the equivalence class of
any trivial element in L(X, Y ).
For proper maps f : (X, Y ) → (X ′ , Y ′ ) of topological pairs, we obtain a group homomorphisms
f ∗ : K(X ′ , Y ′ ) → K(X, Y ),

f ∗ [E0 , E1 , a] = [f ∗ E0 , f ∗ E1 , f ∗ a],

where f ∗ E0 , f ∗ E1 are the pullback bundles and (f ∗ a)λ = af (λ) , λ ∈ X. If g : (X, Y ) → (X ′ , Y ′ )
and f : (X ′ , Y ′ ) → (X̃, Ỹ ) are proper maps, then
(f ◦ g)∗ = g ∗ ◦ f ∗ : K(X̃, Ỹ ) → K(X, Y ).
Moreover, f ∗ = g ∗ : K(X ′ , Y ′ ) → K(X, Y ) if f ≃ g : (X, Y ) → (X ′ , Y ′ ) are homotopic by
a proper homotopy. Hence, K is a contravariant functor from the category of pairs of locally
compact spaces and closed subspaces to the category of abelian groups. A further homotopy
invariance property, which is often useful in computations, is as follows:
Lemma B.1. Let E0 and E1 be vector bundles over X and a : [0, 1] → hom(E0 , E1 ) a path of
bundle morphisms. If
supp{E0 , E1 , at } ⊂ K ⊂ X \ Y,

t ∈ [0, 1],

for some compact set K ⊂ X, then
[E0 , E1 , a0 ] = [E0 , E1 , a1 ] ∈ K(X, Y ).
The following lemma is usually called the logarithmic property of K.
Lemma B.2. For [E0 , E1 , a0 ], [E1 , E2 , a1 ] ∈ K(X, Y ),
[E0 , E1 , a0 ] + [E1 , E2 , a1 ] = [E0 , E2 , a1 ◦ a0 ] ∈ K(X, Y ).
The groups
K −1 (X, Y ) = K(X × R, Y × R)
are called the odd K-theory groups and, as above, any proper map f : (X, Y ) → (X ′ , Y ′ ) induces
a homomorphism

43

f ∗ : K −1 (X ′ , Y ′ ) → K −1 (X, Y ).
Finally, we want to recall the well known isomorphism c1 : K −1 (I, ∂I) → Z coming from the
first Chern number, where I ⊂ R is a compact interval. If
[E0 , E1 , a] ∈ K −1 (I, ∂I) = K(I × R, ∂I × R),
then there are global trivialisations ψ : E0 → (I × R) × Cn and ϕ : E1 → (I × R) × Cn , as any
bundle over the contractible space I × R is trivial. Now, the first Chern number can be computed
by
c1 ([E0 , E1 , a]) = w(det(ϕ ◦ a ◦ ψ −1 ) ◦ γ, 0) ∈ Z,

(69)

where γ : S 1 → I × R is any positively oriented simple curve surrounding the support of
{E0 , E1 , a}. Here, w(·, 0) denotes the winding number for closed curves in C \ {0} with respect
to 0.
