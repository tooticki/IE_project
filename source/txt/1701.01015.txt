Abstract. We describe the group of exact autoequivalences of
the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a bielliptic
surface. We achieve this by studying its action on the numerical
Grothendieck group of the surface.

1. Introduction
Let X be a smooth projective variety over the complex numbers.
We can construct the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves
on X denoted by D(X) = D b Coh(X). It is natural to study the
symmetries of D(X) which preserve the intrinsic structure: the group
Aut D(X) of exact C-linear autoequivalences of D(X) considered up
to isomorphism as functors. We think of these autoequivalences as
“higher” symmetries of the variety. Several autoequivalences of D(X)
arise naturally forming the subgroup
Autst D(X) = (Aut X ⋉ Pic X) × Z
of standard autoequivalences of Aut D(X). This subgroup is generated
by pulling back along automorphisms of X, tensoring by line bundles
and by powers of the shift functor.
It is natural to ask if there are any others? When the (anti-)canonical
bundle of X is ample, Bondal and Orlov [4] showed that Aut D(X) =
Autst D(X), i.e. there are no extra autoequivalences of D(X). The first
example of a non-standard autoequivalence was observed by Mukai [13]
for principally polarized abelian varieties. Many people have tried to
understand non-standard autoequivalences of the derived category but
the full group Aut D(X) is only understood in a small number of cases.
Orlov [14] computed the full group for Abelian varieties. Together with
Bondal and Orlov’s result, this classifies the group of autoequivalences
of the derived category of smooth projective curves. Broomhead and
Ploog [8] computed the group for many rational surfaces (including
most toric surfaces). Bayer and Bridgeland [3] described the group for
K3 surfaces of Picard rank 1. Uehara [18] conjectured a description of
the group for smooth projective elliptic surfaces of non-zero Kodaira

dimension and proved the conjecture when each reducible fibre is a
cycle of (−2)-curves. Furthermore, he describes the group for elliptic ruled surfaces [19]. Ishii and Uehara [11] computed the group for
smooth projective surfaces (not necessarily minimal) of general type
whose canonical model has at worst An singularities. No other examples are completely understood at this time. In this paper we describe
the group Aut D(S) when S is a bielliptic surface.
Let S be a bielliptic surface, Se the abelian surface which is the
canonical cover of S, and N(S) the numerical Grothendieck group of
S. Denote by O∆ (N(S)) the subgroup of isometries of N(S) which

the natural action of Aut D(S) on N(S) given by ρ(Φ)[E] = [Φ(E)].
Furthermore, the image of ρ is a subgroup of O∆ (N(S)) of index 4 if
S is of type 2 or 4 and index 2 otherwise (see Table 1).
Moreover, we describe the generators of Aut D(S) in some cases.
Theorem 1.2. Suppose S is a split bielliptic surface (see Definition
2.2). Then the group Aut D(S) is generated by standard autoequivalences and relative Fourier-Mukai transforms along the two elliptic
fibrations.
The article is structured as follows. In section 2 we review preliminary material on bielliptic surfaces, the numerical Grothendieck group,
canonical covers and relative Fourier-Mukai transforms. In section 3 we
prove Theorem 1.1 by describing a collection of autoequivalences arising from moduli spaces of stable, special sheaves whose Chern character
lies in ∆. In section 4 we prove Theorem 1.2.

2. Preliminaries
All varieties will be over the complex numbers.
2.1. Bielliptic surfaces.
Definition 2.1. A bielliptic (or hyperelliptic) surface S is a minimal
projective surface of Kodaira dimension zero with q = 1 and pg = 0.
Bielliptic surfaces are constructed by taking the quotient of the product of two elliptic curves A × B by a finite subgroup G of A acting on
A by translations and on B by automorphisms, not all translations.
These surfaces are classified by Bagnera and De Franchis into seven
families [1, §V.5] determined by the subgroup G and the lattice Γ such
that B = C /Γ (see Table 1).

Table 1. (ω = 1 and i = 1 are complex roots of unity.)
Definition 2.2. We call a bielliptic surface split if it is of type 1, 3, 5,
or 7 and non-split otherwise.
Remark 2.3. Associated to a bielliptic surface S are two elliptic fibrations:
pA : S → A/G
pB : S → B/G
with A/G an elliptic curve and B/G ∼
= P1 .
Since the projection A → A/G is étale, all the fibres of pA are
smooth. The fibre of pB over a point P ∈ B/G is a multiple of a smooth
elliptic curve. The multiplicity of the fibre of pB at P is the same as
the multiplicity of the projection B → B/G ∼
= P1 . As all smooth fibres
of pA (respectively pB ) are isomorphic to B (respectively A) we will
denote the class of the smooth fibre of pA and pB in H 2 (S, Q) by B
and A respectively.
The derived category of a bielliptic surface S is a strong invariant of
the surface due to the following result of Bridgeland and Maciocia.

Proposition 2.4 ([7, Proposition 6.2]). Let S be a bielliptic surface
and S ′ a smooth projective surface such that
D(S ′ ) ∼
= D(S).
Then S is isomorphic to S ′ .
2.2. Numerical Grothendieck Group. The Grothendieck group
K(X) of a smooth projective variety X is the free group generated by
isomorphism classes of objects in D(X) modulo an equivalence relation
given by distinguished triangles [9, §5]. There is a natural bilinear form
on this group, the Euler form, defined by
X
χ([E], [F ]) =
(−1)i dimC HomiD(X) (E, F )
i∈Z

where HomiD(X) (E, F ) = HomD(X) (E, F [i]). This bilinear form is well
defined as the Euler form is additive on distinguished triangles. We
can consider the radical of the Euler form
rad χ = {v ∈ K(X)|χ(v, w) = 0 and χ(w, v) = 0 for all w ∈ K(X)}
and form the quotient N(X) = K(X)/ rad χ, which we call the
numerical Grothendieck group of X. The Euler form descends to a
non-degenerate bilinear form on N(X). Recall that Num(S) is the
group of divisors on S modulo numerical equivalence ≡.
Proposition 2.5. Let S be a bielliptic surface. The Chern character
ch : K(S) → H 2∗ (S, Q)
identifies N(S) with the group
H 0 (S, Z) ⊕ Num(S) ⊕ H 4 (S, Z) ∼
= Z ⊕ Num(S) ⊕ Z .
Under this identification, for ch(E) = (r, D, s) and ch(F ) = (r ′ , D ′ , s′ )
the Euler form becomes χ(E, F ) = rs′ + r ′ s − D · D ′ .
Proof. For v = (v0 , v2 , v4 ) ∈ H 2∗ (S, Q) define v ∨ = (v0 , −v2 , v4 ) ∈
H 2∗ (S, Q). Recall that the Mukai pairing on H 2∗ (S, Q) is defined by
Z
′
hv, v i =
v∨ · v′
X

where the product in the integral is the cup product of cohomology
classes. As the Todd classes of abelian and bielliptic surfaces are
(1, 0, 0), by Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch for [E], [F ] ∈ K(S)
χ([E], [F ]) = hch(E), ch(F )i.
Thus the Euler form for ch(E) = (r, D, s) and ch(F ) = (r ′ , D ′, s′ ) can
be written as
χ([E], [F ]) = h(r, D, s), (r ′, D ′, s′ )i = rs′ + r ′ s − D · D ′ .
A class lies in the radical of the Euler form if and only if it lies in the
radical of the Mukai pairing. As the Mukai pairing is non-degenerate

an element of K(S) lies in the radical of the Euler form if and only if it
has zero Chern Character. Hence ker(ch) = rad χ and im(ch) ∼
= N(S).
Using this alternative description of the Euler form, we see that
the class of a numerically trivial divisor D, [OS (D)] is equivalent to
[OS ]. Therefore, the image of the Chern character intersected with the
group H 2 (S, Q) is the group Num(S). Furthermore, by HirzebruchRiemann-Roch we have ch2 (E) = χ(E) ∈ Z for all E. Thus we have
an isomorphism
N(S) ∼
= Z ⊕ Num(S) ⊕ Z .
= H 0 (X, Z) ⊕ Num(S) ⊕ H 4 (X, Z) ∼

Remark 2.6. Let A be an Abelian surface. Then a similar argument to
Proposition 2.5 shows that the Chern character induces an isomorphism
N(A) ∼
= Z ⊕ Num(A) ⊕ Z.
Remark 2.7. We will study the group Aut D(S) by studying its action
on the numerical Grothendieck group given by the homomorphism
ρ : Aut D(S) → Aut(N(S))
where ρ(Φ)([E]) = [Φ(E)]. Autoequivalences of D(S) preserves the
Homi groups, thus the Euler form. Hence the image of ρ is contained
in the group of isometries O(N(S)) of N(S).
2.3. Canonical covers of Bielliptic surfaces.
Proposition 2.8 ([6, §2], [9, §7.3],[2, §7.2]). Let X be a smooth projective variety whose canonical bundle ωX has finite order, i.e. there
⊗n ∼
exists n such that ωX
= OX . Then there exists a smooth projective

The canonical cover of a bielliptic surface will play an important role
in determining the group of autoequivalences. We list the following
facts about the canonical cover of a bielliptic surface and leave the
verification to the reader.
Proposition 2.9. Let S be a bielliptic surface which is realized as the
quotient of A × B be a finite group G of order nk. Then there exists
an abelian surface Se which is the canonical cover of S.

quotient Se ∼

of order k acting on A × B purely by translations. We have
G∼

Remark 2.10. The canonical cover Se has two fibrations
peA : Se → A/H
peB : Se → B/H.

Both peA and peB are smooth fibrations with fibres isomorphic to B
e and A

We summarize the description of Num(S) given by Serrano [15, §1]
in the following lemma.

Lemma 2.11. Let |G| = nk and n = deg π where π : Se → S is the
canonical cover of S.
(1) The second rational cohomology group H 2 (S, Q) is generated by
A and B.
(2) Suppose S is split. Then k = 1 and the group Num(S) is generated by n1 A and B.
(3) Suppose S is non-split. Then the group Num(S) is generated by

A and k1 B.

Consider the category Sp-Coh(S) of coherent π∗ (OS )-modules on S.
A sheaf E lies in Sp-Coh(S) if and only if E ⊗ ωS ∼
= E. We call such
sheaves special. The following results from [6, §2],[2, §7.2] relate this
e
category to the category of coherent sheaves on S.
Lemma 2.12. The functor

is an equivalence.

e → Sp-Coh(S)
π∗ : Coh(S)

This descends to the level of derived categories in the following way:
Proposition 2.13. Let E be an object of D(S). Then there is an object

e such that Rπ∗ (E)

After taking Chern characters, π! coincides with the pushforward π∗ on
cohomology by Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch. This is due to the Todd
classes of Se and S being (1, 0, 0).

2.4. Relative Fourier-Mukai Transforms. Recall that a relatively
minimal elliptic surface is a projective surface X together with a fibration π : X → C with generic fibre isomorphic to an elliptic curve
and with no (−1)-curves in the fibres. We will only consider relatively
minimal elliptic surfaces.
For an elliptic surface π : X → C define λπ to be the smallest positive integer such that π has a holomorphic λπ -multisection. This is
equivalent to
λπ = min{f · D > 0|D ∈ Num(X)}.
where f is the class of a smooth fibre of π.
Suppose a > 0, b ∈ Z with gcd(aλπ , b) = 1. Then we can construct
the moduli space JX (a, b) of pure dimension 1 stable sheaves of class
(a, b) supported on a smooth fibre of π. Bridgeland constructed equivalences between the derived category of X and the derived category of
JX (a, b) [5]. We call these equivalences relative Fourier-Mukai transforms.

3. Proof of Theorem 1.1
To prove Theorem 1.1 we will compute the kernel and image of
ρ : Aut D(S) → O(N(S))
given by ρ(Φ)([E]) = [Φ(E)].
We will need the following result concerning moduli spaces of sheaves
on a bielliptic surface S which will give rise to autoequivalences of the
derived category.
Proposition 3.1. Let S be a bielliptic surface and π : Se → S the
canonical cover of S. Take v ∈ ∆ such that v is isotropic (χ(v, v) = 0)
and there exists v ′ ∈ N(S) such that χ(v, v ′ ) = 1. Choose a generic
ample line bundle H with respect to v. Then there exists a two dimensional, projective, smooth, fine moduli space M of H-slope stable,
special sheaves on S of class v.
Moreover, the universal sheaf on M × S induces an autoequivalence
Φ of D(S) such that [Φ(Os )] = v for any closed point s ∈ S.
Proof. Choose a generic ample divisor H which does not lie on a wall
with respect to v.
e
First we show that M is non-empty. As v ∈ ∆, there exists w ∈ N(S)
∗
such that π! (w) = v. The moduli space of π H-Gieseker semistable
sheaves of class w on the abelian surface Se is non-empty by [10, §4.3].
Let F be a π ∗ H-Gieseker semistable sheaf of class w. As π ∗ H-Gieseker
semistable sheaves are π ∗ H-slope semistable, F is π ∗ H-slope semistable.
By [17, Proposition 1.5] the pushforward π∗ F is a H-slope semistable
sheaf as π is finite étale. By construction, [π∗ F ] = π! (w) = v. Therefore, the moduli space MHss of H-slope semistable sheaves of class v is
non-empty.
As H was chosen not to lie on a wall and there exists v ′ such that
χ(v, v ′) = 1, all H-slope semistable sheaves are H-slope stable. Therefore the moduli space MH of H-slope stable sheaves is projective. By
[10, Proposition 4.6] there exists a quasi-universal family on MH × S.
This family can be chosen to be universal due to the existence of v ′ .
Let E be a H-stable sheaf of class v corresponding to a point of MH .
As v = [E] is isotropic and E is stable, dimC HomS (E, E) = 1 and
dimC Ext1S (E, E) = 1 + dimC Ext2S (E, E).

As E is slope stable and ωS is a numerically trivial, E ⊗ ωS is slope
stable of the same slope. Thus dimC HomS (E, E ⊗ ωS ) = 0 or 1 Then
by Serre Duality and the equality above, dimC Ext1S (E, E) ≤ 2.
By construction, MH contains at least one closed point corresponding
to a sheaf F which is the pushforward of a semistable sheaf on the
canonical cover. Thus F is special by Proposition 2.13, so F ⊗ ωS ∼
=F
and dimC Ext2 (E, E) = 1. Hence dimC Ext1S (F, F ) = 2. By Serre
Duality and [10, §4.5] MH is smooth at F because the trace map on
Ext2S (F, F ) has zero kernel due to F being special.
As M is smooth at F , dim MH′ = dimC Ext1S (F, F ) = 2 for some
connected component MH′ of MH . Hence dimC Ext1S (E, E) ≥ 2 for all
sheaves E corresponding to points of MH′ . So dimC Ext1S (E, E) = 2
for all such E. Thus MH′ is smooth of dimension 2. Set M = MH′ .
As E is stable and has the same slope as E ⊗ ωS , any map between
them is an isomorphism. So E is special as dimC Hom(E, E ⊗ ωS ) =
dimC Ext2S (E, E) = 1.
Thus M is a two dimensional, projective, smooth, fine moduli space
of H-slope stable, special sheaves on S of class v.
By [7, Corollary 2.8] the universal sheaf P on M × S induces an
equivalence
ΦP : D(M) → D(S).
By Proposition 2.4, M is isomorphic to S. Thus the equivalence ΦP
induces an autoequivalence Φ of D(S) after choosing an isomorphism

M∼
= S. By construction [Φ(Os )] = [Ps ] = v.
We now prove Theorem 1.1.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. First we describe the kernel of ρ. Let Ψ ∈ ker ρ.
As Ψ is an integral transform, by a theorem of Orlov [9, Theorem
5.14], Ψ ∼
= ΨP for some P ∈ D(S × S). As S is a bielliptic surface, P is
isomorphic to a shift of a sheaf [16, Proposition 5.1]. Thus Ψ(Os ) = Pŝ
is a shift of a sheaf for any closed point s ∈ S. As Ψ acts trivially on
N(S), ch(Pŝ ) = ch(Os ) = (0, 0, 1). Hence Pŝ is a shift of a skyscraper
sheaf for any closed point s ∈ S. As Ψ is a standard autoequivalence
if and only if Ψ(Os ) is a shift of a skyscraper sheaf, Ψ is a standard
autoequivalence.
The only standard autoequivalences that act trivially on N(S) are
(Aut S ⋉Pic0 S)×Z[2]. This is because the n-th power of the shift functor acts by (−1)n on N(S). Tensoring by a line bundle L act trivially
on N(S) if and only c1 (L) = 0, i.e. L has degree zero. Automorphisms
of S act trivially on N(S) because they preserve effective divisors and
cannot exchange the fibres of the different elliptic fibrations as one has
multiple fibres and the other does not.
We now characterize the image of ρ. Let ϕ ∈ O∆ (N(S)) and consider
v = ϕ(0, 0, 1) ∈ ∆. Then v ∈ ∆, v 2 = 0 and there exists v ′ = ϕ(1, 0, 0)

10

such that hv, v ′i = 1. By Proposition 3.1 we can construct an autoequivalence Φ ∈ Aut D(S) such that ρ(Φ)(0, 0, 1) = v. Consider the
isometry
ϕ′ = (ρ(Φ))−1 ◦ ϕ .
Then ϕ′ (0, 0, 1) = (0, 0, 1). As ϕ′ (1, 0, 0) = (1, D, s) is isotropic, D 2 =
2s. Thus s = D 2 /2 and ϕ′ (1, 0, 0) = (1, D, D 2/2) is the class of a line
bundle L with c1 (L) = D. Consider the isometry
ϕ′′ = ρ(L∗ ⊗ (−)) ◦ ϕ′ .
Notice that ϕ′′ acts by
idH 0 ⊕ ψ ⊕ idH 4
on N(S) where ψ is an isometry of Num(S). Note that ϕ′′ respects the
grading and is an element of O∆ (N(S)) as it is a composite of elements
of O∆ (N(S)).
The group Num(S) is isomorphic as a lattice to a single hyperbolic
plane U with underlying group Z2 [15, §1]. The group of isometries
O(U) is isomorphic to Z /2 × Z /2. It is generated by the involutions ι,
which acts by −id on U, and σ which exchanges the two copies of Z.
Both of these give rise to isometries of N(S) by acting by the identity
on H 0 (S, Z) and H 4 (S, Z) which we will denote by ι and σ by an abuse
of notation.
Suppose the isometry ι is induced by an autoequivalence. As ι fixes
the class of a point and acts non-trivially on N(S), ι is induced by a
standard autoequivalence which acts non-trivially on N(S). But standard autoequivalences which act non-trivially on N(S) act by tensoring
by ±(1, D, D 2/2) for some line bundle L with c1 (L) = D 6= 0. However, ι does not acts on N(S) in this way as ι(1, 0, 0) = (1, 0, 0). Hence
ι is not induced by an autoequivalence. Similarly, σ and ι ◦ σ are not
induced by autoequivalences. Thus the image of ρ intersected with
O(Num(S)) is trivial.
Note that ι preserves ∆. However, σ may not preserve ∆. The index
of the image of ρ will 2 or 4 in O∆ (N(S)) depending on whether σ
preserves ∆. As σ acts trivially on the two copies of Z in N(S) it is
sufficient to study the action on Num(S) by the following Lemma.
Lemma 3.2. A class (r, D, s) ∈ ∆ if and only if n | r and (0, D, 0) ∈
e ⊕ Z ⊂ Z ⊕ Num(S) ⊕ Z ∼
∆. Thus ∆ = n Z ⊕π∗ (Num(S))
= N(S).
Proof. Suppose n | r and (0, D, 0) ∈ ∆. Then r = r̃n and there exists
e ∈ Num(S)
e such that π! (0, D,
e 0) = (0, π∗ (D),
e 0) = (0, D, 0). Then

Suppose that (r, D, s) ∈ ∆. Then there exists [E] ∈ N(S)
e = (r, D, s). By computing the Mukai pairing of (r, D, s)
that π! ([E])
with the classes (1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 1) we see that ch2 ([E]) = s and
r = n rk(E). So (r, 0, 0), (0, 0, s) ∈ ∆ as π! (rk(E)[OSe]) = (r, 0, 0) and
π! (s[Os̃ ]) = (0, 0, s). Then
(r, D, s) − (0, 0, s) − (r, 0, 0) = (0, D, 0) ∈ ∆.

If (r, D, s) ∈ ∆ then σ(r, D, s) = (r, σ(D), s) ∈ ∆ if and only if
(0, σ(D), 0) ∈ ∆. To determine whether σ preserves ∆ we reduce
to studying classes of the form (0, D, 0). By abuse of notation, we

4. Relative Fourier-Mukai Transforms and bielliptic
surfaces
For a bielliptic surface S, relative Fourier-Mukai transforms with
respect to either elliptic fibration pA or pB give rise to autoequivalences
of D(S) in the following way.
Proposition 4.1. Let S be a bielliptic surface and pA : S → A/G and
pB : S → B/G its two relatively minimal elliptic fibrations. Then a
relative Fourier-Mukai transform with respect to either fibration induces
an autoequivalence on D(S) which is non-standard.
Proof. Let ΦRel : D(Y ) → D(S) be a relative Fourier-Mukai transform
induced by one of the two fibrations. By Proposition 2.4, Y is isomorphic to S. After choosing an isomorphism g : Y → S, the composite

Ψ = ΦRel ◦g ∗ is an autoequivalence of D(S). It is non-standard because
ch(Ψ(Os )) = (0, af, b) where f is the fibre of the elliptic fibration. 
Example 4.2. Note that for either fibration pA or pB of S we have an
autoequivalence corresponding to the matrix


1 1
P =
0 1
given by Theorem 2.17. We have an autoequivalence ΨB , constructed
by composing the relative Fourier-Mukai transform along pA associated
to P and tensoring by a suitable line bundle, which acts on N(S) by
(1, 0, 0) 7→ (1, 0, 0)
(0, 0, 1) 7→ (0, B, 1)
(0, B ′ , 0) 7→ (0, B ′ , 0)
(0, A′ , 0) 7→ (λpA , A′ , 0).
Note ΨB sends (0, A, 0) to (n, A, 0).
Suppose that S is split. Then the fibration pA : S → A/G admits a
section, i.e. λpA = 1. Then there is a relative Fourier-Mukai functor Ψ̂
that corresponds to the matrix


0 1
−1 0
given by Theorem 2.17 which acts on N(S) by
(1, 0, 0) 7→ (0, (−1/n)A, 0)
(0, 0, 1) 7→ (0, B, 0)
(0, B, 0) 7→ (0, 0, 1)
(0, (1/n)A, 0) 7→ (1, 0, 0).
We now prove Theorem 1.2.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. As S is split, k = 1 and |G| = n = deg π and
Se ∼
= A × B. Let Φ ∈ Aut D(S). Consider v = ρ(Φ)(0, 0, 1). Then
v ∈ ∆, v 2 = 0 and there exists v ′ = ρ(Φ)(1, 0, 0) such that hv, v ′i = 1.
We will construct an autoequivalence Ψ ∈ Aut D(S) which is the
composite of standard autoequivalences and relative Fourier-Mukai transforms along pA and pB such that ρ(Ψ)(0, 0, 1) = v.
We separate the argument into three cases:
(1) Suppose that v = ±(0, 0, 1). Then Ψ = id or [1].
(2) Suppose that v = (0, D, s). As hv, vi = 0, D = aA or bB for
a, b ∈ Z, a, b 6= 0. Suppose that D = aA. As there exists

14

RORY POTTER

v ′ = ϕ(1, 0, 0) = (r ′ , (a′ /n)A + b′ B, s′ ) such that hv, v ′i = 1, we
have
a(B · A)b′ − sr ′ = 1.
As λpB = B · A, gcd(aλpB , s) = 1. Therefore there exists a
relative Fourier-Mukai transform, Φ̂, along pB such that ρ(Φ̂)
sends (0, 0, 1) to v = (0, aA, s). Then set Ψ = Φ̂. A similar
argument for D = bB will work to construct a relative FourierMukai transform along pA which sends (0, 0, 1) to (0, bB, s).
(3) Suppose that v = (r, aA + bB, s) with r 6= 0. We can assume
that r > 0 after applying ρ([1]). Then r = nc with c ∈ N, as
v ∈ ∆. As v 2 = 0 we have
v = (nc, aA + bB, ab/c) .
Note one of a, b is non zero as otherwise v would be divisible.
Suppose a = 0, so v = (nc, bB, 0). Then we can apply the
relative Fourier-Mukai transform Ψ̂ which sends
(nc, bB, 0) 7→ (0, −cA, b)
and reduce to case (2).
Suppose that a 6= 0. After tensoring by A we can assume
a > 0. Let gcd(c, a) = d for some d ∈ N. We can write c = dc′
and a = da′ with gcd(a′ , c′ ) = 1. Thus v has the form
v = (ndc′ , da′A + bB, a′ b/c′ ).
We have two operations given by ρ(− ⊗ (−1/n)A) and ρ(Ψ−1
B )
′
′
which act on ndc and da in the following way:
ρ(− ⊗ (−1/n)A) :(ndc′ , da′ ) 7→ (ndc′ , d(a′ − c′ ))
′
′
′
′
′
ρ(Ψ−1
B ) :(ndc , da ) 7→ (nd(c − a ), da ).

This is just the Euclidean algorithm on c′ and a′ . Thus we can
reduce a′ to 1 and c′ to 0 and proceed as in (2).
Consider the autoequivalence Ψ−1 ◦ Φ whose image under ρ sends
(0, 0, 1) to (0, 0, 1). So Ψ−1 ◦ Φ is a standard autoequivalence. Thus we
can express Φ as a composite of standard autoequivalences and relative
Fourier-Mukai transforms.
