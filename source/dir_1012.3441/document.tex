\section{Concluding  remarks and prospects} This result does not complete the theoretical investigations about dual quantization (beyond the existence of optimal dual quantizers in the case $p=1$, left open in~\cite{dualStat}): the first one is to elucidate the asymptotic behaviour of the constant $Q^{dq}_{\norm{.},p,d}$ coming out in Theorem~\ref{thm:DQRate} as $d$ goes to infinity,  most likely by showing that  $\lim_{d\to +\infty} \frac{Q^{dq}_{\norm{.},p,d}}{Q^{vq}_{\norm{.},p,d}}=1$. From a practical point of view, is it possible to evaluate the mean dual quantization error induced by an optimal Voronoi quantization grid? An answer to that question would be very valuable for applications since many optimal quantization grids have been computed for various distributions (see $e.g.$~\cite{Website} for Gaussian distributions).
% \textcolor{red}{Are you Ok to delete the last sentence of this paragraph: ``
% Can we preserve the above results (as well as existence of dually optimal grids) for unbounded r.v. when switching to another extension of the random splitting operator {\em outside} the convex hull of the grid like the projection on the convex hull instead of the nearest neighbour one?"}

Many natural questions  solved  in the optimal Voronoi quantization theory remain open. Among others  ``Is there  a counterpart to the empirical measure theorem for (asymptotically) optimal quantizers?" (see~Theorem~7.5, p.96~in~\cite{Foundations})? ``How does dual  quantization  behave with respect to empirical distribution of i.i.d. $n$-samples of a given distribution?".  Is it possible to develop an infinite dimensional ``functional" dual quantization?
