\section{Numerical results for $\bar d_{n,2}(X)^2$}\label{app:num}
In order to support the heuristic argumentation on the intrinsic and rate optimal growth limitation of the truncation error $\Probb\big(X\notin C_{n}\big)$ induced by the extended dual quantization error modulus,
we consider the two dimensional random variable 
\[
	X = (W_T, \sup_{0\leq t \leq T}W_t),
\]
where $(W_t)_{0\leq t \leq T}$ is a Brownian Motion.

This example is motivated by the pricing of exotic options, where this joint distribution plays an important role.

Using a variant of the CVLQ algorithm (see \cite{dualStat}) adapted for the dual quantization modulus inside $C_n$ and the nearest neighbor mapping outside, we have computed a sequence of optimal grids together with the squared dual quantization error $\bar d_{n,2}(X)^2$ and the truncation error $\Probb\big(X\notin C_{n}\big)$.

These results are reported in Table~\ref{tab:num}. 

\begin{table}[h!]

\label{tab:num}
\caption{Numerical results for the dual quantization $X$}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
$n$ & $\bar d_{n,2}(X)^2$ & $\Probb\big(X\notin C_{n}\big)$ \\
\hline
50 & 0.04076 & 0.01784\\
100 & 0.01966 & 0.00795 \\
150 & 0.01236 & 0.00412 \\
200 & 0.00931 & 0.00141 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Furthermore we see in figure \ref{fig:num} a log-log plot for the convergence of the two rates $\bar d_{n,2}(X)^2$ and $\Probb\big(X\notin C_{n}\big)$.

\end{figure}

The distortion rate $\bar d_{n,2}(X)^2$ shows here an absolute stable convergence rate (least-squares fit of exponent yields $-1.07192$) which is consistent with the theoretical optimal rate of $n^{-\frac{2}{d}}$.
Moreover, the truncation error $\Probb\big(X\notin C_{n}\big)$ outperforms also in this case the heuristically derived rate of $n^{-1}$ and also outperforms the squared "inside" quantization error, which means that also for such an un-symmetric and non-spherical distribution of the Brownian motion and its supremum, an second order rate can be achieved.

This confirms again the motivation of the extended dual quantization error as the correction penalization constraint on growth of the convex hull in order to preserve second order stationarity.
