I would like to thank my advisor, George Andrews, for his infinite
patience and extraordinary generosity.  Without his support and
encouragement I would not have written this dissertation
or even come to graduate school (twice).

I am grateful to Jim Humphreys for writing the PSU Thesis Style
and for magically transforming my scribble into type with incredible
speed.

I would like to thank Leonid Vasserstein for showing me some
interesting mathematics and some excellent blackberry patches.

This thesis is dedicated to the divisibility of 28 by 7, without which I
might not have met Jenae, my wife.
