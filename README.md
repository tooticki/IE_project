Information extraction from scientific papers

## Usage:
* To upload source code and pdf from arXiv, save an arXiv-search page in source/url and run
   ```
   $ ./get_source.sh
   ```
* To generate xml-files from uploaded source code and pdfs, run
   ```
   $ ./extract_source_to_xml_lines.sh 
   ```
* To generate training data, run
   ```
   $ python generate_training_data.py 
   ```
* Code for learning is in a jupyter notebook: 
   ```
   $ jupyter notebook results_extracting_notebook.ipynb 
   ```
   (File results_extracting_notebook.py contains the same code)

## The Guide:
ArXiv html pages with reference numbers of "interesting" papers are stored in **source/url**.

Uploaded source code together with pdf files is located in **source**.

Xml-files (and pdf-files containing extracted results) are in **source_extraction/results_pdf_xml**.

Training data in csv format is placed in **training_data**.

Plots generated by the notebook should be stored in (what a surprise) **plots**.

You can also find once collected fonts statistics in **fonts.txt**.
